<p><span id="s11">01:01:07</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Let's start with where you were born and your names at birth and now.</span> <span id="s13">Let's start with you Irene.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">I: I was born in Teplice Sanov in Czechoslovakia in the year 1937, and I was named Renate Guttmann, and I'm now Irene Hizme.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Now what was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">I: 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: No, the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">I: Sorry, December 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">R: I was born at the same time, half hour later.</span> <span id="s20">My name then was René Guttmann and today is René Slotkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">01:01:57</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Now you were very young during these early years of the Nazi oppression and persecution, but I really would like to see what it is that you remember as far back as you can go.</span> <span id="s23">Do you remember those first few years where?</span> <span id="s24">You were born in Teplice Sanov, but you didn't live there for very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">I: No.</span> <span id="s26">We moved to Prague and were there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">R: My earliest memories of being alive go to that apartment building in Prague.</span> <span id="s28">It was maybe a like five or six story building brick with a yard and a fence.</span> <span id="s29">I remember a staircase leading up to our apartment so we had to be somewhere up.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">I: Yeah, I think we were on the upper floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">R: Upper floors, and I do remember falling once and I have an injury here, which I haven't thought about in a long time, but I must have stitches underneath my chin.</span> <span id="s32">I still remember the burning sensation of what I guess was iodine, was the first aid that I got for that.</span> <span id="s33">But I do remember that apartment building.</span> <span id="s34">Those are my earliest, very earliest memories, my first memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">I: I remember the inside a little bit.</span> <span id="s36">I remember that our crib was kind of on a diagonal, it seemed to me, it was like one room.</span> <span id="s37">The kitchen was like down there, but we were like in the front where we could look out the window.</span> <span id="s38">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">I: And there was a bed for our parents also in that room.</span> <span id="s41">We were all in this one room kind of apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">R: I do remember a terrace.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">I: And a terrace, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">R: The terrace I remember because one stormy day there were like leaves, the wind, the leaves going by and I remember things falling down from that.</span> <span id="s45">As a matter of fact, your doll once went over.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">I: Right.</span> <span id="s47">I had a doll and René threw her down off the terrace and smashed my doll.</span> <span id="s48">I remember that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">R: Those are our first, I think, those are my first memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">I: Yes, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You slept in the same crib?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:04:22</span></p> <p><span id="s53">R: I don't remember doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">I: Either in the same crib or right next or our cribs were like touching.</span> <span id="s55">My recollection really is, and I know I've told you this once before, that our mother, when she would put us to sleep she played a game with us, there was a game.</span> <span id="s56">She would set our hands and we always wanted our bodies to be set a certain way to see if we could stay that way all night long and wake up in that same position.</span> <span id="s57">So I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">R: This is incredible.</span> <span id="s59">I'm learning this.</span> <span id="s60">I never heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">I: I remember that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did she make up this game or did you make it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">I: I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">R: I would think it had to be her, but that's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What other recollections?</span> <span id="s66">Do you remember playing outside?</span> <span id="s67">Do you remember the people around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">I: I don't remember the people around us so much, but I know that once René — there was a yard in front with grass and René was out there playing.</span> <span id="s69">I think he stepped on a bumblebee and he got bitten and I think that was —</span></p> <p><span id="s70">R: That was a big impression made on me.</span> <span id="s71">As a matter fact, I had itches underneath on that foot even when I came to the States, which was in 1950.</span> <span id="s72">I always get an itch on the one, but I could never understand.</span> <span id="s73">But I do remember that incident.</span> <span id="s74">I put it together.</span> <span id="s75">I don't know whether it's a real physiological phenomena or just my mind playing tricks on me.</span> <span id="s76">But, yeah.</span> <span id="s77">I remember the grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">I: You know, I also remember, do you remember that we had like conductor outfits and punching tickets to go on the train and we used to play train, train conductors?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">R: Well, that brings to mind, I think there was a tram or something that ran near us.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">I: In front of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">R: Number 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">I: Twenty-two, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">R: I wouldn't know it was 22 until now, but it looked like two twos, so now we know it's a 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">I: That was one of our favorite games.</span> <span id="s85">I think we also — I remember we had some kind of car that we could sit in and drive.</span> <span id="s86">I don't — we used to race, but you used to beat me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">R: See, she's older, obviously —she remembers these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">I: I remember one particular time we used to go — our parents took us to the park.</span> <span id="s89">There was a park nearby.</span> <span id="s90">And we used to go quite a bit, but the one time that I remember especially was right after a major storm and a lot of trees had fallen and we were walking on the logs, trying to balance, and I think—</span></p> <p><span id="s91">R: That must be the same storm that I'm talking about except I saw it from upstairs.</span> <span id="s92">We must have gone down.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">I: I think we went down.</span> <span id="s94">I remember that, there's something about the air.</span> <span id="s95">You know you how sometimes that smell — it brings it back, even today, sometimes I'm out and I get a certain smell and it says — that's the park.</span> <span id="s96">Also, I remember that we had — I'm not sure whether it was trucks or what, but some kind of toys that we could pull, like little wooden something.</span> <span id="s97">And we also had wooden little blocks, tiny little blocks, and you were very good at making.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">R: I was?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">I: Yeah, mine always fell, but yours were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">R: I don't remember this.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">01:08:58</span></p> <p><span id="s102">I: I do.</span> <span id="s103">I also remember some of our clothing.</span> <span id="s104">In the winter we had these nubby jackets like maybe made from lambs' wool or something.</span> <span id="s105">They're like curly.</span> <span id="s106">I don't know what it was, and, then on top of that, we had these harnesses with bells so you could hear us jingle and I guess that was a good way to keep track of us.</span> <span id="s107">Our Mom must have held on to us that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">R: Yes, that I remember, the bells.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Do you remember your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">R: I don't, I really don't.</span> <span id="s111">I've tried and even I've had visual aids since, I've gotten some pictures of them, but it still doesn't seem to help.</span> <span id="s112">I've tried to really.</span> <span id="s113">There's just one moment that I remember that happened much later with my mom that I remember, but not at that point in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">I: I think I'm pretty — I could not, if I didn't have photographs, I don't think I could recall what they looked like.</span> <span id="s115">The only thing I remember is my mom's presence at certain times.</span> <span id="s116">I recall them vividly.</span> <span id="s117">And also, my dad in — one of the things that I vividly do remember is when he was taken away, and I think it was at night and some men came in uniform and they just took him away and, you know, we never saw him again after that, not to my recollection.</span> <span id="s118">Although, René, you've said you remember us visiting him in prison, but I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">R: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">I: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">R: We didn't see him then.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">I: I don't remember seeing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">R: I remember going to what I — assuming was some kind of — it was a huge building.</span> <span id="s124">To me, any building was — it was very powerful looking, as opposed to the other buildings and we would bring — my mother and I would bring, we — we would bring packages there.</span> <span id="s125">So, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">I: So maybe —but I don't...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">R: So maybe it was, now that I'm a few years older, it could have been a post office too, but that's not the feeling I had.</span> <span id="s128">The feeling was that he was there, or this is where we made connection with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">I: But you're right, it could have been a post office and perhaps she was sending things to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">R: Or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">I: Or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">R: Wherever he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">I: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you remember seeing soldiers in the street?</span> <span id="s135">Did you remember something that changed in Prague prior to your dad being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">01:11:53</span></p> <p><span id="s137">I: I don't think I remember anything changing, but I think there was a feeling.</span> <span id="s138">I remember having to wait, standing on lines.</span> <span id="s139">I don't know whether this is a later occurrence or from that time, but I just remember having to stand on lines.</span> <span id="s140">It could be, I don't know from where.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: For food?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">I: Maybe, maybe, I'm not — yes, maybe that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Do you remember any change?</span> <span id="s144">I know that you don't remember your mother in the visual sense, but do you remember a change in the household somehow after your father was taken or was it not that clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">I: I don't think it was that clear.</span> <span id="s146">I have a feeling my mom didn't say anything to us and I think that we probably felt our dad was going to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s148">I don't think there was any change.</span> <span id="s149">The time just melted.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: You were about what, four years old in here?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">R: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So that's about 1941, maybe '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">R: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">I: Well, we know now, we just found out that he actually died.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">R: Three weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">I: We just found out three weeks ago from the Chronicles of Auschwitz that he actually was executed December 18, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">R: It's in there.</span> <span id="s159">The name, a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">I: So — the soldiers must have come.</span> <span id="s161">I do remember it was winter, so it must have been about a month or two before.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: What is the next kinds of recollection that you have?</span> <span id="s163">Going to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:13:55</span></p> <p><span id="s165">I: My next recollection is truthfully being on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">R: Being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">I: No.</span> <span id="s168">I remember a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">R: You got an earlier —.</span> <span id="s170">I just remember being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">I: And it seemed like a normal train.</span> <span id="s172">It was a train ride and then we were someplace else and I guess that was Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">R: I just remember being there.</span> <span id="s174">I don't remember getting there.</span> <span id="s175">Maybe I slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And you lived with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">I: Yes, we were with our mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What do you remember about Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s179">School, food?</span> <span id="s180">Was your mother working?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">I: I really have very sketchy remembrances.</span> <span id="s182">I just — I remember cobblestone roads for some reason.</span> <span id="s183">And I remember archways — like tunnel like — I have no idea, it could be someplace else.</span> <span id="s184">I have this flashing thing of bodies in an open cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">R: I was just going to get to that.</span> <span id="s186">I remember carts being drawn through the streets.</span> <span id="s187">I knew they were bodies.</span> <span id="s188">I don't remember them being open, but I knew that they were — don't know how, but that seems to be in the picture very, very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">I: And I also remember there, that — I think we used to wait on line there.</span> <span id="s190">I think we used to wait on lines.</span> <span id="s191">Or maybe that's earlier, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s192">And then something strange.</span> <span id="s193">I remember music.</span> <span id="s194">I remember music.</span> <span id="s195">Music, so that later on when I heard certain things, they like sounded like, “Oh, I know that,” and I don't know it, and I shouldn't know it, because I've never heard it, like, “Yes, I've heard this.”</span> <span id="s196">So, I don't remember what our mom did or whether we actually — I can't remember what we did during a day or —.</span> <span id="s197">I really don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">01:16:28</span></p> <p><span id="s199">R: No, I don't either.</span> <span id="s200">The only real strong memory I have is the picture taking session, and I think we have that picture of my mom and us leaning on her shoulder.</span> <span id="s201">I can almost feel the material on her dress.</span> <span id="s202">It was very coarse, rough, wool like and can almost smell it.</span> <span id="s203">That's my real only recollection of feeling my mother.</span> <span id="s204">That's the only thing.</span> <span id="s205">That really was very powerful.</span> <span id="s206">That happened in Theresienstadt, I know now.</span> <span id="s207">Do you remember that picture taking?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">I: Vaguely, not as clear on detail as you.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">R: Well, it made an impression on me.</span> <span id="s210">I don't remember the circumstances, but I'll never forget that feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">I: The next memory I have shortly after that is us walking.</span> <span id="s212">It was night time, through the snow and our mom had a suitcase that she was dragging along and I remember I didn't, I kind of didn't want to go wherever it was that we were going.</span> <span id="s213">I remember she gave me a real yank, like “you just come!”</span> <span id="s214">That's when I remember her presence because I remember her actually pulling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">R: I guess I was going peacefully because I don't remember the pulling.</span> <span id="s216">I do remember that night, though, and I remember dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">I: Yes, yes, there were dogs barking.</span> <span id="s218">Then we got on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">R: That train ride, I remember.</span> <span id="s220">This now we now know this was the train ride to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s221">But the combination of heat, odor, crammed quarters, the sighs, the agony of it in the car.</span> <span id="s222">You heard the people just die.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">I: There was moaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">R: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">I: And being little it was like hard to, you know, it was just — all these bodies kind of next to you and I remember I just wanted to, like, I wanted to lie down.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">R: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s227">We couldn't lie down for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">I: There was no place.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">R: There was no place or there wasn't room, or it was too dirty or it was like — nowhere to lie down.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">I: You couldn't.</span> <span id="s231">There was no place.</span> <span id="s232">You just kind of had to stay the way you got on.</span> <span id="s233">And — but we didn't cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">I: We didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">01:19:16</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">I: We were scared.</span> <span id="s239">We knew that crying was not something you did.</span> <span id="s240">You didn't cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">R: I don't think we wanted to add anything to that noise there already.</span> <span id="s242">It was a long train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">I: We had already learned the need to be silent to be quiet and well behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">R: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Can I go back for just a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">I: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Do you think you were afraid in Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s248">Do you have any recollection of being afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">R: For our personal safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">I: I don't think so, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">R: I mean, we saw these things going on and I think we just assumed that this is the way things are.</span> <span id="s252">I think our mother must have provided, I'm not just guessing, must have provided us with a real security type of blanket that we weren't, or it was our youth and we really didn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: On the train, how were the adults — well, was anybody relating to anybody else?</span> <span id="s254">Were some people talking or was there just a lot of noise people screaming?</span> <span id="s255">What other recollections do you have?</span> <span id="s256">Was your mother holding you?</span> <span id="s257">You holding onto your mother's leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">R: We were very close to her at all times.</span> <span id="s259">I think everybody was into their own — I don't remember people mixing or doing for one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">I: I kind of remember a moan or a cry here and there.</span> <span id="s261">But no, I don't, I think everybody was scared.</span> <span id="s262">I think that was the first time that I felt like, “Oh my God, what is going to happen?”</span></p> <p><span id="s263">R: I wasn't there yet with that sort of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Do you remember smells?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">R: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s266">It was strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">I: It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">R: Every kind of smell, excretion, either from the bottom or from throw up or — there was just no sanitation, nothing.</span> <span id="s269">Wherever you were, that's where it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So you also urinated or moved your bowels there or do you have a recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">R: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">I: I don't remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">R: My mother must have taken care of that.</span> <span id="s274">She always had, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">I: I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Do you remember arriving at this strange place that now has a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">R: Uh-hum, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">I: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">R: It was night.</span> <span id="s281">I heard yelling "Raus," snowing a little bit too, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">R: And it was refreshing at first, when they first opened the doors.</span> <span id="s284">I mean we had air for the first time, and it just hit you, it was good, but then the rest of it started happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">01:22:52</span></p> <p><span id="s286">I: I remember just that we had to walk a little.</span> <span id="s287">I don't know if it was a long distance.</span> <span id="s288">It's hard to tell, but we walked and then I remember finding — we all, everybody off of that, everybody went into the same place.</span> <span id="s289">We went into this big, like, barn or something.</span> <span id="s290">I don't know.</span> <span id="s291">It had a thing down the center with stones.</span> <span id="s292">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">R: No, it sounds more like a barrack that you describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">I: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">R: That's what I was in later.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">I: Well, that's where we were with our mom also and there was just a lot of other people there, as well, with families.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">R: It's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: But the three of you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">R: You say that with great certainty, so you remember?</span> <span id="s301">I mean, I think we were, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">I: Oh, yes I remember being together.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">R: I don't remember my mother.</span> <span id="s304">I'm trying so hard to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">I: I remember being together and then at some point our mom even took us to the hospital to have a medical examination and this I remember because — sorry, René — you used to cry a lot.</span> <span id="s306">You didn't like doctors, and I was only worried that you were going to cry and something terrible was going to happen to you because I was a stoic.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">R: I cried?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">I: You didn't, not that time.</span> <span id="s309">But I remember that our mom took us.</span> <span id="s310">She was with us once.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: This was at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">I: At some point.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Do you remember being tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s315">I remember being tattooed.</span> <span id="s316">I remember the pain of the needle as they made the dots, and just surrounding it was this awful odor and I'm not sure what that odor was, but the tattooing comes together with an odor for me.</span> <span id="s317">So — but I don't remember anything else but just that needle.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">01:25:31</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: But your numbers are quite different, so you were not tattooed at the same time or you don't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">R: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">I: I think we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">R: I mean, we now know that the numbers that were given to girls and to boys were different so we know this for a fact now.</span> <span id="s323">So, the numbers wouldn't be sequential, but I don't remember anybody else being tattooed except myself.</span> <span id="s324">I mean, I don't remember Irene being tattooed or my mother being tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">I: I don't have much of a recollection of the tattooing.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">R: You don't remember the tattooing?</span> <span id="s327">Such a sharp —.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">I: Yeah, but I don't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">R: We remember different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And your hair, were you shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">R: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">I: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s334">I had long hair at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Were you with other families?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">I: In the beginning, when we were with my mom, it seemed like there were grown ups and younger people and so I guess.</span> <span id="s337">I didn't really know.</span> <span id="s338">It seemed like a lot of different ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Was it possible that you were in the family camp, the Czech family camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">I: Very possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Do you remember food during this time when you were still with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">I: My only recollection of food is always the same.</span> <span id="s343">It's that black bread and something like potatoes or vegetable something, warm something.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">R: I don't have any recollection of food until later when I had to — when we were separated and I had to sift through garbage to get at potatoes.</span> <span id="s345">That seemed to have been my favorite thing.</span> <span id="s346">I would get a potato, make very thin slices and put it onto that stove.</span> <span id="s347">Most of the potatoes were rotten, but still, put it on the stove, and then somehow whatever came out, you ate.</span> <span id="s348">That's the only food I ever remember eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">I: I remember later on, after we were separated, I vaguely remember that — I guess somebody gave the food out — and I remember I thought I was terribly clever at the time, because I would get this piece of bread and I wasn't that hungry and I figured I'd be so much hungrier in the morning, so I decided, “I'll just have bite or two and I'll save this for the morning.”</span> <span id="s350">But, of course, when the morning came, the bread was gone.</span> <span id="s351">So, I think that the rats really loved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">01:28:40</span></p> <p><span id="s353">R: Rats?</span> <span id="s354">You don't think other people took it from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">I: No, I think it was the rats probably.</span> <span id="s356">I would like not to think that.</span> <span id="s357">I just thought the rats, because there were rats.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">R: This is very interesting, because this is the Passover season for us now and we break the middle matzo, we take a portion of it and hide it.</span> <span id="s359">That's why it's called poor man's bread and that's exactly what she was doing.</span> <span id="s360">She would take a piece of it, eat it, and then hide the rest of it and she never got to eat the rest of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">I: The worst was that I was so stupid.</span> <span id="s362">I just kept doing it over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">R: You didn't learn a lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">I: Didn't seem to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Do you remember when you were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Could you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">R: Well, to me it wasn't our separation to me, it was a feeling, it was a separation from my mother.</span> <span id="s369">She was, like, — she was taken away from us.</span> <span id="s370">I'm not sure what I heard or what I felt, but it was my mother and that was the only time that I felt that she was in real agony.</span> <span id="s371">It was a feeling, maybe a cry out or something, but I knew something was terribly, terribly wrong and that was the separation that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">I: I also remember it a little differently, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">R: Well, it's probably more accurate...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">I: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">R: ...from your point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">I: No, no.</span> <span id="s377">I remember knowing that something was changing and something horrible was about to take place, and I do remember an SS hitting our mom.</span> <span id="s378">I remember she didn't —</span></p> <p><span id="s379">R: You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">I: I just remember, yes, because we didn't want to let go of her and we were actually physically separated, you know, like kind of torn apart from her, pulled away.</span> <span id="s381">I don't know what, maybe she screamed, but I remember a slap, she was hit.</span> <span id="s382">I kind of —if I close my eyes, I think she fell to the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">R: It fits into my thinking.</span> <span id="s384">I don't remember it as vividly as you would.</span> <span id="s385">It fits.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">01:31:28</span></p> <p><span id="s387">I: After that, I don't remember what happened immediately after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">R: Really we were hurting, I think I was.</span> <span id="s389">I know that was a very emotional time, very, very hurtful, and after that, we were, like, we were separated.</span> <span id="s390">I remember being separated from you but we were just in different places.</span> <span id="s391">I was with the boys, young boys, older boys and men.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">I: I don't know where I was.</span> <span id="s393">I was just with other women.</span> <span id="s394">I just remember that your barrack, for some strange reason, I always said was a little bit over the right.</span> <span id="s395">It was in that direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">R: It's funny, I remember directions too, but I have no, I never studied the map of Auschwitz or anything.</span> <span id="s397">I remember where my barracks was, I remember where the gates were and I remember where the crematorium were with respect to my barrack.</span> <span id="s398">I remember people walking into this crematorium day and night just about.</span> <span id="s399">I couldn't tell you just in my own circle I could tell you if you put me there again.</span> <span id="s400">Please don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">01:32:49</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: I think we should stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">(Pause on tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Since you were separated at this point, what I would like to do, is focus on each of your stories separately although, of course, you can talk or elaborate if someone forgets something.</span> <span id="s405">So, let's focus on you, Irene, and where you remember you were and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:33:22</span></p> <p><span id="s407">I: Well, again, like I said before, my memories aren't consecutive.</span> <span id="s408">They're kind of sporadic and, very often, things in my everyday life today kind of — when I'm doing certain things they stir and trigger a memory for me that's related to what happened to me in Auschwitz, and my major memories of Auschwitz are certainly being hungry and cold very often, and I remember watching people running to the electric barbed wire and then they didn't move anymore.</span> <span id="s409">I remember having to stand outside for very long periods of time.</span> <span id="s410">I don't know exactly for what, just — and I always tried to hide.</span> <span id="s411">I thought if I wouldn't be seen then that would be good, so I always tried to find somebody taller to stand behind.</span> <span id="s412">I remember the barrack.</span> <span id="s413">I remember there was this oven or something warm running down the center that you could sit on, on it.</span> <span id="s414">I remember people sitting on there.</span> <span id="s415">I remember one night I was — I felt extremely alone.</span> <span id="s416">I had gone to the latrines that were in the back, and I became disoriented, so I forgot on which side of this oven or whatever my bed was on, and I started groping to get into somebody's bunk, because I was scared that if they found me wandering around that I'd be beaten.</span> <span id="s417">What happened was so unexpected, because wherever I tried to get in, the hands were just pushing me away saying, “this is not your place, this is not your place.”</span></p> <p><span id="s418">01:35:59</span></p> <p><span id="s419">I: It was almost dawn before some kind person finally said, “Come in and be with me.”</span> <span id="s420">And it just stuck with me all the time.</span> <span id="s421">I can still feel so unwanted, you know, like nobody cared.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">R: I don't believe — that's so — I never really heard this.</span> <span id="s423">I remember you saying once that you couldn't find your way back, but I never heard the explanation of it.</span> <span id="s424">If I may, I think just the standing in line or standing outside for great periods, I remember that too, but I remember that as roll call.</span> <span id="s425">There were lines, we were made to stand in lines.</span> <span id="s426">They might not have been the same lines, but we had, we had to stand in lines and numbers and names were yelled and down and up and down the line and the soldiers, soldier, officer, whoever very often stopped at somebody and just hit them and knocked them down to the ground for apparently no reason, but this happened almost all the time.</span> <span id="s427">I mean, I seen that many, many times happening over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">I: I kind of also remember people being beaten or punished for whatever.</span> <span id="s429">I'm not sure what it was that they had done, but I also remember seeing somebody hang.</span> <span id="s430">I don't know where, but I remember once, I don't know what was going on, but I felt I needed to hide.</span> <span id="s431">I don't know where this was exactly, but there were, I actually found myself hiding with dead bodies.</span> <span id="s432">I don't know from what exactly either, but that's a memory.</span> <span id="s433">I, of course, have unfortunately a lot of memories of the hospital and the doctor's office.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">01:38:37</span></p> <p><span id="s435">I: I seem to recall spending a great deal of time there, and also being in the hospital and being very sick, and I know one time, when I went to the doctor's office, that they took blood from me and it was extremely painful because it was from the left side of my neck.</span> <span id="s436">That's a strange thing to remember.</span> <span id="s437">I also remember having blood taken out of my finger, but that wasn't quite so bad.</span> <span id="s438">I also remember having to sit very still for long periods to be measured or weighed or in x-rays.</span> <span id="s439">I remember x-rays, x-rays and injections.</span> <span id="s440">I remember injections, and then I'd be sick.</span> <span id="s441">Because then I'd be in this hospital, and I remember having a high fever, because I know they were taking my temperature.</span> <span id="s442">Somebody was.</span> <span id="s443">I really got to hate doctors.</span> <span id="s444">I got to be afraid.</span> <span id="s445">I was terribly scared of doctors.</span> <span id="s446">I still am.</span> <span id="s447">They are a nightmare.</span> <span id="s448">Hospitals are out of the question and illness is unacceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">R: Do you ever remember being cut or something like that because I think you mentioned once — I never heard a lot of the things that you just said, but I remember you saying that once.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">I: I remember, but this is so unclear, it sounds bizarre.</span> <span id="s451">I remember something with electric wires, but I just remember — because always after the war, you know me, I'm so crazy, I can't stand to touch an electric wire.</span> <span id="s452">I get, I actually have like an anxiety attack.</span> <span id="s453">For a long time, I used to have anxiety attacks when I would have to plug in an outlet and it was especially painful to me, because I went to school and I majored in biochemistry and I taught physics and biology and I would have to do these experiments with the class and I would have to plug these things in and I'd get these horrible anxiety attacks when it had to do with electrical things and magnets and things like that in physics.</span> <span id="s454">I was a wreck.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">01:41:44</span></p> <p><span id="s456">I: I remember some kind of shock, don't know.</span> <span id="s457">And the thing that you refer about being cut, again, it's just a vague thing of being on an icy cold table and I don't know why I keep seeing eyes, and it just I know that there was a doctor there and he had an instrument.</span> <span id="s458">Like, it looked like a knife, obviously, it wasn't a knife, but it was something, and I remember him just kind of touching me with it and I, that's it.</span> <span id="s459">I don't remember anything else about that.</span> <span id="s460">I think I don't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Was anybody kind to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">I: I really, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s463">I felt no, it didn't seem to be — I always felt just outside somehow.</span> <span id="s464">I remember being a little jealous because it seemed like there was, there were two girls and it seemed like their mother — I don't know how they had a mother or somebody who would bring them things.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">R: Little girls?</span> <span id="s466">They were little girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">I: No, bigger than me, but they had somebody who brought them things, who was very close to them somehow and I remember, you know, kind of watching with great deal of envy.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did you know you were twins?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">I: No, no, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s470">I knew I had a brother, but I had no idea of what twin even meant.</span> <span id="s471">In all of this, everything that happened, I always just thought this was what life was.</span> <span id="s472">I couldn't remember anything else anymore, and I used to think sometimes about our mother, fleetingly, like, “Well, maybe I'm never supposed to see her again — this is how things are.”</span> <span id="s473">And then just knowing that there was René over there.</span> <span id="s474">And then I remember one particular night that I was especially concerned about René, because there was like a big explosion, and there was a fire and it was all off to that side, to the right.</span> <span id="s475">I remember lying on my bunk bed and there seemed to be a lot of commotion and I was scared that maybe it was his barrack burning.</span> <span id="s476">So I remember that as a real clear scare.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Did you think about him a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">01:45:08</span></p> <p><span id="s479">I: In some way, I did.</span> <span id="s480">I kind of felt I had to stay in there because he was going to need me.</span> <span id="s481">That's pretty egotistical.</span> <span id="s482">Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Do you remember other young girls in the same barrack?</span> <span id="s484">Were you with other people who also had these funny things happening to them, these horrible medical experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">I: I thought I was the only one.</span> <span id="s486">In fact, it's interesting, when in 1985, when we first found out there were other twins who survived Auschwitz, I said to René, “I thought we were the only kids who survived, how could there be anybody else, what you do mean there are twins?”</span> <span id="s487">So, no, I had no idea that anybody else was having anything done to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Are there any other things you want to tell us about Auschwitz before the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">I: I remember once in the hospital there, I was there and something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s490">It seemed all the patients were being evacuated or cleared out or something and I remember somebody who worked in the hospital grabbed me and hid me behind her and just said, “be very quiet.”</span> <span id="s491">Of course I was.</span> <span id="s492">I mean, if I could have disappeared I would have, and that's all I know.</span> <span id="s493">I don't know who it was and I don't know what she might have saved me or not saved me from.</span> <span id="s494">And so that...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Were you ever beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">I: No, no, not that I — no.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Do you remember getting weaker and weaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">I: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s499">I remember getting weaker and weaker because towards the end just before liberation, I was on the ground and I could not even get up.</span> <span id="s500">And there were other people also on the ground to my recollection, and I didn't know if I was ever going to be able to get up off this floor.</span> <span id="s501">But I don't think I understood what “to be dead” meant even then, because I just didn't know what was going to be.</span> <span id="s502">I remember there were also, I remember sirens and bombings, noise, gun fire or maybe bombs.</span> <span id="s503">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s504">Do you remember that at all?</span> <span id="s505">Sirens?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">01:48:23</span></p> <p><span id="s507">R: Yes, I remember sirens and then the hum of the airplanes and they would always get everybody in and they would stand a soldier outside our barrack, one soldier outside the barrack.</span> <span id="s508">Don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">I: But I remember that when that happened, I got very scared, when there were the sirens and the sound of the airplanes, because somehow I understood something about bombs and, and you could really get hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">R: It was not a natural course of events that was happening there.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">I: And also, do you remember every once in a while a siren would just go off and it was like there'd be a lot of commotion and the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">R: Right, yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s513">I: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">R: …but I can’t put that together right—</span></p> <p><span id="s515">I: Just — I, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s516">I guess I don’t either.</span> <span id="s517">Just a flip that came into my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Were you liberated in Auschwitz by the Russians?</span> <span id="s519">You may not have known that...</span></p> <p><span id="s520">I: Yes.</span> <span id="s521">I might not have known that that's what it was.</span> <span id="s522">I was literally picked up by a Polish lady who just took me to her home.</span> <span id="s523">I remember she carried me on her shoulders the whole way, because I couldn't, couldn't walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: You were eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">I: Yes.</span> <span id="s526">Going to be eight —</span></p> <p><span id="s527">R: You were, you were — your seventh year is December.</span> <span id="s528">You turned seven in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">I: Oh, I had just turned seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">R: You were just a little bit over seven.</span> <span id="s531">Same as me — that's how I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">I: Good point.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Rene, let's go to you and your months now in Auschwitz as you're alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">R: Well, I'm going to juxtaposition my things with hers.</span> <span id="s535">The long waits and roll calls, something that we mentioned before.</span> <span id="s536">The wires, yes, electric, every once in a while, somebody would go against those wires and then be still, but the wires to me were always near my barrack for some reason, were the backdrop of a hole, a long, deep ditch where I remember very often, very, very often they would just line up people and shoot them, because I remember as me and some other young youngsters, we went over to see what was happening to some of those people.</span> <span id="s537">I do remember one instance, where the person wasn't quite dead.</span> <span id="s538">He didn't stop moving.</span> <span id="s539">I do remember him having a big bump on his head and the people, there some of the people, actually pulled him out into the barracks.</span> <span id="s540">He was still alive.</span> <span id="s541">But it was a curiosity kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s542">This was the natural daily routine there, and I remember this happening very, very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">01:51:49 But so much for the wires.</span> <span id="s544">I was with others, I had to think were twins, my visits to the hospital, I don't think, were anywhere near as frequent as Irene's and I don't remember ever being invaded into my body.</span> <span id="s545">The only thing I remember them doing to me is measuring and I do remember the Röntgen, the x-ray, I guess it was.</span> <span id="s546">“Röntgen,” I remember that name, they used Röntgen a lot, and I had to stand still or sit still for a very long time for this process to take place.</span> <span id="s547">And it was cold wherever you were.</span> <span id="s548">That was just about the experience with the hospital, very minimal compared to Irene's.</span> <span id="s549">My barrack was, I think, one of those long things with a stove in the middle or whatever that brick structure was.</span> <span id="s550">I used that to bake rotten potatoes on and to sit on and warm on.</span> <span id="s551">Sleeping in the bunks, I just remember that smell of that wood against my nose and splinters also, because that wasn't soft wood.</span> <span id="s552">It was raw wood, very raw because you could really smell it.</span> <span id="s553">It was just about the only refreshing smell, fresh kind of an odor that you had there.</span> <span id="s554">It was woodsy, it was wood.</span> <span id="s555">I remember very clearly going to sleep, because I was near the wood.</span> <span id="s556">Cold always, hungry always.</span> <span id="s557">I remember asking who's the master of the world, who runs this, who's the master of the world.</span> <span id="s558">I was told Hitler — Hitler— but I didn't question anything.</span> <span id="s559">This was the norm.</span> <span id="s560">This was the way things were, but I did have friends, which Irene didn't.</span> <span id="s561">I think the men, the older men, sort of took care of one another in some special way that the women didn't.</span> <span id="s562">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s563">I do remember getting a pair of shoes once.</span> <span id="s564">I don't know why I know this.</span> <span id="s565">I got a pair of shoes which didn't quite fit.</span> <span id="s566">They were brown, tall, going over the ankles, but they cost somebody a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s567">There must have been a market going on, but I do remember being the recipient of this once.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">01:54:40</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: There were older men in your barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Were there older women in your barrack, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">R: And I was very close to the crematoria, because there was a constant flow of people going into this and nobody every coming out.</span> <span id="s574">I was very close to that road.</span> <span id="s575">I was, like, very close to the barracks.</span> <span id="s576">I always had a view of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Could you smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s579">The odor was just bad.</span> <span id="s580">It was just bad.</span> <span id="s581">Everything there was bad.</span> <span id="s582">Foul, all the odors were foul except for that wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">I: I just remembered something that for years, even today sometimes that besides you — you know, you just said the smells.</span> <span id="s584">Yes, it always was — there was an awful smell there.</span> <span id="s585">It was horrible all the time, but what I remembered is waiting in line naked.</span> <span id="s586">Standing outside naked waiting on line to get into the showers and sometimes we'd stand out there for many hours it seemed and somehow I remember that was scary, because I don't know now, but I knew that sometimes you didn't get your clothes at the end of this shower and you weren't going to be able to come back.</span> <span id="s587">But again, being probably silly child, at one time I had a locket from my mother that I wore around my neck and I knew that when we undressed for the showers if anybody saw this, it would be real trouble, but I was brazen enough to think that I could actually get away with hiding this in my hands, so I do remember taking it off my neck and holding it very tightly in my hand to get into the shower and I probably lost it then right in the shower because — didn't come out with it but I remember it was an act of defiance on my part.</span> <span id="s588">I said “I can do this.”</span> <span id="s589">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did you have showers with some regularity?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">R: I don't remember any showers at all, but that doesn't mean….</span> <span id="s593">I do remember though, I did see Irene once.</span> <span id="s594">I saw her once across — a wire fence.</span> <span id="s595">I don't know whether I was walking to the hospital myself, but I saw her somewhere in the middle and I recognized her.</span> <span id="s596">Nothing was said and I just looked at her and I knew she was there.</span> <span id="s597">I don't know if she remembers the moment, but I always, from that point on, and I think maybe even before, I knew that she was alive.</span> <span id="s598">It was the inspiration, it was the motivation to keep me going.</span> <span id="s599">I knew I had to stay, stick around and do until I met her for her sake, or for whatever sake, but I knew that you were there somewhere there and in a certain direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">I: I don't really recall the moment, though I'm really trying hard to see if I can, but I do, I must in some ways recall it on a different level, because I knew that you were alive, so I must have known because then later on, after liberation, I knew that you were alive, so perhaps I did see you and I just don't recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s603">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Rene, you were describing — not individual people, but, in some way, the relationships there.</span> <span id="s605">Did you feel less alone than, than Irene described herself?</span> <span id="s606">Or did you feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s607">R: I would have to think that I wasn't alone.</span> <span id="s608">I was with other people.</span> <span id="s609">I did not, however, think of Irene or my mother.</span> <span id="s610">I just accepted what was there and went with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Did you ever cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">R: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s613">I'm sure I did, but I don't remember crying, no.</span> <span id="s614">Just to catch up to Irene's liberation, I was also liberated pretty much at the same time, but under totally different circumstances.</span> <span id="s615">I remember before the end came, the end of Auschwitz, the liberation, there was an increased amount of noise, which I now know was gun fire around, and less of a German presence.</span> <span id="s616">We were marched somewhere from some point to somewhere and whoever couldn't do this marching, if they stepped out of line or fell down, they were just eliminated, so I knew I had to keep marching.</span> <span id="s617">Again, there was increased gun fire at this point, I'd have to say it was, and then all of a sudden the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s618">They were just gone, and we were surrounded by these white uniformed — which I know were Russians now.</span> <span id="s619">That's how my liberation — I do have to insert, that I do remember one Russian solider, officer on a horse, which to me looked pink.</span> <span id="s620">It looked like a pink horse to me, but that's one of the memories, and the white uniforms.</span> <span id="s621">Definitely white uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Was it night or day?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">R: Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: What languages were you speaking in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">R: That's a good question, because I just thought of it myself and I don't really remember whether it was or what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">I: Actually, we spoke German and Czech, because I did understand what — I understood what was going on around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">R: Well, I understood too, but I never put it together.</span> <span id="s628">If Germans were talking, I understood, I guess I did...</span></p> <p><span id="s629">I: That makes sense because our parents came from Germany, so we probably grew up speaking German and Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: In the barrack, do you remember what the inmates were talking?</span> <span id="s631">Do you remember not understanding a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">I: Yes, yes, I did not necessarily understand the people.</span> <span id="s633">That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">R: I don't remember any conversations really.</span> <span id="s635">I'm trying to think on it now as we're talking, but no, not really.</span> <span id="s636">Just there were these questions that I posed to people, and they would answer it and that was it.</span> <span id="s637">That was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">02:04:45</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Did you also get black bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">R: I don't remember black bread at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: So, what you remember is stealing potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">R: Potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: You don't remember being fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Do you remember drinking anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Irene, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">I: Yes, something brown, but I don't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">R: There was a liquid.</span> <span id="s650">There was a liquid served.</span> <span id="s651">I don't ever remember ever partaking of it, but there was a pot, yes.</span> <span id="s652">There was a pot and people would sort of line of for this thing.</span> <span id="s653">I don't remember ever having any.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Do you remember the latrines?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: You have no recollection of where you went to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">R: None, absolutely none.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">I: Now I do remember, I thought at one time that I actually saw like bones in the latrine.</span> <span id="s659">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">R: That's strange.</span> <span id="s661">It's really strange that I can't, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Do you ever remember washing your hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Do you remember what you were wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">R: It didn't fit, whatever it was, and it was all over me.</span> <span id="s666">It was on my head, it was all over, but I don't remember what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: What happened to you when you were liberated, when the Russian on the pink horse came?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">R: Well, I remember being marched a little further with a throng of people into a warehouse of food, and I remember getting hold of a golden looking can and rolling it.</span> <span id="s669">I remember that was my, that was my prize.</span> <span id="s670">And when they finally opened it, it turned out to be sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s671">That's what I remember about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Did you eat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">R: Yeah, tasted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">R: No, I don't remember getting sick.</span> <span id="s676">I understand that a lot of people did get very, very sick from eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Do, do you remember where they took you?</span> <span id="s678">Did they take you back to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">R: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">02:07:39</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And then what happened?</span> <span id="s682">I mean, were you there for a very long time or did someone —?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">R: Time is just totally meaningless at this point.</span> <span id="s684">My very next real memories — I know that I went to, to a hospital somewhere, but my next memories are in an orphanage in Košice, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">R: This was obviously after the war.</span> <span id="s687">It was a Catholic orphanage or hospital, because I remember being embraced by these nuns.</span> <span id="s688">In fact, I remember once being embraced by a very large nun to the point where I lost one of my teeth, which had to be loose, because it was obviously an embrace of love, not a hurting kind of thing.</span> <span id="s689">But those are just little things.</span> <span id="s690">And I was with a lot of children, but there was an administrator in this hospital who took me into his home one day where I lived with them.</span> <span id="s691">His name is, was, is, is still Doctor Kalina (ph).</span> <span id="s692">His first name, I think, was Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">I: Oh, it's Steven.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">R: Well, Doctor Kalina.</span> <span id="s695">Let's leave the first name out because I don't really — Doctor Kalina — his wife's name was Helen and they had a baby girl and I lived in an apartment on one of the streets in Košice with them.</span> <span id="s696">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s697">I remember something very specifically that happened in that house.</span> <span id="s698">Like a Christmas tree, a little goat that they let me keep in the very narrow back yard.</span> <span id="s699">A real little goat.</span> <span id="s700">He had a car, a green convertible, which I know now is a very unusual thing for somebody to have.</span> <span id="s701">He must have been somebody important in that hospital setting.</span> <span id="s702">This was an orphanage hospital complex.</span> <span id="s703">It was huge.</span> <span id="s704">To me, at that point, it seemed huge.</span> <span id="s705">I remember every weekend I would get an allowance and I was able to buy some, ten decagrams of salami in the butcher store.</span> <span id="s706">Was my treat for the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">02:10:34</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Did you know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">R: I had the feeling.</span> <span id="s710">I had the feeling, which really came just out a little bit later when this Doctor Kalina had to leave his home, leave the country.</span> <span id="s711">Because somewhere — he had to leave, and I think it had to do with Communist takeover at that time in Czechoslovakia and I started to go to school in Košice, and he left me with his sister, Edith Mann, and her husband, Joseph Mann.</span> <span id="s712">They had a boy, Otto, and a girl, Bibi (ph), Bibi, we lived very close to the school, and I knew I was Jewish then because, first of all, they were Jewish and I was called a Jew in the school.</span> <span id="s713">Everyday when I, when school got out — there was one other Jew in the entire school.</span> <span id="s714">His name was Sobol (ph).</span> <span id="s715">I'll never forget the name, Sobol.</span> <span id="s716">I don't know his first name, but the boys are waiting for us to beat us and stone us every single day.</span> <span id="s717">It was a hassle to get out of school.</span> <span id="s718">I don't know why it wasn't a problem going to school, but leaving school every day was a horror show.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Did the family know this?</span> <span id="s720">Did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">R: I think they knew it, but maybe they — I don't think anything was done.</span> <span id="s722">The school administration, now that I'm thinking about it, probably didn't do anything either, because I do remember being exposed to Catholic teachings in the classroom and we did go to church together for whatever.</span> <span id="s723">I remember always trying to be at the back, so I wouldn't maybe not get in, not enough room for me to get in or something or to sneak away, but I knew I was Jewish, definitely from that.</span> <span id="s724">They reminded me that I was and I'm sure the number on my arm was some kind of a signal.</span> <span id="s725">Though I know that not only Jews got numbers, but I think most Jews had that number.</span> <span id="s726">I think it was an identifier and the number was there.</span> <span id="s727">And I was, I also knew that I was Jewish, because the Mann family did observe certain holidays.</span> <span id="s728">I do remember going to synagogue in Košice.</span> <span id="s729">I don't remember ever praying, but I do remember having fights with boys — we'd sort of like divide the synagogue yard into two areas and chestnuts would fall and we'd throw these chestnuts at each other, making believe some kind of war was going on.</span> <span id="s730">But there were other synagogues though.</span> <span id="s731">I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">02:14:01</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: How long did you stay with the Manns (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">R: Well, I know it was about two years.</span> <span id="s735">I think it was about two years, 'til just before I came, started my trek here to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Of course, you remembered Irene, because...?</span> <span id="s737">Did you tell people you had a sister?</span> <span id="s738">[Irene shakes his head] Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">R: I think I did tell them, after first contact was made, but it came from America.</span> <span id="s740">I think it came from Irene's side.</span> <span id="s741">She's the one who somehow — well, she'll tell you how she let the people know she that had a brother, but no I wasn't making it a —.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: But you don't know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">R: No, no, I knew.</span> <span id="s744">I mean, it kept me going, it kept me going.</span> <span id="s745">And I have to say that this Mann family, they took me in and they treated me just like one of their children.</span> <span id="s746">Very understanding woman, this Edith Mann was.</span> <span id="s747">She knew what a boy, a young boy was all about, and she let me do things that all boys, I think, should be doing at that point in life.</span> <span id="s748">They bought me — in Czechoslovak, it's kolobezka, it's a scooter with just two wheels and a platform and a thing.</span> <span id="s749">It was one of the fanciest ones, and I loved that.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">I: It's funny.</span> <span id="s751">You just reminded — we had those when we were little.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">R: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">I: We had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">R: Maybe that's how I learned how to ride them, because I was an expert.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">I: We had them, I remember.</span> <span id="s756">You push off with one foot and you hold on.</span> <span id="s757">We had them, we had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">R: Yes, that was one of them.</span> <span id="s759">They were a wonderful family but that was life in Košice.</span> <span id="s760">Oh, they let me do something else.</span> <span id="s761">She let me buy two Angora rabbits.</span> <span id="s762">I had two Angora, they're white rabbits with red eyes, and they were babies.</span> <span id="s763">So they were very cute, when they were little, but then after a while they got to be big and we had to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s764">So I'll never forget every weekend or every two weeks there was a market, a farmer's market would open up.</span> <span id="s765">All the farmers would come into a big square in the town and they would sell their product, produce, whatever.</span> <span id="s766">I was at one of those stands trying to sell — I don't know if I was trying to sell my two rabbits.</span> <span id="s767">I don't even remember if I ever sold them, but they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: This is the third animal that you've mentioned.</span> <span id="s769">You mentioned a goat, and the two rabbits.</span> <span id="s770">Is this something special?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">02:17:17</span></p> <p><span id="s772">R: I don't think so, because I'm not particularly crazy about animals, certainly not to live with them, which is apparently what was going on.</span> <span id="s773">There was a dog also in Kalina's.</span> <span id="s774">Somehow I remember a dog, also a puppy, didn't last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Did Doctor Kalina have a son or a daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">R: A daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: And the Manns?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">R: The Manns had a daughter and a boy, Otto.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Were you close with them?</span> <span id="s780">Were they nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">R: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: So, they all were nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s784">I seem to be much luckier with my relationships with people after the war at least up to the Slotkins, then Irene appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Was eating a problem, or did you, I mean...?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">R: For me, personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">R: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s789">I do remember doing all the normal things, you know, looking for treats and I ate everything, kosher or unkosher, which obviously, I had no idea about.</span> <span id="s790">In fact, I do remember now eating the unkosher things, like, whatever it is, it's called slanina.</span> <span id="s791">I think it's fat, I think it's just lard or….</span> <span id="s792">Shepherds used to eat this.</span> <span id="s793">I remember going into the fields and shepherds would have this shepherd's bag and they would pull out this big hunk loaf of bread and then unwrap this smaller meaty white looking white, mostly white and take a knife and cut.</span> <span id="s794">It looked so great and delicious that I had to partake.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Was it good?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">R: Yes.</span> <span id="s797">I never had trouble eating, I don't think.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Did you feel lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">R: Well, once I found out that Irene, in fact, was alive and we made some kind of connection, I just wanted to go.</span> <span id="s800">I wanted to meet.</span> <span id="s801">I don't know what else I wanted, but I wanted to meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Irene, let's go back to you and take you up to the point — this point.</span> <span id="s803">So, this woman takes you on her back, she carries...</span></p> <p><span id="s804">I: She carries me piggy back kind of fashion, and I'm holding on to her, and I don't have a clue to where we're going, but it didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s805">And I find myself in this apartment and it's facing a square, and diagonally across to the right is where the Russian soldiers are housed in some big huge building.</span> <span id="s806">It was like a square, there were, and her name was Mrs. Mucha.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">02:20:41</span></p> <p><span id="s808">R: Yes, Mucha?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">I: Means fly in Polish, and I remember now always being embarrassed to say the name because I knew what it meant and — you know it's like...</span></p> <p><span id="s810">R: I've never heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">I: I — when I first got there, I must have been pretty sick.</span> <span id="s812">And I remember that she had me in bed and she called, I guess, what was a doctor, and I remember having hot — this is going to — hot glasses — that were heated glasses that were like put on the body at different parts.</span> <span id="s813">Do you know what I'm talking about even?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">I: It's very, very weird.</span> <span id="s816">I don't know what it was for, but I guess I eventually got better, because I did finally get out of bed, and I got enrolled in Catholic school and actually I think I knew, because you asked René about being Jewish, but I think I didn't want to be Jewish and I thought this was neat.</span> <span id="s817">It was pretty — the only thing is Mrs. Mucha was very, very, very strict, so that if I came home two minutes later than she thought it should have taken me to walk home from school, we got punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">I: We got hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">R: Who's "we?"</span></p> <p><span id="s821">I: Me, myself and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">R: Were there any other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">I: No, she had somebody who might have been her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s824">I don't know.</span> <span id="s825">I thought it was her son, but, you know, in retrospect now, I'm thinking, maybe I don't know, you know, an adult male who would come and visit every once in a while.</span> <span id="s826">He used to get drunk, and he wasn't pretty when he got drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Did he harm you?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">\I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Sexually?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">02:23:06</span></p> <p><span id="s831">I: I don't want to talk about that.</span> <span id="s832">I remember going to school and going to church and I remember, that I — when the priest called — there was a time when you could go down and they put something in your mouth, you know those white thin, looked so great, and I wanted to know if I was ever going to get a chance, but no such luck.</span> <span id="s833">But, I do remember having rosary beads and I became very devout, very devout.</span> <span id="s834">You know, I really didn't want to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s835">I mean, I was glad, “this is great.”</span> <span id="s836">But I also — maybe it wasn't totally great.</span> <span id="s837">In the summertime, she would take me to visit.</span> <span id="s838">She had family in the countryside and it would be a long, hugely long walk.</span> <span id="s839">It seemed like hours we'd walk with this wheelbarrow or something, because then we'd bring home produce from the farm.</span> <span id="s840">Now, on the farm, there were some other children, but I was really devastated by them, because they made fun of my number.</span> <span id="s841">And I didn't know how to stand up for myself.</span> <span id="s842">I was very quiet and very shy and I was very obedient.</span> <span id="s843">I was a scared bunny.</span> <span id="s844">I was scared all the time.</span> <span id="s845">I remember one particular evening or day, I kind of got lost on the farm.</span> <span id="s846">I don't know, it was getting dark and I didn't really know how to find my way back, and I guess I, they eventually found me, but I remember being pretty scared.</span> <span id="s847">I also, interesting enough, was put in charge of bunnies, of rabbits, I had to clean.</span> <span id="s848">She had rabbits.</span> <span id="s849">Not one, not two, rabbits, lots of rabbits, hutches, you know.</span> <span id="s850">I had to clean the rabbit cages, but I got very attached to the rabbits, but, you see, she used them for food, like on Sundays we would have rabbit.</span> <span id="s851">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s852">She got very mad at me and I got punished for that too, but I just couldn't eat the rabbits.</span> <span id="s853">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s854">We had a, we didn't have a bathroom in the apartment.</span> <span id="s855">There was an outhouse.</span> <span id="s856">I remember on Christmas, she told me that if I was a very good child and if I watched the sky, I would see Santa Claus come down in his coach and I would get a present, if I was very good.</span> <span id="s857">I remember I fell for this, and I believed her and I stayed up the entire night looking at the sky, and I never saw.</span> <span id="s858">I thought I was good, but I guess I figured I wasn't good enough and I never saw him.</span> <span id="s859">And I didn't even get a present.</span> <span id="s860">Well, I guess I got a present, it was a cookie made in the shape of what do they call them like gingerbread —</span></p> <p><span id="s861">R: A gingerbread house?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">I: No, like a person, like a little girl or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">R: Yes, gingerbread cookie, yes doll, girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">I: I was so excited about this.</span> <span id="s865">I remember guarding this, you know.</span> <span id="s866">I never ate it, obviously, because to me this was my doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">02:27:23</span></p> <p><span id="s868">R: Save it.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">I: Save it, right.</span> <span id="s870">I'm big on saving.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">R: I want to ask you something.</span> <span id="s872">The numbers, you said the girls — the kids made fun of your numbers?</span> <span id="s873">Was that a Jewish thing or was it fun, playing fun, because you were different or because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">I: Because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">R: So, they were saying that you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s876">That's what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">I: Right.</span> <span id="s878">So, I had a need to want to hide these things, because I really wanted to be Christian.</span> <span id="s879">And some of the — it's funny, I remember, like, some foods we had.</span> <span id="s880">We had bread with butter and sugar.</span> <span id="s881">Do you remember bread with butter and sugar?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">R: Yes, I remember it.</span> <span id="s883">Yeah.</span> <span id="s884">Also remember bread, butter and chocolate, and radishes — slices of radishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">I: Yes, I remember that too.</span> <span id="s886">But, basically she was very, very strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Was she ever nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">I: Well, she did care for me.</span> <span id="s889">She got me through being ill and, as long as I got home on time and didn't, did everything right, she was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Was she ever affectionate with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">R: It sounds pretty rough to me.</span> <span id="s893">I haven't really digested all of this ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">I: Well, you're saying it sounds pretty rough, but it was better than Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">R: Well, I'm comparing it to what I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">I: So when finally — there, I, what I subsequently learned was when the Joint Distribution or Agudah or somebody finally was sending people to take out the children from these Catholic homes and they came to take me out, I did not want to leave and I was extremely upset at having to leave, to leave.</span> <span id="s897">We went to Bratislava and there it was some kind of a home where there were other people.</span> <span id="s898">It seemed to be a waiting place where you got then sent elsewhere.</span> <span id="s899">This was just a very temporary place and that's where I met a very dear friend who then went to Israel and I'm friends with her to this day, and we would sit there with our rosary beads talking about how we were going to escape from this place because we'd said, “This is — look at them they're so dirty.</span> <span id="s900">They don't prepare things.</span> <span id="s901">Look at this place, it's a mess.”</span> <span id="s902">We were real little Catholics here and she was the only person I spoke to was this friend, Miriam.</span> <span id="s903">I didn't speak to anybody else.</span> <span id="s904">I was very upset about having been taken out of this Mrs. Mucha's home.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">02:30:45</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: What do you mean it was dirty?</span> <span id="s907">What was it about that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">I: They weren't dressed nicely, they were schlumpy and things were left on the table.</span> <span id="s909">It was just messy, I guess, maybe not dirty, but just messy, and it bothered us.</span> <span id="s910">We were neatniks in those days.</span> <span id="s911">You should see my house now.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: But you didn't escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">I: No, no we didn't.</span> <span id="s914">I got shipped to France and finally wound up in an orphanage in Fublaines, which is on the outskirts of Paris.</span> <span id="s915">I was one of the youngest children there, and I didn't speak to anybody, except Miriam, who was, I guess, about seven years older.</span> <span id="s916">She seemed like almost a mother figure in a sense to me, because I had these long curls and she would fuss with them and she just was very compassionate, and I, the other children — I was the only child there with a number, so I also felt that there was something wrong with me.</span> <span id="s917">I felt that I had done something horrible that I had gotten the number and nobody else did.</span> <span id="s918">Most of these children had escaped somehow by hiding, or their parents had temporarily given them over and some were subsequently reunited with parents and some just had family members and they were just waiting to be shipped to, and things like that.</span> <span id="s919">Even when I was in Fublaines, I tried extra hard to be good.</span> <span id="s920">I was “Miss Goody Two Shoes.”</span> <span id="s921">I would help.</span> <span id="s922">Anybody needed help, I was there.</span> <span id="s923">And I also was a stoic.</span> <span id="s924">There was time when we were getting some kind of — I really should go back and say I had all these horrible boils on my body at one point when I got to Fublaines.</span> <span id="s925">I don't know if it was an infestation of lice, but all these huge scars on my legs.</span> <span id="s926">A lot of us had it, and I remember, we had to go — the couple that ran this home, the father was, I think, a doctor and we had to go to him every day and he'd put this cream or something on it, and I remember always trying to, like, be very brave and, you know, show that it didn't hurt because I thought then they'd like me a little better than all the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">02:33:50 I was a sick child.</span> <span id="s928">We were getting inoculations at some point for something.</span> <span id="s929">Somebody would come to the home and all the children would get inoculated and the arms would blow up and nobody could move their arms.</span> <span id="s930">And everybody stayed in bed.</span> <span id="s931">Everybody except me.</span> <span id="s932">I went down and, believe me, I was in pain, my arm was blown up too.</span> <span id="s933">I bring breakfast to everybody.</span> <span id="s934">I took breakfast to everybody.</span> <span id="s935">Very strange child.</span> <span id="s936">Anything so that I could be a little special.</span> <span id="s937">That's really what it was.</span> <span id="s938">I wanted to be special.</span> <span id="s939">And I was also — a lot of the children from that — it was a period of time when a lot of children were being shipped to Israel.</span> <span id="s940">I remember, I don't know how the sequence of time, but I remember that our Aunt Paula — we found out that our mom had a sister in England — and our Aunt Paula was contacted about us and I did know that I had René.</span> <span id="s941">I didn't know where he was, but I knew that I had a brother, and but I remember hearing through the grapevine that she really didn't want us.</span> <span id="s942">I guess she had her own, she had a child at that time.</span> <span id="s943">I think things were perhaps not so great in England at that time, and I guess she just didn't have room for the two of us.</span> <span id="s944">That was, I sort of think I took it lightly then, but maybe I didn't, because it was just another reject.</span> <span id="s945">And I was trying so hard to be good, all the time.</span> <span id="s946">And then it came time and my friend Miriam was going to be going to Israel and I wanted very much to go with her as well, but it was not my luck, because in the interim, there was a Mr. Herbert Tenzer who had formed an organization here called Rescue Children and he would visit, he also had connection with Barton's Candy, and we kids were crazy about him because he would bring candy and — but the best thing was American gum.</span> <span id="s947">That was the best.</span> <span id="s948">Forget the candy, American gum.</span> <span id="s949">That was it for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">02:36:40</span></p> <p><span id="s951">I: But it seemed somehow he — of all the children, he decided to pick me to come to the United States to raise money for the other homes that Agudah or Po’el ha-Mizrachi, or whoever was running them.</span> <span id="s952">He picked me and another boy from another orphanage in France, by the name of Charles Karo, and I remember being extremely distraught about this, because I want to go with my friend Miriam.</span> <span id="s953">I remember I was promised, “just for a little bit you'll go to America.”</span> <span id="s954">— like I knew what America was, who cared?</span> <span id="s955">I just knew I was being taken away – “and you know then you'll come back here and we'll send you to Israel and you'll be with Miriam.”</span> <span id="s956">And of course, I believed them.</span> <span id="s957">And talking about candy just brought to mind a very early time.</span> <span id="s958">It must have been someplace between Bratislava and Fublaines where I might have been at another orphanage.</span> <span id="s959">I was very little and there was a room, it must have been whoever was running the orphanage and there was candy underneath this bed, hard candy and they all got me to crawl under and get the candy for them, and I was caught.</span> <span id="s960">I was caught.</span> <span id="s961">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s962">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s963">I knew I did something bad.</span> <span id="s964">It was devastating to me.</span> <span id="s965">I was mortally ashamed.</span> <span id="s966">It's also while we were in Fublaines we also were enrolled in a public school there.</span> <span id="s967">And we didn't go very often, it seemed, but every month or so we'd make this long trek, take two or three hours to walk and we'd sit at these desks and the ink bottle well was up here.</span> <span id="s968">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s969">You'd dip the pen and, yeah, so we had some kind of learning, and also at the home.</span> <span id="s970">I wasn't included in much of it because I was still one of the younger ones, but I loved learning so much I used to sneak in and listen.</span> <span id="s971">If ever there was anything going on, I'd be there.</span> <span id="s972">They were also teaching us about our religion and Hebrew studies and it was only for the older girls, but I always sneaked in with Miriam and I'd fall asleep, but I remember because again I wanted to be special.</span> <span id="s973">I wanted them to notice that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">02:39:41</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: At that point did you decided you wanted to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">I: Well, it seemed like Miriam was, so it was okay, you know.</span> <span id="s977">We were going to be together so it didn't matter anymore what, yeah, we did — and I liked it, because we did have Shabbats and I know we always got a special dress for Shabbat, which we then had to turn quickly in, because then we got whatever we wore for the whole week.</span> <span id="s978">I remember vanity gets in my way too, because we would get shipments of clothing items from the States or wherever and there was these red shoes.</span> <span id="s979">I had to have the red shoes.</span> <span id="s980">I remembered sandals.</span> <span id="s981">I remember these were with little holes in them, like a shoe sandal.</span> <span id="s982">I had to have them.</span> <span id="s983">So, when the children tried on the shoes I said, “I want those shoes.”</span> <span id="s984">They were too small for me but I said, “They fit great.</span> <span id="s985">I like them, I love them, they're my shoes.”</span> <span id="s986">And because of this, very shortly after that, we took a long walk into Paris, or went for a really long walk, and of course, you can imagine what happened to my feet.</span> <span id="s987">I had blisters.</span> <span id="s988">My feet were bleeding.</span> <span id="s989">I was in so much pain that the head mistress had to actually take me in Paris to buy me a pair of bigger shoes.</span> <span id="s990">I got white.</span> <span id="s991">I got white.</span> <span id="s992">They weren't red, but okay, but they weren't brown.</span> <span id="s993">I hated brown, and that's all that I had had before.</span> <span id="s994">My story with the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: When you were in Poland with this woman, Mrs. Mucha, you decided you didn't want to be Jewish, what was going through your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">I: What was going through my mind is that I felt to be Jewish was not a good thing.</span> <span id="s997">People didn't like Jews and it was just much better to be Catholic because that was just what everybody was.</span> <span id="s998">I wanted to be part of what everybody was — and gee — it was pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">02:42:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">R: I never knew that there was an option even for this.</span> <span id="s1001">I sort of was always reminded that I was Jewish and I accepted that.</span> <span id="s1002">And I knew I wasn't liked, but I accepted it.</span> <span id="s1003">I did have though one in the very early stages when I first started to go to school and they had these Catholic priests teach us the religion.</span> <span id="s1004">It seemed so very, so very pretty, the statues and the rays going to the heads it seemed very nice and clean, and the Christmas also seemed very — but somehow I couldn't put it together with what these people were really doing.</span> <span id="s1005">I mean those same kids that I went to church with were waiting for me on the outside, so I just — that wasn't an option really.</span> <span id="s1006">Just a hint there that maybe there's another way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: You then went to the United States on a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">I: No, I came by plane.</span> <span id="s1009">It was terrifying because nobody had actually prepared me for a plane ride, and we came — I came with Charlie and Miss Stutz (ph) or — don't remember.</span> <span id="s1010">Anyway, a young woman who accompanied us and, we came — that's how we came to New York.</span> <span id="s1011">The plane ride was horrific.</span> <span id="s1012">I remember getting sick.</span> <span id="s1013">I remember throwing up.</span> <span id="s1014">It was just — there was no preparation.</span> <span id="s1015">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1016">It was long, it was very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">I: So, I’m now — it's 1947, I'm going to be 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: So, you go to live with this Mr. Tenzer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">I: I come to the States and I get wined and dined.</span> <span id="s1021">We go to the White House.</span> <span id="s1022">We visit President Truman and like, you got a celebrity sitting next to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: You were kind of like a poster child in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">I: Exactly right.</span> <span id="s1025">I was poster child.</span> <span id="s1026">I had these long curls.</span> <span id="s1027">I'm convinced to this day that's why he chose me.</span> <span id="s1028">He says he just fell in love with me, he says, but I was the only child with long hair, that's the truth.</span> <span id="s1029">And I was kind of the poster child.</span> <span id="s1030">We were wined and dined.</span> <span id="s1031">We went to dinners.</span> <span id="s1032">We were on TV, early TV We were on the radio, and Life magazine did a full spread and a cover story and yes, they did raise thousands of dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">02:45:30 In the meantime, I was staying at Mr. Tenzer's home.</span> <span id="s1034">And well — no, at the beginning we stayed at a posh hotel.</span> <span id="s1035">Wait a minute, we stayed at a hotel in New York City, and I remember getting served white bread for the first time and corn flake cereal, which I detest to this day, because — what is this?</span> <span id="s1036">White bread, I didn’t — and the photographers were taking pictures, so they wanted us to look all excited about this, so I looked excited — but I said “I'm not eating this.”</span> <span id="s1037">So, and we went shopping in this big department store.</span> <span id="s1038">I think it was Bonwit Teller’s, and I never seen anything like it in my whole life.</span> <span id="s1039">We got clothes and we got — I got a stuffed animal, a bear, pink, “Celeste” I called it.</span> <span id="s1040">And then I just kind of – I got — I wasn't staying with Mr. Tenzer.</span> <span id="s1041">Charlie stayed with Mr. Tenzer.</span> <span id="s1042">I stayed with Bill and Eda Bess Novick.</span> <span id="s1043">He was also one of the founders of Rescue Children and she had at that time a little boy, David, and I think she was pregnant, and so I stayed with them and they enrolled me in the local yeshiva and I just wanted to know when I was going back to France, and it seems that Mr. Tenzer arranged it so I would never go back to France and I would just be staying here someplace and there was a family who was interested in possibly adopting me — and they'll remain nameless — so we had a trial, so they invited me for a weekend.</span> <span id="s1044">They had a daughter and a son and they wanted a playmate for their daughter I guess.</span> <span id="s1045">So, I came, and I was very shy.</span> <span id="s1046">I was very quiet and I didn't know how to play games.</span> <span id="s1047">I never played, and they wanted me to play dolls and Monopoly.</span> <span id="s1048">I didn't know how to play anything, so I failed, and so after my visit with them, they decided that I was not the right child, but that they would take Charlie instead, because Charlie was very outgoing and he was funny and he had an impish smile and he had the dimples.</span> <span id="s1049">He was cute and he blabbed and he'd talk and I only wanted to hide in the corner and disappear.</span> <span id="s1050">So they didn’t — I was a reject, so I came back to Mr. Tenzer, but then I lucked out, because then — I don't know quite how — Mr. and Mrs. Meyer Slotkin were contacted, and they actually had said they would be willing to adopt a child and they wanted a boy actually.</span> <span id="s1051">They wanted Charlie.</span> <span id="s1052">Actually, that was the arrangement.</span> <span id="s1053">This other family was going to get me and they were going to get Charlie, but when Mr. Tenzer explained to them what happened, they said, “No problem, we'll take her.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">02:49:08 They just took me sight unseen.</span> <span id="s1055">I wasn't rejected.</span> <span id="s1056">And in the meantime, Eda Bess Novick, when I staying with them, I had told her that I had a brother, so I think what happened is Rescue Children started making inquiries themselves about — I remembered his name was René Guttmann.</span> <span id="s1057">I don't remember how I remembered that, but I did, and to make a very absolutely phenomenal story a little shorter, when Doctor Kalina had to flee to Israel was about the same time that Life magazine did a spread on me, and he picked up this Life magazine in Israel and he opened the page and he saw Irene Guttmann, and he said, “that must be René's sister,” and that's really how —.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: How did they find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">I: Well, Doctor Kalina knew where he was.</span> <span id="s1060">So, Doctor Kalina told Rescue Children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">R: Yes, I was with his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">I: And that’s when I told Mr. and Mrs. Slotkin — they were thrilled, they said “great.”</span> <span id="s1063">Now they're really happy, because they really wanted a boy for so long.</span> <span id="s1064">See, they just wanted you, René.</span> <span id="s1065">But they really spared no expense and it was a trek to get him.</span> <span id="s1066">I mean a lot of red tape.</span> <span id="s1067">A lot of government officials had to be convinced the justice of this.</span> <span id="s1068">Money changed hands often and it took two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">R: It took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So, how did each of you find out that you were in a particular place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">I: We started writing once we — Doctor Kalina notified us where René was, and I had an address for him.</span> <span id="s1072">I wrote him.</span> <span id="s1073">In fact, I still have the letter.</span> <span id="s1074">My mother made a copy of it at that time for me.</span> <span id="s1075">She took a photograph of it.</span> <span id="s1076">Some silly letter: “I go skating.</span> <span id="s1077">I'm a big girl now.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">R: When I think about it today, these people for two years searched and, believe me, it cost them, they told me that when I got here finally in 1950, that I was actually worth my weight in gold, of course, gold wasn't as dear as it is today, but still I believe them, because for two years they searched.</span> <span id="s1079">They sent a man, a private person just to go out there —.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">I: Because René was behind the iron curtain now and it took some doing because he had to go — Switzerland, he had to go to school there.</span> <span id="s1081">He had a good time.</span> <span id="s1082">He skied, he learned how to do all nice things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">R: I really lucked out on this.</span> <span id="s1084">I was in Paris, in the Grand Hotel.</span> <span id="s1085">They would — I would go to see movies, English movies because in preparation getting the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">02:52:29</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">I: Not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">R: It was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">I: I was struggling with school and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">R: I saw Elizabeth Taylor in the original Black Beauty.</span> <span id="s1091">I mean, I remember her blue eyes and dark skin.</span> <span id="s1092">I thought she was magnificent.</span> <span id="s1093">She was very young then – it was a real girl.</span> <span id="s1094">Some of the cowboys, Tom Mix.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">I: Lone Ranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">R: That’s much later — this is in Europe.</span> <span id="s1097">The Abbot and Costello movies, these was what was being shown then, and I was made to go and see these, so I would catch on to the English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">I: Tough life he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">R: Then they sent me to school in Switzerland where I learned Hebrew and to ski.</span> <span id="s1100">It wasn't the purpose.</span> <span id="s1101">The purpose was — They couldn't somehow get through the red tape to get me over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Were the Mann family upset in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">I: They were in some ways — I think Mrs. Mann really liked me.</span> <span id="s1104">I felt that.</span> <span id="s1105">I never knew what it's like to love a mother or a father, not even the Slotkins, even though they're angels, because I realize now what they had done.</span> <span id="s1106">It's only when you grow a lot older that you realize that here was this family, the Slotkins, and they took an unknown 12 year old boy, I mean, think about it, with certainly not a great background.</span> <span id="s1107">Certainly questionable, a little bit, to just bring him and adopt him.</span> <span id="s1108">It was like an unbelievable thing to do, but Irene paved the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">I: I paved the way.</span> <span id="s1110">They loved me – they figured you had to be right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Did you write to each other in Czech, German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">R: I wrote in Czech and I think it was translated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">I: Then, he started writing simple English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Tell us about the day you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">R: It was March 29, 1950.</span> <span id="s1116">I landed at Idlewild Airport with Mr. Enright.</span> <span id="s1117">It was a misty night.</span> <span id="s1118">Did we…?</span> <span id="s1119">It was my mother that came to pick us up, my father wasn't out there.</span> <span id="s1120">I call them mother and father, because they're the only ones that I knew.</span> <span id="s1121">He was out of town somewhere, but we came in, we came to the house.</span> <span id="s1122">I think it was so late at night that we didn't see.</span> <span id="s1123">I don't remember seeing you that night.</span> <span id="s1124">I think we just went to sleep.</span> <span id="s1125">They gave us their bedroom, the master bedroom of the house, Mr. Enright and myself had that, and I don't know where the rest of them were.</span> <span id="s1126">But I remember seeing you first in the morning on that path in the front of the house.</span> <span id="s1127">That's my first recollection of seeing you, meeting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">02:55:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">I: Yes, I remember it was the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">R: In the front of the house.</span> <span id="s1131">And to me it was like when I saw her in Auschwitz, the look, didn't say a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">I: Not a word.</span> <span id="s1133">We didn't say anything, we just —</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">R: But okay, now it's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">I: People are always surprised.</span> <span id="s1136">They expect that fire works went off, but it was not like that at all.</span> <span id="s1137">It was just…</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">R: Very long trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">I: But we never spoke about anything that happened.</span> <span id="s1140">We just became very American — like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">R: I was even in the American Army, would you believe.</span> <span id="s1142">The National Guard, Fort Dix —that's where I had my basic training.</span> <span id="s1143">People told me that I was really nuts, but —</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">I: When I went to school here, I went to yeshiva and I also even here I was ashamed of what had happened to me, because they never taught anything about the Holocaust and I had the number and I always wanted to hide it, so my mom did get makeup and every— anytime in the summer or spring when I was wearing short sleeves, we would doctor it up in the morning, take an extra ten minutes of my life in the morning to do, because I didn't want anybody to know that I had been in this, because I felt that it was something to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s1145">And I remember once a teacher asking me — and this was already I was in high school — and he asked me this question, he said to me, “If everybody in this country were to vote that we should kill all the Jews would that still be a democracy?”</span> <span id="s1146">He's asking me, me of all the children in that school, so I guess what I'm trying to say is there was very little sensitivity and, even among teachers or my classmates, people just didn't know what to do with it.</span> <span id="s1147">I was the only child survivor that they had ever seen that was in that school and, of course until René came, and they just — I remember history and nothing.</span> <span id="s1148">Never talked about this.</span> <span id="s1149">So, I was ashamed to talk about it too, plus that our parents said, “forget about it, this is a new life, be American,” and I already had learned to fit in, so I knew how to do that.</span> <span id="s1150">I became very American, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">R: So did I.</span> <span id="s1152">It was time to be drafted or join, I chose to join, but they told me, “You'll get off, just tell them what you are.</span> <span id="s1153">You can't be near guns, near war.</span> <span id="s1154">You've had it.</span> <span id="s1155">I didn't feel that, I really had the fear.”</span> <span id="s1156">So I said, “No, I'll have to go through it,” and I did.</span> <span id="s1157">Of course, I took lot of abuse, again in the army, because of the number.</span> <span id="s1158">Total ignorance.</span> <span id="s1159">They people didn't know and this I'm talking about 1960, about 1960.</span> <span id="s1160">Not so far away from the war and you'd think that people would know, but totally insensitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">02:59:08 End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">03:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Irene, if we can just go back for a moment, when you were with Mrs. Mucha, she did something very bizarre with you.</span> <span id="s1165">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">I: Yes.</span> <span id="s1167">Every once in a while she would take me, I didn’t really realize where at the time, but we would sift through ashes looking for gold teeth, and I realized that the surroundings were kind of familiar when I got there.</span> <span id="s1168">I guess she was taking me back to Auschwitz-Birkenau and we were looking for gold teeth.</span> <span id="s1169">And by this time, I understood that a lot of people had died here and had been set ablaze here.</span> <span id="s1170">And it was a very difficult thing for me to do but – and I had — she insisted that I do this.</span> <span id="s1171">I had to come up with some gold teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: So, she didn't shift through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">I: She also sifted.</span> <span id="s1174">We both did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: And if you didn't come up with gold teeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">I: I had to come up with gold teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: And this was more than once?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: You were talking, René, about being in the National Guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">R: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1181">I joined the National Guard in the early 60s, maybe even '59 it was.</span> <span id="s1182">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1183">I was an observant Jew and I saw nothing wrong with it.</span> <span id="s1184">I saw nothing wrong with having my arm bared, which was many times.</span> <span id="s1185">There I remember the showers very clearly.</span> <span id="s1186">The army showers.</span> <span id="s1187">I had my head shaved, it was really funny, now that I think about it.</span> <span id="s1188">I was surprised that it was only like a decade or so after the war, the World War II and the ignorance of the people when they saw my arm.</span> <span id="s1189">They were like, “It's your phone number, it's your social security number?</span> <span id="s1190">Is it your…” they really had no idea.</span> <span id="s1191">And then, coupled with my wearing a hat or a yarmulke in the mess hall, and usually carrying my own food in or asking for certain food to be prepared.</span> <span id="s1192">I was surprised at the negative feelings that I got.</span> <span id="s1193">Well, maybe it's the wrong word, surprised.</span> <span id="s1194">That's the way it's been all my life all over, but I thought, “In the army — the American Army, we're sharing something.”</span> <span id="s1195">I was such a good soldier.</span> <span id="s1196">A marksman, my company commander was very proud of me.</span> <span id="s1197">I was his only Jew, but I was the best, so, but it was surprising, that so shortly after the war, there was still ignorance and these negative feelings about Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">03:04:38</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: When they asked you, “Is this your telephone number?”</span> <span id="s1200">I mean, clearly you said “no,” but did you say —?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">R: I told them what it was.</span> <span id="s1202">I said — I explored it with them – “You really don't know what this is?”</span> <span id="s1203">and they didn't.</span> <span id="s1204">Then, I told them, and they still weren't quite sure what to make of that.</span> <span id="s1205">“Was it a Jewish symbol?</span> <span id="s1206">Did it make you a Jew?”</span> <span id="s1207">I said, “No, this is man's symbol of inhumanity to another man.</span> <span id="s1208">Tattooing instead of giving me a name, giving me a number.”</span> <span id="s1209">You know, I tried to explain it.</span> <span id="s1210">Some got it, some didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1212">At this point, in the 60s, what did you know about where you were at that time in the 40s?</span> <span id="s1213">Did you know it was Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">R: Yeah, but that's as much as I knew and that's as much as I care to know, and that's as much as I discussed with Irene.</span> <span id="s1215">We never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1216">We knew where we came from and that was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So, you went into the National Guard after high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">R: Pretty much, yeah.</span> <span id="s1219">It was college really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Was this like ROTC?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">R: No, it was not a continuous — I did go into ROTC, but I cut out of their program and that would have led me into a two year stint and I wasn't ready for it.</span> <span id="s1222">I went on to college, after I was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Did you go to school, Irene?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: You studied biochemistry, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">I: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1227">I am a biochemist.</span> <span id="s1228">I never spoke about the Holocaust, because I — as I said — I had this feeling that nobody ever really wanted to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1229">Also, our parents kind of told us, you know, “it’s best,” and what was everybody’s feeling, “You were young, forget about it.</span> <span id="s1230">You've got a new life, and just, you know, put the past out of your minds.”</span> <span id="s1231">In a way, I did that.</span> <span id="s1232">I listened.</span> <span id="s1233">I said, “Okay, great.</span> <span id="s1234">I'm American.</span> <span id="s1235">I'll put it out of my mind.”</span> <span id="s1236">But, in a way, I was suffering twice.</span> <span id="s1237">I had already suffered, and now I was suffering, because I couldn't even talk about it.</span> <span id="s1238">It made me feel like maybe there was something to really be ashamed about, because nobody wanted to know about it.</span> <span id="s1239">And as I went through high school, I remember the Holocaust was not even mentioned.</span> <span id="s1240">We learned the world history.</span> <span id="s1241">We learned about World War II, but — and this was a yeshiva!</span> <span id="s1242">So, it was pretty frightening to me, I — and then when I got to college, it was pretty much the same thing.</span> <span id="s1243">I found that my friends knew very little about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1244">Nobody spoke about it.</span> <span id="s1245">There weren't any programs yet, and I really — it just reconfirmed for me that it was something that I need to be ashamed of and I don't want anybody to know that I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s1246">But then, when I got a little braver, and they started having some Holocaust reunions, I kind of would venture forth and say, “I am a survivors.”</span> <span id="s1247">From the survivors I got, “You can't be, you're too young.</span> <span id="s1248">Couldn't be.</span> <span id="s1249">Children didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1250">They said where were you?”</span> <span id="s1251">I said “Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1252">Couldn't be.</span> <span id="s1253">Children didn't survive.”</span> <span id="s1254">I said, “But I and my brother did.</span> <span id="s1255">We did.”</span> <span id="s1256">“No, you have it mixed up.”</span> <span id="s1257">So, another negative.</span> <span id="s1258">So, I stopped, I kind of stopped talking about it.</span> <span id="s1259">I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1260">I think my kids knew, my husband knew that I was a survivor, but I think the floodgates broke loose in 1985 and friends who had known me for years, who hadn't had a clue that I was a survivor, were shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">03:08:59</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: They didn't see your tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">I: Right, because I always hid it.</span> <span id="s1264">I hid it.</span> <span id="s1265">I wore long sleeves.</span> <span id="s1266">I wore long sleeves, I wore Band-Aids.</span> <span id="s1267">René never did.</span> <span id="s1268">René always showed it clearly, and after a while, I also stopped covering it up, but I remember in particular when I gave birth to my daughter Lori, a nurse came into my room and she saw my number and she ran out terrified.</span> <span id="s1269">She thought I was a prisoner, an escaped prisoner, 1965.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Did you folks read Diary of Anne Frank, when it came out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">I: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">R: I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: That's in the 50s, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">I: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Did that provoke something in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">I: Yes.</span> <span id="s1277">I was very moved and touched by it, but I couldn't quite — I'm searching for the right word.</span> <span id="s1278">I didn't connect to it.</span> <span id="s1279">Her story was so very different.</span> <span id="s1280">And in some ways, I thought it was better, you know.</span> <span id="s1281">At least she had her family and so they were in hiding and however horrible that was, at least they had each other for a long time.</span> <span id="s1282">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Do you know that she went to Auschwitz from that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">R: I found it yesterday in the Museum's archives, in the Auschwitz Chronicles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">I: I found out sooner than that, but I didn't from that book realize that she had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">R: Can I backtrack just once?</span> <span id="s1288">It just came to mind that this loneliness that we talked about.</span> <span id="s1289">When twins were in Auschwitz and they had their own sex partner with them, there — they had somebody with them.</span> <span id="s1290">We were separate because of our sex difference, so this made it —</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">I: It added to the isolation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">R: Do you remember seeing girl twins together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">I: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1294">I was jealous.</span> <span id="s1295">I was jealous of them because I felt they had somebody and I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1296">That's why I was always hiding and—</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">03:11:35</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: So, they never kept the boys and the girls together, the twins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">I: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1300">I think maybe younger ones possibly, but—</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">R: I don't think there were any.</span> <span id="s1302">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did you talk with your kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">I: No.</span> <span id="s1305">I did make an attempt.</span> <span id="s1306">At one time, I was actually at my mom's house and Lori was asking me about my number and I was trying to tell her that it was something horrible that happened and that I'm adopted and my mother got very upset.</span> <span id="s1307">She said, “You don't have to tell her these things.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">R: The Slotkins, in all their good qualities and beautiful intentions, they slipped up over here a little bit.</span> <span id="s1309">They were a little over protective, I think.</span> <span id="s1310">They really tried to hide the truth, in a way of protecting us, really.</span> <span id="s1311">I don't think they had anything else in mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">I: But it backfired, because the more they said don't talk about it, the more it was still always there, because it's always with me and not being able to express it or tell or share any of it was really hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1314">When you saw each other for the first time, when you were finally together, even though you didn't talk, did that stimulate nightmares or remembrances or bad dreams that you woke up from?</span> <span id="s1315">I mean do you have any recollection whether there was something that happened other than safety when you found each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">I: For me, I had some of the remembrances we spoke about when we were children.</span> <span id="s1317">And so, when I saw him, “Now I have finally have somebody I can check some of this stuff out with.”</span> <span id="s1318">I think we did check some of that pre stuff out that we never spoke about after Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1319">It was only what happened before.</span> <span id="s1320">That's how we spoke about the doll and about the bee sting and a couple of things like that.</span> <span id="s1321">So, that was nice to confirm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: So, it didn't bring out —?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">03:14:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Now, did you become a teacher when you studied biochemistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">I: No, I went into research, but I did teach for a while, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So what happens in the 80s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">I: Well, in 1985, it was probably in December we got a call from Eva Kor who was the founder and remains the president of an organization called CANDLES, which stands for Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiment Survivors, it's a mouthful, God!</span> <span id="s1329">CANDLES.</span> <span id="s1330">And she told us that they're going to have a reunion, a first time reunion of all surviving twins in Israel, and that we were going to bring Joseph Mengele in absentia to a tribunal and Gideon Hausner was going to chair it and are you going to come?</span> <span id="s1331">We were just —as I said before, I said, “You mean we're not the only children to survive Auschwitz?”</span> <span id="s1332">But it was a drawing card, I think, for René and myself.</span> <span id="s1333">For me, I had a tremendous need to find somebody who knew me.</span> <span id="s1334">I wanted to be affirmed in some way.</span> <span id="s1335">“Oh please, let me — somebody knows me, so they can tell me what exactly happened.</span> <span id="s1336">And are my memories, they're so bizarre, can they be real?”</span> <span id="s1337">And so, we decided we'd do it.</span> <span id="s1338">And, you know, it's in retrospect now, because we did that and we started talking to each other and heard some of the other twins and some of their testimonies and it was like, “Ah-ha, that's what happened to me!”</span> <span id="s1339">You know, we realized that our memories were true, as bizarre as they might be, they really happened, and subsequently, we were able to research out a lot of our past, because we started looking into history books and original documentation from Auschwitz and Givat Chaim in Israel, we started piecing together dates and occurrences.</span> <span id="s1340">We were also very fortunate to have a lot of photographs that were saved by our aunt for us and letters and documentations, birth certificates and such.</span> <span id="s1341">So, it's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">R: It's like finding roots.</span> <span id="s1343">Roots is very important in American history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Were you as surprised as Irene that there were other children?</span> <span id="s1345">Or did you know there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">R: That didn't play such an important part because I didn't need — I didn't feel like I had to be okay by anybody.</span> <span id="s1347">I was okay.</span> <span id="s1348">I was surprised though when I saw the numbers.</span> <span id="s1349">And there must have been about 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">I: Right, about 120.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">03:17:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">R: One hundred and twenty from all over the world, and some of the stories we've heard were more bizarre than even ours, believe me.</span> <span id="s1353">Some of the stories — because I think older people — most of the people are older — one hundred percent of them were older than us, and they were more caught up in this thing emotionally.</span> <span id="s1354">That's my own private theory, that when you're older, your emotions are hurt much more.</span> <span id="s1355">You have more understanding of what's really going on, so you were hurt more.</span> <span id="s1356">And the stories that they told with the emotions behind them were really, really – but I don't know, Irene, you never find anybody who recognized you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">I: No, I was the one who was looking for somebody to recognize me.</span> <span id="s1358">But again—</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">R: I was recognized by people.</span> <span id="s1360">I didn't recognize them, but they recognized me, so I must have made an impression on somebody, which was okay with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: What did that do?</span> <span id="s1362">I mean, it's clear what it did for you probably together and for yourself, but when you came back to the United States in terms of your friends, in terms of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">I: Well, our dad was already dead, and my mom, we started — I started giving talks on Yom Ha-Shoah.</span> <span id="s1364">It's one of the things I still do.</span> <span id="s1365">And we were in the news media a lot at that time, and I think my mom was kind of proud, but she didn't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1366">She's never come to hear me talk.</span> <span id="s1367">She never came.</span> <span id="s1368">She's dead now, but she never came, and she never wanted to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1369">I could not talk to her about it at all, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Did that hurt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">I: It's hard, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">R: Yeah, it's hard, because here is somebody who certainly loves you and wants to do absolutely the best, and yet somehow doesn't have enough strength or wisdom to be sensitive to understand that this other person has to express or wants to — I mean, we really didn't want to go and spill our guts out, just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1373">I think maybe part of it was that she really wanted to play the mother role.</span> <span id="s1374">She was the only mother.</span> <span id="s1375">She was afraid of maybe losing that.</span> <span id="s1376">I'm just talking now.</span> <span id="s1377">We don't know, we really don't know.</span> <span id="s1378">But her motivation was pure, I know that, absolutely pure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">03:20:21</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Did it shock your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">I: I had some friends who were totally taken aback, they said, “But you're so American.</span> <span id="s1382">You don't talk like a European.</span> <span id="s1383">You don't look like, you know.”</span> <span id="s1384">And — but the truth of it is, that even though I'm so "American," because I knew how to fit in, the truth is that everything I did and everything I excelled at, whether it was in school or being, I mean, I made my parents – right, I was the salutatorian of the class, the editor of the newspaper, the yearbook, the — you name it, I did it — but always there was that feeling like I was apart.</span> <span id="s1385">I never — never felt a part of anything.</span> <span id="s1386">There was always a wall someplace.</span> <span id="s1387">I said, “You guys don't know what I know.”</span> <span id="s1388">And I remember when I first even started school here.</span> <span id="s1389">I remember the kids would talk out of turn in class or they didn't bring in the homework and I said, “My God, how can you do that?”</span> <span id="s1390">I said, “How can you do that?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: You were a good girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">R: Just generally, I think the European school system is so different.</span> <span id="s1393">I remember, I used to, other than the unpleasant things, I used to have to bring my own stick to school, in case I misbehaved and get hit on my hands.</span> <span id="s1394">So, there was this big theory to get a very thin stick, then it will really sting, or get a fat stick, and it will really hurt.</span> <span id="s1395">This was a big problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Were you in classes together through high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">R: Yes, through high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">I: In our English classes we were together, but in Hebrew we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Was that fun to be in school together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">I: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">R: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">I: No, it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">R: The class was really too small.</span> <span id="s1405">I think there were only 11 of us, because this was the beginning of a school there, we were always the eldest – we were senior class in yeshiva, right.</span> <span id="s1406">Even if we were juniors or sophomores or freshmen, we were always the oldest.</span> <span id="s1407">There were — nobody older than us, so it was too close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">I: It was too close.</span> <span id="s1409">We weren't the same kind of student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">R: She was a student, I was a playboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">I: And, you know, very often, he'd be compared to me and I didn't like that, because I really wanted to be like him.</span> <span id="s1412">I thought it was nifty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">R: And Father thought I should be just like you, a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">I: So there you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">03:23:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: What did you end up doing — since we know what Irene ended up doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">R: I ended up getting married early and out of the house, making a mistake doing that, I think, but as God's ways are so strange, everything I've done in my life has led up to what we're on now.</span> <span id="s1418">And I can see the whole picture now and it's not so bad.</span> <span id="s1419">I paid my dues, but I have the most wonderful wife in the world, the wonderful wife, the best, and I have the best kids and the best grandchildren, so I'm happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: What did you do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">I: I worked in the packaging field all my life.</span> <span id="s1422">Packaging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Do the two of you live near each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">I: Relatively, I live on Long Island, he lives in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1425">And I also have the best family, René.</span> <span id="s1426">So, you know, I have the best kids too.</span> <span id="s1427">I don't have any grandkids yet, but I definitely have the best great-grand whatever they are to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Right, René was just made a grandfather twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">R: Last week, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">I: I also do calligraphy and write poetry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">R: She's very talented.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">I: I don't know if I'm talented, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">R: What this '85 thing also did for us, it made the two of us talk.</span> <span id="s1434">Not during any session at home, we would not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1435">Like in between sessions in the hotel room, we would talk about it, and that's the only time we talk about it.</span> <span id="s1436">We'll go home now and we're not going to talk about this, but we talked about it a little bit this morning or last night on the way to the airport, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1437">It's just something that is not really, I guess — it's not pleasant.</span> <span id="s1438">It's unnerving.</span> <span id="s1439">It takes a lot out of, out of you, but we've done it now since '85.</span> <span id="s1440">We've talked because we feel it's really necessary, and the further we go away from it, the more necessary, I think, it becomes because we see a lot of funny things going on out there, in terms of did it really happen?</span> <span id="s1441">Did it not happen?</span> <span id="s1442">What really happened?</span> <span id="s1443">We'll change a little bit of this and a little bit of that and that's very, very harmful and dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">03:26:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">I: I'm going to say that this has been painful for me to do, even though René says we've been doing it now since '85.</span> <span id="s1447">I, I'm always disturbed for days on end after I've done it, but I agree with René that it's something that we need to do for our children, so that they can pass on the story, because it must never be forgotten, and I guess that's why I do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">R: I have to say again that what's happening today, we are meeting up with people that are using the story for their own purpose and, obviously, if they're using a story that's not true, they're changing it.</span> <span id="s1449">That is we can't stand by, as hurtful as it is to question a survivor, because I know when somebody asks me a question, it's got to be done.</span> <span id="s1450">It's got to be done to pollute the history of something like this, it’ll lose any potential for learning something from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">I: Well, the historical integrity of the Holocaust must really be upheld and it's got to be done with the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">R: And I think more people when they put somebody in the front or recognize by whatever slight means, survivor, I think at this point have to question and document that person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Well, I thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1454">You showed your tattoo, would you be willing to photograph your tattoo?</span> <span id="s1455">What's the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">I: 70917.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">R: That's an old looking tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">I: It's 50 years old, baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Yours is much smaller?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">R: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Yours is 169061.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">03:29:36</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">I: We've been trying to find out what my mom's number might have been.</span> <span id="s1464">We didn't find out yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">R: We suspect it was probably close to that number, but we don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">I: Okay, the photo on the left is my mom with René and myself.</span> <span id="s1467">René is on the right and I am on the left, and I think it was shortly after we were born.</span> <span id="s1468">It's probably 1938.</span> <span id="s1469">The photo on the right is again René and myself with my dad, and it's about the same time.</span> <span id="s1470">René is on the left and I'm on the right with my dad, because René has the droopy eyes.</span> <span id="s1471">It's 1939 and we're wearing our nifty winter jackets.</span> <span id="s1472">René is on the right and I'm on the left.</span> <span id="s1473">It's 1941 and we're practically all grown up and it's winter and we're wearing our harnesses with bells.</span> <span id="s1474">It's the summer of '41, it's our last picture with our father and we're in the park.</span> <span id="s1475">This is a professional photograph taken in Theresienstadt with our mom and it's the last picture we ever took with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">R: Just want to add that it's the only time I ever remember touching her, feeling what it really felt like, so this picture is very, very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: This was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">I: It's April 1950 and this is where René and I saw each other for the first time since the war.</span> <span id="s1479">It's our home in America and the front walk is where we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">03:32:39</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Conclusion of Interview Danuta Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945 (New
