Q: Esther, tell me about the role of in the ghetto.
EL: Especially for me well we went in the, into the ghetto at, at a period in my life where I was already an artist who has had many exhibitions. And my day, day to day work was painting or drawing. Of course the arrival of the Germans and all those terrible, terrible things that happened around me made me stop everything.
The Germans marched into Kovno on the 21st June 1941.
And uh the no one expected them because there was a non aggression pact between Russia and Germany but uh probably it never was meant seriously. What I heard from time to time being said.
And then when the German armies were disenchanted from invading England they threw the armies to the, the in Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 2 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W.

Lithuania has a border with Germany. So that we had the first, Latvia got them a few days later and Estonia still a few days later.

Q: So
EL: So you probably heard from other sources what happened in Lithuania, how everywhere there were terri- ble happenings that Jews were slaughtered by Lithuani- ans, even before the Germans came in. And when they came in rules against Jews went worse and worse every day. But you are interested in the ghetto.

EL: I was in Kovno. I was in Kovno where I went a year be, in, in 1939 I was in Belgium on a study tour.
Q: But what did you hear.
EL: When the war started the, the Lithuanians started to kill Jews in the provinces, in the, in the small, in the small towns. they accused the Jews of collaborating
with the Soviets.
Q: How did you hear about that. Or what did you see.
EL: I was, I was uh with a friend. We liked to be together and some Lithuanians came to arrest us and took us to the Kovno uh prison. And uh said that now they are going to reven, take revenge on the Jews who had a big hand in what was done to the Lithuanian people by the Communists. There were many communists and many among the Jews in the, Baltic states and they really collaborated with the, with the Lithuanians.
But uh I, I had friends communists, Lithuanian artists and intellectuals who said we had to choose between Germany or Russia. We couldn't survive the war without taking sides.

I even had a close friend uh uh a Lithuanian artist who was, who was very, very active in communist life. Her husband was a deputy in the same, this is their parlia- ment. And uh this people most of them managed to flee Lithuania to Russia. When the Germans came in but all the nationalists, among them painters and intellectuals and even Jews who were Zionists were imprisoned during the, during the Russian occupation of Lithuania. So that the whole country was divided, very, very much
divided.
But uh many Jews went on, went out from the city to reach the russian border to flee from the Germans but the Russians had uh had closed the border. So they came back. To find in many cases that their flats were taken by Germans or by others.
Anyway there was a decision that the after what hap- pened between the, the Jews and the Lithuanians, they would not tolerate that Jews would live in the city of Kovno. And uh part of Kovno that lay on the other side of the river Eleya was designated as a ghetto and all the Jews had to leave town by the 15th of August.
And I very much wanted to, to do some drawings of that exodus. but it was really dangerous to, to be in the streets. I, I could have taken a view from, from the mountain yes, but we, we were afraid to go out into the street. I thought maybe I would reconstruct it in my memory.

So uh we philosophized that the war would, would be over and we would never have to leave our homes. But of course everything happened. This is where i learned that the most terrible things that you, you, you think may will not happen, they really happen in the most
horrible form.
Uh I had the luck to be together with a neighbor with whom we became friendly during the time we had to, to be inside and uh we had to find living space uh.
Eight, eight meters to each, eight quadrant meters to each yes. So that in a room there should be 3 to 4 people yes. And I was lucky to be with friends. And in our apartment of 3 rooms, I think there were 15 people
or so.
The, my sister with her husband and child. They went to another place. I had an aunt yet here who lived and a cousin from the provinces who lived with her and I didn't room with them, I did room with my friends.
And uh the days in the ghetto started. We were en- croached there, we were closed up by, by barbed wire.
And there were seven entrances to the ghetto and during the first week we were completely isolated and then the Germans decided to lose, to use the working force of the, of the Jews yes.

EL: Yes the, the Germans demanded of the Jews to choose representatives and to follow council of elders, the Altestenrat. They choose the prominent lawyers and physicians and uh when it came to choose the, the chief representative, no one wanted the responsibility. So at last Dr. Elkis who was a, a famous physician in Kovno, very, very honored. He took the responsibility of being the head of the council of elders, the Altes- tenrat. He was a very proud tall person and he even he even knew how to talk with the Germans and the, and be respected. And uh I knew several of those people who were in the council of elders because I was a stranger in Kovno. Complete stranger. I came to visit my sister who had just had a baby, as I was in Europe. And it was summer and I, I was invited by uncles to, to be, to pass the summer in the, in the in the country so I was
uh around.
And uh but uh I had stayed a year in Kovno and I could- n't go back to Belgium as I had planned. And I had an exhibition of, of Is, Palestine pictures with me that I planned to exhibit in Belgium where my professor had promised to help me but as I was planned it in Kovno I dis, and I, I wanted to work so I got myself inscribed in the, in the local academy so I had models and I could go and uh and continue my, my work and I had an Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 8 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W.

And many of the Jews and the Jewish schools came to visit and these were my only contacts and it happened so that in the council of elders there were a few people that I knew from my
exhibition.
So, so I confided in them that I was deeply fascinated by from what i saw in the ghetto and I would like to, to draw some scenes, if they could help me. If, if they knew people from, from whose windows you saw things that really some of these people uh for in- stance, Dr. Rabinovich is, is responsible for the raid on the potato field. He, he saw it from his window at the, at the, at the house of the council of elders and I had asked him to tell me about it because I wanted to draw that scene. And it was very the house of the elders was very nearby where I lived and then he came and he said Esther we have uh we have a on the potato field just from my window. So I went with him, with my paper. I still had my materials and I did it in a few hours. And people were uh going, going around there, were milling around there and they saw me draw- ing. So somebody took the, took the drawing from me and went to show it in the during the conference of the council of elders and he brought it back to me and said that every, everybody was very much impressed and they asked me to go on with it.

And that the Germans had taken away all the, all the uh photographic equipment so that this was the only way to preserve some of the views. I accepted it of course because this is naturally what I did best, yes. It was not illustrations and it was not graphic work. It was what I did best, drawing from nature.
And I, I started to go to places and from time to time he called me to, to take my to places where by my own, by my own inshertive I couldn't have gotten because you needed a certain permit or places were closed out.
So the for instance the remains of the hospital. Uh the Germans burned it down with all the people in it because there were a few cases of typhus. So all the patients and all the doctors and all the nurses were burned down with the building.
And then after the ghetto was, uh was torn off from the, from the territory of the ghetto and a thousand Jews were marched off to the fort. The Germans told them that they had taken them to other working places but uh of course with time to believe. They believed because no one could, no one could understand that they took people and, and then just shot them in the hun- Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/ESTHER LURIE-SHAPIRO page 10 Interviewed (7-17-97) by Sandra W.

kilometers from us.
It was inconceivable because after all we lived in Europe. After all, after the world war. Germany was uh conceived by us as one of the most cultured countries.
We just couldn't believe it. yes, believed what the Germans told us, what we wanted to believe. And it went on through the, through the years and with, it goes on til today. Because it is inconceivable that such horrors are being, being done.
Q: When you went to the hospital....
EL: Yes, this was uh, uh as there were many abandoned houses. It was in winter and there was great shortage of uh firing wood. So the council of elders with Mr. Tory arranged for a permit to go and collect books and uh, and whatever could be burned in the abandoned houses. And they got the permit to go over the street, yes. It was just over the street, this was the bridge that was built yes. Over that street and that bridge stood on, on the, the stood there for two months and still I, I, I succeeded in drawing it yes.
If I had waited I couldn't have drawn the bridge yes.
And we came to the spot and he took me and he said Esther I want you to, to make a few drawings of the, of the burned hospital.

And a Lithuanian came over and said you stop it immedi- ately. So Tory heard him and he came over and uh and I stopped. But then when he went away I, I went up to a house and I found some place from where that I did two drawings and they are among the drawings reproduced
in my book.
And then there was the, another important thing. There was a, a room in the ghetto where.
Q: Tell me about drawing the bridge first.
EL: About drawing the bridge all right. Uh well I, I went around and asked people how can I get to draw the bridge. And at that time uh I did some volunteer work for uh by collecting clothes and, and, and food for, for the, for the orphanage. And there was a young man working there who received what we brought yes. And then I met him at the house of Dr. Rabinovich because his wife had told me that she had friends living near the bridge. And there I met that young man and he said all right I take you. And tomorrow he took me to one place and I, I drew it from both sides. Yes. He was the, was the man uh who lived there, who had grown up there so he knew everybody and then I, I made an agree- ment with him that every day he would come and fetch me and bring me to a place where I can draw.

Why not? Well uh all the Jews are ordered by the Germans to, to be on the, on the spot at a certain hour and uh this was one of the, the small aktion when they separated the small ghetto from the large ghetto and then a few days later the bridge was torn down.

EL: Yes, a very important movement in my creative work in the ghetto began when after Mr. Tory had talked to me and he introduced me to Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro who was in charge of the education of the, the art of the ghetto. They had schools there. That it was not allowed by the Germans but still they had them. And uh told, told me that Professor Shapiro will advise me as what is important for the archives and I should bring everything I am drawing to him. And he will see to it that it goes to safety. And uh for, for a few years I did it. It was a, I couldn't do much of it because I was organized to forced labor like everybody else but from time to time they give me some piece of paper that I was employed by the, by the inside, the services of the ghetto. And then I could go and draw every day.
And I, I went to the social services and to the gates.
All those drawings that they did near the gates and all those, all those things that uh uh that are connected with uh with types from the ghetto is what uh Professor Shapiro tried to tell me. We want people, yes, how they look. How they lived. This, this uh scene where old people stay in line to receive their, their soup at the social kitchen was one of them.

And then uh this scene at the, at the gate when people come back from work or go out to work.
This I did from uh from a window that was opposite the gate. Where the, where the police uh department was.
And uh they came from the council of elders to per, persuade the policeman to let me sit there. And they bring, and they were bringing me up all sorts of people from downstairs that I had a big collection of, of those types but they, they were lost with my with my collection that was lost. What, what is, what has remained is what uh Mr. tory has photographed at an exhibition that was arranged in the ghetto of the work that by the time I had managed to do. So he chose about 20, 20 to 25 uh pictures that uh were most uh characteristical and they are what, what, what I later uh reconstructed from the photographs he did from my
pictures.
Q: What about that house that you
EL: Yes, there was, there, there was a room where, where there was uh in the first in the first days of the ghetto there was a slaughter of, of a family.

Don't think of anything. Only think of making a good
drawing.
Q: What did you see

And there were, there were uh remains of blood and uh and uh remains of, of human tissue on the walls. But between them were pictures and uh arrangement of a nice room of a nice Jewish family.

There were no Jews left in the little towns. Not at all.
This was the revenge for the collaboration with the,
with the Soviets.
Q: And you drew the democracy square...

And uh these were mostly appreciated so they survived because they were photographed and that, that uh we up, up the mountain to the ninth fort. It was a most beautiful paysage, yes a most beautiful view. With big trees and uh you see it in the picture I did. of it.
And it had a, a specially in rainy days it had such an atmosphere that really appealed to me as what it was.

EL: I would like to tell you about the tragic fate that befell Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro, the man to whom I was delivering my, my works. When I had finished them and uh who saw to it that they came to a hiding place.
One uh one day they started to tell in the ghetto that the night before Germans had come to, to the flat where professor Shapiro lived with his old mother, his wife and his young son and took them all away. Professor Hy Nachman Shapiro was the son of the chief rabbi of Lithuania. Of whom I did a drawing at his request.
Rabbis don't want to be, to be drawn but his son wanted a drawing of me of his father. And it is in, he and uh it came out that the whole family was burned alive. And why was it. Because other sons of the rabbi who lived in the United States and in Switzerland had taken steps to the pope and to all the great of the world to take their family out of the ghetto. But to the Germans, a Jew was a Jew. And a Jew had no right to be treated differently from another Jew. So they burned the whole
family.

And the colored, the colored uh picture in the, in the album a Living Witness of the big blocks, he asked me to give to him. Because he lived in one of those apartments and i gave it to him. And uh of course I gave him the portrait of his father and they were salvaged because Mr. Tory took the archives of Profes- sor Shapiro and brought, brought part of it to Israel.
So the original of that uh water color is uh in Yad Vashem now. In the Yad Vashem museum.
Q: Tell me about drawing the Estonian deportation.
EL: When the, when the deportations began, I had a, a long period where I did, where i didn't work because Germans came to live in the ghetto. There, there was a, there was a period that they discovered that the Jewish committee was helping young people to go into the woods as partisans. So they dissolved the, the council of elders. And uh German officers came to live in the ghetto. Then somehow we, if, if I felt before it, it, it was somehow ours. Yes it, it was shameful.
It was there was hunger, there was uh desolation. We were shut in but somehow it was a corner that was ours.

But when I heard of the deportations I decided this I still have to do. And uh peace drawings remained in my hand after I had already, already put into the earth my, my collection. And then I got a message from uh from a Lithuanian painter, Veronica Shlebliter. Maybe I shouldn't say her name bcuase the, the they will ask her well wear are the pictures yes. And uh if I had something to, something I wanted to hide, she was ready to hide it for me and she hid it for me for more than 40 years. A nd after, after the peristroika, Jewish uh Jewish artists in Lithuania stated to collect what remained of Jewish artists from before the war and may exhibitions. And Veronica came with my pictures. Yes I learned from our press that my pictures were exhibited in a, in an exhibition in in Lithuania. And then they started to come in little by little. They brought them to . First I got, first I got the xerox copies and then I, I started to do the etchings and then I got the originals.

You think how you drew, how you compose it, how you, to make a good drawing. Doesn't, look I couldn't draw dur, during an aktion or doing something terribly that happened but after all the deportations, we knew that they were deported not to concentration camps. They were deported to other working places. The ghetto was split up in seven the, they they started to call it not, not the Kovno ghetto but the concentration, con- centraziones Slager Coahene. They head seven satel- lites and these people came with their packs and with there children. And this is what you see of my drawing yes. And the Aktion on children came later. And was, was executed everywhere, In all the, in all the places in the ghetto and in th the, in the satellite.
Uh camps yes. We all tried to hide our children and some, some of us succeeded. we succeeded in hiding our little boy my sister and me and took him in a rucksack.

We, we see now little boy who was five then when they,
when the ghetto was liquidated. I was taken to Stutthoff concen- tration camp and all those women who had little chil- dren they were after several days in Stutthoff they were sent to Auschwitz. But then when we were in Stuffhoff there was the, the assault on Hitler's life.
You remember in, in July 1944, from which he escaped
alive.
And then there, there was some optimism in the camps that perhaps they, they, won't kill us anymore. They will, they will want to shoot and there are Jews around and so we believe that we will survive. But we were sent to working camps, and we were sent back here and back there and shlepping here and shlepping there.
And, and we were working on fortifications and on trenches. They cut through all of Poland, yes, with trenches. They hoped that with tanks and with soldiers, they will, they will be able to win the war. They believed til the end, til Hitler's suicide they be- lieved that Germany would win the war.
I have the opportunity now as I speak German and French to see many historical films. Yes. And I, I hear many debates yes.

Q: Your, your drawing did you have a sense that it was a record, a historical record, as well as art
forms.
EL: Of course. I generally I draw more freely. But here I made a special effort to make it very realistic and i used all my academic training to make it as near to reality as possible, especially when I drew the bridge, I really went into the construction to, to draw it in a manner that if somebody wanted to construct a bridge in a model or something, he could use my drawing as, as a record.
I, I did my best you know in those circumstances you don't count any more. Yes. It's the whole that counts.

What you do is the only record we have. And uh as I had a, an academic training because uh I, I went to study in Belgium in a modern arts school that was, was founded by Juan develdha, who was one of the big German uh modern architects. He was already old and he was the director of the school and it was based on modern art.
I chose the theater but it didn't give me the training I hoped for, to learn. Drawing and painting. So at the same time everybody laughed at me yes. I went to the Antwerp Royal academy to the drawing classes where they were drawing for a whole week a statue of, of something yes and you had to go into every details, detail. And I stayed there for two years. And if I hadn't done it I could never have uh have done what I did in the ghetto. I wanted to know to draw like Leonardo DaVinci does. He was my ideal.
And uh at that time it was the time of the Bauhaus yes and at the time of everything. Burned the Louvre yes and they were laughing at me. But I once uh I visited a lot of exhibitions when I was in Belgium. I really had a very good time. My, my brother was living there.
I, I had planned to study art in Germany but then Hitler was already near his uh near his seat in, in German politics.

He was one f the Dada movement and when I was 13, 14 he did discover that I had a talent yes. I didn't know it myself because I couldn't like, like my friends all sorts of silly things yes.
And I started already to take lessons at the age of 14, 15. I was very much encouraged by my teacher and he even uh told my parents that I should leave school and then make a career of uh of art but my parents said first, first finish school, then we'll see.
Q: In the ghetto when you were drawing, what did other people in the ghetto think.
EL: They came around and they, they were very excited and they said how good you do it so and what can be done so that it is preserved so people will know how it was. This was their expression. Show them how it was.
Of course there were people that said that you are doing very dangerous things and then they, there is no, no hope for it to survive and leave it alone and I must really say and say it again that thanks to Avraham Tory, I, I, I held out. I had my encouragement. I had,

There was a, a man he was he was one of the workers at the, at the organization of Jewish labor. And so he was a collector and once he, he called me and he said that he had a plan. He wanted to create the album of the ghetto.
Here, where he wanted to include all the documents that came from the Germans and all the signs and all the uh whatever was printed in the ghetto. And uh to, to, to give them some artistic value, he wanted me to do portraits of all the people who, who had some important jobs. Were about 40 people that I didn't have to worry. He would, he would make the arrangements. He would bring the people to me and 40 portraits.
And then one day he calls me look it won't be 40. It will be twice 40 because I, I went to Mr. Tory. He, his name was Golub then. And uh I had to have his help because he knew all the arrangements in the, in the building and, and the people who were working there and I asked him for help so he said well I'm ready to help you on one condition. Everything you do you do double.
One for my archives and one for your archives. So he said all right (laughs) I'll do it. There, there were enough papers that, that were double and, and many fold yes but I said no, I won't make 80 portraits.

Some, some are mine and some are his. By the way he was from Czechoslovakia, he survived the war. And lived in Czechoslovakia, he was, I was told that he was the director of the Czech national museum.
And Tory even invited him on his account to come and visit Israel. But he was already after a heart attack and then he died. And we didn't know why he, why he doesn't answer, well, why he doesn't come but about a year ago, somebody calls me and says I am the nephew of Joseph Schlesinger, the Washington Museum found me because they were looking for uh Schlesinger had a sister who had emigrated to the United States and he lives in Canada. And he came here and he visited Tory and he visited me and we spoke a lot about Joseph, yes.
Pity that he died. I hoped to see him again.

Q: About the children.
EL: Yes, when you watch my pictures I did in the ghetto, so around all the houses there were fences.
During the years all the fences disappeared for, for, for wood. For firewood. And so any patch of vegetables stood open and who, whoever came by could, could take what he wanted. So children were posted as watch men.

And I asked the workers to make for me big containers. The size that I could put my pictures into them and bury them with a cover yes and they did it for me.
And even, yes, what I wanted to tell you, you are, you are talking about art in the ghetto. There was another artist who was a good friend of mine who had his exhi- bition at the artists', the artists' house in Kovno imm, immediately after me.

So you can, you can have your collection back. And I decided to take the, the jars. They were in a hiding place. I went there and I took them and I buried them in the back yard of my sister's flat. Yes. They were never found and I think that Lithuanians who uh turned the ghetto upside down for, uh for gold and jewels and they found whole, whole uh big uh jar with papers, that they, they got angry and threw it away or tore it, tore it up and they, and maybe it's still there.

There were many intell, intelligent people among them. But you know that on the, on the day of the children's action they arrested the whole Jewish police so it could not uh collaborate with uh with, with people in the ghetto in saving the children. And by the way they came to take the children when the, when the, when the people were out to work. So the people came back in the evening they didn't find the children.
You can imagine what crying and shouting and, and uh what a noise rose up in the ghetto when the, the people didn't find the children at home. And the Jewish police they took them to the ninth fort and they de- manded of them to disclose where there were hiding places for children. And those who went with them, there were a few, stayed alive and the others were shot. The bloom of youth. I knew many of them.
