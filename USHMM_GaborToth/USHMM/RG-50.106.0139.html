Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind, conducted by Gail Schwartz on February 21, 2001 in Bethesda, Maryland.</span> <span id="s4">This interview is part of the museum’s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum.</span> <span id="s5">This is a follow up interview that will focus on Helen Goldkind’s post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s6">In preparation for this interview, I read the detailed summaries of the interview you conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on January 9th, 1985 on audio, and the video United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview on January 16th, 1990.</span> <span id="s7">I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews.</span> <span id="s8">Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s9">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s10">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Answer: My name is Helen Goldkind.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Was Helen Lebowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Czechoslovakia in a small town by -- Volosyanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born in 1928, July the ninth.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: You’ve already gone in detail in your previous interview, so before we begin, I will summarize some o-of your experiences.</span> <span id="s19">You came from a large, religiously observant family, of which you were the sixth of seven children, and you had many extended relatives.</span> <span id="s20">When the Germans occupied the town in 1944, you and your family were forced into a ghetto and then after one or two months transported by cattle car to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s21">You and your sister Sylvia, who was three and a half years older than you were in Auschwitz for five weeks.</span> <span id="s22">And the other members there of your family did not survive.</span> <span id="s23">Then with a group of 1,000 girls, you and Sylvia were taken to Germany to work in an ammunition factory, being exposed to the burning gun powder.</span> <span id="s24">You were then transported to Bergen-Belsen where you were liberated by the British on April 15th, 1945.</span> <span id="s25">Before we continue, I’d like to clarify some things.</span> <span id="s26">How would you describe yourself as a child?</span> <span id="s27">This is, of course, before the war.</span> <span id="s28">Were you very independent, were you physically strong?</span> <span id="s29">How would you -- what would you say you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well, I think I was very strong and that probably saved my life when I got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Were you very independent?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, when you’re in a family of seven, you got to be independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you have a close relationship with your sister Sylvia before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">We were a close-knit family.</span> <span id="s36">I was very close to my whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s38">And with your parents, before conditions got worse, were they the kind of people that you could talk things over with?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s40">Now looking back on it, I think my parents were trying to hide many things from me, that things will get better.</span> <span id="s41">I mean, I remember when they were saying, honey, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s42">Things will get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: When Hitler came into power in 1933 and until the Germans occupied your -- your country, did your life change in any way?</span> <span id="s44">Preceding the time that the Germans occupied your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, Czechoslovakia became Hungaria in 1939.</span> <span id="s46">It had changed somewhat, but not to the extent what has happened in 19 f -- when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s47">Q: So life went on for you, relatively the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Not the same at all.</span> <span id="s49">Was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What -- what were some of the changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, I think the Jewish kids did not have the same opportunity going to school as the non-Jewish kids, where -- and I lived under the Czechs, my uncle was a Czech officer, and after we’ll be finished with this interview, I’ll show you a picture of him.</span> <span id="s52">So th-that -- that we lost.</span> <span id="s53">And we started sort of educating ourselves on our own.</span> <span id="s54">What happened was we were allowed to go to school, but we wal -- we had to sit in the back and we were never called on.</span> <span id="s55">So what my father did is he got a -- a teacher and we -- we s -- he -- he -- he was teaching us.</span> <span id="s56">And after awhile, the whole communities, you know, the Jewish kids came to our house.</span> <span id="s57">So when a -- I think back, I feel like our house became the school, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What was it like for you as a young person to experience anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s59">What did it mean to you as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, when you’re young you don’t understand a lot of things.</span> <span id="s61">Here you had friends today and tomorrow you lost them, and you wondered why.</span> <span id="s62">And that was very painful for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And did you talk this over with your -- your siblings or your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: We did.</span> <span id="s65">We constantly talked about it because we worried about it.</span> <span id="s66">But we were always living in hope that things will get better, but they didn't get better, they got worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did you know earlier that -- what was happening to the Jews in other countries, before the germ -- like all of this is before the German occupation of your town.</span> <span id="s68">Did you know what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, you know, we had a radio and that was taken away from us.</span> <span id="s70">So people, some people took a chance in keeping their radios, but you could have been punished for it.</span> <span id="s71">So we gave our radio away.</span> <span id="s72">But there was some people took the -- a chance on keeping it, so during the night they would be listening to the news.</span> <span id="s73">So the news would come through, but we -- we -- we couldn’t understand, we didn’t understand how severe the tragedy was.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you have any other interests?</span> <span id="s75">You were still young, but besides school, did you -- music or reading, anything th-that you did to occupy your time besides schoolwork?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Constantly reading.</span> <span id="s77">Matter of fact, I loved books and well, actually our house al-always was full of books.</span> <span id="s78">And I had a little brother, he was six years old, and he had a little book, they called it “All of Base,” it’s a ABC book and poor kid, he was carrying this book with him until he came to Auschwitz and they told him to throw this little book into a -- the -- the pit there.</span> <span id="s79">It was very difficult for him, he cried a lot about it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And when it was time for you to have to wear a yellow star, what were your feelings about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: My feelings were awful.</span> <span id="s82">I feared for every minute.</span> <span id="s83">At that time, no matter how my parents wanted to protect me, it just was right there in front of me.</span> <span id="s84">I could no longer -- I’ll -- I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s85">I -- my uncle gave me a quarter to go and get myself ice cream, to a place where I used to go and get this ice cream, it was a big treat for a child.</span> <span id="s86">And I got there -- at a certain time, we couldn’t walk out of the house, I believe it was between five and six.</span> <span id="s87">And I got there, they told me they cannot sell me the ice cream because I was a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s88">Came home crying and I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s89">So the pain was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So what do older relatives say to children your age to comfort them?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You -- wha-what did your relatives say to comfort you when these things happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: There was very little to comfort me because everything was staring in my face.</span> <span id="s94">How -- what could they say to me when a little kid comes home crying they didn't get a ice cream, even though I had my quarter.</span> <span id="s95">It was -- it was sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s97">Was the yellow star sewn on your coat, or pinned?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s99">No, on my arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: It -- it was an armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: An armband, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: While you were in the camps, you had said that your sister kept you going.</span> <span id="s103">Where do you think she got her strength from?</span> <span id="s104">What do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Well, when we parted in Auschwitz, I don’t know if I should mention Auschwitz, how we parted.</span> <span id="s106">Can I an --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, when we got to Auschwitz, we came with the whole family and my -- you know, my parents -- but the two older brothers were taken away already for work, to s-s -- t -- t-to the Russian front where they were picking mines.</span> <span id="s109">And my father, and I had an older sister, and she took care of my grandmother, and my grandfather came and my little brother and my mother and my sister that survived.</span> <span id="s110">In Auschwitz they pushed my mother with my sister because she looked fairly young, but they pulled my little brother out of her hand.</span> <span id="s111">So my mother heard him cry, so she ran back to him and pleaded with the Germans to -- to let her go with my little brother and they beat her up, and after she was bleeding, and they kicked her into the left lane.</span> <span id="s112">And she was screaming, please tell the world what is happening to us, if you survive.</span> <span id="s113">Try to survive.</span> <span id="s114">Actually her words were like that, try to survive, and if you do, tell the world what happened here.</span> <span id="s115">And of course, you know, my grandfather also had a terrible experience there.</span> <span id="s116">I don’t know if I can go on talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Can I talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Whatever you wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s121">Well, my grandfather came -- well, they took him from home.</span> <span id="s122">He -- he had the Torah scroll with him, because when they closed our synagogues, he managed to take out a Torah scroll.</span> <span id="s123">So our house became a school and I think his house became a house of worship.</span> <span id="s124">And when they told us we have to leave the house, he took the Torah scroll with him.</span> <span id="s125">And when we got to Auschwitz, he came down from the train with this Torah scroll and they made -- they -- they told him to -- to throw the Torah scroll into the ditch and he wouldn’t do that, so you know, he -- they were beating on him and we ran over to him and pleaded with him, please, please throw the Torah scroll down and he just wouldn’t do it and they kept on beating on him and then th -- they really -- you know, they beat him to death and right in front of us he fell with the Torah scrolls, and -- so we saw this tragedy right in front of us, and I think in -- that’s what f -- then they took my grandfather and they threw him in a truck.</span> <span id="s126">And I think she kept that in mind all the time, that she needs -- she has a need to tell this to someone.</span> <span id="s127">And that -- I think that -- that made her stronger, to say I have to survive to tell it to someone what happened, because I don’t think they’ll believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Were there any other examples of women helping other women in the camp while you were there?</span> <span id="s129">Can you -- do you know of any other situations?</span> <span id="s130">Your sister, of course, helped you.</span> <span id="s131">Did you see that relationship between any other women, or other women to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, you must understand, when people are put in a situation where survival is the only thing, so it was very difficult to help each other because we were all in the same boat, with the same thing.</span> <span id="s133">But we -- we did try.</span> <span id="s134">You know, if we saw somebody fainted we were there for them, of course.</span> <span id="s135">But there was nothing we really can do to help them, they probably, you know, they were fainting out of hunger or -- or weakness.</span> <span id="s136">And it was -- it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s137">It wasn’t that one had more than the other to be able to help each other, it wasn’t like that.</span> <span id="s138">When my sister tried keeping me alive when I was giving up, she just gave away her little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s139">You know, she like bribed me, sort of, to -- to want to -- to want to surv -- you know, that I should survive.</span> <span id="s140">But I -- I -- I think what happened to me, I emotionally did not want to do it any more.</span> <span id="s141">And a -- and a -- of course, I was very weak because I had to work so hard in the munition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s143">When you were in -- in the camps, did you talk about what was going on with the other women, outside of your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: We saw it.</span> <span id="s145">We were right there with them, we were in one barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: But I meant, did you exchange feelings with each other, the other women?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I think everybody was just numb, and everybody -- everybody just didn’t understand what is happening because we -- we weren’t treated as human beings any more.</span> <span id="s148">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were you with women from your town, or were you with women from other town -- towns and villages when you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: When I was in Auschwitz, the time when I was in Auschwitz, I was there with a lady and my next door neighbor and her daughter.</span> <span id="s151">And I don’t remember, somebody else there.</span> <span id="s152">But then when they took us to work they took them someplace else and they took me and my sister someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What -- what was the -- or -- the name of the munitions factory?</span> <span id="s154">Do you know where -- where in Germany it was, or what the name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I really don’t.</span> <span id="s156">I should really find out because it’ll -- probably I have to -- I -- I -- I -- I’ve -- I’m going to try to find out where it was, but I don’t think it was far from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s157">It wasn’t far from Bergen-Belsen, but I don’t reme -- I-I just don’t know, you know.</span> <span id="s158">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Now, you were almost 17 years old when you were liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s160">Did you know what those tanks meant when you saw them at the time of -- the British tanks?</span> <span id="s161">What -- what did it mean to you to see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well -- well let me tell you first what position we were in.</span> <span id="s163">We -- we were full of life, we were thrown in with other people that were half dead, and i -- I was burned up from the m -- from -- from the spring stuff.</span> <span id="s164">From the gunpowder, or whatever, I -- I remember it was yellow and very hot and while I was filling these bombs, you know, of course some of it went on top of me.</span> <span id="s165">So we were really like half dead.</span> <span id="s166">But my sister, you know, she noticed them first.</span> <span id="s167">And I sa -- you know, so she tells me, you know, there are some tanks out there and they don’t look like they’re German tanks.</span> <span id="s168">So I said to her, you know, maybe this is the end and things will be better.</span> <span id="s169">So she says, it’ll be probably be better for the world, but for us it’s too late.</span> <span id="s170">So when the Germans came, we really didn’t have the strength to be happy and --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: When the British came, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: When the British came, that my -- yeah.</span> <span id="s173">They came a little bit too late for m -- actually for a lot of people.</span> <span id="s174">My -- when they came my sister was already sick in that room, I remember she was delirious.</span> <span id="s175">And then the British opened up the barracks, and when they looked into the barracks, it was terrible because they wouldn’t let us out to the bathrooms.</span> <span id="s176">Everybody was doing everything they needed at -- in the barracks and a l -- a lot of them were very sick.</span> <span id="s177">It just -- they opened -- they probably thought it was worse -- it was -- really was worse than a crazy house.</span> <span id="s178">So they were asking us what they can do for us, and they tried very hard to help us, but as I said, it was a little too late.</span> <span id="s179">They took my sister and I didn’t know where sh -- they took her.</span> <span id="s180">So she didn’t return a few days, I went out to look for her because at that ti -- after the English came in they posted names who died in Bergen-Belsen and I couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s181">But the sight I’ve seen in Bergen-Belsen I still have nightmares about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: These big mountains of -- of corpse and everything.</span> <span id="s184">Anyway, I couldn’t find my sister’s name, but in the meantime I fell somewheres there on the street.</span> <span id="s185">I -- I don’t remember how they picked me up and how I got to the hospital.</span> <span id="s186">They took me to the hospital but I don’t remember nothing of that.</span> <span id="s187">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What languages did you speak then?</span> <span id="s189">What -- what did you understand?</span> <span id="s190">Did you understand German at that point, or English?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, we spoke -- we spoke j -- Yiddish and Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: So when the British came, you did not understand them.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, I -- we didn't.</span> <span id="s194">No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s195">But -- but you know, you could see that they wanted to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: How could you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Oh, because they acted different than the Nazis did.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: They acted like human beings, where the Nazis acted like they were monsters, in every which way.</span> <span id="s200">In every which way.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you, at the -- at that point think about going back to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Not when I got sick, when -- I-I was in Bergen-Belsen for a few weeks in the hospital because I got typhoid, it’s a high fever, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What was your physical condition at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s205">It wa -- you know, I -- best to describe me as I looked like a skeleton with a heartbeat.</span> <span id="s206">I mean, in a short -- it was awful the way I looked like.</span> <span id="s207">You know, I weighed -- I don’t even know how much I weigh -- I -- I was like a skeleton taken out of the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Di-Did you know what you looked like?</span> <span id="s209">Could -- did you ever see yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Of course, I-I was so weak, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t eat, I mi -- I mean I couldn’t eat, and I was sick, you know, I got sick.</span> <span id="s211">Got sick.</span> <span id="s212">I don’t even remember how I got to the hospital, I just fell there fro -- on the street and what happened was the ambulances were going around the s -- these s -- the street -- on the streets and whoever, yet whoever’s heart was beating, even though they looked like they are dead, they were picking them up and trying to save them.</span> <span id="s213">And so I wound up in the hospital and I-I just -- after many, many weeks -- I remember asking for my sister, not for my family, because I -- I was just heartbroken that she was tr -- you know, she didn’t want to s -- she would tell me that I have to survive because she doesn’t want to stay -- be alone.</span> <span id="s214">And after all that, I found myself alone.</span> <span id="s215">So I was crying all the time and they asked me why -- you know, I’m crying.</span> <span id="s216">I says, I had a sister and she died here and I wa -- in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s217">So they really put an effort in to look whether she’s dead or she’s someplace.</span> <span id="s218">And you know, they found her in another hospital.</span> <span id="s219">They had these makeshift hospitals and she was very weak and I was very weak and sick, but they put us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: What was that like to -- to get together with her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: It was like giving someone life, because I again didn’t think [indecipherable] surviving.</span> <span id="s222">You know, even though I was liberated, I still -- because I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s223">I -- I didn't want to believe it too much, but we knew already what happened, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: You were saying that your sister Sylvia had said that you, Helen, had to stay alive because she didn’t want to be alone.</span> <span id="s225">Can you talk a little more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, one day I just didn't want to go out to the c’est l’appel because I just didn’t have the strength and it was cold.</span> <span id="s227">So I was laying there and she saw not getting up, she lifted me up and she started shaking me.</span> <span id="s228">So I thought that she went crazy or something.</span> <span id="s229">And she says, you know, you’re not going to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s230">And because she knew by the time she would come back, I -- they would do away with me.</span> <span id="s231">And I got up and I went to the c’est l’appel and she was trying to hold onto me so I shouldn’t collapse out there and dragged me to work and then she came to help me out.</span> <span id="s232">She was running back and forth and I didn't think she’ll survive, you know, to help me a little bit, hard job.</span> <span id="s233">And that’s how it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Before the war, did you -- di-did she exhibit these -- this strength that she had during the war, in any way?</span> <span id="s235">Were there any situations pre-war that she showed how strong she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Ye -- I think she -- she -- she did show some strength, but I really don’t think that that would have kept her alive.</span> <span id="s237">I think it’s the idea of what she saw and the message from my mother, I think that kept her alive.</span> <span id="s238">I -- I really think so, cause I saw stronger people and just not the su -- not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s240">So when you and she were together, did you talk about going back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: In the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: We didn’t know what we want to do.</span> <span id="s244">But what happened was the Swedish Red Cross agreed on taking in the very sick ones to Sweden and we were lucky and we were picked because we were very sick.</span> <span id="s245">And then when we got to Sweden, I -- there was another shocker, for me anyway, because I think I almost lost my o -- belief in humanity.</span> <span id="s246">And when they took over, I -- again, I hate to repeat myself, I looked like -- I still looked like a skeleton because I was so sick, and they nurtured me, they bathed me, they fed me, I had no strength to eat.</span> <span id="s247">And I was looking at them that maybe they’re not on this earth, they -- they -- that they -- they just came from heaven or something.</span> <span id="s248">It’s hard to describe.</span> <span id="s249">It is very hard to describe my feeling when I got to Sweden.</span> <span id="s250">I -- every time, every day I get up, I bless them, cause you know, I -- I think that if I would have to take care of myself and I would have a normal life, I wouldn’t want to take of me, because the way I looked.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: When -- before you left for Sweden, had you and your sister ever talked about going to Palestine?</span> <span id="s252">Did -- was that something important to you or your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, the f -- the things that I remember in Europe, they had the chalutzim, they called these kids chalutzim, but don’t forget, we were -- I-I was next to the youngest, which was six years old and then she was, so my father was trying to get the older ones to i -- to Israel, but i-i-i -- you know, it was closed.</span> <span id="s254">Y-You had to wait for a quota, you know.</span> <span id="s255">Ou-Ou-Our -- our life was like, you know, they -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s256">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s257">Even we knew the horrible things, but there was nothing to do and no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Had your parents, pre-war, been strong Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes, they have.</span> <span id="s260">Even though they were religious, but they have, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s261">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: So, let’s talk a little bit about Sweden now.</span> <span id="s263">So there you are with your sister.</span> <span id="s264">Are you with anybody else that you knew, pre-war or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yeah, it was so funny.</span> <span id="s266">I was in Sweden -- wi -- the [indecipherable] I-I -- when I was in be -- I have to backtrack a little.</span> <span id="s267">When I was in Bergen-Belsen looking for my -- for my sister, I saw a man that was pulled by the ankles, because they thought he was dead.</span> <span id="s268">And I took a look at him and I -- it looked like my cousin, and I was yelling to him, Freddie, Freddie and he opened up his eyes.</span> <span id="s269">But of course then I collapsed, I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s270">So when I saw my sister, I says, you know, I -- Freddie is alive and he -- he -- I saw him Bergen-Belsen, they were pulling him on that mountain with the dead.</span> <span id="s271">She says, oh, you were sick, you don’t know what you’re talking about.</span> <span id="s272">So at this point I really don’t know whether it was Freddie or it wasn’t Freddie.</span> <span id="s273">He was the one that was very sick and they took him to Sweden too, and we met him there in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: What -- what was it like to see another member of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh, you -- you wouldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s276">His name was Milbauer and our name was Lebowitz.</span> <span id="s277">So when we met him, we were so scared that we’re going to be separated again that he says, I’m going to become Lebowitz and they’re not going to separate me.</span> <span id="s278">So what happened was he became Lebowitz, he says he is Lebowitz and we were there together as Lebowitz’s.</span> <span id="s279">But then my sister found me in the papers in -- in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s280">They took our names and they asked us whether we have anybody out of Europe and I knew I had a sister.</span> <span id="s281">So, she found us in the papers, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: When had this -- what was your sister’s name in Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: My sister’s name in Brooklyn, Arler.</span> <span id="s284">But wi -- she was mar --</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Her first -- her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: First name was Frances.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And -- and when did Frances leave to go to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Just before the war in 1938.</span> <span id="s289">I had an uncle there and we were begging to be, you know, taken out, but he didn’t want to -- you know, he couldn’t take out nine people, because it was -- you know, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s290">So he took my sister out.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind.</span> <span id="s293">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about how your sister was in Brooklyn, and you and your -- and you and your sister Sylvia was in -- were in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Right.</span> <span id="s295">So then she sent us affidavits.</span> <span id="s296">Now here is the problem with my cousin, bec -- he -- he was Lebowitz and he had a -- a -- a aunt in -- i -- also in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s297">So her name was Milbauer.</span> <span id="s298">So there was a big problem because he had to change his name in Sweden to Milbauer in order for them to send an affidavit.</span> <span id="s299">So he remained in Sweden for awhile, and then that aunt of his sent him an affidavit and he came out to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: When you were in Sweden, and you were with other survivors who were being taken care of the way you were being taken care of, did you and they talk about what your wartime experiences were?</span> <span id="s301">Did you share with others what you and your family had gone through while you -- during the war, while you were in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Actually no, because -- I didn’t talk about it for a long time.</span> <span id="s303">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s304">It was very, very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s305">And then when we were in Sweden a-after we were in that sanitarium, I -- we felt better, of course.</span> <span id="s306">They fed us and they made u -- you know, they gave us dark beer, I remember.</span> <span id="s307">A -- you know, just to gain some weight.</span> <span id="s308">And then we got s -- I got separated from my sister and I wasn’t so happy about it, but they were explaining me and reassuring me that I was -- they says I was under-aged and I have to go to a school, and my sister went to work.</span> <span id="s309">But they treated her very nice.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, they paid her for her work, and -- and life was very good in is -- in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So di -- di -- you did not live with her once you got out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No.</span> <span id="s313">I was in Fielgarden and she was in Göteborg.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And how did you stay in contact with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh, we -- we could -- you know, we could write to each other.</span> <span id="s316">We had our i -- we lived normal, you know, it was a normal life, you know, to each other.</span> <span id="s317">And she knew where I was and I knew where she was and --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Was it hard to be away from her after all you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Very.</span> <span id="s320">Very.</span> <span id="s321">But you know what happened to us, all the girls?</span> <span id="s322">I mean, all these girls that I was with in school, I don’t remember how many we were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: This is school in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Right.</span> <span id="s325">In Fielgarden.</span> <span id="s326">And we became like sisters, and we -- you know, everybody lost everything, so we would say to each other, you know, we’re going to be sisters now.</span> <span id="s327">And we did things together and we were -- I think we were ev -- trying to be even closer than sisters, you know.</span> <span id="s328">So it was wonderful, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s329">Our teachers were great.</span> <span id="s330">They -- they tried being like our parents, more or less, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did you live in a dormitory or in people’s homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, I lived in a dormitory, yeah.</span> <span id="s333">But we were maybe seven, eight kids in a dormitory, but -- but there were -- you know, there -- more -- there were a lot -- a lot of kids.</span> <span id="s334">It was like a house and it had these different rooms, yeah.</span> <span id="s335">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And -- and what did you -- did you study Swedish, or English?</span> <span id="s337">What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I studied English and Hebrew, and everything else, math and all these other things that ne -- you know, that I missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Who were the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: The teachers were also survivors and they were teachers before, and they volunteered to do that.</span> <span id="s341">Of course they were taken care of, they g -- you know, they had shelter and food.</span> <span id="s342">They gave us -- you know, they fed us very nicely and it was a beautiful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did they teach you Swedish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s345">We tried talking Swedish sort of, but i-i-it -- it -- it wasn’t -- I think they had other plans for us.</span> <span id="s346">I don’t know if the Swedish at that time took us in to be their citizens.</span> <span id="s347">I think they took us in there to take care of us, but I don’t even remember or I don’t even know what the deal was with them.</span> <span id="s348">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Now, at that time, did you and your sister talk about going back to your town at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Sa -- some people did try to tell us that it would be nice if we would come back.</span> <span id="s351">But we -- we really felt in our hearts that we have no place there.</span> <span id="s352">We had no place there.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And what made you think that?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Well, all that that we had to go through from 1939 til -- to -- until the Germans came.</span> <span id="s355">I mean, it wasn't just the Germans, it was how our life changed even before the Germans.</span> <span id="s356">See, Czechoslovakia was sort of a -- tried to be a democracy in Europe.</span> <span id="s357">But the rest of the countries were -- you know, everybody made their own rules and their own laws, especially in the war.</span> <span id="s358">It wa -- you know, we knew we -- we -- we were pointed out as Jews, that we are not wanted there, but we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s359">The world was closed for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you feel Czech at that time, or Jewish?</span> <span id="s361">How would you have described yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Well, I was very small in 30 -- how old was I in ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: 11.</span> <span id="s365">Well, I knew that I’m Jewish because I -- I -- I -- you know, as I said, that we had -- we -- we -- we were religious.</span> <span id="s366">But I loved being where I was, in the position I was in, because I had a big family, I had my own support system, and I -- I -- I -- we didn’t experience the anti-Semitism that much, because a Jewish child could, if -- if he was really smart, he could reach to be educated.</span> <span id="s367">But later on it was closed completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s369">So you -- you felt Czech also, besides being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s371">If anything I -- I wanted to be Czech and nobody else -- I mean, I -- I was Jewish and I always feel like I want to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s372">But the Czech, yes, but not the rest of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s374">And then when I -- it became a part of Hungary, did you feel any Hungarian connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: We -- not -- it’s hard for me to explain because I was a child and I was trying not to be -- I mean, y-y-you know, in a child you sort of try to see the bright side of it, see?</span> <span id="s376">But you know, I couldn’t help feeling that I was not accepted.</span> <span id="s377">The only thing I think that really saved me is because, you know, my large family, as a child.</span> <span id="s378">I didn’t feel -- I didn’t need the outside to accept me and love me because my own family did that for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: How long were you in Sweden, you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I was there over a year, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And then you said your -- your aunt tried to arrange for you to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: My s -- my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: I’m sorry, your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: My sister.</span> <span id="s385">And then it took no time, I think we were the first ones from the survivors to come out here to the United States.</span> <span id="s386">I think it took her maybe four or five, a half a year maybe, and we were here after she contacted the Red Cross in -- in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Well, I had a big problem again, you know, I didn’t want to leave my sisters there, you know, because I already connected with them.</span> <span id="s389">And I thought I’m going to spend my life with them, they’re gir -- my family.</span> <span id="s390">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Oh, these are the other survive -- when you say sisters you mean there this --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: The other survivors -- children.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: -- the other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Although I knew -- I remembered her, that she’s my real sister, you know, here in the United States, Frances was my real sister.</span> <span id="s395">But believe me, if I would be given a choice, I think at that time I would have rather just stay with my family, the m -- with my friends.</span> <span id="s396">Because, I says, whatever will happen to them, it’ll happen to me, because I no longer had a home and I didn't know what -- where I am, where I’m going to be.</span> <span id="s397">And it felt comfortable to be with these girls.</span> <span id="s398">But of course, you know, my sister says, look, she is our sister and she wants us out there, and we have to go, and we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So how di -- what was it like to say goodbye to these friends, these sister friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s401">I tell you, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s402">I tell you it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s403">We kept on promising each other we’ll -- let’s be in touch, we want to know about each other.</span> <span id="s404">And I was in touch with many of them, and then, you know, after years go by, you lose touch, and you see a different world.</span> <span id="s405">You see that they were your friends, and -- you know?</span> <span id="s406">And we came va -- when I came out here I-I had a terrible -- both of us, I think we had little breakdowns.</span> <span id="s407">Because you know, when I saw a man with a beard, I would say, is he -- you know, I s -- how come he wasn’t destro -- you know, it was -- e -- if I her -- if I heard a kid cry, I thought he’s being destroyed, not that he’s unhappy.</span> <span id="s408">I had a difficult time.</span> <span id="s409">I had such a difficult time when I came out here, you can -- you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s410">The -- what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s411">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s412">It was very difficult for both of us, even though, you know, to be with my sister, but was difficult.</span> <span id="s413">Then reality set in, you see?</span> <span id="s414">While you’re on the road, you sort of survive every day.</span> <span id="s415">But when you knew this was your last place that you’re going to, it’s -- reality set in and we realized we lost everybody and everything, I think this is when we s -- really started mourning, to tell you the truth, when we got here.</span> <span id="s416">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: When you were -- so you ca -- how did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: We -- well, as I said, my sister sent us the papers, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yeah -- no, did you come by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s421">With th -- I think it was the United States.</span> <span id="s422">I forgot the name of the boat -- with a boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: And -- and when -- when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Was it 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I don’t even remember, I co -- have to look it up.</span> <span id="s427">I don’t remember whether it was ’46 or not [indecipherable] in between.</span> <span id="s428">Do you want me to --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: No, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s430">And so you -- you c-came by boat and you landed where?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: In Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s432">Na -- na -- in broo -- you know, I di -- we saw the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s433">It wasn’t Brooklyn, it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Ellis Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s436">Ellis Island, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Had you seen pictures of the Statue of Liberty before?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you know what it represented?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, I was told on the boat, I was told.</span> <span id="s441">I was told on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Was the boat filled with survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s444">I do -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s445">Because we came from Sweden and there weren’t that many survivors in Sweden.</span> <span id="s446">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s447">No, they weren't all survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: And so then you -- you got to -- you landed.</span> <span id="s449">What was like to -- to put your foot down on American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: A miracle, to ex -- describe it, really.</span> <span id="s451">A miracle, because i-it took me, at that time -- when I got to the United States it looked like it’s the world.</span> <span id="s452">And when I was in Europe, I -- I thought I’m in hell.</span> <span id="s453">That’s how I compared it.</span> <span id="s454">I don’t know how else to describe it.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s456">But I was just thinking, I don’t think hell could be that bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s458">Hm.</span> <span id="s459">Who -- and your sister met you at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, she met us at the boat.</span> <span id="s461">She had two kids, beautiful, beautiful, two boys and -- but you know, she wasn’t a wealthy woman, so she took us in to her apartment, she had a one bedroom apartment, walking up three flights.</span> <span id="s462">But she was so happy to have us there and we were so happy to be there together.</span> <span id="s463">I remember we slept in the living room on a bed that closed up, you know, because she couldn’t keep it open, then the kids wouldn’t have where to play.</span> <span id="s464">But it was very nice.</span> <span id="s465">I mean, you know, she was just wonderful, she was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s466">And, you know, I wanted to go to school but I saw that I had to go and provide for myself.</span> <span id="s467">You know, you couldn’t help seeing it.</span> <span id="s468">So, I went to school at night and I went to look -- actually, I think what really saved me from not mourning there forever is because I knew I have to get out and get a job.</span> <span id="s469">And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn’t trained for anything, and I -- I -- although I-I-I was learning how to speak English for n -- for close to a year, but still -- I understood most of it but I couldn’t speak it too well.</span> <span id="s470">So there are so many drawbacks for me to get a job.</span> <span id="s471">Well, it took me about two, three weeks going every day.</span> <span id="s472">My brother-in-law, he would take me and paid for my carfare, for my token because I had no money.</span> <span id="s473">And I was going around and he helped me, he came with me at times, and they were telling me they would love to hire me, but I’m not trained for anything.</span> <span id="s474">And of course, you know, when I came from Sweden I didn’t have money to buy clothes, so I was walking around with this big -- these big sweaters and these heavy pants.</span> <span id="s475">You know, I didn’t really look that presentable, either.</span> <span id="s476">So one day I -- there was a big place, a fur place, and my brother-in-law took me up there to ask for a job and I went over to the boss and I asked for a job and he looked at me, and I told him my problem and he was very sympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I would, but I don’t know where to put you because you do -- y-you don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s477">I mean you -- where -- wa -- how -- I says, I’m going to do anything you want me to do, just -- just please give me a job.</span> <span id="s478">He looked around and sadly said, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s479">So, I wanted to see how this factory looks like because I heard so much about it and how it works and all that.</span> <span id="s480">So from the office I sneaked into the factory.</span> <span id="s481">I opened the door and I see that’s the factory.</span> <span id="s482">So I walk in there just to see the factory and while I was passing, I saw there an old man standing and he had a beard and he wasn’t working, he was just standing, looking around.</span> <span id="s483">And I said to mys -- you know, in my -- my grandfather came in front of me, he had a black hat like my grandfather ha-had, but he was a little shorter than my grandfather, my grandfather was very tall.</span> <span id="s484">So I walked over to him and I -- I felt that I can speak Yiddish to him and I did.</span> <span id="s485">And I told him my story.</span> <span id="s486">I-I says, you know, y -- I don’t know if you know the tragedy on what has happened to the Jews in Europe, but I survived with my sister and I came out here, and I have a sister, but I -- I can see she cannot feed me or take care of me, I’m forced to get a job and I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s487">And the man listened and listened and listened.</span> <span id="s488">And then he says to me, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s489">So I said to myself, why not?</span> <span id="s490">I’ll wait.</span> <span id="s491">I have no place to go and no -- nothing to do.</span> <span id="s492">I’ll wait at -- and a -- I -- I -- I was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told me that he doesn’t have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint.</span> <span id="s493">And he was standing there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to him.</span> <span id="s494">And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow.</span> <span id="s495">I says, tomorrow?</span> <span id="s496">What time?</span> <span id="s497">He said nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s498">When I came back, I stayed near the door, eight o’clock I was already there waiting the door -- for the door to be opened.</span> <span id="s499">And finally I went in there, into the office.</span> <span id="s500">Shall I continue?</span> <span id="s501">A -- so anyway, I went to the office, they took one look at me and as I said, I didn’t look so presentable.</span> <span id="s502">It was a problem.</span> <span id="s503">And he must have promised his father, that was the son of this old man, he was the boss and I didn’t know at that time.</span> <span id="s504">So this man wouldn’t leave the son until he would promise him he’ll give me some kind of a job.</span> <span id="s505">So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big place and they had their own designers and were so many secretaries in this office.</span> <span id="s506">So the de -- I don’t know, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever.</span> <span id="s507">She takes one look at me and she says to me, you never go shopping.</span> <span id="s508">I s -- wi -- I said to her, you know, there is a problem, I don’t have no money.</span> <span id="s509">She takes another look at me, she says, well don’t worry about it, we’ll -- we’ll bill it to the -- to the company.</span> <span id="s510">So I had no choice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do.</span> <span id="s511">She knew exactly what to do with me.</span> <span id="s512">She -- she took me in.</span> <span id="s513">I remember they were smaller stores.</span> <span id="s514">Now that I know there’s -- was Macy’s and everything, but she didn’t want to waste time.</span> <span id="s515">So she took me into these smaller stores and took out different dresses.</span> <span id="s516">And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all, I -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s517">Sh -- so she got me a little bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life.</span> <span id="s518">And she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch and a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these dresses.</span> <span id="s519">I says, you know, they’re so expensive, I -- you know, and I don’t have any money.</span> <span id="s520">She says, don’t worry about it, just put it on.</span> <span id="s521">So I put it on and I tell you, I looked like a different person.</span> <span id="s522">You know, I just looked like a different person.</span> <span id="s523">Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know.</span> <span id="s524">She took my hair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me.</span> <span id="s525">And she bought a lot of clothes that I wasn’t paying much attention because it was scaring me.</span> <span id="s526">And we went back and we got into the office and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I must say.</span> <span id="s527">And so the boss came in and he took a look in the office because he was in the main place, you know, watching the workers.</span> <span id="s528">And I saw him looked at -- looking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl?</span> <span id="s529">So, anyway, then they gave me a job.</span> <span id="s530">They had a v -- like a [indecipherable] house, where very rich ladies came in to pick out skins for their coats.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t realize how rich these women were at that time.</span> <span id="s532">And they were training me on what to say to them and how to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and then I-I didn’t mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch.</span> <span id="s533">I would -- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and I was trying my best they should keep me there.</span> <span id="s534">And after awhile -- after awhile they saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too.</span> <span id="s535">You know, they paid me, they paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they needed, or -- they could do with me.</span> <span id="s536">And then had models when -- whenever a buyer would come from a different city, they would call a -- a model, or a few models, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big place.</span> <span id="s537">So one time I became lucky and a model didn’t show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well, why don’t we call in Helen?</span> <span id="s538">So they called Helen in and I came there and they said to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk.</span> <span id="s539">You know, on a walk.</span> <span id="s540">I put on the coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you.</span> <span id="s541">A-Anyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk.</span> <span id="s542">I smiled at him and I took another walk.</span> <span id="s543">And it went well, you know, it went well.</span> <span id="s544">So finally that lady said to the boss, let’s send her to modeling school.</span> <span id="s545">So -- so they send me to modeling school for a few hours, but I still had to come into work to get my paycheck.</span> <span id="s546">After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen -- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously.</span> <span id="s547">You know, how many times do you need to be told what to do?</span> <span id="s548">So I walked over to her, I says, listen, I don’t mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything already what to do.</span> <span id="s549">And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job because then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be there?</span> <span id="s550">Somebody tipped me off that a -- a buyer was asking about me, then I felt already secure with the job.</span> <span id="s551">Then I felt so happy.</span> <span id="s552">I was so happy, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s553">Anyway, I wound up with a beautiful job and people were very nice to me and they paid me a lot, I thought at that time, they paid me a lot.</span> <span id="s554">I think I was getting 75 dollar a -- a week.</span> <span id="s555">You see, and what happened was, they paid these models by the hour.</span> <span id="s556">And here I’m willing to anything they want me to do for 75 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s557">But they paid me overtime if would come in on Saturday.</span> <span id="s558">And I ju --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: What -- what -- what was the name of the firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Modenstein and company.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Modenstein and company.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Now did you continue to live with Frances?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yeah, I continued to live with Frances.</span> <span id="s567">I paid for my room and board becau -- you know, I paid f -- and then on the weekends, you know, we helped her wash clothes and clean the place and --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What kind of work was your sister doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: My sister w-was working by fur, too, but she had another job, yes, because my brother-in-law was a furrier.</span> <span id="s570">That’s where -- how we went into that field, t-to -- to -- to -- to that.</span> <span id="s571">I think I was very lucky when I came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: When you -- di-did you feel different than other people because of your history?</span> <span id="s573">Did you feel other Americans accepted you?</span> <span id="s574">I -- I’m talking outside of the office.</span> <span id="s575">Or did you not have much contact with them at this time?</span> <span id="s576">Did you f -- in other words, did you feel very different than other Americans on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: When I first came over, of course I felt different.</span> <span id="s578">Of course I felt different, much different.</span> <span id="s579">When I started working and I saw how the people were really nice to me, I think it’s because they realized where I came from, what I went through.</span> <span id="s580">And I don’t know if I should tell that.</span> <span id="s581">I felt th -- maybe because, you know, where I came from that rejection was difficult for me.</span> <span id="s582">There were two nephews, you know, young boys that worked in that place, the bosses, and they felt like they were big shots.</span> <span id="s583">And even though I had a beautiful job, you know, one was pretty nice to me, and the other one, for a reason or another, he was constantly bugging me.</span> <span id="s584">And I thought this is my problem, but then I -- I -- you know, my sister says, what do you even bother looking at him?</span> <span id="s585">I -- I says, well he’s the bosses nephew and he keeps on coming in to the showroom and constantly bugging me, you know, telling -- you know, he was -- he wasn’t a nice person, I think.</span> <span id="s586">So that was about that I felt at work.</span> <span id="s587">You know, everybody else was nice, somehow, everybody else was very, very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And how about your English, was that improving?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: It’s much better, because I was going to night school, and I started speaking.</span> <span id="s590">I had the background of English, but I didn’t ta -- speak it.</span> <span id="s591">So -- matter of fact, I still have the English dictionary brought from Sweden.</span> <span id="s592">And -- so I got along well.</span> <span id="s593">I -- I -- I picked it up quickly.</span> <span id="s594">I -- I did better than my sister, because she didn’t have the basic, you know, eng -- you know, she -- she was never taught English in a school.</span> <span id="s595">In --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Are you talking about Frances?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: My sister, Sylvia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Oh right, because she was working in Sweden --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: -- whereas you were going to school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Then how long did you work at this furrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Oh, I worked there for over a year and I don’t know if you want me to go into that story.</span> <span id="s606">I met -- shall I tell you what happened with me privately?</span> <span id="s607">I -- my -- my th -- a-after a few month, after I got the job -- after I got the job, you know, as -- so I -- I had pretty clothes because th-the -- the company gave me this clothes and I di -- matter of fact, they even gave me a fur coat.</span> <span id="s608">So -- so I -- my sister says, you know, why don’t you just go out of the house on a Saturday night?</span> <span id="s609">You know, you sit in here and crying all the time, and just get out.</span> <span id="s610">So we -- my sister came with four friends and I was the fifth one.</span> <span id="s611">Nobody came from the school at the time I -- when I came.</span> <span id="s612">So we were like together five, and we kept together again because we had this background.</span> <span id="s613">So finally on Saturday night, we decided we’ll go to New York.</span> <span id="s614">And as we walking th -- in New York, we heard music.</span> <span id="s615">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: [indecipherable] End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind.</span> <span id="s618">This is tape number two, side A. And you had begun your story about your life outside the furrier business and -- and your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: So anyway, one Saturday we did go to New York and we heard this music there and we peeked in to see people were having a wonderful time, with dancing and all that, and we felt, let’s just watch and see how people are living, you know?</span> <span id="s620">That was the first time we went out into this world where we saw people living normally, sort of.</span> <span id="s621">The youngsters, anyway.</span> <span id="s622">So we stood there for awhile.</span> <span id="s623">In the meanti -- but you had to take your coats off in order -- you know, and check it in.</span> <span id="s624">So we took our coats off and we checked in the coats and i -- you know, we were standing there and a few guys came and asked these other girls to dance.</span> <span id="s625">But somehow nobody asked me to dance.</span> <span id="s626">So anyway, I stayed there and two young man walked over and they talked to me and they saw I have an accent and they -- their par -- ha -- their parents were Hungarians, and they knew a few words Hungarian, so they were -- sure enough they were having a good time.</span> <span id="s627">And me being so depressed, I was looking at them, I says, why are they so happy?</span> <span id="s628">What is to -- so funny?</span> <span id="s629">You know, saying a word in Hungarian, I looked at them like they’re a -- you know, I didn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s630">I didn’t understand that they’re just normal, happy young man.</span> <span id="s631">So they stood with me for awhile, but then they walked away again.</span> <span id="s632">And I was waiting there for awhile, waiting for these girls to come back, so a man with a girl comes over to me and he says, would you like to dance?</span> <span id="s633">I says to him, no, I don’t dance.</span> <span id="s634">So he detected a -- an accent and he looked at me again and he wondered why I been standing there alone and I’m not dancing, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s635">So he says, look, would you like to have a drink?</span> <span id="s636">I says, no, I don’t drink.</span> <span id="s637">I was -- I was thinking, you know, I’m waiting for the girls.</span> <span id="s638">I don’t want to -- you know, start in with anything.</span> <span id="s639">So this girl that he came with had to say goodbye because she had to go home.</span> <span id="s640">In the meantime, this -- this young man is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would you like to -- would you like a Coke?</span> <span id="s641">I says n -- well, I don’t know if I can go and have a Coke because I’m waiting for my friends and they’re supposed to come soon and we’re gonna go home.</span> <span id="s642">So I says -- so he says, well come, we’ll just get a Coke and we’ll come right back.</span> <span id="s643">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s644">In the meantime, I had to tell him who I was, that I’m a survivor and I just came from where -- well, then I became an object to him, that he wanted to know what happened because he -- I was the first survivor that he came -- he came in contact with.</span> <span id="s645">Well, I want to tell you something, he started asking me questions and every question he gave me, it just -- I wanted to really hit him, because -- and he didn’t realize what he was questioning.</span> <span id="s646">And then he -- he -- so I told him, you know, you’re talking to me like it’s -- like you’re cross examining me.</span> <span id="s647">He says, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s648">I just want to know what happened there, do you understand?</span> <span id="s649">And I wasn’t ready to talk.</span> <span id="s650">And the more I resisted not talking, the more he wanted to know.</span> <span id="s651">So our meet -- first meeting didn’t go too well.</span> <span id="s652">He -- he -- and like, you know, he -- he would ask me -- he -- he really didn’t mean to hurt me or anything, but he didn’t know how to deal with me.</span> <span id="s653">So he says to me, you know, I read in the papers that they were taking young women for the Germans.</span> <span id="s654">I says, y-you heard right, but they were taking -- what happened was whenever they -- they took the Czech girls, they picked them up from the street if they saw a Czech girl, a Polish girl, they did use them for the -- for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews were picked to be killed, not you know, taking them there.</span> <span id="s655">At -- so I -- I said to myself, a lot of Jewish girls probably would feel lucky if they -- you know, just to survive -- to -- to -- to be able to do that.</span> <span id="s656">Anyway -- but it was very, you know, it wasn’t -- it wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s657">So then he finally says to me, listen, I want to take you home.</span> <span id="s658">I says no, you’re not taking me home, cause I’m going to go home with the five of these girls.</span> <span id="s659">So the girls finally came.</span> <span id="s660">I -- I think hey kept on staying there because he wanted to pull out words from me, you see, because I wasn’t ready to talk.</span> <span id="s661">I couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s662">And finally the girls came and you know, we are finished having a good time and we says, let’s go home.</span> <span id="s663">So he says to the girls, listen, I want to take you all home.</span> <span id="s664">So the girls says yeah, take me home.</span> <span id="s665">We were five of them.</span> <span id="s666">So I was between them, so -- he had a car.</span> <span id="s667">He had a car.</span> <span id="s668">Matter of fact, he had a new car, a -- a Buick.</span> <span id="s669">So he sa -- we -- he took us home and finally he dropped them all off and my sister and I were the last one and he still wanted to talk and the guy says no, no, I have to go, you know, we’re late, my sister is going to worry, we’re supposed to be home.</span> <span id="s670">So I -- I -- he says to me, I’ll come and see you tomorrow.</span> <span id="s671">I says -- I heard him say it, but I didn’t even answer him, I just wanted to go in, because I was annoyed with him, the way he talked.</span> <span id="s672">So finally we went in and my sister says, you know, I worried -- and then my sister told us not to go into a car and we came in a car and we didn’t want to lie to her.</span> <span id="s673">So we -- we told her what happened and nec -- next day I was washing the kitchen floor and I forgot about him, because I wasn’t too nice to him.</span> <span id="s674">A-And the bell rings, and -- see, we didn’t have a telephone in the apartment, a telephone was downstairs and if there was a telephone for us, you know, somebody picked it up and rang our bell.</span> <span id="s675">And my sister was busy with the kids and I was washing the floors.</span> <span id="s676">But -- so my sister says, Helen, run down and see who’s on the telephone.</span> <span id="s677">So I run down there barefooted, you know, because I was washing the kitchen on my hands and knees.</span> <span id="s678">And I see this man standing there, I said to myself, what happened here?</span> <span id="s679">Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he’s gonna come back, but I just wasn’t paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other things.</span> <span id="s680">So he came back and he wants to go upstairs.</span> <span id="s681">I says look, I’m in the middle of washing the kitchen floor.</span> <span id="s682">I-It’s very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don’t think you can come upstairs.</span> <span id="s683">So he says, I’ll tell you what, I’ll wait in the hallway until you finish washing the floor.</span> <span id="s684">So he comes up and he stays in the hallway and my sister says, who is he?</span> <span id="s685">So I says, you know, this is the guy that [indecipherable] yesterday.</span> <span id="s686">I told him that he can’t come because we’re busy here, but he said -- he chose to stay in the hallway, so he’s in the hallway.</span> <span id="s687">So my sister was very nice, you know, she was normal, you know, she wasn’t like me, you know.</span> <span id="s688">So she walked out and she says, who are you, what are you?</span> <span id="s689">So he was very good friends with the family of the Bestform.</span> <span id="s690">The -- their name was Benenfeld.</span> <span id="s691">You see, he la -- he lan to the yeshiva with the Benenfeld’s son-in-law.</span> <span id="s692">They had one daughter and that son-in-law was a nephew of the geera rabba.</span> <span id="s693">So today geera rabba don’t mean anything, but in Europe it was a big situation.</span> <span id="s694">And my sister knew the Benenfelds, so she says -- so she felt a little embarrassed, she says, well as soon as she finishes washing the kitchen, come on in.</span> <span id="s695">Because the kitchen wasn’t that big, the apartment wasn’t that big.</span> <span id="s696">So he came in and he talked, and my sister talked to him, you know, my sister talked to him.</span> <span id="s697">At that time -- at that point he wasn’t no longer a stranger, but he -- sh -- he made connections with my sister, actually.</span> <span id="s698">And he stood there, he says he’s got to go to Richmond, he was from Richmond.</span> <span id="s699">He told me the truth, he had a place in Richmond, but then he -- he -- e-everything he said he told the truth, but it didn't connect with me.</span> <span id="s700">So that night he left for Richmond and he said that he wants to come back, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Abe Goldkind.</span> <span id="s703">And so when he went to Richmond, he telephoned me a few times and then he says he is sorry that he cannot see me this week because -- but did I get the flowers?</span> <span id="s704">I says yes, I got the flowers, but you know what?</span> <span id="s705">I don’t want you to send me any flowers.</span> <span id="s706">Because they were roses and you know, after three days in this apartment, the roses started dying.</span> <span id="s707">And don’t ask, I couldn’t deal with that.</span> <span id="s708">To me those roses represented life and all of a sudden I’m faced with death again.</span> <span id="s709">So anyway, he -- he just didn’t understand what I was talking about, nobody did.</span> <span id="s710">And then he -- he did come to see me and -- but my sister wouldn’t let me go with him because, you know, I was so young and you see, even though I was 17 - 18 years old at that time, right, I was still like a child of 12.</span> <span id="s711">I had no experience with -- you know, interacting with what -- so I didn’t go out with him becau -- you know, he was just come to visit me in my sister’s house.</span> <span id="s712">And after awhile he got tired of it, he says, I want to take her to the Benenfelds.</span> <span id="s713">So my sister says, well, you’re telling me you’re going to the Benenfelds?</span> <span id="s714">So she says yes, so he got a cab and we went to the Benenfelds and I saw that, you know, he knows these Benenfelds and they were four brothers and they were, you know, very close friends, from home yet.</span> <span id="s715">So yeah, came back, I says, here I was in the Benenfeld’s house and -- and after awhile he wants to take me to the movies, you know, a few weeks later when he came from Richmond.</span> <span id="s716">So now my sister said no, sh -- you can’t take her to the movies.</span> <span id="s717">So she says, okay.</span> <span id="s718">So he says, fil -- you know me already, you know, you -- you must understand, I have a background.</span> <span id="s719">And I wouldn’t hurt her, she was hurt enough.</span> <span id="s720">At that point he already understood who I am, where I come from.</span> <span id="s721">So my sister says, all right, well if you take her with a cab, I’ll let you go.</span> <span id="s722">And he had to park the car downstairs and take a cab, and we went to see Al Jolson.</span> <span id="s723">And that’s how it started, you know.</span> <span id="s724">So actually, I think what the beginning was he -- he really wanted to know what happened there.</span> <span id="s725">He was a very curious person, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Was he your age?</span> <span id="s727">A: No, he was a little older.</span> <span id="s728">He was a little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And was he born in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No, he came from Poland, from Lódz, just before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So had he lost relatives in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yeah, he -- but he was lucky, he came here with his family, with his parents and sisters and brothers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: But he lost extended family?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: All of them.</span> <span id="s737">All of them.</span> <span id="s738">All of them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Do you think that’s why he kept asking you what --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: -- what happened, because he was thinking of his own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: -- yes, yes, yes, he really wanted to know.</span> <span id="s743">He really wanted to know what happened there.</span> <span id="s744">I -- you know, there were lots of articles, but they were in the -- they were on the -- on the back pages.</span> <span id="s745">Nobody made a headline out of it.</span> <span id="s746">So -- you know, and people were skeptical.</span> <span id="s747">If somebody would come and tell you they’re taking hi -- little kids to the gas chamber, would you believe that?</span> <span id="s748">It has never happened before, so people, even though they heard it, but they says, oh it’s something, you know, that doesn’t make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: When you and Frances and Sylvia would be together in the apartment, would you talk about your parents and life before the war?</span> <span id="s750">A: Oh yeah, a lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s751">She wanted to know what happened and we had to tell her what happened, we had to tell her the truth and -- and yeah, they were sad stories, it was a very sad time, you know.</span> <span id="s752">It was like a mixed situation.</span> <span id="s753">It was -- it was a mixed situation, it was -- I felt lime -- like again betwe -- I felt like I’m again with people that Hitler didn’t destroy.</span> <span id="s754">I thought Hitler destroyed the world, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s755">I really thought Hitler destroyed the world.</span> <span id="s756">And when I came here, I found the world.</span> <span id="s757">And you know, I was -- but still, it’s very hard to explain, when you lose one person, yo-you know, like you lose your mother, you -- you -- you mourn and my mother, my mother.</span> <span id="s758">But when you lose 89 people at one time, it’s just -- there is no compacity in you to bear it.</span> <span id="s759">I want to tell you that.</span> <span id="s760">And but you -- I think if w -- when I -- a-and of course, I got married.</span> <span id="s761">I -- you know, of course, after awhile, after he was coming to see me from Richmond and he already felt like he would want -- you know, he got interested in me, actually, after he was finished with the stories of World War II, he moved his pla -- he had a -- a navy op -- army-navy store in Richmond and he said that I probably wouldn’t want to live there, so he moved it to Baltimore, just to show me that he will do anything I want to, because I told him I’m not leaving my job, that he’s got to get a job in -- in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s762">And he says, you know, I-I-I’m not a type of person to work for other people, I need to work for myself.</span> <span id="s763">And back and forth.</span> <span id="s764">I didn’t want to give up my job, my job meant so much to me because I was so happy there.</span> <span id="s765">I was so happy there.</span> <span id="s766">But anyway, after awhile we came to an understanding, we will ga -- he wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s767">Now, I -- you see, I -- I don’t think I was ready to do that, you know.</span> <span id="s768">I -- I wanted to -- I don’t know what I wanted to do, I don’t know, I don’t know, I just wanted my job and I wanted to work and I wanted to go to school, and -- but anyway, I agreed that -- you know, we all agreed because he’s really -- he really was a person with depth.</span> <span id="s769">He -- I just lost him two years ago, in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: We got married November the ninth.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yeah, I -- I’m ashame of it, but I can look it up.</span> <span id="s774">It -- it doesn’t matter, does it?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: So -- and what was your wedding like?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Oh, you know, I -- even though I made up -- some money, but he wasn’t a rich man either.</span> <span id="s777">He came here in ’39, right before the war.</span> <span id="s778">But he was very educated.</span> <span id="s779">So we had a small wedding that we paid for because there was nobody else to pay for.</span> <span id="s780">And then I moved to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s781">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Was it hard to leave your two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Very.</span> <span id="s784">Very hard.</span> <span id="s785">Th -- actually then I -- you know, after I -- I realized I have to live in Baltimore, I -- I asked him that my sister please syl -- well, it’s another long story.</span> <span id="s786">My si -- I lost my sister Frances, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Whe-When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: When was that?</span> <span id="s789">Maybe -- maybe three years after we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: So there was another shock in my life that one sister should have lived, my s -- yeah.</span> <span id="s792">Anyway, but after she died I says, le -- you know what, I can’t deal with this world any more.</span> <span id="s793">I need my sister near me.</span> <span id="s794">So he opened up a store for my sister in Baltimore and she came to Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: What -- what did Frances die of?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Kidney disease.</span> <span id="s799">Today she probably could have lived, they have dialysis and all this, so yeah.</span> <span id="s800">So then she left these two little kids, so we took care of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: So you moved to Baltimore and your sister came to Baltimore also --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: -- and then you -- and you had children?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yes, then I had three children.</span> <span id="s805">But I really feel when my first child was born -- matter of fact it’s sort of -- to me this kid represented not only life, but sort of like my -- that -- that I -- I’m alive again.</span> <span id="s806">You know, I ti -- I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s807">So anyway -- and I looked at this kid and I said to her, I need to protect you from my past, because I was afraid that if I’ll be talking to her what I went through, it’s -- it’s going to be a punishment to this kid.</span> <span id="s808">So I -- I promised myself I-I -- I no longer have the luxury on being preoccupied with it.</span> <span id="s809">I need to put it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Ha-Had you been preoccupied with your past up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And how -- how did that manifest itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: All the time sad.</span> <span id="s814">You know, my husband really went through a tough time with me too, but he sort of understood it.</span> <span id="s815">I had nightmares.</span> <span id="s816">He was very understanding.</span> <span id="s817">I was married to a very good guy.</span> <span id="s818">And so I said to myself, I’m going to put all this in an iron box and I’m not going to open it up.</span> <span id="s819">And I was raising her and I kept on -- you know, she -- I gave her all my love, for the people that I no longer had.</span> <span id="s820">You know, there is a little bit too much is no good either.</span> <span id="s821">You know what they say?</span> <span id="s822">I would never put her down.</span> <span id="s823">I carried her around constantly.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, I carried her around constantly, so what happened, being I didn’t put her -- I was afraid the floor is dirty, I was -- I was so afraid I’ll lose her.</span> <span id="s825">So -- and then she was born with big -- we had a problem, she was born with big adenoids and she couldn't take her bottle.</span> <span id="s826">So I ha -- we had a doctor come in every day to the f -- when we fed her, they couldn’t -- like this she was healthy, but -- but she had this problem, she couldn’t take the bottle.</span> <span id="s827">So we had a doctor come in every day to look at her and finally the doctor saw the kid can’t breathe when she closes her mouth.</span> <span id="s828">He took a look in the nose and her nose was clutter -- she made history.</span> <span id="s829">They took her to John Hopkins and they opened up her nose and that’s -- she could have died if this doctor wouldn’t of -- I would have lost her.</span> <span id="s830">And the doctors kept on saying that I was the crazy mother.</span> <span id="s831">But then they found that I wa -- you know, I had a reason, because I saw the kid is losing weight and can’t eat.</span> <span id="s832">So that was that, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Is Rose.</span> <span id="s835">Right now her na -- her name is Rose Shainus.</span> <span id="s836">And so I -- I raised this child and by ne -- never putting her on the floor she didn’t know how to crawl or she didn't know how to walk.</span> <span id="s837">So again with the doctors I keep on saying -- she was already -- she was already 20 months and this kid wouldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s838">So I take her to the doctors and the doctors see a healthy child.</span> <span id="s839">They didn’t know what to do with her.</span> <span id="s840">And -- so one day a doctor says to me, tell me, so how do you deal with her?</span> <span id="s841">So accidentally I said to him, you know, I -- I -- I love to hold her so much that I never -- I always hold her, I said to him, I always hold her.</span> <span id="s842">So he says, well, fa -- try putting her down the floor.</span> <span id="s843">Ee -- I -- e -- I says, but she’s going to cry.</span> <span id="s844">So he says, well let her cry a little bit, and move away from her.</span> <span id="s845">So I did that.</span> <span id="s846">You know, she started crawling.</span> <span id="s847">Then she was looking, how can she get to me.</span> <span id="s848">So at 20 she started crawling.</span> <span id="s849">And then, you know, eventually, when I knew what the problem was, I already, you know put her in a little wagon, and anyway, we dealt with the problem.</span> <span id="s850">It was my problem, that I created, but this is the kind of mother I was.</span> <span id="s851">I just never put her down.</span> <span id="s852">Even I -- I was, you know, cooking, or I was giving my husband to eat, she was always in my hands, she was like my hand.</span> <span id="s853">I could never put her down.</span> <span id="s854">It sounds crazy today.</span> <span id="s855">I never put her down.</span> <span id="s856">Anyway, but she grew older and she’s -- she’s fine, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And then your other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Then I had another daughter, her name was Michelle and I knew already more what to do.</span> <span id="s859">And then, four years later, we had a lit -- a son, Larry.</span> <span id="s860">So that was a happy time of my life and I had my children, and of course I was forced to get rid of my past that I -- I didn’t have that luxury to deal with it any more.</span> <span id="s861">Do you see what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: What I mean by that is that I wallowed in my past and it made me a very hap -- unhappy person.</span> <span id="s864">And I felt I need to raise these kids [phone ringing] [tape break] Well anyway, I try very hard to live for the future and not for the past, and I was -- because of my kids.</span> <span id="s865">I wanted them to have a better life than I had and I wanted them to grow up to be better people than I encountered in my young life.</span> <span id="s866">So this was my decision and this is wa -- what I was out to do.</span> <span id="s867">I felt that -- that that was my job now and I raised them and I was very, very happy with them.</span> <span id="s868">They were wonderful kids.</span> <span id="s869">They tried so hard.</span> <span id="s870">I never talked about my past, but I think that they knew that it -- something in my life wasn’t talked about.</span> <span id="s871">So -- so they really -- my husband and my children made my life.</span> <span id="s872">And I went on raising them.</span> <span id="s873">My oldest daughter -- shall I tell you where they went to school or whatever?</span> <span id="s874">I should tell you -- okay.</span> <span id="s875">My oldest daughter, she went to Brandeis University, and my younger daughter went to ithic -- no, sh -- she went to -- not Ithaca, there was another college, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: In Ithaca?</span> <span id="s877">Cornell?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No.</span> <span id="s879">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: A-And my son went to University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s884">And my older daughter bec -- got a PhD in psychology and my younger daughter has got a PhD -- no, my older daughter has a PhD in microbiology and my younger daughter has a PhD in psychology and my son is a gastroenterologist.</span> <span id="s885">And they have families and I’m blessed with 10 grandchildren that I l -- that I love them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: When you say when you raised them you didn’t talk about their -- your background, did they ever ask you, and if so, how did you answer them?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: They started asking me after they went to college, wi -- believe it or not.</span> <span id="s888">They started reading books.</span> <span id="s889">As --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: They didn’t say anything during high school years?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: They va -- they would throw out, but I did not volunteer my past with them.</span> <span id="s892">I didn't [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So what did you say about their -- their grandparents, or their aunt?</span> <span id="s894">How did you answer them?</span> <span id="s895">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s896">Well, I told thi -- told them that I lost them, but I did not go into details on how -- what had happened.</span> <span id="s897">But when they started reading books, you know, I had to be honest with them, and I felt at that time that they were capable of dealing with this tragedy, where before I was afraid if I’ll tell them what has happened, they’ll be very angry, and -- angry people, I’ll bring up angry people because -- so -- and this is not what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s898">So when they came to ar -- when they read the books -- actually, what -- what -- what happened was, when books came out that this tragedy never happened, then they started questioning.</span> <span id="s899">You know, they read the books -- I don’t know the name of the professor from Princeton, he was trying to -- he was trying to convince the world that that couldn't have happened.</span> <span id="s900">So they came questioning me, how could it have happened, and actually that’s how I started with -- you know, telling them how it happened and how it -- you know, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind.</span> <span id="s903">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s904">You were talking about your relationship with your children and it was only when they were older that you started to tell them about what happened to their family and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Well, just to give you a example, when the museum opened, the Holocaust Museum opened, I was a volunteer and she says, Mommy, I want to go with you and I’ll visit the museum.</span> <span id="s906">So I went to my job and she went upstairs to, you know, look around.</span> <span id="s907">If -- at that time she already had three kids of her own, imagine.</span> <span id="s908">She went upstairs and about 15 - 20 minutes later she came downstairs, pale.</span> <span id="s909">And so I said to her, what happened honey?</span> <span id="s910">Wha -- you know, you look so pale.</span> <span id="s911">She says, Mommy, I think I saw you in these pictures.</span> <span id="s912">And it wa -- she didn't -- I -- I’m not in these pictures, but I said to myself, my God, if I would have fed her with al -- with this tragedy when she was young, I know the kid probably would have not survived, if she couldn’t deal with it at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: What about with your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Well, we didn’t talk -- we didn’t talk about it to my grandchildren either.</span> <span id="s915">That -- w-we made these decisions actually, because we did not want to bring up angry kids, or -- you know.</span> <span id="s916">Matter of fact, my daughter would say to me, Mommy, when I’ll grow up, I’m going to do something so I can help people.</span> <span id="s917">I says -- oh, you’ll be proud of me, I’ll ca -- I-I’ll help people.</span> <span id="s918">I says, sweetheart, I’m already proud of you, you’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s919">Anyway -- so anyway, she is the one who became a microbiologist so that she can help people.</span> <span id="s920">So I’m just -- I -- I-I’m delighted that they grew up that they would rather help and not hurt.</span> <span id="s921">Because once you start hurting one group, you wind up hurting the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Do they know your whole story?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Oh yes, now -- now they all know my story.</span> <span id="s924">I would just -- can I talk about my grandchildren a little bit, too?</span> <span id="s925">Because it means so much to me in my life, maybe more than anything else that I -- me -- as a survivor could raise three kids that -- I don’t know how to say it -- that are real human beings.</span> <span id="s926">I would be heartbroken if my kids would have wound up hating, because I saw what hate does.</span> <span id="s927">And -- and they sort of go around with their normal life.</span> <span id="s928">I am forever thankful that the United States gave me this chance to -- for a new life, but my reward to them are my children and my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s929">You know, I’m so glad I brought them to the United States and they are good citizens and that makes me very happy.</span> <span id="s930">And now you want to know about my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s931">I have two grandchildren that graduated from Princeton and three grandchildren that graduated from Columbia University, and four little grandchildren that go to the Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s932">So I’m very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Do your children live nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I have my daughter and son -- one my daughters and son living here in Washington and one of my daughters live in Tampa.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: When -- wh -- when your children were growing up and they -- let’s say your daughter Rose reached the age that you did when things got very difficult for you as a child, was that a more difficult time for you?</span> <span id="s936">Did it bring back memories of what you had gone through, when she was, let’s say 12 - 13 - 14 - 15?</span> <span id="s937">When -- when life was so hard for you during the war, and when she reached that age, did that trigger anything for you, when you would look at her and think what were you doing when you were her age?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Mm, mm-hm, I understand what you’re saying, but my answer on that would be this, I was so afraid being that I wasn’t born here, and I have an accent that somehow another my children m-might suffer from it, that I will not be able to guide them, you know, to the right places and do the right things.</span> <span id="s939">So I was concentrating more or less on what’s happening in their life.</span> <span id="s940">I was always on top of it.</span> <span id="s941">I always wanted to know how they’re doing in school, and I always wanted them to -- to go to Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s942">And I always wanted them to do everything that other kids in the United States did.</span> <span id="s943">So this is where my energy went in, not saying -- well, I’m delighted that my daughter has it better.</span> <span id="s944">I mean, I was delighted that my daughter has it better, but I felt that I -- I -- I shouldn’t touch that part.</span> <span id="s945">That was a no-no for me to think back and say, what did I do when I was 12, because it wouldn’t be good.</span> <span id="s946">I used to get these crying spells and I would just, for no reason, nobody would say much to me, I would cry and I couldn’t stop for nothing.</span> <span id="s947">And that bothers me even today.</span> <span id="s948">I would cry and cry and I couldn’t explain it and I couldn’t stop.</span> <span id="s949">So the ki -- poor kids, they were such good kids, they would say did -- did we do something, Mommy, you’re crying, did we -- I said, no, you’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s950">I was trying to reassure them it’s -- has nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s951">But they were just sad to see me cry.</span> <span id="s952">And here if I would start talking, it would be a bigger problem.</span> <span id="s953">I could have contr -- you see, what happened was, I could control my mouth, the talking, but you can’t control emotion, you can’t control the nightmares.</span> <span id="s954">You can’t control the -- I couldn’t control the crying.</span> <span id="s955">I don’t know how to explain it, because you know, I wanted to stop because I didn’t want my kids to see me that way.</span> <span id="s956">I couldn’t control it until I cried myself out, for days, you know, and then all of a sudden it like, stopped.</span> <span id="s957">It relieved me.</span> <span id="s958">I think maybe cause I couldn’t talk, so this was my outburst.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: You had said something before about your sister and you -- Sylvia and you didn't -- couldn’t really start mourning un -- for your family, your lost family until you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s961">That’s right, because you see, we were in so much trouble that we didn’t think we’ll survive either, til the last minute.</span> <span id="s962">My sister got typhus and you know how many people died in -- in Bergen-Belsen and -- and we didn't even think -- one of us wanted to survive to tell the world, but it wasn’t in our power really, completely to control it.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: But even in Sweden, you -- did you feel you could mourn your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s965">First of all, we were separated and then I had the responsibility of studying.</span> <span id="s966">And we were isolo -- we -- not isolated, you know, isolated --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Separated, yeah.</span> <span id="s969">We were separated from society there.</span> <span id="s970">It was a little town, Fielgarden, I don’t know if it’s on the map, even.</span> <span id="s971">So my -- I think my energy went in to bond with these girls, you know.</span> <span id="s972">And of course we studied.</span> <span id="s973">We studied.</span> <span id="s974">No, it was no time to mourn.</span> <span id="s975">It was no time --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Do you still get these nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Occasionally, of course.</span> <span id="s978">Of course.</span> <span id="s979">If I see a document, or a -- it comes all back, yeah.</span> <span id="s980">It comes all back.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Are there any other sights or sounds or smells that -- that trigger your memories, besides a documentary?</span> <span id="s982">Anything, any sounds, or s --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: You know, you -- I don’t know how to say this either, in order for people to understand it.</span> <span id="s984">When we got to Auschwitz, there was such a smell of burning people that there was a smell.</span> <span id="s985">It was a s -- definite smell.</span> <span id="s986">Sometimes when I walk into something, you know, like the light goes on, it’s the smell of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s987">It’s hard to explain what happens inside of me.</span> <span id="s988">You know, there is -- there are certain things that are in there -- in -- in -- i-in -- you know, things trigger it off, for different reasons, for different -- if I see a chimney today, I have a reaction.</span> <span id="s989">A tall chimney.</span> <span id="s990">[phone ringing][tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: You were talking about what sights or sounds or smells trigger your memories of the war and when you see a chimney that brings back memories.</span> <span id="s992">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: You know, it just depends, it just depends.</span> <span id="s994">A swastika.</span> <span id="s995">You know, when I see a swastika I feel I’m in danger.</span> <span id="s996">It s -- it sounds crazy to other people, because other people are not affected at all by a swastika.</span> <span id="s997">That swastika cannot hurt you.</span> <span id="s998">But what represents to me is something else.</span> <span id="s999">Well, you know, a lot -- a lot of things, a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1000">To say that I completely have a pain free life, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1001">It feels that -- you know, I have -- I have s-so many nice things in my life right now that I try to focus in on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: If you have -- if you had had a different life, a different childhood, do you feel you’d be a different person today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1004">First of all I think I would be more of an educated person.</span> <span id="s1005">I -- I hate to say it about myself, but Hitler took my years of education away from me and I miss that.</span> <span id="s1006">I remember when I -- I used to feed my daughter with a bottle, I would tell her stories.</span> <span id="s1007">Some mothers tell their children, you know, all kinds of wonderful things and I would tell her sweetheart, when you’ll get -- grow older, you’ll go to college.</span> <span id="s1008">And looking back, she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1009">She -- she would look at -- I think I was telling myself that -- I was trying to comfort myself because that was robbed from me.</span> <span id="s1010">And the simple reason that my children and my grandchildren are such overachievers, it might have something to do with it, but I’m not sure, I’m not sure, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: You had said that you were a strong child before the war.</span> <span id="s1012">Did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: I think my sister was stronger than I was.</span> <span id="s1014">My sister was much stronger than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: I’m talking physically and emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I-I -- I think -- I think emotion -- I think physically I was strong.</span> <span id="s1017">Emotionally, because -- emotionally I don’t think I was strong as my sister because I cracked faster, I gave in faster.</span> <span id="s1018">And a lot of people when they did that, they just took their lives.</span> <span id="s1019">I remember in -- the first night in -- in Auschwitz, when I saw a lot of people hanging from these -- on these electric wires.</span> <span id="s1020">I believe today that’s what, they cracked and they fel -- they -- they knew that the -- there’s no way they can escape.</span> <span id="s1021">They just did away with themselves the best way they knew how.</span> <span id="s1022">And if not for my sister I ba -- wonder if I wouldn’t have been hanging on these wires, believe me.</span> <span id="s1023">There are many times I think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Where is your sister today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah, I just spoke to her.</span> <span id="s1026">She’s in Florida and she’s not well.</span> <span id="s1027">She’s not a well person and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: D-D-Do you -- do you and she talk still about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: She can deal with it less than I can, would you believe it or not?</span> <span id="s1030">We were in Yad Vashem and sh -- together, she couldn’t walk in there.</span> <span id="s1031">I walked in there, and she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1032">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Does she have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yes, she’s got two children and they’re both married and all have a nice family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: What are ye -- let’s talk a little bit about your religious outlook, because of what you went through, had to -- did it make you more religious, less religious?</span> <span id="s1036">Your feelings about being Jewish, because you suffered because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1038">I’m trying to figure out how to explain it best.</span> <span id="s1039">I would say that I take my Judaism very serious because I paid a big price.</span> <span id="s1040">And a sad thing happened that I cannot be as religious as my grandfather and my father was.</span> <span id="s1041">But what I did is put my hope in Israel, because I feel if we will not have Israel, we Jews are not safe.</span> <span id="s1042">So therefore, when something goes on in Israel, it puts me though a lot of pain, the fear of losing Israel.</span> <span id="s1043">I think I made my peace with God.</span> <span id="s1044">I have a lot of questions for him and maybe one day he’s going to be able to explain, or something -- somebody will be able to explain fu -- why.</span> <span id="s1045">The reason why the children come to my mind is because when I look at my little grandchildren and I say to myself, these -- kids like them went to the gas chamber and they never had a chance.</span> <span id="s1046">So I want to know why.</span> <span id="s1047">I would very much like to know why.</span> <span id="s1048">If there is a reason, I would like to know.</span> <span id="s1049">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1050">This is how I live today.</span> <span id="s1051">I don’t think it made me more religious, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s1052">But I -- I respect everybody, whatever they believe in and whatever, because the truth is we really don -- you know, unless somebody’s a real believer, can he feel, you know, what you really read?</span> <span id="s1053">But you know, in the other hand, y-y-you know, God gave us a brain that’s -- y-you know, you -- you also think and examine things.</span> <span id="s1054">E-Everything we read, actually, you know, wa-wa-was -- it was written by humans and so many years ago.</span> <span id="s1055">So I sometimes think, you know, I -- I -- I’m very happy that we have this things in -- in orbit.</span> <span id="s1056">Maybe through that we will find out really, maybe something more than w-we know now on earth.</span> <span id="s1057">I’m hoping anyway, I’m really hoping for it, but it’s probably my great-grandchildren will know a little bit more than I know of, as far as the religions are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Do you -- do you still practice in any way, religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yes, I belong to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1060">And I don’t know whether it is a habit, or whatever, I light candles on Fridays and whenever I can I go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s1061">And of course the holidays, which are the toughest for me because I remember what happened at home.</span> <span id="s1062">It was such a happy time with my family.</span> <span id="s1063">And -- and I’m afraid to complain, I’ll tell you the truth, because I feel like God gave me a lot back, and I’m always scared something shouldn’t happen to my family, cause I don’t think that I could survive any more, you know?</span> <span id="s1064">So -- so I don’t -- so most of the time I just say thank you God for what you gave me and I hope they stay well and go on with their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did, whereas other people, let’s say in the United States, didn’t have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Well, I don’t think I’m angry because they didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s1067">Matter of fact, I feel happy that they didn’t have to, because m -- why so much suffering?</span> <span id="s1068">And unnecessary suffering.</span> <span id="s1069">What we went through is not because I was a bad person.</span> <span id="s1070">It isn’t because I committed a crime.</span> <span id="s1071">So it doesn’t make sense for me to be angry.</span> <span id="s1072">Matter of fact, I’m the other way.</span> <span id="s1073">I’m happy that there were some people that did not have to go through this.</span> <span id="s1074">But I’ll tell you the truth, I live in fear.</span> <span id="s1075">I’m hoping that my grandchildren, great-grandchildren shouldn’t have to go through what I have gone through.</span> <span id="s1076">And therefore, when I go to the museum, I want to teach society, please don’t hate.</span> <span id="s1077">Please don’t hate.</span> <span id="s1078">The outcome of it is no good, no good.</span> <span id="s1079">I think this is the message I would want to give the world.</span> <span id="s1080">Don’t hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Would your children today be different if you had not gone through your wartime experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: I really can’t tell.</span> <span id="s1083">I really can’t tell, to be very honest.</span> <span id="s1084">I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s1085">I think perhaps I -- I-I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1086">I think perhaps -- you see, everything too much is no good.</span> <span id="s1087">I think I was s -- too protective of them.</span> <span id="s1088">I lived in fear they shouldn’t get sick.</span> <span id="s1089">I didn’t have a normal day because I feared what will happen to them.</span> <span id="s1090">But, in the end --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Th-This is all three children?</span> <span id="s1092">In other words, it did not lessen as you had th -- more children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: No, no, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s1094">Each and every one was different and just to tell you I was so on top of my children, I remember my younger daughter, I was watching over her and she fell and she hit her lip.</span> <span id="s1095">And so I rushed her to the doctor and I kept on crying because it’s my fault, I didn’t watching -- you know, another mother would say, well it happens.</span> <span id="s1096">And this was my big fault, because my child fell and hit her lip and cr -- and -- and I couldn’t forgive myself.</span> <span id="s1097">So imagine my children what they had to go through having me on top of them all the time.</span> <span id="s1098">I think, you know, that was a -- not the best thing for them.</span> <span id="s1099">You know, I -- I should have l -- I should have given them maybe more elbow space.</span> <span id="s1100">See what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1101">I should have given them a little bit more elbow space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Do you feel like you’re two different people?</span> <span id="s1103">Someone on the inside -- the true person on the inside and someone on the outside, facing the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1105">Yes.</span> <span id="s1106">Because there is no way -- there is no way -- I would constantly want to live my inside.</span> <span id="s1107">So what I do is try to focus in on what’s around me.</span> <span id="s1108">And that’s how I’m surviving.</span> <span id="s1109">Don’t forget, I have some responsibilities to my children, too.</span> <span id="s1110">It’s not just me any more.</span> <span id="s1111">So I think I am.</span> <span id="s1112">There’s a lot of sadness in me, although there is so much for me to be happy.</span> <span id="s1113">I don’t have to -- I already mentioned that.</span> <span id="s1114">But there’s a lot of sadness in me.</span> <span id="s1115">And I really think even the happy things, even the happy things are … the hap -- I think I get -- I get it from both sides, like, you know?</span> <span id="s1116">There is this sadness in me and -- and there is -- there is the good things that I -- I -- I enjoy.</span> <span id="s1117">That’s why my kids keeps on saying, Ma, why you so sad?</span> <span id="s1118">Look at the beautiful things you have.</span> <span id="s1119">I says, you’re right, you’re right, I shouldn’t be sad.</span> <span id="s1120">But you can’t say this to your soul, you know?</span> <span id="s1121">You can say this -- I can say this to you, but I can’t say this to my soul.</span> <span id="s1122">Yes, my sou -- I would say my soul is sad.</span> <span id="s1123">Sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Have you ever gotten counseling, or di -- have you just handled this yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: When we were in New York, maybe just came over, my sister cou -- didn’t understand how to deal with us, so we had a little counseling, yes, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1126">But then we also didn’t have the money to pay for it.</span> <span id="s1127">And at that time there wasn’t such th -- I mean, just -- we didn’t expect any help or anything.</span> <span id="s1128">So there was no money and we just had to pull ourselves out and go on with our lives.</span> <span id="s1129">And I really began feel that s -- right away, after a -- a few months, so many nice things happened to me.</span> <span id="s1130">That -- that helped me.</span> <span id="s1131">That helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today?</span> <span id="s1133">Germany, and Germany today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Okay, now let me tell you something, how I feel.</span> <span id="s1135">You know, I always say, please God, don’t punish my kids for my sins.</span> <span id="s1136">So I have to give them the same -- the same feeling.</span> <span id="s1137">When I see a young German today, I’m willing to deal with him one on one, it depends what kind of person he is.</span> <span id="s1138">But let me tell you something, when I see a person in my age, I -- I doubt.</span> <span id="s1139">I say, I wonder what you did.</span> <span id="s1140">And I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s1141">It’s not that I would want to do anything to him, but crosses my mind, how could you have been such a monster?</span> <span id="s1142">Well, I don’t know how to call it.</span> <span id="s1143">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1144">That’s what comes to -- crosses my mind.</span> <span id="s1145">And then, I’ll tell you the truth, I am hoping even for the -- even for the German’s sake -- I mean, the Germans were destroyed too, Hitler took them down the road also.</span> <span id="s1146">So I’m hoping they learned a lesson.</span> <span id="s1147">I hope they learned a lesson, that we need a different society.</span> <span id="s1148">That’s what I’m hoping for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: What about political situations here, for instance, the Civil Rights movement.</span> <span id="s1150">Was that something you paid particular attention to, because in mentioning Hitler, who took away other’s civil rights, were you more attuned to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: You know, you brought up such a good point, but there wasn’t enough of us, I think, as survivors.</span> <span id="s1152">We -- we felt the depth of this wrong thing.</span> <span id="s1153">We felt it.</span> <span id="s1154">But I think a lot of people couldn’t feel it like we did, because they never experienced it.</span> <span id="s1155">So all I remember, the riots and I remember all these things and I kept on saying, I’m -- I raised my children with the idea this is wrong and, this is wrong.</span> <span id="s1156">My children were brought up that this was -- this was a terrible thing in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goodkind.</span> <span id="s1159">This is tape number three, side A, and we were talking about the Civil Rights movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Me as a survivor, I wasn’t happy about it at all.</span> <span id="s1161">I thought it was wrong, and you know, I -- I raised my kids not to be bigoted and to understand that we are all made in the image of God.</span> <span id="s1162">So i-it was a thing that bothered us in the family, a lot.</span> <span id="s1163">And I’m happy to say that my kids are -- are people that always, always stayed on the side of the oppre-oppressed people.</span> <span id="s1164">I don’t know ho -- I -- I don’t know if I want to -- whate -- you know, whoever was oppressed, they were there for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Can you give an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Can you give an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Well, if there -- if there was a -- you know, a march or something, they would go.</span> <span id="s1169">I would beg them, please don’t get -- don -- don’t go as far as being locked up, but they would, you know -- they would always talk about it in the schools and they -- they -- how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s1170">They -- they right away knew, even when they were little that this is -- this is something that we shouldn’t -- we have to pri -- we have to right this wrong.</span> <span id="s1171">And I told them if you’re not going to right this wrong, it’s going to be awful.</span> <span id="s1172">The world will come to an end.</span> <span id="s1173">I saw it this way, because I saw already the end in Europe and I was afraid there’s going to come an end here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Do -- do you think there could be something like that in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Well, you know, you can’t have -- you can’t have people and oppress them.</span> <span id="s1176">You’ve got to give them the freedom of, you know, what they are.</span> <span id="s1177">If not there are revolutions and killing each other and one will figure out how to make a gas chamber, to gas the other.</span> <span id="s1178">I-I-Is -- just doesn’t work like that.</span> <span id="s1179">Or will become a jungle, the stronger animal will eat up the -- th-the weaker one or whatever.</span> <span id="s1180">I -- I just didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Do you think that could happen in this country still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Well, I have more hope now.</span> <span id="s1183">I have more hope because I think that people do have a chance.</span> <span id="s1184">I -- I -- I’m not saying that, you know, everybody should get a palace, but I think everybody should have the opportunity to do with themselves what they possibly can, and not being denied of it.</span> <span id="s1185">This is exactly -- I am the -- the -- the pr -- I am the person that was denied of an education.</span> <span id="s1186">Can you imagine how I feel when I see another child would be denied of an education?</span> <span id="s1187">It would be awful, it’s awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Did you follow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Matter of fact, I was in Israel at that time and I went to one session.</span> <span id="s1192">You know, all these witnesses that were there, I-I -- I felt like I’m a part of this witness anyway, I knew everything.</span> <span id="s1193">It’s just that I was trying to look at him and trying to figure him out, how he was created.</span> <span id="s1194">Was he really created by God, or were there mon -- are there monsters in heaven?</span> <span id="s1195">Bec-bec-because -- how -- how can anybody take again, kids, put them in wagons to a gas chamber?</span> <span id="s1196">How could any human being do that?</span> <span id="s1197">You know, be -- I always want to talk too, about the kids.</span> <span id="s1198">You feel adults, you know, had maybe a chance to life, but kids never did.</span> <span id="s1199">How -- how could this man -- I was looking at him and my mind was just going a mile a minute, where he comes from, why is -- was he the way he was?</span> <span id="s1200">Of course, I never figured it out, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1201">Have no answer.</span> <span id="s1202">But to my mind he didn’t look -- you know, when I looked at him, in my heart, I said, it’s maybe in my eyes he looked like a human being, but to my soul and my heart, I saw -- I saw a monster, a scary monster.</span> <span id="s1203">It’s hard to explain because other people wouldn’t understand it, unless you go through this.</span> <span id="s1204">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1205">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1206">So that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s1207">You know, the few years that I’ve have left -- the few years that I have left to live, I -- you know, I go and work in the museum and I talk to children.</span> <span id="s1208">I really think that if -- if -- if I could just help a little bit, that much t -- help society to be a better society, I would like to do that, very much so.</span> <span id="s1209">If not -- if a -- if I leave this earth and I didn't change anything in my small way, I think I’m going to die with a fear what will happen to my great-grandchildren, because I already know what human beings are capable of.</span> <span id="s1210">And if you let it go, it does no good.</span> <span id="s1211">That’s really -- that’s how I live today.</span> <span id="s1212">You know, I don’t know if I too -- I was talking to little kids and I was telling them about my little brother and I really, you know, I was making it mild.</span> <span id="s1213">I just told them how we got separated and how, you know, he brou -- he -- he -- he l -- you know, he had to give up his book, and how sad he was.</span> <span id="s1214">And there was a lady and -- with two children a-and I really didn’t know who she was, because people were coming and going and then after I had my say to the kids, this lady came up and she said to me, you know, I’m an SS man’s daughter, and well, he didn’t tell me that it was so bad.</span> <span id="s1215">And imagine, I didn’t even scratch the surface when I was talking to these little kids.</span> <span id="s1216">She had two beautiful little girls with her and -- and she said that to me and it’s like she would hit me over the head.</span> <span id="s1217">And I said to her -- I didn’t have time to debate it with her how good or bad it was, so I pulled her aside and I say to her, listen, I’m so glad that you came in here, because I need to ask you some questions.</span> <span id="s1218">Tell me, did your father tell you what his job was as an SS man?</span> <span id="s1219">We didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1220">So I says, you know, in Auschwitz, where I was, there came a million and a half children to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1221">And you know what the -- the SS people, they had their families there with their children, you know what their job was?</span> <span id="s1222">Did you ever wonder what their job was?</span> <span id="s1223">She says no.</span> <span id="s1224">Watching over the people she says to me.</span> <span id="s1225">I says, not really.</span> <span id="s1226">Their job was to take little kids like yours -- I pointed my finger to her children -- to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1227">These kids had no -- nobody had any mercy over them and they knew where these kids are going.</span> <span id="s1228">And they were living there very happily with their own families.</span> <span id="s1229">So I -- I -- I don’t know how more to explain it to you, how good and bad it was.</span> <span id="s1230">You know, she started crying.</span> <span id="s1231">I think I scared her a little bit because I showed my f -- pointed my fingers to her children.</span> <span id="s1232">So I said to myself, you know, I -- I [indecipherable] to -- as angry I was in the beginning for her to saying this to me, I -- I -- you know, I was really upset.</span> <span id="s1233">Well, I said, if she’s starting to cry, maybe I touched a nerve in her.</span> <span id="s1234">So I was going to hug her, and she stepped back.</span> <span id="s1235">She says to me, you know, I will never forget you.</span> <span id="s1236">And I said to her, you know what?</span> <span id="s1237">As long as you will never forget me, please remember what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1238">If you see any children when their lives will be threatened, speak up.</span> <span id="s1239">Because your father didn’t.</span> <span id="s1240">And that’s how she walked out.</span> <span id="s1241">Now, re -- now I feel that I touched her, I touched one person.</span> <span id="s1242">And that makes me feel good, that maybe if she’s going to see a child in danger, whether it’s a Jew, or a non-Jew, or green or yellow or purple, maybe she’ll be there and say wait a second, we cannot afford of doing that, we shouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1243">And you know, it makes me feel like maybe I touched someone.</span> <span id="s1244">I would like to touch the whole world and tell them don’t hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Let’s talk a little bit more about your experiences as a volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1246">When did you begin working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: All right, I beca -- I became -- I became a volunteer there right away, as soon as the museum has opened.</span> <span id="s1248">And then my husband retired and we moved to Florida.</span> <span id="s1249">And so I -- w-we moved and as I said before, my husband died -- it’ll be two years in May, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: So you started working in 1993, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Yeah, as soon a -- as soon as it opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: -- th-the building --</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah, when it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: -- wa -- wa -- you did not work with them preceding the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: -- when it was finished I worked in there.</span> <span id="s1256">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Wha-What ins -- why did you go to work for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Why I went to work for them?</span> <span id="s1259">Because I think through this museum, hopefully people will get the message what not to do to each other.</span> <span id="s1260">And it’s very important to me.</span> <span id="s1261">You see, I cannot bring back my parents, my family.</span> <span id="s1262">There’s nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s1263">But what I -- there is left for me to do is perhaps it shouldn’t happen to other people and other children.</span> <span id="s1264">And if I can do that, I would -- you know, this is my main priority at this point in my life, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: What kind of work do you do at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Now?</span> <span id="s1267">I am at the donor desk, the membership desk, I work.</span> <span id="s1268">And then I also -- I’m on the speaking bureau.</span> <span id="s1269">And whenever they need me, if they call me, I make it a priority to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: An-And where have you given talks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Well, in high schools.</span> <span id="s1272">And sometimes I talk to kids when they come in, they surround the desk there, and I will talk to them when they come in, if the teachers request it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: And -- and you tell them your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Not the complete story, because it’s impossible to tell the complete story.</span> <span id="s1275">I just focus in perhaps on -- I give them a -- I -- I give them a responsibility.</span> <span id="s1276">I tell them that it’s in their hands to make a better society and what they saw there is reality.</span> <span id="s1277">It’s not a motion picture, it was rea -- reality.</span> <span id="s1278">And to go out and make a better world.</span> <span id="s1279">That’s what I’m hoping they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Do you think working at the museum has affected your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Or -- or your memories of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1283">Has it affected those memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: I think working in the Holocaust is giving me a chance to take my mother’s message to people, and so that makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s1285">And I don’t know, I just -- I think I -- I enjoy working there, don’t ask me why, but I -- I enjoy working there.</span> <span id="s1286">I talk to people, different people, and I like it.</span> <span id="s1287">Some people have questions and I don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s1288">If I probably wouldn’t live through what I did, I probably would have lots of questions.</span> <span id="s1289">So I try to explain it the best way I know how that makes sense.</span> <span id="s1290">And as you know, the Germans were very, very suf -- e-efficient, by keeping -- by keeping track on where the Jews were going and what happened and all that.</span> <span id="s1291">So if they doubting my words, they can always go and pick up with some documents that were -- that we have today.</span> <span id="s1292">We don’t have it all because it wasn’t just Auschwitz that they were killing people in the Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s1293">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Are there any other special insights that you bring to the museum because you are a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Special insights.</span> <span id="s1296">Gee, I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s1297">The only th -- the -- well, the only thing that I feel I can explain this horror more than anybody else, because we all read about it and we all heard about it and we all saw -- see the documentaries that they have today of it, but I lived it.</span> <span id="s1298">And I think the person that lived it can really, really get it across somewhat a little better maybe than the educated and the teacher can.</span> <span id="s1299">And I tell them my purpose on earth today, and I hope they take me serious.</span> <span id="s1300">You know, as I said before, I would just like to see a better society, and if I can do something about it I would like to, the best way I know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: So you feel society could be made better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1303">I’ll tell you the truth, being that I was lucky enough to bring in thr-three kids i-into this world and given the chance to mold them, I think we can have a better society, because I know exactly how my kids feel.</span> <span id="s1304">I remember going to work in Germany and kids would be -- you know, near their picket fences in the house.</span> <span id="s1305">You know, kids 10 - 11 years old, something like that, playing.</span> <span id="s1306">And when they saw us pass by, they started spitting and screaming [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s1307">You see now, when kids are being brought up with this hate, I don’t really think they’re capable of loving other people, even though at that time they were hating the Jews.</span> <span id="s1308">But I think when you bring up kids hating, they eventually hate.</span> <span id="s1309">Their life will be a hate.</span> <span id="s1310">It’s very destructive, very destructive.</span> <span id="s1311">Very destructive.</span> <span id="s1312">So now I -- I really feel if my kids would be different people, I -- I -- I would say well, you know, there’s nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s1313">I understand -- I understand, being that my daughter is -- you know, she’s got a degree in microbiology that she -- she tells me a lot of people are, you know, born with certain genes, and I understand that.</span> <span id="s1314">I understand that, but you still have to nurture that gene.</span> <span id="s1315">And he -- he might -- he might have the gene of having red hair or black hair or whatever.</span> <span id="s1316">But the nurturing to make a person, I think it -- it -- it’s a big job.</span> <span id="s1317">To tell you the truth, I think if I would have known all that, maybe I would be afraid that I’m not capable of doing it, at that time, anyway.</span> <span id="s1318">But -- so I -- I definitely feel that if we can just somehow erase this hate, we will definitely have a better society, I do believe in that.</span> <span id="s1319">I do believe in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: When you meet other survivors, or friends of yours who are survivors, do you encourage them to work at the museum as a volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: I do.</span> <span id="s1322">But it is hard to explain.</span> <span id="s1323">As much as I talk about it, I still have difficulties.</span> <span id="s1324">And a lot of survivors grew older and weaker and they just cannot deal with their past, it’s too painful.</span> <span id="s1325">It’s very painful.</span> <span id="s1326">So everybody does the best they know how, but I can also understand it.</span> <span id="s1327">It’s a painful situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Do you belong to -- outside the museum, do you belong to any survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1330">I do, and we get together and we try to support each other.</span> <span id="s1331">Don’t forget, we survivors -- I mean, thank God that I -- you know, I have children and they made -- they made their own little families, one or two children, but we have nobody else on the outside.</span> <span id="s1332">So, believe it or not there’s some survivors that are dying, and if they -- you know, and if by some reason they could never have a child, or they had a child and unfortunately it’s not here, they really don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1333">So we -- we become their family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Wh-What is your relationship with the other volunteers at the museum who are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1335">Do you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1337">How shall I say it?</span> <span id="s1338">I have such strong, good feelings towards all the people that work in the Holocaust, whether they get paid or not, because I feel n-not only are they do -- especially the volunteers, they are trying to right the wrong by coming there and working there.</span> <span id="s1339">I once asked a gentleman, why -- why are you working here in this museum?</span> <span id="s1340">I call it a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1341">You could go out and get a job anyplace, at a happy place and have a happy day.</span> <span id="s1342">But I have to understand that other people that didn’t go through what I did, they have a different feeling.</span> <span id="s1343">But he -- he told me a story about his life.</span> <span id="s1344">He says, you know, I have a child -- I have a child that I love dearly and she is not as focused as another child is.</span> <span id="s1345">And when I think, would I have had this child in Germany?</span> <span id="s1346">I would have lost her.</span> <span id="s1347">And she makes my life.</span> <span id="s1348">She means so much in my life.</span> <span id="s1349">Because, as you know, the Germans were gassing their own children first, the sick ones.</span> <span id="s1350">Well, I don’t know whether this motivates him to be there, but I said to myself, if he told me this story, there must be a spark underneath there.</span> <span id="s1351">So everybody that works in this museum is trying to right the wrong, I think.</span> <span id="s1352">That’s the way I look at them, and I -- I love them all.</span> <span id="s1353">I feel very comfortable with them.</span> <span id="s1354">I almost feel like they’re my relatives.</span> <span id="s1355">I -- okay, no big deal.</span> <span id="s1356">I’ll just take a towel and wipe it off, no big deal.</span> <span id="s1357">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: We were talking about the -- your relationship, and even with the non-Jewish volunteers and staff at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1360">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1361">Matter of fact -- I don’t know if I should say it, the Jews, I expect them to be there, y-you know, but when I see a non-Jew as a volunteer, I really -- I really feel very good about it, very good about it.</span> <span id="s1362">Yes, I do, and I feel close to them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Have you exchanged your story with other volunteers that -- survivor volunteers at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Well, we all had different experiences, I want you to know.</span> <span id="s1365">We come from different places.</span> <span id="s1366">The truth is that we’re -- [phone ringing][tape break] -- yeah -- yeah, I -- I -- I like them all.</span> <span id="s1367">I like them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: And then I said something about -- talking about your experiences with the other survivors, but -- do you exchange your stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: S-Somewhat, but we really do not.</span> <span id="s1370">What we do is talk about our grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1371">Can -- I just feel bad that I forgot my daughter’s college.</span> <span id="s1372">Can I just mention it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: -- it was -- she went to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s1375">And Mishy, please forgive me, but sometimes my mind goes blank.</span> <span id="s1376">And -- and I have another grandson that went to Ithaca.</span> <span id="s1377">So Brian, again, please forgive me, but I always think about you anyway.</span> <span id="s1378">My mind sometimes goes blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: You -- you did talk about some very memorable experiences you had in the museum, such as talking to that woman whose father was an SS officer.</span> <span id="s1380">You -- you had told us about this special experience you had with this woman whose father had been an SS officer.</span> <span id="s1381">Are there any other memorable experiences that you’ve had at the museum when you were down there volunteering?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Oh, I have a lot.</span> <span id="s1383">You know, it will take forever for me to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1384">Well, th -- that experience with this lady, it wasn’t in the Holocaust Museum, it was in the Children’s Museum on -- on -- you know, on Third Street, I spoke there, too.</span> <span id="s1385">In the Holocaust Museum, I -- at one time -- he was from Germany, you know, and he was very upset, and he s -- comes over to me and he says to me, you have a nerve to -- to -- to have this Holocaust Museum here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1386">Why don’t you have a museum what you did to the Indians?</span> <span id="s1387">I s -- and I saw he was very upset and I knew I can’t make a lot of noises there, because people will come over and will make a scene.</span> <span id="s1388">I begged him to sit down.</span> <span id="s1389">Actually, you know, I was trying to be very nice to him to calm him down.</span> <span id="s1390">And he did -- he did sit, he sat down and he was shooting off at the nu -- United States, I’ll tell you, it’s not enough that I was hurting from the Holocaust, but then he started about the United States, I’ll tell you -- I -- I mean -- but I knew that I have to be patient with him, that I am in the museum and I cannot afford on having a -- a scene there.</span> <span id="s1391">So after he stopped talking, I said to him, you know, I let you talk now for about five, six minutes, right?</span> <span id="s1392">And now, allow me to say something, and I’m not going to talk for five, six minutes.</span> <span id="s1393">I just want you to know that the United States talks about what happened to the Indians.</span> <span id="s1394">In the United States we teach our children what happened to the uni -- to the Indians.</span> <span id="s1395">Tell me, do you teach your children what happened in the Holocaust, what your ancestors did?</span> <span id="s1396">So don’t tell me -- and come telling me what the United States has the right to do and not the right to do.</span> <span id="s1397">And as you see, we in the United States constantly are trying to right the wrong.</span> <span id="s1398">Are you doing the same thing?</span> <span id="s1399">Even today, you know, there is a lot of Arab -- you know, different countries people, there are -- still discriminated.</span> <span id="s1400">They still cannot tolerate them.</span> <span id="s1401">We have a melting pot here.</span> <span id="s1402">People from all over the world, they come here and they find a -- a secure place.</span> <span id="s1403">At least their life are -- aren’t threatened.</span> <span id="s1404">Does your country do the same thing?</span> <span id="s1405">Well, then he left.</span> <span id="s1406">Well, I -- you know, you get in different characters.</span> <span id="s1407">I-I’m not blaming all German society about it, but you get these people in.</span> <span id="s1408">Some of them are very happy, some of them -- some of them -- well, I get so many, you know, I could talk for a di -- shall I tell you what happened once?</span> <span id="s1409">That was in the museum.</span> <span id="s1410">You know, we work right there as people come down from the museum, and she was a -- she was a mature lady and she came down and I see her cry, so I thought maybe she got sick, so I took a chair and gave it to her to sit down and sh-she just you know, goes back and forth.</span> <span id="s1411">I says, lady, you know, I would very much like to help you.</span> <span id="s1412">And she looks at me and she still wouldn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s1413">And then she stays there and cries.</span> <span id="s1414">I says, you know, I wish I could help you.</span> <span id="s1415">So I pulled her over to the desk and I says, please sit down.</span> <span id="s1416">Then, after awhile sort of, she loosened up and she says to me, she’s so upset.</span> <span id="s1417">I says, tell me, why are you so upset?</span> <span id="s1418">She says, well you know -- she must have been a religious lady.</span> <span id="s1419">She says, you know, Jesus was a Jew, and when he’ll find out what happened to the Jews, how will I explain it?</span> <span id="s1420">I says -- at first I didn’t catch on, but then I says to her, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1421">She says, well you know, when I die, I’ll meet Jesus and he might ask me and I will not know how to explain.</span> <span id="s1422">I says, look, lady -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen Goldkind, and this is tape number three, side B, and you were talking about the woman who was so upset about after she died and she would have to tell Jesus what happened to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: So I said to her, you know, I-I’m Jewish, I said to her.</span> <span id="s1425">But in our religion everybody is responsible of their own actions.</span> <span id="s1426">So please, did you kill any of these Jews?</span> <span id="s1427">She says no, I wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1428">I says, believe me, I know you wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1429">And -- so don’t just -- maybe you’ll tell him you didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1430">And she still couldn’t swallow it, sh-she couldn’t swallow it.</span> <span id="s1431">But she was sitting there for awhile and we were exchanging what she believes in and what I believe in and somehow I made her feel that, you know what?</span> <span id="s1432">There are some very -- you know, there are a lot of guilty people.</span> <span id="s1433">I mean, I don’t want to say -- you know, I have to say first there’s a lot of guilty people, but also you know, we’re all responsible.</span> <span id="s1434">And I think that’s the way she felt.</span> <span id="s1435">That’s exactly the way she felt, that we are all responsible.</span> <span id="s1436">I think her religion made her feel like that.</span> <span id="s1437">And I thought that was a nice lady, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget her either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: You mean that we’re all responsible for each other?</span> <span id="s1439">Ri -- is that what you mean, or responsible for the guilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: In a way we all responsible because you see, if there would be enough people to say, we cannot gas a million and a half children, then the world would hear it, but there was a silence.</span> <span id="s1441">So they didn’t take the responsibility of -- of saying it.</span> <span id="s1442">That sh -- he or she carries the responsibility, she is saying, wait a minute, I don’t like that.</span> <span id="s1443">If there would be more people crying and saying that, i-i -- you know, a tragedy like this wouldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s1444">So she sticks out in my mind.</span> <span id="s1445">I hugged her and we parted as friends, sort of, and I was glad that I got an opportunity to talk to her, and it was a good experience for me too, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: When you come into the museum, when you walk into the building every time, do you have a special feeling?</span> <span id="s1447">When you cross the threshold, when you walk in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Your -- your -- you’re not going to believe this.</span> <span id="s1449">Wi -- you know, I walk in here, I walk in there and if I see people coming, it makes me very happy.</span> <span id="s1450">And if I see that people stop coming, I s-say to myself, oh my God, I hope these doors never close, because we need to learn, this place is so important.</span> <span id="s1451">You know what, I think perhaps it’s even more important than I -- you know -- even though, you know, I -- I think universities are very important, especially to me, because I’m not an educated person, a-and -- but I think this museum is even more important because maybe we can educate people to be better.</span> <span id="s1452">And you know, there are -- the reason why I say this is this, because at this point today we know that the uneducated people were trying to save the Jew, and the educated people, like Mengele and thousands of others could commit this at-atrocity.</span> <span id="s1453">You se -- you understand what I’m trying to say?</span> <span id="s1454">So, you know, I think if a person isn’t educated, but if h-he is brought up with the idea that we should be different and we can be different, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s1455">We think we’re very sophisticated and you know, as human beings, but we’re capable of doing a lot of unthinkable things, and that needs to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Are there any particular parts of the museum and their exhibits that you identify with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: All of it, what shall I tell you?</span> <span id="s1458">All of it.</span> <span id="s1459">I went through all this, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s1460">All this, it’s hard to believe.</span> <span id="s1461">It’s hard to believe, all this, wherever I go.</span> <span id="s1462">I look at the little windows and I remember I -- you know, every little thing has got a story for me there.</span> <span id="s1463">You know, as we were going to Auschwitz we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s1464">So I was li -- you know, y -- a -- next to my brother, I was, you know, the yo -- the younger.</span> <span id="s1465">And they pulled me up to look outside, I wanted to see what’s going on outside, and we were passing farms where people were working on the farms.</span> <span id="s1466">And they’re motioning with their hands across their throat that we’re going to be, you know -- and when I said it, I didn’t even think about it twice, because who would think, I’m a healthy person, that somebody is going to want to kill me.</span> <span id="s1467">I just didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s1468">To tell you the truth, I wasn’t affected by it.</span> <span id="s1469">So, the window -- then I see these farmers, they’re motioning this to me -- everything, everything, everything.</span> <span id="s1470">I take a look around and I see my life.</span> <span id="s1471">Everything, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: So you intend to keep working at the museum as long as you can?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1474">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1475">I think I want this to be, how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s1476">My last breath.</span> <span id="s1477">Maybe I’m too strong about it, but as long as I can do it, I’ll -- this is where I want to -- I think that’s where I belong.</span> <span id="s1478">Sometimes I go with the subway and I say to -- you know, there’s a funny feeling [indecipherable] says, you know, I think I’m gonna -- I’m gonna visit my family, you know?</span> <span id="s1479">I get such crazy thoughts.</span> <span id="s1480">I don’t know why, but it’s silly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: You mean you -- you feel when you go in there you’re visiting your family, is that what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1483">I reach out to them, in my head, in my heart, I don’t know, it’s -- you know, I hate to say it because it doesn’t sound normal, but sometimes yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Have you been back to Europe at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: My husband wanted to go to see Auschwitz and I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s1488">I really didn’t, I was fighting it off and finally he says, you know, ra -- Helen, I understand it’s difficult for you, but I have to go.</span> <span id="s1489">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1490">And so what -- he decided that he has to go, I says, well, I have to go with him.</span> <span id="s1491">So we went once to Auschwitz with a group.</span> <span id="s1492">And he -- he made a prayer there, for all of them actually, for all of them.</span> <span id="s1493">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Did -- did you go -- you went inside the camp?</span> <span id="s1495">You were able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Can you cut it, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1498">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: The most important thing in my life I already lost, so whatever, you know, I don’t take it to -- you know?</span> <span id="s1500">Some people get upset, sometimes I look at them -- over really things they shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1501">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: We were talking about that you went back with your husband to Auschwitz and I asked if you went inside the camp when you went on your visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: You see, people that go to see this camp, really, they took apart the camp.</span> <span id="s1504">They left there a few barracks.</span> <span id="s1505">The gas chamber was there.</span> <span id="s1506">For me, I saw the whole thing the way it was, but my husband didn’t really see it the way it was.</span> <span id="s1507">So -- course everybody was sad and crying there because we knew, we all knew the loss and what went on there.</span> <span id="s1508">But it’s different.</span> <span id="s1509">It’s different than when I was there.</span> <span id="s1510">It’s different.</span> <span id="s1511">And I was so upset, let me tell you that.</span> <span id="s1512">They have a -- like a museum, at least when I was there, I don’t know what’s going on there today.</span> <span id="s1513">They have a museum there with pictures, and names.</span> <span id="s1514">And we had a guide, and I looked at these pictures, because you know, it doesn’t matter whether you’re Jewish or not Jewish, you look the same to me.</span> <span id="s1515">People look the same.</span> <span id="s1516">But then I noticed there was a lot -- that there wasn’t any Jewish names that you would call.</span> <span id="s1517">And I look around and I spend some time there, I couldn’t believe this.</span> <span id="s1518">So I said to myself, it’s -- maybe it’s me, because you know, it’s maybe -- but there weren’t any Jewish names under these pictures.</span> <span id="s1519">So I go over to the guide, I says, listen, can you explain me something, because I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1520">You know, I’m the one who was here in Auschwitz and I brought here my whole family, 89 people, tell me how come that there isn’t a name that has a -- sort of a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1521">She says to me, well you know -- you know, you remember when you came to Auschwitz you had to take your valise and throw it in the ditch?</span> <span id="s1522">I says yes, I remember, I -- I do remember.</span> <span id="s1523">And so we don’t have any documents who came here as a Jew, but we do have the documents who came here that weren’t Jews.</span> <span id="s1524">So I said to her, you know what?</span> <span id="s1525">You told me something new that I didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s1526">I didn’t know that there were some s -- because this is a destruction camp, and I didn't know that there were some non-Jews came here to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1527">I knew there were in different camps, some people that resisted Hitler, but I didn’t think they came all the way to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1528">So you just told me something new.</span> <span id="s1529">So it’s okay, now I will understand it.</span> <span id="s1530">But [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1531">So she told me there are no Jewish names because there is no record of it, that Jews were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1532">I says, you mean to say a million and a half children that you know went to the gas chamber here and there wasn’t one name of a child?</span> <span id="s1533">I was so upset there, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s1534">I was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s1535">I don’t know what they did with the rest of it there now.</span> <span id="s1536">I don’t know what’s going on, but I better don’t go there because today I can’t take the pain any more.</span> <span id="s1537">I-I’m too old.</span> <span id="s1538">So when you talk about this Holocaust Museum, we scraped here a few documents, there a few documents.</span> <span id="s1539">I mean, they can say a hundred years from today it doesn’t even happen because we don’t have no documents of any kind.</span> <span id="s1540">So I think that’s important there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Well, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: That’s my experience with Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Did you go back to where you lived?</span> <span id="s1544">Did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: No, they didn’t le-let us go there because the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: So we -- I couldn’t go there and I really didn’t want to go there to face these people, I don’t think I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Because it would be very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1550">It would be very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1551">Not that it wasn’t difficult to go to Auschwitz, but it would be more -- it would be just as difficult over there.</span> <span id="s1552">Don’t forget, these people lived there for generations and generations and generations and generations.</span> <span id="s1553">In the wit -- with -- way they made us -- way they made us look, like we were less than rats to these people.</span> <span id="s1554">So how can they look at me and have any respect for me?</span> <span id="s1555">And why should I go there?</span> <span id="s1556">The world is plenty big and it will take generations and generations to come for Europe to recuperate to see a Jew as any other normal person, I want to tell you that.</span> <span id="s1557">The damage that was done there, that’s the way I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Do you get reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: What is your feeling about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Oh well, I’ll have to tell you the story about it.</span> <span id="s1562">In the beginning I didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1563">Oh, when I heard it, I -- I c -- I cried, I carried on, and I says, there is no money to pay me what they took away from me, it’s ridiculous, I says, I -- I don’t want it and I was fighting it.</span> <span id="s1564">It took me maybe two years with my husband back and forth.</span> <span id="s1565">You see, he -- I was emotional about it and he was realistic about it.</span> <span id="s1566">He couldn’t reach me and I couldn’t reach him.</span> <span id="s1567">So finally, what did the sale from him, where he, you know, sort of hit the nail o-o-on the head, is telling me, you know, Helen, I know you don’t want this money, but what you should do is take this money and help other people that are suffering.</span> <span id="s1568">And I said to myself, now maybe -- maybe I’m just -- maybe reality, that’s what the -- realistically that’s what I should do.</span> <span id="s1569">But for a long time I was very emotional about it, that I couldn’t even think realistically.</span> <span id="s1570">So -- but that’s what I did, that’s exactly what I do.</span> <span id="s1571">I never use a penny of it, never, because I would feel like I want to, you know.</span> <span id="s1572">So then I says, you know, I did send this check there and there and I’m hoping that m-made somebody feel better.</span> <span id="s1573">I do that.</span> <span id="s1574">I do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: What was it like for you to become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: And what does it mean to you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: I need to get on my va -- vocabulary isn’t too big, and I need -- sometimes when I’m looking for a certain word I have to think about it, and I still don’t get it.</span> <span id="s1579">I was delighted to become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1580">I -- I -- I bless America as much as -- you know, to me, being a -- I’m not saying it’s perfect, but for a person like me, I see the United States a little bit different than other people do, different.</span> <span id="s1581">Because the other people feel that this is the way life is, and that’s the way, you know -- I love the United States and I am delighted that I, you know, i-if I want to make myself feel good, as I said before, I -- I says, I gave the United States three kids that are the best of citizens and a -- I -- I-I really love the United States.</span> <span id="s1582">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1583">If I hear somebody complaining, which there’s plenty complaints, I very patiently listen, you know, I listen, and -- but I always want to debate it.</span> <span id="s1584">I don’t let it just go.</span> <span id="s1585">I feel th -- I showed the other side of the coin and I have so much material to show on the other side of the coin, but I never let it go.</span> <span id="s1586">Just like I would speak up for this child that is in danger, that’s how I feel about the United States.</span> <span id="s1587">I need to speak up, and I do.</span> <span id="s1588">I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Well, speaking of these three wonderful citizens that you gave to the United States, is there any message that you wanted to leave for your children or your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I wish I could find some words of wisdom.</span> <span id="s1591">I used to tell my husband to do that.</span> <span id="s1592">Well first, I’m just lucky to have -- to ha -- you know, I know life comes to an end, I’m just lucky that I had the opportunity of experiencing even to have my children.</span> <span id="s1593">And not only are -- are they wonderful children to me, but they’re just -- they’re just very good citizens.</span> <span id="s1594">I feel if my children are around someplace or somewheres where somebody will be [indecipherable] I have a feeling that they will want to be there the first ones.</span> <span id="s1595">My grandchildren are like I can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1596">They’re such a big part of my good feeling in.</span> <span id="s1597">They’re such nice kids, all of them, all of them, all of them.</span> <span id="s1598">And well, in the end, I -- you know, I just want to say that God took away a lot from me, but he also gave me back a lot.</span> <span id="s1599">And my hope and pray is that they take good care of themselves and they continue in this world, being a model for society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Are your children named after anybody in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: My daughter, when she was born there were so many names.</span> <span id="s1602">In the meantime I didn’t have a mother and Abe didn’t have a mother.</span> <span id="s1603">So, how do -- what do we do with all these names?</span> <span id="s1604">I wanted to name her a dozen names.</span> <span id="s1605">So I se -- I said to Abe, well, you know what?</span> <span id="s1606">Today we’ll ma -- you know, Monday we’ll call her this, Tuesday we’ll call her that.</span> <span id="s1607">It was such a crazy thought to me, honestly, I remember.</span> <span id="s1608">So he was laughing, he says, you know you’re not being realistic.</span> <span id="s1609">We need a name.</span> <span id="s1610">So finally he said we’ll -- half of my mother’s name and a half of my husband’s name.</span> <span id="s1611">So that was the compromise.</span> <span id="s1612">My second daughter came and Abe had his father.</span> <span id="s1613">So here I -- I wanted to name her after my father, because I didn't think I’m gonna have more children.</span> <span id="s1614">We just thought of having two children.</span> <span id="s1615">So that was big problem.</span> <span id="s1616">Here this beautiful little kid is born and we want to name her after my father.</span> <span id="s1617">And so my husband went all over the city to look for a name that you can translate from a man’s name to a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1618">He went to the synagogues, to the library, he brought me all kinds of books to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1619">And finally we found the name, and so she is named after my father, and we named her Michelle.</span> <span id="s1620">This is my second.</span> <span id="s1621">But I’ll tell you, it was such an anxiety every time we would have to pick a name, because we needed to give these kid -- kids 16 names, like never before, you know?</span> <span id="s1622">So it was a big thing to us, my husband spent a few days on figuring out how should we name this beautiful child.</span> <span id="s1623">So it -- and then my son.</span> <span id="s1624">So then my son came and, you know, so already my father had a name and of course my oldest brother also got killed by picking mines.</span> <span id="s1625">So I wanted that name badly and my husband was trying to accommodate me because e-even though he had a big loss, too, you know, all of his relatives were in Europe.</span> <span id="s1626">But he knew that meant a lot to me, so he says okay, we going to name this child after your family, he ga -- so he says -- so I says, you know, I want to name him after my oldest brother, something.</span> <span id="s1627">He says, but you know, in the Jewish faith, you cannot name a child after a young person.</span> <span id="s1628">So he says, I’ll tell you what, let’s name him after your brother and after my grandfather, so [indecipherable] his name is Larry.</span> <span id="s1629">So -- but it was a bi -- you know, you brought up a very good point, that was a big thing in our lives, how we planned on these kids, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: And what are your grandchildren’s names?</span> <span id="s1631">You can just go down the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Okay, now -- who their name is -- who their name aft --</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Well, if you [indecipherable] fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Okay, the first grandchildren that were born, they were all named after my husband’s father, because that -- you know, he died.</span> <span id="s1635">So this is her -- was his wish.</span> <span id="s1636">And of course, as good as these kids were, they wanted to please him, and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1637">And with Evan, my son-in-law’s grandma died when he was born, so Michelle said that would be nice to do, because -- but of course, he was a boy, they called him Evan.</span> <span id="s1638">And then Brian, Brian my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Number two grandchild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: -- number thr -- num [phone ringing][tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: We were talking about the names of your grandchildren, so can you go down the line and name them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1643">My oldest daughter’s children are Jason, Edina and Fefy.</span> <span id="s1644">My younger daughter’s children’s name are Darren, Evan and Brian.</span> <span id="s1645">My son’s children are Josh, Clifford, Jessica and Matthew.</span> <span id="s1646">And they are the greatest, all of them.</span> <span id="s1647">All -- all are the greatest kids.</span> <span id="s1648">I’m just lucky having them, the truth, that’s the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say that we haven’t covered today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: I-I’m glad that I had an opportunity to be recorded and heard.</span> <span id="s1651">And I -- I hope whoever’s gonna listen to my tape that will learn something.</span> <span id="s1652">And again, I mentioned it so many times that I wil -- that they -- they’ll try and make the world a little better, and I don’t know, that -- that’s what I would like to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Well, that’s a wonderful note to end on.</span> <span id="s1654">Thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s1655">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Helen
