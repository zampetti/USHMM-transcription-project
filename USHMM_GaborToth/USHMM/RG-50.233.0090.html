Germans was very good to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s158">There were prisoners and they were good.</span> <span id="s159">He say he cannot believe Hitler can change the situation.</span> <span id="s160">Because, in this time I think Wilhelm was the president of Germany and this become when Hitler came to the power and he changed.</span> <span id="s161">I remember when the war with Russia he told me he say I cannot believe he will kill us for what.</span> <span id="s162">The people we live in village, we Jewish people we live good with all the people because in the village was not a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s163">Maybe 5 families, not more, and we didn’t know the difference between us and the Ukraine people.</span> <span id="s164">Everything was together, most Ukraine

the father say, ‘no, why we’ll go, where we’ll go, who knows how we need to leave the home, we need to leave everything, where we will live and it was a big mistake, a big mistake when the father said we will go to Russia”.</span> <span id="s169">A lot of people they escaped from Germany.</span> <span id="s170">I don’t know how it will be when we left; no the father didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s171">He say we stay in our village.</span> <span id="s172">He say the Germans say we will work, we work and we will cooperate, for working.</span> <span id="s173">No, it was a big difference.</span> <span id="s174">Not only to work.</span> <span id="s175">They began to kill us.</span> <span id="s176">That begins the trouble.</span> <span id="s177">A couple, the Germans begin to come to us in 10 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: That was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s180">In ten days the Germans were in our -- I remember, I see them

id="s183">We feel this time we would have trouble.</span> <span id="s184">My father, he speak very well German and he was talking with one older, the young people was very bad.</span> <span id="s185">The older Germans was much, much better.</span> <span id="s186">One German, I remember the father explained to me, one German told him, you are Jewish, you’ll have a lot of trouble, he told him.</span> <span id="s187">It was late.</span> <span id="s188">The Germans are here, you cannot go anywhere and he told us, the father.</span> <span id="s189">Yes, a German soldier told him we will have a lot of trouble and in 10 days after they came, we feel what it was begin to done to us.</span> <span id="s190">The helpers was the Russian_________ (can’t understand).</span> <span

town.</span> <span id="s193">Can you tell me a little bit about what happened then?</span> <span id="s194">I mean, how they came in, did they seize property and businesses and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: When Russia came to us, we didn’t got no troubles.</span> <span id="s196">They came, they begin to work, they didn’t say nothing,__________, it was everybody was feeling like the Ukraine people and it was not bad.</span> <span id="s197">We begin to work for the government.</span> <span id="s198">I was beginning to work.</span> <span id="s199">I got no more

know a lot of stuff what was going on.</span> <span id="s208">And I remember he begin to teach me.</span> <span id="s209">I told him, “People, I don’t know from what to begin?”</span> <span

didn’t left this place and go to Russia.</span> <span id="s214">When I take the money from the stores, they bring all the money to me and I put them in the bank to Menibish.</span> <span id="s215">When it begins the war, I got money, I got the government’s money.</span> <span id="s216">Then they come to me at nighttime, the Ukrainian people to take the money.</span> <span

room.</span> <span id="s385">Nobody begin to cry.</span> <span id="s386">I can’t express to you the situation.</span> <span id="s387">I will never forget, I came in the basement.</span> <span id="s388">You don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s389">If you don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s390">If you don’t talk, a person deals with life what comes on every day and if you begin to

home with father, father would begin to cry and I would begin to cry and call mother, mother and nobody answered.</span> <span id="s394">Now we understand what they brought us and they told us to take all the stuff what’s in the apartments and in the houses and we begin to do this.</span> <span id="s395">A lot of people we saw what was killed in the apartments and outside.</span> <span id="s396">And they tell us to take the people they shot, the bodies, we take them in the wagons and somebody takes them to this place where they kill.</span> <span id="s397">It was outside.</span> <span id="s398">They stay -- the Germans and the police, they say what are we doing, faster, faster, faster.</span> <span id="s399">Everything, but we take everything.</span> <span id="s400">Don’t leave nothing.</span> <span id="s401">Boxes, in the wagons, put them.</span> <span id="s402">We do that job and it’s left 50 or 60 persons, I don’t know exactly how many persons, they tell us, now you can live in these buildings.</span> <span id="s403">We do not touch you.</span> <span id="s404">It’s left old people.</span> <span id="s405">They killed some in the family’s children or they killed the parents, the children left or the husband they killed, the wife left.</span> <span id="s406">It was not any family that came but was all the family in life.</span> <span id="s407">We began to stay in this place again and we were working the same in the German farm.</span> <span id="s408">They take us to the farm, they take us to clean up where the horses stay.</span> <span id="s409">Clean the

stuff and maybe something can happen today or tomorrow, after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s412">It was why he came to take this.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">(END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1) We stay maybe

what the guy say what the German take from him all the gold stuff what he need to work around that.</span> <span id="s418">We was sleeping in the farm.</span> <span id="s419">One night we stayed with

id="s424">We come only to see down somebody.</span> <span id="s425">The Germans with the police, they come very quiet.</span> <span id="s426">They were knowing what somebody’s inside.</span> <span id="s427">When they see us,_____________ that’s in German.</span> <span id="s428">We, with the father, we come down from the ladder, come down and see a German one or two, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s429">They begin to beat us.</span> <span id="s430">They beat me, beat the father.</span> <span id="s431">The father begin to talk to them in German, they didn’t want to talk at all.</span> <span id="s432">I see he beat the father and beat me and a couple of minutes it begin to keep a lot of people but they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s433">They left but they didn’t go to the ghetto too.</span> <span id="s434">Then they take us again brought to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s435">We come to the ghetto we see this –p- stay trucks and police, a lot of police and Germans.</span> <span id="s436">Germans was in forms was what kind of soldier I don’t know, was in black forms.</span> <span id="s437">A color like that, that was the SS.</span> <span id="s438">The SS and green colors uniforms.</span> <span id="s439">We see what they stay around the ghetto, they took us in the ghetto and we stay in the house.</span> <span id="s440">How many people they can put in one room or two rooms in the buildings, they put us.</span> <span id="s441">Then maybe by one o’clock or two o’clock daytime, comes the first truck to the door where they can take people.</span> <span id="s442">They make like a corridor, they stay the Germans, the police with like ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Clubs or truncheons?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Like the police

run.</span> <span id="s447">In house, I told you what it was, was there’s a guy what told us he was a couple more.</span> <span id="s448">They say we have a gun.</span> <span id="s449">We’ll go, the young people, we’ll go form in the truck.</span> <span id="s450">Maybe we can save our life.</span> <span id="s451">He said I will begin to shoot and everybody will help me or --.</span> <span id="s452">I come to my father and tell him, you know let me, we’ll go together.</span> <span id="s453">That’s when we were inside the house, maybe we’ll have a chance to run away.</span> <span id="s454">He told me, no, son, I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t want to see your death and you will not see mine.</span> <span id="s456">I went and a couple people more, we come ourselves to the door.</span> <span id="s457">They hit us and we come on the truck.</span> <span id="s458">They put us on the truck.</span> <span id="s459">If you sit, you straight up your feet straight and on your feet sit another person.</span> <span id="s460">I got the chance to sit, it was my back -- in the back truck in the corner.</span> <span id="s461">____________ they put us and we

the guy what he said he has the gun, he begin -- he take two shot, he didn’t work the gun and they killed him straight.</span> <span id="s464">When they killed him, I was sitting in left side and I jumped from the truck on the floor.</span> <span id="s465">I know I hit my face, it was blood and I begin to run, run from the truck.</span> <span id="s466">You know what was difference people, it was

id="s471">Now when somebody tells me to jump this fence, tell me you can kill me, I will not jump.</span> <span id="s472">This time it was so, was so to life to be like that.</span> <span id="s473">Hr begin to shot after me.</span> <span id="s474">He shot me two, three times.</span> <span id="s475">He didn’t shot me and I come in a barn.</span> <span id="s476">It was a pig and I jumped where the pig -- I know what somebody’s running after me.</span> <span id="s477">I see what to do.</span> <span id="s478">In Poland or in Russia, it was a small barn.</span> <span id="s479">Then you can go up,
