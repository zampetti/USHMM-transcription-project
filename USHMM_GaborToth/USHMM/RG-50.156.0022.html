History Project being conducted by the Jewish Community Relations Council Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas.</span> <span id="s5">This is Rhoda Lewin doing the interview and today is March 9, 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I came from a very religious family.</span> <span id="s7">My mother was very religious, because she was coming from a rabbi’s family, and my father also was very religious.</span> <span id="s8">My father had a very warm home, with lots of love and just the best parents in the whole wide world.</span> <span id="s9">My mother, she lost her parents very early, and she was growing up very difficult, from one relative to the other one.</span> <span id="s10">She was the older and she had sisters - six or seven, seven, I guess.</span> <span id="s11">And when she got older and can make money, then she was working and she was helping the sisters, the brothers, until they all got married.</span> <span id="s12">I remember our house always was full with kids, and one aunt was not much older than I was.</span> <span id="s13">My father, he was a very good man.</span> <span id="s14">He was very good-looking, tall, blonde.</span> <span id="s15">And always he helped my mother and it never was too much, helping my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s16">My mother was a tiny little woman just half of my father’s size.</span> <span id="s17">Always we were wondering, how can she find my father.</span> <span id="s18">It was a joke.</span> <span id="s19">They had a very nice life.</span> <span id="s20">My father loved my mother, and my mother always said she never wanted to survive one minute without my father.</span> <span id="s21">Unfortunately, he doesn’t survive.</span> <span id="s22">He...she...died together.</span> <span id="s23">He was in the war, and he was injured.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: In World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s26">In the right hand, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s27">After this he was back and he was still working in the army ‘til the war was over.</span> <span id="s28">He has another story, his family, because he was not from my town; he was in a different town, a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What city was this that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: That was Transylvania and the city was Maroshvashsyeh; then was changed and was Tirgu-Mures.</span> <span id="s31">There was ten children.</span> <span id="s32">My grandmother was really religious.</span> <span id="s33">You know at that time the very Orthodox wore a wig.</span> <span id="s34">But not my mother.</span> <span id="s35">No.</span> <span id="s36">My mother was Orthodox, she was doing everything for my father, but did not cut her hair, no way.</span> <span id="s37">So my grandmother lost her husband after they had ten children, four girls and six boys.</span> <span id="s38">She lived in the village close to the town where I was born.</span> <span id="s39">In this village was a princess.</span> <span id="s40">the name was Thebinger.</span> <span id="s41">The princess liked very much my grandmother and the kids, and my grandmother was working very hard, to keep them clean.</span> <span id="s42">So this princess was helping my grandmother, and sent the kids to the school.</span> <span id="s43">She was a Christian, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s44">My father was sent to school and he was supervising, a manager in the forest.</span> <span id="s45">You know in a forest they cut lumber.</span> <span id="s46">He was working all the time for a large company.</span> <span id="s47">He was speaking German, he was traveling in Austria for business.</span> <span id="s48">A very fat gentleman was the boss and he sent him to doing business with other countries.</span> <span id="s49">He was smart.</span> <span id="s50">The young one, my father’s brother, was always looking for girls.</span> <span id="s51">Then, finally, he married with a shiksa, with a non-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s52">That was a great tragedy for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s53">She was doing everything like he was dead.</span> <span id="s54">This I tell you because finally this brother of my father, he was deportation, after he has seven children, one girl and six boys, who was in the army and was in the front in the second world war.</span> <span id="s55">He was executed in Auschwitz with my father, together.</span> <span id="s56">So that’s why I tell you.</span> <span id="s57">At home we was like a middle class.</span> <span id="s58">Not rich and not poor.</span> <span id="s59">We have everything.</span> <span id="s60">We was nice dressed all the time.</span> <span id="s61">Our house was full with food because my father brought the best food from the forest there and he has always a good salary and always was enough to have everything.</span> <span id="s62">We was going to the Jewish school, which is private.</span> <span id="s63">And always, all the time we grew up, all the time aunts was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Aunts and cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">Her cousins.</span> <span id="s67">And aunts, not cousins, because I was so young.</span> <span id="s68">So I had one sister and two brother.</span> <span id="s69">Two brother I had that alive in Israel, and my sister died not long ago, also in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Let’s back up a minute and, would you mind telling me when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: How old I am?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: It’s necessary?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Approximately.</span> <span id="s75">How old were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I’m sixty-seven.</span> <span id="s77">No, sixty-six.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And were you the oldest of the four children?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No, I was the third.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s81">It’s just good to know how old you were when the Germans came in, and so on.</span> <span id="s82">You were going to the private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, we was going to the private school.</span> <span id="s84">I tell you because some people cannot afford this.</span> <span id="s85">But that did not mean we was rich, just we had a nice education.</span> <span id="s86">Also we learned to pray all the time.</span> <span id="s87">My brother was five years in, like, Ukrainia.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: A work battalion.</span> <span id="s89">Now was this a government-sponsored program by the Hungarian government?</span> <span id="s90">Or do you mean he was with the Zionist group?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span> <span id="s92">I was born in Rumania, Transylvania, not Hungary.</span> <span id="s93">But in 1940 was coming the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s94">‘Til then we have a nice family and a very nice life.</span> <span id="s95">We have everything in Rumania.</span> <span id="s96">Rumania was not Paris, but everyone was living.</span> <span id="s97">No one was sleeping in street and no one was hungry.</span> <span id="s98">Now is nothing there.</span> <span id="s99">In ‘40, everything was changed.</span> <span id="s100">In ‘40 my youngest brother went to the army.</span> <span id="s101">He was twenty-one.</span> <span id="s102">After couple of months there was not any more soldiers.</span> <span id="s103">He was transferred to the war battalion.</span> <span id="s104">My sister was married in ‘39 and she was living in Bucharest, which was the capitol of Rumania.</span> <span id="s105">She was not deportation, I find out when I came home.</span> <span id="s106">My two brothers in war battalions, one was four years and the other almost two.</span> <span id="s107">In ‘44, I remember the seder table was nice, and my father was praying, and we was crying with my mother.</span> <span id="s108">And then, (hits table twice), just a knock on the door and was coming Hungarian soldier and two other persons insisting, “You have sewing machine.”</span> <span id="s109">I said, “Yes, I have.”</span> <span id="s110">He says, “Bring it.</span> <span id="s111">We have to take.”</span> <span id="s112">Then he take all through the house, and left.</span> <span id="s113">I was working as tailor, when my brother was taken and we needed the money.</span> <span id="s114">I was working hard, but I was making good money and my parents never needed nothing.</span> <span id="s115">Was no problem.</span> <span id="s116">Also, my sister from Bucharest used to send, with one man who was the youngest brother of her husband, in Bucharest, who crossed to our town, silk stockings, blouses, underwear.</span> <span id="s117">And always she was running to the train.</span> <span id="s118">My brother-in-law was a very good man, down there in Bucharest, and he was looking for this guy who brought the package for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Were these things for you to wear?</span> <span id="s120">Or were these things for you to sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: My sister sent them for selling.</span> <span id="s122">You know that silk stockings, you can’t wear two dozen!</span> <span id="s123">So then, this stopped.</span> <span id="s124">After the first seder night, they don’t let go to the market, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s125">Just only ten o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: These were the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s128">And then start to take the bike, the radio, the cars, everything.</span> <span id="s129">Almost don’t let nothing to use, the Jewish.</span> <span id="s130">First it was taking in ghetto, which was in a factory.</span> <span id="s131">Not this (knocking on table); the solid houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Oh, the brick burners, the places where they made the bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s134">Yes.</span> <span id="s135">We was taken there.</span> <span id="s136">In our town was two or three like this.</span> <span id="s137">But many, many years they hadn’t been used.</span> <span id="s138">One day my father came home from the synagogue - he used to go every evening to the synagogue - he came home and said, “It’s something very wrong coming.</span> <span id="s139">The people was talking.</span> <span id="s140">We’ll be taken to the ghetto, and the ghetto is going to be nobody knows where.”</span> <span id="s141">My mother says, “Don’t tell me, because this is making me cry.”</span> <span id="s142">But I heard and I said, “Why don’t you ask what the rabbi says?”</span> <span id="s143">Then after a couple of days one evening my father was coming home, and he says in the synagogue was a Polish.</span> <span id="s144">He says there happened terrible things.</span> <span id="s145">There is ghetto, has been killed the people.</span> <span id="s146">And he collect dresses and money and everything for the people in Poland.</span> <span id="s147">So I give two dresses, my mother says, “You don’t have to listen because the Polish people, and who can be sure it’s true or not?”</span> <span id="s148">But, unfortunately, was true.</span> <span id="s149">I remember I was in movie one Sunday evening from seven to nine and just at half the time somebody come out and says, “The movie is over,” and everybody had to go home.</span> <span id="s150">Before this, used to be some alarm, like the airplane coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Oh, air raid sirens.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">And when we came out from the movie was so dark.</span> <span id="s154">No lights.</span> <span id="s155">But, when I went to the movie, my mother said, “When you come home” - and this I never can forget.</span> <span id="s156">Was a kosher dairy cart, just like Lincoln Del, and there used to be sausage just like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Like a little finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">It’s goose sausage.</span> <span id="s160">And my mother used to make with potato, paprika, that’s how she made it.</span> <span id="s161">And my mother said, “You stop by Moshe and you buy sausage, because tomorrow I want to cook this with paprika.”</span> <span id="s162">When we came out and the street was no people, nobody, then I was hurrying.</span> <span id="s163">I take the short way to go home.</span> <span id="s164">And I said, “Oh, mother, I can’t stop there because it’s so dark and strange, and no one in street.”</span> <span id="s165">My mother was so good.</span> <span id="s166">“Don’t worry, I can cook something else.”</span> <span id="s167">Then not long after this again was the sirens and the people have to go to the basement or someplace.</span> <span id="s168">And so the next morning, that was Monday, the Germans just arrived in Hungary.</span> <span id="s169">Nobody want to be near.</span> <span id="s170">My father, he was wounded in the war, he was still so Hungarian.</span> <span id="s171">He says the Hungarian people is gentlemen, and nothing can happen.</span> <span id="s172">So then was there the Germans.</span> <span id="s173">Not a long time after this, one evening, my father came home and said, “Is something very wrong going to happen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Now, do you know when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: ‘44.</span> <span id="s177">And what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: May 3rd.</span> <span id="s179">In May we was taken to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">And on the 29 May or so we was taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Can you describe what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: My father came home and he says, “It’s going to be something wrong.”</span> <span id="s183">Not late after, my oldest brother was coming home from the war battalion.</span> <span id="s184">He was lucky.</span> <span id="s185">He was with a Lieutenant, the name was Fabian.</span> <span id="s186">He was one in a million.</span> <span id="s187">He was a very good lieutenant, and he was very hard drinking person, and the Jewish boy gave all the time to drink.</span> <span id="s188">He has all the time food, and was working them hard, but never beating.</span> <span id="s189">Never, never molesting.</span> <span id="s190">Fabian says, “How many I bring here that I bring home?”</span> <span id="s191">He brought back a couple that died, because was sick.</span> <span id="s192">So my brother was lucky because was with this Fabian.</span> <span id="s193">He went to Fabian and he said, “My father, he’s disabled, and I wondering what’s going to happen with my family.</span> <span id="s194">Can I go home for twenty-four hours?”</span> <span id="s195">And Fabian says, “Okay, you can go home.”</span> <span id="s196">We was so close to the border; from Hungary to Rumania you have to go one hour, not more than one hour to reach the border, and you was in Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Traveling how?</span> <span id="s198">By train, on foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Walk.</span> <span id="s200">And my brother says, “Fabian let me came home and I like you to leave everything,” and we left to go to the border, and crossed the border.</span> <span id="s201">We going to this place.</span> <span id="s202">The name was Naratur, in Rumania.</span> <span id="s203">And my sister in Bucharest says she’ll be there in twelve hours and stay there and you can survive there ‘til over the war.</span> <span id="s204">And my father says, “I’m not going.</span> <span id="s205">I don’t want to have different from other Jews.</span> <span id="s206">I have 80% disability and I don’t get one penny from the Germans.</span> <span id="s207">One penny.”</span> <span id="s208">And my father says, “I was working and I can’t be working.</span> <span id="s209">I have no papers, and I’ll have less than I have here.”</span> <span id="s210">So my father says, “I’m not going.</span> <span id="s211">I wait, and I’m doing what everybody is.”</span> <span id="s212">We was asking him, why don’t we try, why don’t we do that.</span> <span id="s213">My father says, “It’s over.</span> <span id="s214">The discussing is over.</span> <span id="s215">I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s216">We had a big house.</span> <span id="s217">There was two or three family there.</span> <span id="s218">In Europe it’s different, not like apartments.</span> <span id="s219">A large house, like duplex, three-plex.</span> <span id="s220">We have three bedrooms, and big, big, like a whole house.</span> <span id="s221">One woman was coming home late and she says, “Tomorrow morning we’re going to be taken to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s222">And my brother says, “That’s true.</span> <span id="s223">That’s why I’m home.”</span> <span id="s224">So my mother says, “You go to sleep and you don’t think nothing about tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s225">The day before 3rd May, the rabbi ordered a fast, and the people was fasting.</span> <span id="s226">We was fasting, and next day was taken to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: The fast didn’t do any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No, it did no good.</span> <span id="s229">Before that ghetto, the General wa coming.</span> <span id="s230">He ordered all the people from the big buildings, and that the Jewish girls had to go clean up for him.</span> <span id="s231">The rabbi says, “We have no choice.</span> <span id="s232">The girls have to go to him.”</span> <span id="s233">And my father sways, “What you want to do?”</span> <span id="s234">I says, “I’m going to do what everybody else.”</span> <span id="s235">So I went to that first building.</span> <span id="s236">The name was Apollo.</span> <span id="s237">It was a very big, large building, and expensive.</span> <span id="s238">there was only rich people who can rent there, like professors, like doctors.</span> <span id="s239">It was fancy.</span> <span id="s240">Now everybody was out from there.</span> <span id="s241">The German soldier who was supervise, he was so awful.</span> <span id="s242">He would catch one girl and take to one room and rape, and say, “If you say one word, I kill all your family.”</span> <span id="s243">And we know what was happening.</span> <span id="s244">I was a good-looking girl at this time, and I was so afraid.</span> <span id="s245">So I was going a couple of days, working very hard, very dirty job.</span> <span id="s246">Then I said to my father, “You have to go and tell the rabbi I cannot do any more.</span> <span id="s247">Just I can’t do it.”</span> <span id="s248">And my father went to the rabbi and the rabbi says, “Okay, she can not.”</span> <span id="s249">So there was more like me, and the job was done.</span> <span id="s250">Then the German ordered to be furnished.</span> <span id="s251">The best from the rich people.</span> <span id="s252">My husband was a rich boy and had very beautiful house, full with oriental rugs and silver and crystal and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You weren’t married yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No.</span> <span id="s255">For six years we was dating, because my husband was always in school or was in Rumanian army.</span> <span id="s256">We met in Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Which organization did you belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s259">And Nur Ha Zion.</span> <span id="s260">And finally he was in ghetto.</span> <span id="s261">All my life I was in organizations.</span> <span id="s262">that was the best place for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So here he had this very elegant, wealthy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And I saw when a wagon with horses, a big, big wagon was taking his mother’s furniture.</span> <span id="s265">His mother was doing needlepoint all the time, and was a big chair, something special.</span> <span id="s266">I saw it was put in the wagon, and everything else.</span> <span id="s267">And was taking not only from my husband family.</span> <span id="s268">But we had not such special things.</span> <span id="s269">But he has such a beautiful home and full of all kind of expensive things.</span> <span id="s270">The finest crystal imports.</span> <span id="s271">The best, whatever people had.</span> <span id="s272">So then was coming the ghetto.</span> <span id="s273">My father says we can’t take with us everything what we want.</span> <span id="s274">Down quilts, clothes.</span> <span id="s275">We can take for cooking, dishes, pots.</span> <span id="s276">Everything.</span> <span id="s277">And if we have, food.</span> <span id="s278">My mother don’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s279">We have some lamb.</span> <span id="s280">In the morning she got up, and was with white on the head, always so clean, with apron, and she put on the lamb.</span> <span id="s281">For dinner we used to eat one o’clock, and she was cooking that.</span> <span id="s282">Then the neighbor came in and says, “Look, come to my gate.”</span> <span id="s283">And I saw a long line people with a lot of packages on the back, in the hand.</span> <span id="s284">Then my mother says, “It’s true, what you say.”</span> <span id="s285">So we fast pack in what we can.</span> <span id="s286">Was May, first day or second, and was a very ugly summer, rain and cold, just terrible.</span> <span id="s287">And my father says we have to take the blanket and comforter and pillow.</span> <span id="s288">And my brother was with us.</span> <span id="s289">And we was taking what we can.</span> <span id="s290">Was not too much food, because at that time was not refrigerator.</span> <span id="s291">What we had, we put all together, and we went to the line.</span> <span id="s292">There was old people, was young, was sick, was big.</span> <span id="s293">Everybody was crying and everybody almost can’t walk because they was so packed in, and was so hard to carry those packages.</span> <span id="s294">My father was like a statue.</span> <span id="s295">He was tall and very proud.</span> <span id="s296">My mother and me, what can we do in this situation?</span> <span id="s297">And my brother, all the time saying, “You have to be strong until it will be over.</span> <span id="s298">The Germans lose the war.</span> <span id="s299">You must be strong.”</span> <span id="s300">So we went to the line.</span> <span id="s301">Was a very, very long day, and on one was in the street.</span> <span id="s302">Just this terrible line of people, sick, and pregnant, and everything.</span> <span id="s303">So when we cross one place, two gentlemen come out.</span> <span id="s304">One was an officer, the other one was a civilian.</span> <span id="s305">And one was asking, how can this happen in this time?</span> <span id="s306">He don’t want to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Oh, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s309">Then it was, I don’t know how many hours.</span> <span id="s310">We reached the brick factory at three or four o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: About how many people were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: In our town was 8,400 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s313">And we came about 1,500, but maybe 300 died early.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So then all 8,000 were walking...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Walking, but was three places.</span> <span id="s316">One part went to the synagogue, and the other in another factory, also a brick factory.</span> <span id="s317">We went also into a village, it was very far and was very difficult, and carried the heavy packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: And it was hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: And everybody already was in very bad shape because in ghetto we had no food, we can’t wash regularly.</span> <span id="s320">The ghetto, it consumed us.</span> <span id="s321">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s322">Finally we reached the brick factory.</span> <span id="s323">There was a different kind of police...like a feather...again, I don’t know how to say...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: With a different kind of hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">This was the most bad part of

Hungarians.</span> <span id="s330">We leave the factory then; my brother says he cannot come in, he have to go back to the battalion and he have to say good-bye because he only for twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s331">Before this whole thing we use the yellow star and he says it’s very difficult traveling, but hope he can reach the battalion.</span> <span id="s332">I was happy, when I saw everything what’s going on there, and my father was happy he can be free, and not with us.</span> <span id="s333">My mother was crying, all terrible.</span> <span id="s334">My brother left

dirt.</span> <span id="s337">The roof was all holes.</span> <span id="s338">In night when it was raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: It came in through the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: But before that, we have to take off the jewelry; just left the wedding ring.</span> <span id="s341">In the minute we arrive there, was coming something...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Like a

they had taken your other jewelry before?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did they take it away or...How did you get food in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s349">Were you selling things like your jewelry?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: In ghetto?</span> <span id="s351">No, in ghetto most of the time people was starving.</span> <span id="s352">And we who had food was sending to some friends.</span> <span id="s353">But most of the food was taking to the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s354">We have a nanny, all my sister and brothers.</span> <span id="s355">She was wife of man who was the fisherman, a poor woman.</span> <span id="s356">And she was there with packages all the time.</span> <span id="s357">And we don’t get not one.</span> <span id="s358">The police man was taking...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: This was your sister in Bucharest?</span> <span id="s360">The one who was sending you the packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No, the nanny.</span> <span id="s362">Our nanny.</span> <span id="s363">But married.</span> <span id="s364">The same street, all the time was there, the coat, the dress, everything...even the name was Jewish.</span> <span id="s365">And she was suffer because of that.</span> <span id="s366">So one guy by the name of Cesar, with whom I was very good friends and I saw many times on the tennis court, he says, “You have a necklace.”</span> <span id="s367">It was really nothing, just a narrow necklace.</span> <span id="s368">He says, “You have a necklace,” like I never saw before, and he take my necklace.</span> <span id="s369">I got home, then; he was paid for this.</span> <span id="s370">Then not long after was called my father.</span> <span id="s371">There in the front was some rooms very fast built.</span> <span id="s372">There was the police, and the people who was called.</span> <span id="s373">The first who was called there was my father, and everybody was in so shock because my father was such a quiet and honest and good person, and was not rich, and he was called to go to the police.</span> <span id="s374">And my mother, she says, “You not going.</span> <span id="s375">No, you not going.”</span> <span id="s376">I say, “I’m going.”</span> <span id="s377">My father says, “No way, I don’t want you go.”</span> <span id="s378">My mother says, “If you don’t want I die here, let her go.”</span> <span id="s379">So I went to the police.</span> <span id="s380">The head there was a man who was a officer, who all the time was after me.</span> <span id="s381">The Germans all the time want to make me, and I hate it.</span> <span id="s382">At this time, if somebody not introduce me to somebody first, I don’t want to know, nobody, especially a goy, or poorer.</span> <span id="s383">I never met this official, and he was all the time after me.</span> <span id="s384">And when I got there he says, “We know each other, from this way.”</span> <span id="s385">I say, “We saw each other.”</span> <span id="s386">And I say, “I am William Sidran’s daughter.</span> <span id="s387">My father is an invalid from the first war and I don’t want to upset him.</span> <span id="s388">I have no idea what for I’m here, and just you tell me what for I’m here.”</span> <span id="s389">And he says, “You have a brother.”</span> <span id="s390">I says, “I have two.”</span> <span id="s391">And he says, “Where is your brother?”</span> <span id="s392">I said he was twenty-four hours from the war battalion and he went back.</span> <span id="s393">He says, “You absolutely sure your brother is not here?”</span> <span id="s394">I says, “I think you know this is not a place where somebody gets, who you don’t want to be here.</span> <span id="s395">He is not here, and you can check.</span> <span id="s396">It is not so difficult.</span> <span id="s397">My brother went back to the war battalion and that’s all.”</span> <span id="s398">And he says, “Okay, I believe you,” and let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Now, where was the other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: The other brother was four years in some other place.</span> <span id="s401">He was not lucky, because he had a terrible lieutenant.</span> <span id="s402">He was twenty-one and he was a normal soldier.</span> <span id="s403">He went to the war, and then he was in the ghetto; the life was terrible.</span> <span id="s404">There they start to build some latrines, and we have to stay in line, hundred and hundred person, ‘til get the door.</span> <span id="s405">They start to take the rich people who has something, and beat, and beat.</span> <span id="s406">Some was not conscious.</span> <span id="s407">There was one doctor, Schwartz; he was a gynecologist, he was working very hard.</span> <span id="s408">We was not rich but everybody had some jewelry, some money, some reserves, something.</span> <span id="s409">That Dr. Schwartz was almost killed there, and his wife, also.</span> <span id="s410">And one other doctor was beat with a stick.</span> <span id="s411">You know what they’re called...emergency bring this...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Like a stretcher?</span> <span id="s413">You mean when someone has fainted and they carry them on a stretcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s415">Cannot walk.</span> <span id="s416">In the ghetto was not medication, was not food, just what some people had.</span> <span id="s417">The morale was high.</span> <span id="s418">The people tried to encourage each other.</span> <span id="s419">And who have more food they give it to the other one.</span> <span id="s420">And everybody give to the children.</span> <span id="s421">The children was crying for that.</span> <span id="s422">Even we had no water.</span> <span id="s423">And one day, one morning, it was ten or twelve, we have to stay in line, five and five and five, and they start to do some administration.</span> <span id="s424">That day was also miserable, because was so hot.</span> <span id="s425">And the people just one after the other...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Fainting?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s428">And my mother, too.</span> <span id="s429">We cannot help because don’t let to move from the line.</span> <span id="s430">People have no idea how much somebody can summer.</span> <span id="s431">So then, after that, on the 3rd of May, we was taken again.</span> <span id="s432">That time they say no packages, because we going to a long trip.</span> <span id="s433">So we was taking what we can.</span> <span id="s434">And again in line, to the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You walked to the railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s437">the railroad.</span> <span id="s438">We walked to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s439">And again the street was dead.</span> <span

she cannot do Shabbat and cannot light candles.</span> <span id="s447">We arrived in Auschwitz Sunday morning, early morning, 5 o’clock.</span> <span id="s448">Was dark and always was like rain but was not rain.</span> <span id="s449">Like...</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: A little mist?</span> <span id="s451">Fog?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Fog.</span> <span id="s453">yes.</span> <span

id="s457">Q: High off the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It was difficult.</span> <span id="s459">And right away, very fast, the Germans.</span> <span id="s460">We saw one officer, very good-looking, very clean, very imposing.</span> <span id="s461">Mas Mengele.</span> <span id="s462">He was coming with a stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Like a riding whip.</span> <span id="s464">How did you know it was Mengele?</span> <span id="s465">Did other people call him that?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I especially know Mengele because I was talking with him, because I want he meet my mother.</span> <span id="s467">He says, “Right, and left.”</span> <span id="s468">I saw my father.</span> <span id="s469">He cannot be on right side.</span> <span id="s470">He had lost his hand.</span> <span id="s471">He had surgery, because of it.</span> <span id="s472">I remember my father’s arm was bandaged, his hand.</span> <span id="s473">He was working in the forest most of the time, and was cold, and maybe sometime was infection; there was not penicillin.</span> <span id="s474">And the doctor says to my mother, “If you want to see this man, you have to amputate.”</span> <span id="s475">My father was with her brother, Benedict, together, and my mother was with me.</span> <span id="s476">And I had a red frock and I roll it in two and I put in my mother’s hand.</span> <span id="s477">She was looking very young; she was very pretty, and she was with me.</span> <span id="s478">When I reach Mengele he was speaking Hungarian perfectly and he says, “You can’t see at night.”</span> <span id="s479">When Mengele turned to do the job I went for my mother, and he took me back to the right side.</span> <span id="s480">And in wartime, was a girl, the name Maria Sidran, and this girl was working in pharmacy and Mengele was visiting; he like a lot this girl.</span> <span id="s481">She was a blonde.</span> <span id="s482">Straight, blonde hair, blue eyes, like a German.</span> <span id="s483">So I was staying on the right side and went to the barrack.</span> <span id="s484">And my mother went to the other side.</span> <span id="s485">Far away we saw some woman who pushed a carriage.</span> <span id="s486">Her head was covered in white and somebody says, ‘Look, there are the kids, the babies.</span> <span id="s487">Let’s take care of the babies.”</span> <span id="s488">But there was no taking care of the babies.</span> <span id="s489">They were taking the good things to Germany, in the carriage.</span> <span id="s490">Then we saw the wire in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s491">if somebody touch it...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: The barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s494">Then I said to a good friend, she was holding her mother, and also she was taken away.</span> <span id="s495">I guess I can’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s496">My mother was born of five children; and nobody make it.</span> <span id="s497">When I think she have to be with allt hese strange people, naked...</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Did they make all of you take your clothes off?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: You can just go on, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Then I saw my girl friend.</span> <span id="s503">“Look at these people.</span> <span id="s504">they must be crazy.”</span> <span id="s505">Because you see, it’s such a large place, and my girlfriend, she was a very intelligent girl.</span> <span id="s506">“You notice that wire, if you touch that you can die there.”</span> <span id="s507">It’s a terrible place, this.</span> <span id="s508">So then the next stop we have when we went to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: To the bath...the showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: The showers, yeah.</span> <span id="s511">In the door, the SS woman says, “Everybody take off everything and go inside.”</span> <span id="s512">She was a fat German woman.</span> <span id="s513">I had ski shoes and I keep it all the way, because in the wagon was so dark.</span> <span id="s514">I was a skier.</span> <span id="s515">I was not a good one, but I used to ski.</span> <span id="s516">And I have very pretty ski shoes.</span> <span id="s517">And I thought I keep this on my feet because if I have to go to work that’s the best to wear.</span> <span id="s518">So then the German dog saw my ski shoes.</span> <span id="s519">She said, “Take off and leave it to me.”</span> <span id="s520">And I take off my shoes and I give it to her and she pushed me and we was in the shower.</span> <span id="s521">In the shower was start to cut our hair, and everything.</span> <span id="s522">And there was the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s523">It was so terrible.</span> <span id="s524">He was looking at us, he was watching us, a lot of men there, and a machine which cut...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: They used clippers?</span> <span id="s526">Scissors to trim your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No.</span> <span id="s528">That’s a machine.</span> <span id="s529">And was not cutting good, and we move, and was cut our head.</span> <span id="s530">I had long hair, and he was saying, “Look at this hair.”</span> <span id="s531">I had black, beautiful hair.</span> <span id="s532">So then he says we have to go to the shower.</span> <span id="s533">In the shower first of all was very little water.</span> <span id="s534">Not too many douche.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Not too many shower heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">And many have to go in under one shower.</span> <span id="s538">But when start to came this water there was something to pinch us, was so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And it was cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: It was cold?</span> <span id="s541">Everybody said, “What’s going to happen with us?”</span> <span id="s542">Everything was so fast.</span> <span id="s543">Take out, no dress, no hair, nothing.</span> <span id="s544">We was wet, and was cold, like an animal, “Everybody go out, take a dress, take shoes, in the line.”</span> <span id="s545">So when I got out and I catch a dress that was silk, short, white and red, nothing else, just one dress.</span> <span id="s546">It was very thin.</span> <span id="s547">And I went to the shoes and I picked up two shoes and both was for one leg and one had high heel and the other was flat.</span> <span id="s548">Then I start to...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Try to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Walk, and...how does one say in English...</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Oh, like you were crippled, like you couldn’t keep your balance?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s553">So then we was taken to the barrack, where we went ‘til early August.</span> <span id="s554">There we was staying.</span> <span id="s555">No water, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s556">And then noticed was coming a group of young men, dressed to go out from Auschwitz to work, in a hat with stripes and a blouse with stripes.</span> <span id="s557">I was staying there, and somebody pushed me a dress.</span> <span id="s558">It was a woman dress with long sleeves and high collar.</span> <span id="s559">It was 1200 girls, and he gave it to me?</span> <span id="s560">And right now, minute, I run around, and I take off my dress...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Your silk dress...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">That was some(thing) in my life.</span> <span id="s564">Otherwise I die there.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: And you don’t know who gave it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s567">I don’t know when, and who the guard was.</span> <span id="s568">Just that can be.</span> <span id="s569">And later we was staying in line, and then was coming Mengele.</span> <span id="s570">He was coming to me, because he was asking for “Sidran,” and everybody says me.</span> <span id="s571">I was tall and I was in front, and he was coming there and he says, “Are you a Sidran?”</span> <span id="s572">I said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s573">She (Eva) was here just now, and we can’t find, right now.”</span> <span id="s574">And he asked, “When you saw your sister?”</span> <span id="s575">“I saw, it’s here.”</span> <span id="s576">“You’re sure?”</span> <span id="s577">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s578">And he was taking...he has a private room.</span> <span id="s579">That’s why I know, so closely,; I was talking twice with Mengele.</span> <span id="s580">I was three months in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s581">When I was there we went to work.</span> <span id="s582">Later we was doing trenches.</span> <span id="s583">I was in Stutthof, a couple of days, and then they let us go from there, for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Can you go back a minute and tell me which factories you worked in, what kind of work you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: We was digging.</span> <span id="s586">Trenches.</span> <span id="s587">And always we was in forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Was this men and women together.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s590">Just women.</span> <span id="s591">And the Lithuanian who supervised us, he says, you don’t worry, because anybody who work, we don’t kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And what did they feed you during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: We had one meal where we went for evening.</span> <span id="s594">And also we have a piece of bread and a piece of marmalade or margarine once a day.</span> <span id="s595">And coffee.</span> <span id="s596">We work all day and don’t have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: No

id="s603">Everyone was taken to Stutthof for gas chamber.</span> <span id="s604">But was too many before us and had no materials and so we escaped from there.</span> <span id="s605">Then we was taken to another prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: I think in the letter your son said from Stutthof you went to Bromberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And you worked there, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: In Bromberg I became a tailor.</span> <span id="s610">I was working for the SS, part of the time, because first I was digging and I was so sick and I was so beaten.</span> <span id="s611">I have broken ribs in Auschwitz, and I had a long hemorrhaging.</span> <span id="s612">And I had a spot in my lung.</span> <span id="s613">And my feet is

Bromberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s631">Seven days, we walk.</span> <span id="s632">The road was slippery and was very difficult to walk and the soldiers always shot the people.</span> <span id="s633">And after seven days, all the time we was in bombs, and then one morning we get up, no Germans.</span> <span id="s634">So it was over for us.</span> <span id="s635">And then, really a big mistake, I discovered that a nurse who my husband’s cousin like was in another state, and she convinced me we have to go away from there.</span> <span id="s636">So we
