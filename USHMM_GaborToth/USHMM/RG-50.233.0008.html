which was Karlin, K-a-r-l-i-n.</span> <span id="s16">The street was called, Karlova, K-a-r-l-o-v-a which later under the Germans was changed to Nymburska.</span> <span id="s17">My identification is – N-y-m-b-u-r-s-k-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What did your parents do for a living?</span> <span id="s19">Your father and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s21">He had a store of wholesale/retail place of floor coverings which was, as soon as we were occupied, taken away by his own employees, Czech.</span> <span id="s22">Later on, by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So the Czechs took the shop over and then the Germans --?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Took it away from them</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: From the Czechs?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: On their own.</span> <span id="s27">Was not the law yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you and your brother go to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We went to public schools, to German schools and in ’37 when things became ---.</span> <span id="s30">The andr_______started, we transferred to Czech schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you speak German at the time, at home and things or did you speak --?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Both languages, we were bilingual.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Both German and Czech.</span> <span id="s34">How about Yiddish, did you speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A; Never, never heard a word of Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: You and your brother also, did either of you, were you involved in youth organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My brother was involved in the Zionist youth organization, M________ Hatzair.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What kind of things did he do there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: He got me to join against our parents’ wishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: They disapproved?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: They disapproved.</span> <span id="s44">In the end as I’m putting it together, after the war, much later, due to the Zionist youth organization, I was saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little bit about that since we’ve already started to talk about it?</span> <span id="s46">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well, it’s a long story in itself but the leadership of the Zionist youth organization, first we set up a whole “Helping Hand” group when the transports started.</span> <span id="s48">Later on, the same leadership in Terezin and other camps tried to get us into positions where we either could be of help, teaching, helping or, as later on proved, got me out of a transport and into the Blima Mica which was a war production, which in the end saved my life.</span> <span id="s49">Many instances during my stay in Terezin happened because the underground movement of this leadership ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Were able to do things for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Were able to, indirectly.</span> <span id="s52">Even so, the leadership was all killed, all put into the gas and so on.</span> <span id="s53">Some of us were able to get to certain jobs in certain positions, where in the end we were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did either of you or your brother and since your brother was older he probably did, I’m not sure if you did, finished school, finish high school before --?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Neither one of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Neither one of you did before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s58">We were both thrown out.</span> <span id="s59">He was in his sixth year of _______ and I was in my second year.</span> <span id="s60">Neither one of us finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you remember any instances of overt anti-Semitism before the war started -- like in the early thirties when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Not directly remember on me.</span> <span id="s63">I was really too young.</span> <span id="s64">But there were incidents, unrest in the streets and against the Jews.</span> <span id="s65">In schools some of the_______ in our class and______ which was _______were against us.</span> <span id="s66">But personally on myself, the first day of our occupation when a teacher yelled at me, you dirty filthy Jew and spit in my face and wouldn’t let me come in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: That was the first day of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: First day of occupation, March 15, 1939.</span> <span id="s69">That was my first contact with personal hatred against me on my body, on myself.</span> <span id="s70">Until then, I was only 13 years old so I didn’t really identify.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: When Hitler came to power and I know this is probably hard for you to remember but you may remember through your parents’ reactions or your brother’s reactions, was there a feeling of fear about what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s72">Or was -- did people really know what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We knew and I knew because we had family in Austria, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s74">They were occupied a year before.</span> <span id="s75">They tried illegally to cross the border at night and to come to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s76">That’s another whole story.</span> <span id="s77">They paid to be taken across the border illegally and whoever they paid to, took the money and never guided them across.</span> <span id="s78">There were many stories like that.</span> <span id="s79">They finally did make it on their own, illegally across.</span> <span id="s80">Now when I came home from school that day I was told to be very quiet because somebody was sleeping in our house that came.</span> <span id="s81">I was not told then illegally because it was too dangerous for me to know.</span> <span id="s82">Later on I was told; I was 12 at that time.</span> <span id="s83">We learned and we knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s84">We also had many friends from Germany come to Prague and relatives who were already, before that, persecuted and escaped to Prague.</span> <span id="s85">Of course, they were caught, later on in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Was there, I remember, I’m in fact reading a book about Franz Kafka and Prague at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s87">Was there a great rivalry between the Czechs and Germans going on at the time?</span> <span id="s88">Do you remember a whole lot of unrest in that kind of area?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well the andress really came with the Sudetenland which was the mobilization which was in the fall of ’38.</span> <span id="s90">That’s really the time we became aware of all that and were taken out of the German schools.</span> <span id="s91">There were riots in the streets and all that where we were caught once trying to get home from where we were.</span> <span id="s92">As Jews, we didn’t even dare to cross or go near it.</span> <span id="s93">It took us like three hours, four hours to get home.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: To go around?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: To go around and I remember we were separated at a point and I got scared.</span> <span id="s96">That stayed with me but this was before we were occupied.</span> <span id="s97">That was when the Andres______started.</span> <span id="s98">From little thing like that, I remember the various tensions and feelings.</span> <span id="s99">My parents always, when they talked, it was always in whispers so we wouldn’t -- the children should not know.</span> <span id="s100">We were at that time being protected.</span> <span id="s101">Later on the table turned and we had to protect our parents but that came later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little bit about when the city was occupied by the Germans in 1939?</span> <span id="s103">You told me the one incident with the teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: That was the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s106">What happened when the Germans came in?</span> <span id="s107">Did they immediately put restrictions on Jews or .</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Slowly, day by day the laws kept coming in day by day.</span> <span id="s111">From all the things we had to give up, valuables, art collections, anything of value.</span> <span id="s112">Later on the radios, the telephones, the phonographs and restrictions.</span> <span id="s113">Later, no public places allowed for Jews from amusement halls, movies, theatres, restaurants, any public place, playgrounds, parks and so on.</span> <span id="s114">Public transportation which was restricted.</span> <span id="s115">Of course the identification with the Jewish star, you are well aware of that, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s116">Food stamps where we had the red “J” printed into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Were you made to shop at certain stores or at certain times?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Certain stores and certain times and only certain items of food.</span> <span id="s119">The lines were usually very long which was always very degrading for the older people.</span> <span id="s120">Again the Zionist youth organization, this Helping Hand, we would take the carts and go to the stores and stay in line.</span> <span id="s121">Run back and forth and get the food whatever was needed for the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So you and your brother helped out with this organization during the occupation days?</span> <span id="s123">Did the organization work to try to aid Prague’s Jews, that’s what it was set up for?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: That’s what it was set up for including to go on Hachshara.</span> <span id="s125">Hachshara meant the preparation to go to Israel to learn to farm and work the land.</span> <span id="s126">But again you couldn’t officially call it Hachshara so we were assigned to help the farmers in the country as unpaid labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So you went out in the countryside?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: My brother went to farm, it was about maybe eight or ten from the -- again the Zionist youth organization.</span> <span id="s129">They worked various farms.</span> <span id="s130">We younger could not go, we only went daytime to the farms.</span> <span id="s131">Again this was at the time when we could no longer take public transportation.</span> <span id="s132">If there was a two-car train, we were permitted to take the last car and the platform of the last car to go to this work.</span> <span id="s133">We had a separate permission slip.</span> <span id="s134">If the train had only one car, we were not permitted at all.</span> <span id="s135">We had to be home before the curfew.</span> <span id="s136">This was before the transports started.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Once the transports started, we had to stop on all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: When did the transports start from Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: First transport went out in October, ’41.</span> <span id="s141">Five transports at 1,000 each to Lodz.</span> <span id="s142">After that, two transports followed November and December called --.</span> <span id="s143">First one was 250 men,_________ which was arbeit_________ working group one which were only men, to Terezin to build up the camp.</span> <span id="s144">Terezin was a garrison town.</span> <span id="s145">The second transport, my brother was in that, were 1,000 young men, 18, 17, 18 years old and older, to____________ colony two, to build up Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s146">The bunks and the barracks and all that.</span> <span id="s147">After that, transport after transport always left, 1,000 people each.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Every day or every few weeks or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, sometimes two, three in a row.</span> <span id="s150">Then there were a few days of nothing and then maybe a week again followed by every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you remember how people were notified for these transports?</span> <span id="s152">Like your brother, did a letter come, or did someone just show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: From the Jewish council, Jewish office, they had to put together the list which they had to go to the SS to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s154">From the Jewish elders, you send out, at that time we still had young people working there with the notification, the name of the transport and with that we had to go to the holding place which was an old exhibition hall emptied out called the Messacalanda.</span> <span id="s155">Sometimes we had a couple of hours, sometimes even more.</span> <span id="s156">We were permitted to take one small suitcase or backpack, something we could carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Was there a limit on how many pounds that could be?</span> <span id="s158">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: There was and I don’t remember it any more.</span> <span id="s160">It was something like 20 kilo but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s161">I really am not sure but I know there was a way we could pack and again the youth organization we called that formed Helping Hand would send us out to the older people that couldn’t carry and couldn’t pack.</span> <span id="s162">We would pack for them.</span> <span id="s163">Like we had a way of packing the shoes to the side and the blankets.</span> <span id="s164">Since in Europe you had this old-style, heavy down-feather_______, it was called blankets, we established a sewing room where people could bring ahead of time in preparation for transports, their blankets.</span> <span id="s165">We would empty out the feathers, we would stitch it small and flat and restuff it with their feathers.</span> <span id="s166">That was called – we sort of established a room this size, a sewing room.</span> <span id="s167">Everybody was prepared and had sort of a blanket you could roll up and put on top of your --.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Which was all done by the Zionist youth organizations, all volunteers.</span> <span id="s170">We helped to do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Did you have any contact with your brother after -- between the time that he left and you left, did letters come back from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No letters, nothing.</span> <span id="s173">He was able to send out through somebody on a little -- I remember that so clearly -- a little torn piece of paper with one word on it, Terezin.</span> <span id="s174">So we knew where he was at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: But that’s it?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s177">That was pretty dangerous to do at any rate for who smuggled.</span> <span id="s178">The way he smuggled it out, if he would have been caught including whoever helped him smuggle it and brought it back to us.</span> <span id="s179">Later on we followed him and we saw him in the camp.</span> <span id="s180">We were in the same Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Let me backtrack just a little bit.</span> <span id="s182">When you -- you said the transports began October of 1941?</span> <span id="s183">So you were basically in occupied Prague for over two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Was there any ghetto ever set up in Prague?</span> <span id="s186">Or were you forced to move to a certain area?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No, we stayed in our apartment.</span> <span id="s188">We were very lucky at that.</span> <span id="s189">My aunt lived in the same building and another aunt had to move out of her apartment.</span> <span id="s190">I don’t remember why and she moved in with us.</span> <span id="s191">We could stay until we were transported in our apartment.</span> <span id="s192">We had to give up all our belongings from there and everything but we did stay in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Because I remember, I’m trying to remember.</span> <span id="s194">I’ve been to Prague once and I remember the Karlin area.</span> <span id="s195">I also remember that there was a Jewish ghetto just where Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Which was in the auch_________, the old part where the eldest were set up.</span> <span id="s197">We had, it was called madon, the Zionist organization had their own people live there, the young people that came from other towns and cities as they were being all brought into Prague for transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: So when people were brought into Prague they were housed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: They were put into the center, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: But the rest of -- any other Jews --?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: More or less stayed.</span> <span id="s202">If there was a need, they were put into apartments with other Jews but in that sense we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s203">Just my aunt was put in with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s205">Now at this point, after your brother left, it is you and your aunt and your parents are living in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: When were you forced to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: My aunt left before we did.</span> <span id="s209">My parents and I left July 13, ’42.</span> <span id="s210">The transport was, I just gave the name here for the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You have it?</span> <span id="s212">It’s upstairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Upstairs in the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: I can find it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: It’s AAR 395 was the number.</span> <span id="s216">The name of the transport was RRL.</span> <span id="s217">It started with A to Z.</span> <span id="s218">Then came AA to AZ and we were in AAR.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So you’re almost at the end of the second --?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, third.</span> <span id="s221">Third time alphabet around.</span> <span id="s222">They were almost daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did they come to your apartment and just ask you to leave or were you notified ahead of time like given a week or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No, no, never a week.</span> <span id="s225">A few hours or the most was a day, but hours at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">(Another interviewer’s voice: Let us interrupt you.)</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I really would like to tell you a little bit more about my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Susie has your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: I’ll talk to her then.</span> <span id="s231">Okay, go ahead, tell me anything you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Not Susie, what was the lady’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: (The lady that was just here to see us.</span> <span id="s234">Susan Cohen).</span> <span id="s235">Okay Susan Cohen, one of her volunteers.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: One of her volunteers called me and she has my whole story over the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: (Then we can fill in areas if you need to).</span> <span id="s238">That’s fine, that’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: We started in and out with my brother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s241">I think the last time we talked about him, he had just been sent on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Right and then we followed later, my parents and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: You can tell me about when he was in Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: In Terezin, he was assigned to work for the SS, to take care of their horses, one of the jobs, as a stable boy.</span> <span id="s245">For that he also had lumps of sugar which the horses get at night.</span> <span id="s246">At one point my mother was very sick and he tried to smuggle out some of the sugar to her barrack.</span> <span id="s247">He was caught by one of the SS and was taken to the ma______ which is the ________ in Terezin which was the punishing center about a mile, two miles out of Terezin where the artists of Terezin were taken and so on.</span> <span id="s248">From there, nobody ever returned.</span> <span id="s249">Usually you were tortured to death, they all send out to the gas chamber but after about three days, he came back.</span> <span id="s250">They still needed him as the stable boy but in these three days, he was so tortured or beaten that we didn’t recognize his face almost.</span> <span id="s251">For just a few lousy lumps of sugar.</span> <span id="s252">That was one story about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did he say anything about what they had done to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s255">We didn’t ask, we didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s256">We didn’t have the opportunity or the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Or the inclination?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Inclination.</span> <span id="s259">We really couldn’t --.</span> <span id="s260">We knew what happened.</span> <span id="s261">Another story that I’m putting together now.</span> <span id="s262">As a matter of fact, just a week ago or two weeks ago.</span> <span id="s263">He worked for the SS, he was very handy.</span> <span id="s264">He was given materials to do for the -- either the wives of the SS or the German soldiers I don’t know -- like pins or book markers or little things like that out of metal and leather strips.</span> <span id="s265">He made some for me and I saved them.</span> <span id="s266">I have those various things.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You still have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I have them but I found in a book in the Precious Legacy book which is now in Prague, the exhibition but it traveled through the United States, a picture of one item that was made for the purpose when the Red Cross came to Terezin, there was a sports event staged.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Oh there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Right, a football game was staged in one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s271">For that event, a trophy, was a leather strip and I saw the picture in this book which is identical to what he made.</span> <span id="s272">It was found after liberation in camp, this item.</span> <span id="s273">I would say 99% sure that he must have made that.</span> <span id="s274">I have no proof but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: But that’s what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: He did and I have an item almost identical to that.</span> <span id="s277">It’s in the same shape and all so I got it.</span> <span id="s278">That was one thing he did, was forced to do, for the SS.</span> <span id="s279">The other story I like to tell about him that my parent and I received notification for what is now called the Mass______which was the transport of 5,000 Czechoslovak Jews sent from Terezin to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s280">At the time he was not in that transport because he was covered, protected, working for the SS.</span> <span id="s281">They needed him so he was not in that transport.</span> <span id="s282">He volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: To go on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: To go on that transport.</span> <span id="s285">As we boarded the cattle cars for that transport, I was taken out of this transport already on the ramp to the car.</span> <span id="s286">Later on I put together as I was telling you about the Zionist youth organization, due to them I think.</span> <span id="s287">(Male voice: Also the Germans wanted 5,000 and not 5,000 and one).</span> <span id="s288">That I put together later.</span> <span id="s289">There were four, (It was their choice whom they would take off).</span> <span id="s290">Right.</span> <span id="s291">Anyhow, 5,000 left.</span> <span id="s292">This is the transport, I don’t know if you’re familiar with it, when they arrived in Auschwitz, they were kept together as famililager Birkenau which is where I have the cards that I received which are upstairs too.</span> <span id="s293">He perished in that transport.</span> <span id="s294">He volunteered, he took my number, I found out later on, my transport number.</span> <span id="s295">Later on I also found out that there were 5,004 on this transport.</span> <span id="s296">They had said only 5,000 can be.</span> <span id="s297">So four were taken out.</span> <span id="s298">Since there were obviously four volunteers, one of which is my brother.</span> <span id="s299">(He went to be of help to your parents, thought he might be able to help them).</span> <span id="s300">I, in turn, was taken out due maybe to the influence of the Zionist youth organization.</span> <span id="s301">(Was their choice, their choice).</span> <span id="s302">Their choice to decide the four.</span> <span id="s303">(It was their choice to decide whom to send).</span> <span id="s304">I think also because from the last numbers and we were in the 4,500 category so that also was part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Why don’t we stop here and we can --.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">END OF FIRST TAPE.</span> <span id="s308">FOLLOWING IS TAPED PHONE INTERVIEW COMPLETED AT A LATER DATE.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: My brother’s name is Peter Winternitz.</span> <span id="s311">He was born in Prague on April 28, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Now when we talked before, you said that you lived in Karlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Karlin which was Prague Ten at that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And that your father was a wholesale rug -- he was selling rugs?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Wholesale/retail floor coverings.</span> <span id="s316">Not just rugs.</span> <span id="s317">He had the floor coverings.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Did he have his own shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: He had his own store.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s321">It was just you and your brother, yes?</span> <span id="s322">Those are the only two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: That’s the only children.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: He was born in 1922 so he was older than you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: He was four years older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: You said that you went, when you went to school, you started in Czech schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No, we started German schools.</span> <span id="s328">Then we had to transfer from German schools to Czech schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: When did you transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: In ’36 or ’37, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s331">As things were starting up, we had to leave German schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Because of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes, anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: You said that -- you did mention in the earlier interview that your brother was involved with some Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s335">Do you remember what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah, he belonged to the youth group, the Zionist youth organization, the _________Hatzair.</span> <span id="s337">Due to him, I also joined.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: What kind of things did -- what kind of get-togethers or functions did the organization have?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, Maccabi_________Hatzair was Israeli-oriented, preparation for life in Israel at the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s340">So we all went on Hachshara which was a preparation working for farmers, living with the farmers in the countryside.</span> <span id="s341">Which, later on, helped us as far as work was concerned in the concentration camp, including Terezin.</span> <span id="s342">It helped him, he was assigned as having so-called experience.</span> <span id="s343">He was assigned as a stable boy to work for the horses that belonged to the SS and he even lived in the stables.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Were there lectures and things about Israel and that kind of stories about Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s346">We had meetings, we were reading.</span> <span id="s347">As a matter of fact, we were already teaching the younger children.</span> <span id="s348">Later on when we were not permitted to go to school, we arranged Hillsteens which was sort of a group “Helping Hand” when the transport started.</span> <span id="s349">Taking the people to the assembly place, packing for them because we each were permitted originally to take one package, one backpack or one little suitcase.</span> <span id="s350">The Zionist youth organization was sort of the Helping Hand everyplace including in the camps trying to help the smaller children, teaching, keeping up the morale in Terezin, even trying to arrange for singing, poetry, writing, any kind of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s352">Speaking of education, you said that you didn’t finish high school before the war.</span> <span id="s353">Did your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No.</span> <span id="s355">He also didn’t finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: No, he didn’t either?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: He had one year left.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: He was almost done.</span> <span id="s359">Can you tell me a little bit about the occupation and what your brother was doing when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well we were in school when the Germans occupied us in 1939.</span> <span id="s361">Then when we were immediately thrown out of school, even before it was turned into law, he started working for the Zionist youth organization, of which actually the leading man was written up in many books, Freyda Hirsch.</span> <span id="s362">You might have heard that name.</span> <span id="s363">With him and with other younger people, he was instrumental to work on a place called H_______in Prague which was the only place left for us to go.</span> <span id="s364">It was a huge sports field where we continued not only sports activity, but educational activity, lectures, study groups, schooling and so on.</span> <span id="s365">He was part of that leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: You said it was like a sporting field.</span> <span id="s367">Was it open?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah, it was a big open field and that was the only place left for Jewish to go after we were no longer permitted to go to any public places, playgrounds, movies, theatres, schools, etc.</span> <span id="s369">Since we couldn’t take any public transport any more, for most of us it was almost over an hour walk to get there.</span> <span id="s370">But it was one place where we could talk, be together; otherwise it was never permitted to be more than two or three people together.</span> <span id="s371">So this gave us a perfect place.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: To gather and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: To gather and continue sort of our work.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: You mentioned a few restrictions that were placed on Jews.</span> <span id="s375">What other kinds of things were placed -- did you have to wear a Jewish star at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: We had to wear the Jewish star, yes.</span> <span id="s377">The laws were coming out day by day.</span> <span id="s378">We had to give up all our radios, our telephones, our record players, our records.</span> <span id="s379">We had to give up all our valuables, any kind of art collection or later on or so naturally, jewelry.</span> <span id="s380">My father was a big stamp collector, well-known stamp collector.</span> <span id="s381">He had to give up his stamp collection.</span> <span id="s382">We were no longer permitted public transportation or own bicycles or cars -- bus, taxis, trains, trolley-cars, no public place, movie theatres.</span> <span id="s383">Certain stores were not permitted for Jews to enter.</span> <span id="s384">We had a curfew, seven o’clock we had to be off the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: How long after the Germans came into the city was the curfew in place?</span> <span id="s386">Pretty quickly or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Pretty quickly, almost day by day laws were coming out.</span> <span id="s388">I don’t exactly remember the succession which started first, I think giving up all valuables was one of the very first ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: You mentioned earlier you and your brother being involved in the Helping Hand organization.</span> <span id="s390">Once the Germans came in, the restrictions started, did the Helping Hand organization become more active in trying to help people?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes, it became sort of, almost legalized.</span> <span id="s392">It was under the umbrella of the Jewish Elder.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Like the Jewish Council or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah, Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s395">We established two or three rooms in a building there and it was sort of the communications center to send out the transport notices.</span> <span id="s396">We followed up with the notices immediately, helping the people pack, getting them to the assembly place.</span> <span id="s397">Prior to that, we had another room, we were not permitted to take those big European blankets, you know_____.</span> <span id="s398">Everybody was hoping we could take blankets.</span> <span id="s399">We took the big______opened them up, took out all the feathers and stitched them into very thin little blankets.</span> <span id="s400">We stuffed them and rolled them up so people could take it on their backpack.</span> <span id="s401">Of course we had, got permission to be after seven o’clock on the street.</span> <span id="s402">It was a special au______special papers stating for that day we had permission to be on the street after 7 o’clock to help with the packing and getting people to the assembly.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: You and your brother, both of you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s405">Well, no, not the sewing, only the girls did the sewing and working.</span> <span id="s406">But he did more the packing the office had.</span> <span id="s407">But he left in one of the very first transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Your brother did?</span> <span id="s409">Do you remember when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s411">He let n the very special transport in December ’41.</span> <span id="s412">Second transport to Terezin which was called AK 2, the first transport was AK 1, consisting of 280, I believe, young men to build up Terezin into a camp.</span> <span id="s413">AK stands for Arbeit Kolona and he was in the second transport a week later, Arbeit Kolona 2 which was a thousand young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: That was in December of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: December of ’41, I don’t remember the exact date.</span> <span id="s416">They were one week apart, those two transports.</span> <span id="s417">They went directly to one of the barracks called Sudeten Barrack to build it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: At this point, Theresienstadt was just being opened?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Right, it was a small garrison town at the time housing about 6,000, five to six thousand people.</span> <span id="s420">They were moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Oh, the people who were there, were moved out?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Right.</span> <span id="s423">It was turned into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s424">The two transports were sort of the forerunners to build a bunk center, to build it up into a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Let me go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s426">When your brother was deported, and since you helped with some of the -- getting people ready to go on the deportation, can you describe for me a little bit of the deportation.</span> <span id="s427">What would happen, like people would get a notice and then they would be told?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: There was no telephone so people got the notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Through the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s431">We took it or the Germans would give the list to the Jewish Elder and we in turn would take the notification.</span> <span id="s432">Or sometimes people were just, by the Germans, taken off the street.</span> <span id="s433">A whole street was closed up.</span> <span id="s434">But most of the time, we went to the houses.</span> <span id="s435">As a matter of fact, we rang the doorbell.</span> <span id="s436">If the doorbell rang, it meant bad news.</span> <span id="s437">Either it was SS or a transportation notice.</span> <span id="s438">If you went yourself someplace, you would never dare to ring a doorbell.</span> <span id="s439">You’d only knock on the door.</span> <span id="s440">Doorbell ringing meant a disaster.</span> <span id="s441">The notices were handed out that way or if we worked in the office and we knew who was on the transport, we could send out quickly because sometimes you didn’t have much time to get to the assembly place.</span> <span id="s442">Sometimes you had four or five hours, sometimes if you were lucky, half a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Now is that what happened with your brother since they knew him at the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: We knew that this transport of young men will be assembled within probably a few hours.</span> <span id="s445">So pretty much we anticipated he would be in it and before we turned around, we learned yes, he was on that list.</span> <span id="s446">When he came home and I was home at that time, I knew when he came home that this is what had happened by his face.</span> <span id="s447">We told our parents and I remember my mother and father standing by the door when he left, just holding hands.</span> <span id="s448">Then of course when we got our notice, I kept sort of the front up and kept telling my mother that maybe we be soon together with Peter.</span> <span id="s449">We had a few hours to get to the holding place.</span> <span id="s450">Since I was familiar, having worked on it knowing the holding place and all, I got help from some of our friends.</span> <span id="s451">They walked with us to the holding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did you leave shortly after your brother or a few months later?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: We left a few months later, we were in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: In June of ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: June of ’42.</span> <span id="s456">Was 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: When people left from Prague, they left on trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Being sent to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, first we went to the assembly place which was an old exhibition hall which was cleared out.</span> <span id="s461">There we were held for about two, two and a half days.</span> <span id="s462">A thousand people always sitting on a concrete floor, men, women, children, babies.</span> <span id="s463">In our transport we were there 2 ½ days and then we were taken to the train which was about -- in back of the building, came to the back of the building.</span> <span id="s464">Some trains were regular passenger cars, most of them were cattle cars.</span> <span id="s465">Some were a mixture of everything.</span> <span id="s466">I remember being with my parents in the same car which was a cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: When you got to Theresienstadt, how long was it after that you found your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Actually, to Theresienstadt, the trains at that time did not lead all the way into Terezin.</span> <span id="s469">We had about, if they stopped in a little village before which was B______.</span> <span id="s470">Then we had like half an hour walk into Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So you didn’t actually go into Terezin, you walked into Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: You had to walk at that time.</span> <span id="s473">Later on, the railroad went all the way in.</span> <span id="s474">The tracks were laid all the way into Terezin, was a faster procedure for loading and unloading the people, for getting them in and out.</span> <span id="s475">We were earlier so we had to walk in a column of three with SS all alongside of us.</span> <span id="s476">We had about a 20-minute, half an hour walk.</span> <span id="s477">We walked through the gate.</span> <span id="s478">The gate said like all camps, Arbeit Macht Frei which means work makes free.</span> <span id="s479">In the camp, I kept asking as we walked through the slau______---.</span> <span id="s480">You were taken to a place where you were searched and stripped which was called slau_______, means like a sluice.</span> <span id="s481">There were people working who were already in Terezin and I kept asking them if they knew my brother.</span> <span id="s482">He was still there and then maybe a day or two later, I really don’t remember, it took a day or two to locate him and see him.</span> <span id="s483">Then I told him which barrack my mother was and he was able to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: There was no segregation of males and females?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes, there were different barracks.</span> <span id="s486">But we were able in the beginning at least to go after work, if we were still able to or something, to go to that barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You could actually see each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Before when I talked to you, you had told me that -- and actually you said it earlier today, that your brother took care of the horses for the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Right.</span> <span id="s491">He also did something else.</span> <span id="s492">He was very handy, artistically handy.</span> <span id="s493">The SS provided him with materials where he made different pins and chokers, necklaces for their wives and girlfriends.</span> <span id="s494">He managed always to out of little remnants and pieces, make things for me or for my mother.</span> <span id="s495">I have a couple of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Oh you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I happened to find, just recently, in the book of the Precious Legacy, a picture of one item that after liberation was found in Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Do you think he might have made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: There is no doubt in my mind that he must have made that.</span> <span id="s500">It was found in the -- where the SS lived in the _______.</span> <span id="s501">It’s so identical, the picture to the item I have.</span> <span id="s502">I wish I could find out where that item is.</span> <span id="s503">I’m still working on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: That sounds like quite a job, that will be, to look for that.</span> <span id="s505">Let me see -- you said that since your brother took care of the SS’s horses and now he also made things for the wives of the SS.</span> <span id="s506">Do you know how he became involved and was able to get jobs like that, involved with the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, when you came in, you were always asked and filled out what work or what you do?</span> <span id="s508">Or what were you?</span> <span id="s509">He, of course, that was part of all the Zionist youth organizations, the Hachshara helped us.</span> <span id="s510">Because the girls or the boys were on Hachshara, again inTerezin were assigned to_______ which was a -- working outside the camp for the farmers, working on the farmland.</span> <span id="s511">Hachshara was a training for Israel, to work on the land.</span> <span id="s512">So they used that and again the youth Zionist organization helped and the Jewish Elders brought younger people, some of my friends in my barrack.</span> <span id="s513">So due to that, they are now in Israel, a number of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Because they had the training?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Because they had the training, because the Zionist youth organization helped, including at that time Edda Schtein (who later on himself was killed at Auschwitz with his family.</span> <span id="s516">There is a book written about him now for the Elders The Jewish Elder I think it is called by Ruth Bondy who was also a member of that youth organization which is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s517">By just saying that he worked in the fields and he worked with horses, on that Hachshara, he was assigned to the stables, the SS stables.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A&gt; As a matter of fact, he received lumps of sugar for the horses.</span> <span id="s519">Every night they would get like after they were groomed and all that, a lump of sugar.</span> <span id="s520">At one point my mother was very sick and he tried to get the sugar, some of the lumps of sugar to her.</span> <span id="s521">But he was caught by one of the German policemen, not SS, German police that policed us.</span> <span id="s522">He was taken to the punishment center which was MA_____you might have heard that word, which was three miles out of Terezin, but was still part of Terezin.</span> <span id="s523">The artists of Terezin were taken there.</span> <span id="s524">Usually, everybody taken there was killed or tortured to death there.</span> <span id="s525">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s526">But he came back to the camp about three days later but so brutally beaten and tortured that we hardly recognized him.</span> <span id="s527">In the three days.</span> <span id="s528">But the reason he came back, at that time we understood, he was needed for the horses.</span> <span id="s529">He was especially good with the horses.</span> <span id="s530">Some of the SS got him out but he looked terrible.</span> <span id="s531">For just a few lumps of sugar which were good for horses but not good for his mother, for Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You also said that your brother earlier when we talked, made medals for a soccer game.</span> <span id="s533">Do you remember something about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: The medals?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: That was part of the art he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Oh, I see, for the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: For the SS, those were big round circles and when the Red Cross came for the performance, there was also a soccer game.</span> <span id="s539">Then they were handed the winner, the winning teams were handed in front of the Red Cross team, the Red Cross that came.</span> <span id="s540">those medals.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Your brother had made those medals?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: He had made those.</span> <span id="s543">He designed them.</span> <span id="s544">He was told to design them.</span> <span id="s545">He was told to design them, he was told what to do.</span> <span id="s546">He had just to follow orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Can you tell me now when did your brother leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Leave Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Terezin.</span> <span id="s550">Or was deported there?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Actually my parents and I were in the transport that is called the MA_________transport.</span> <span id="s552">Five thousand Czechoslovakia Jews were shipped out of Terezin on September 7, 1943 to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s553">My brother, working for the SS as their stable boy were brought back that call, they need him.</span> <span id="s554">He was protected from shipped out but when he learned that my parents and I are on that transport, he volunteered.</span> <span id="s555">He ran to the Jewish Elder and asked to be put into this transport and got a number and joined.</span> <span id="s556">As we were already boarding the cattle cars -- by then the trains came all the way into camp to the Hamburger Barrack, the Hamburger -- my parents were already in one car, my brother in another.</span> <span id="s557">I was boarding the cattle car on that ramp, the SS standing at the ramp, called out my number, pushed me aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Took you off the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Took me off the transport.</span> <span id="s560">I didn’t know why or what as the train left with my parents and my brother.</span> <span id="s561">Later on only towards the end when the death transports and the death marches were coming back to Terezin and on those transports were some people that we knew from Terezin or before, through the Zionist youth organizations and had been in Auschwitz at the time, told us that this particular transport went into the gas on March 7, six months to the day that they arrived.</span> <span id="s562">Because that was the birthday of the first president of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Thomas_____?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Thomas_____, right.</span> <span id="s565">That’s why this transport is called the __________transport.</span> <span id="s566">Actually, at that time, as far as I researched it and understood, out of the 5,000 that’s also in the movie Shoah, I mentioned, only 2,800 were still alive.</span> <span id="s567">The others had perished due to starvation, sickness, beating, etc.</span> <span id="s568">My father and my brother had perished before.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Oh, they had died before?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Of beatings, starvation, malnutrition, things like that.</span> <span id="s571">At that time, as far as I researched it, I don’t have documents which will be ready now I hope, I have to find out more, as far as I know, only my mother went into the gas on March 7.</span> <span id="s572">I was saved by being taken out and I found out much later that the transport was under roster 5,000.</span> <span id="s573">There were 5,004 on that list so four were taken off and I was one of the four.</span> <span id="s574">Possibly that, which I found out later, my brother might have taken my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: But I still had the number and_________they chose his transport number was the one I had.</span> <span id="s577">A 90% possibility, what happened as the Jewish Elder, when he volunteered, that he gave him my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: He took your number, to save you?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Then know, we didn’t know saved.</span> <span id="s580">But since they only could have five thousand and they had 5,004 but that is not proved fact.</span> <span id="s581">I am putting this together in my mind and in my research.</span> <span id="s582">I have no proof of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Now this is a bad question to ask you but you don’t know exactly what happened to your brother and father, only that they died before --?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: The way I understand that the 5,000 were kept together.</span> <span id="s585">They were not separated; they were kept together in familalager Birkenau.</span> <span id="s586">They had to work, the ones that were able and the ones who died, died of either torture, malnutrition, sickness due to the malnutrition like we had dysentery, typhoid, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Let me ask you when we talked at the end right before you had to leave, we were talking about your brother and I didn’t get to ask you a few questions about your story to the end, if that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: They left on that transport, your parents left on September 7, 1943.</span> <span id="s590">From that time onward, what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I stayed in the camp.</span> <span id="s592">I worked there.</span> <span id="s593">After that transport, after transports were leaving and again, due to the Zionist youth organization and the Jewish management that always had to put together the transport, they always were trying to keep some of us, the younger people behind.</span> <span id="s594">In Terezin, we still had a chance of survival but we knew once we are shipped out east, that there is hardly any chance left.</span> <span id="s595">Then they needed work for war production.</span> <span id="s596">War production and I was assigned to that war production which was a big barrack in Terezin, built outside the camp.</span> <span id="s597">About 6,000 people were assigned to that war production which was splitting that big rock of mica into very thin slivers which were used for filters in the gas masks for the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s598">The other work we had to do which also protected us at that time from being shipped out were building the gas chambers in Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: You helped to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s601">Which were going to be operational on May 11 and we were liberated on May 7 by the Russian army, four days before they became operational.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you remained in Terezin until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Till the end, right.</span> <span id="s604">But then when the death transports were coming back and we were unloading the trains of the dead bodies mostly, either there or someplace else, I don’t know, I got typhoid.</span> <span id="s605">I ended up in the typhoid barracks.</span> <span id="s606">Typhoid was contagious, the Germans had one barrack where all the typhoid cases were taken.</span> <span id="s607">I was in that barrack more or less unconscious when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Do you remember which -- were they Russian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes, the Russian army, we went to pass the Russian army.</span> <span id="s610">We were liberated in the night of May 7 to May 8 which I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s611">But a friend of mine came to the typhoid barracks two days later, when I became conscious and she brought me a piece of, sort of a slice of white bread which the Russian army had brought in for us.</span> <span id="s612">Then I realized I must be free; then it all sank in.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Do you remember how long before you were liberated that you went into the typhoid barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, not really, must have been just a couple of days.</span> <span id="s615">I remember just sort of floating in and out of consciousness, semi-conscious state or whatever.</span> <span id="s616">I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s617">Then I remembered being carried by two sort of -- two guys, two inmates and this friend of mine who helped, carrying me to the typhoid barrack but I didn’t realize where to.</span> <span id="s618">I just knew I’m being carried but I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s619">The next thing I knew when I regained consciousness, sort of, that she was there, this friend of mine who is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s620">We are still the closest of friends.</span> <span id="s621">We went through the whole camp together, we helped each other and we remained the closest of friends until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: What happened after liberation, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: After liberation I tried to get back to Prague.</span> <span id="s624">By then I knew that my parents and brother are not alive but I hoped that someone else, some other people of my family.</span> <span id="s625">But again I couldn’t leave Terezin because I had to be first -- we needed a repatriation card on which it stated that we were deloused and no longer a carrier of anything and so on which was set up by the Russians.</span> <span id="s626">Since Czechoslovakia, Prague, at that time was also under the Russians.</span> <span id="s627">I couldn’t get that since I was still a typhoid carrier and I was too weak and too sick.</span> <span id="s628">But this friend of mine already was in Prague and on one of the trucks coming back to Terezin, it would take us about wherever we wanted to go, and she had sent a -- like an empty beer keg on that truck.</span> <span id="s629">Before we came into Prague to the border like the “Checkpoint Charlie” type, like a gate where you had to show that you are clear, you can enter the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Oh, with papers and documentation and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Right.</span> <span id="s632">I didn’t have that one slip so they shoved me.</span> <span id="s633">I crawled into that empty beer keg.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You got into that barrel?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: They covered it up with some old blankets, rags that were on the truck.</span> <span id="s636">That’s how I was actually smuggled into Prague.</span> <span id="s637">Once there, she already had assigned an apartment.</span> <span id="s638">What happened, the Repatriation Office, as we were coming back, the Germans had fled.</span> <span id="s639">Their apartments were empty so the Red Cross and the Repatriation Center tried to assign us to various empty apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: They let you settle in those apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: So there was one apartment where about six or seven of us, in the beginning, stayed together.</span> <span id="s642">That was on the fourth floor and I couldn’t walk the stairs up yet and I remember being carried up.</span> <span id="s643">Then I recuperated, I got a little better and stronger.</span> <span id="s644">Then later I started to work and later on I got my own apartment assigned.</span> <span id="s645">I started getting documents, everything together.</span> <span id="s646">A year later, I had an uncle here, and a year later, I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s648">So you had relatives in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I had an uncle here.</span> <span id="s650">At first there was no communication.</span> <span id="s651">I couldn’t notify him, he couldn’t notify me.</span> <span id="s652">About three months afterwards, he found my name in the paper in New York from the Red Cross list of survivors.</span> <span id="s653">I, in turn, knew his address and through a British soldier that came back to the Czech army, a friend of my brother’s, through him, through the British army, through London, through his mother, I was able to send a wire to New York, to let him know that I survived.</span> <span id="s654">Actually out of my entire family, when I came back to Prague, out of my entire family, aunts, uncles, cousins, everybody, I was the only one that survived.</span> <span id="s655">Everybody else perished.</span> <span id="s656">Then I came here a year later and started a brand new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Do you remember when you arrived in Prague, after getting out of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: What year?</span> <span id="s661">That was in -- well we were liberated in May of ’45.</span> <span id="s662">May 7, and about five weeks later ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: You were released from -- ?</span> <span id="s664">No, you smuggled yourself out?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I smuggled myself out of Terezin and into Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Then you lived in Prague for how long before you went to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: A year, till ’46.</span> <span id="s668">I came here in July of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Okay, I think that’s all the questions I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: That about covers it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Yeah, I think we’ve gone back and fixed everything here.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Thank you for your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Thank you for your time.</span> <span id="s674">I really appreciate your talking to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I don’t know if you’re going to use the material on my brother for the -- for this project.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: We’d like to, that’s one of the things -- in fact, that’s why I wanted to get the story because_____</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: You have his picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Actually I’m going to turn off the tape here.</span> <span id="s679">Hang on for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
