id="s116">My father come back from the prison -- mean the farm prison, and come back to Warsaw, and start working aw -- eight -- for example, propa -- he was about 20 years old, working for state like Marines, on Vistula river, because during this time, if you has -- are 18 ye -- or -- year -- years old, you cannot create a good education, because was very tough during the sn -- Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s117">Russian occupation was everything against the education, not like in other part of this time -- a other part of the Poland, li-ike Austria, or Germany, was much easier to educate that -- himself.</span> <span id="s118">In Russian part was not so easy, and my father c-come back from the ne -- I call this prison, and start working, like I said before, for na -- state, and start educated himself.</span> <span id="s119">I remember I was maybe five years old, I remember good, to our house each days or two days, came some student from the Polytechnical

mean we was very tight to our history, to our freedom, and my parents was very like, have the right freedom for Poland, and that’s we was discuss we move.</span> <span id="s218">In our house was all

id="s220">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: And we never be anti-Polish, for example, and we never was on the left or the right side take the position.</span> <span id="s222">And we raised this way and we was good Polish citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You have said that when your father went into his business, you began to have more of an association with Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: -- or at least your father did.</span> <span id="s226">When you were going to school, were there Jewish kids in the school as well as Polish Catholic kids, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: You see -- yes, I have couple -- ne -- not many, because you see, we was not too rich people.</span> <span id="s228">Before, the educated children was very costable.</span> <span id="s229">And one time in our family was four children, and you must pay the tuition.</span> <span id="s230">And before the war, it was not so easy.</span> <span id="s231">Each child costs, for example in gymnasium, mean the high school, was private high school, and was state high school.</span> <span id="s232">If you cannot go to state high school, you must pay.</span> <span id="s233">And this costs this time, 80 zloty, and fellow who work in the bank, like [indecipherable] or fellow who work in the post office, take only 200 dollars mon -- monthly.</span> <span id="s234">And you must pay for one child 80 zloty.</span> <span id="s235">And I was maybe lucky because my parents paid for me only part of this, because I was good student, and happened I pay less.</span> <span id="s236">And my two sister and brother, that’s was big money monthly, pay for education.</span> <span id="s237">And my father did pay and my mother said, I don’t

about your association with Jewish kids when you were in school, in -- in elementary school, and high school.</span> <span id="s242">Were there Jewish kids in the high school, or did -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: In elementary school, yes.</span> <span id="s244">Only was two in this area, was not a Jewish area --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: -- because you know in Warsaw, a part -- the Jewish Warsaw located mostly in one part of the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s247">The north part na -- close to Narlefki and this area.</span> <span id="s248">And where I live, I live close to Vistula river, was not many Jew, and s -- Jewish people, and still was two young guy who was up to twa -- 14 years old, we was together in school, and you know, was very nice guy, on -- poor, and still was [indecipherable] this young people go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s249">And up to si -- 14 years old, this fellow has education, and later they both are interest in go to Palestine and be some carpenter or some mechanical something like this.</span> <span id="s250">And that’s was stop my connection with the Jewish young person.</span> <span id="s251">And still sa -- we was invited to later there, I maybe mentioned to Melamid family, where was on Bar Mitzvah and etcetera.</span> <span id="s252">That’s connection family who is jewi -- our family with Jewish family in the same branch, the same business, the same trade.</span> <span id="s253">And during the high school time, was not many Jews, mostly it was like Catholic and the Protestant, not Jewish young people.</span> <span id="s254">In other words, this time, up to ’39, in school was not close connection to young Jewish people.</span> <span id="s255">On the m-mem -- part of my family, from 1930 to 19 thir -- near ’42 - ’44, na -- we was connected very closely to couple family, Jewish family in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">And special after 1939, the -- some family from Wilno moved to Warsaw, a Jewish family wo -- who moved to Warsaw, and name call Epstein, and we was close, and very important for us this time, we na -- was family name Melamid.</span> <span id="s257">Was three kids, and two g -- brothers and a girl, and a Melamid family and grand family of Melamid was Birnbaum.</span> <span id="s258">And he was very close, and still was a business connection and my father was couple times -- was very -- like I said before, he’s ver -- was very nice, honest man, and was call for some arrangement, some discussion, not only discussion, it was business people, but be Catholic and Jewish.</span> <span id="s259">And to wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: A problem, you mean?</span> <span id="s261">Some si --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: A problem, some --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: -- problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: And before go to the court, these people created some -- honest people from one side and other side, and dissolved the problem, in other words, straightened the problem.</span> <span id="s267">My father was called like the judge.</span> <span id="s268">In other words, Jewish people try -- know Father was honest and Catholic was thinking my father was honest person.</span> <span id="s269">That’s was our connection.</span> <span id="s270">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And was this in the 30’s, before the ghet --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, this was -- 30’s - 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: In the 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Now the 19 -- from 1939, that’s was little bit different situation because start created ghetto concentration camps in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: And for example, the concentration camp, very important thing.</span> <span id="s277">In Poland was, before the war, three and a half m-million Jewish people.</span> <span id="s278">The biggest concentration in Poland -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s279">Mean was for Jewish people, was some chance better like in Germany or France.</span> <span id="s280">And German know this after the war, and before too, the big concentration Jewish people in Poland, that’s, from my point of view, was created and yet -- and German created so many concentration camps in Poland.</span> <span id="s281">One of the important concentration camp was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s282">The Auschwitz was built first couple weeks after a war was [indecipherable] 1939, and first prisoner was not Jewish people, was Catholic people.</span> <span id="s283">And which one Catholic people?</span> <span id="s284">All professors from university.</span> <span id="s285">All the lawyers, engineers, and clergy was sent first to concentration camp, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s286">That’s first there was only Polish people was there, and was not directly kill, only hard labor created the deaths.</span> <span id="s287">1941 start Jewish people there, and start the death camp.</span> <span id="s288">Concentration camp that’s the one part, people dying because was overwork.</span> <span id="s289">And death camp, was sent there and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: That’s was the different and this must be straight, because I was in concentration camp, not in Auschwitz, only in Flossenbürg, that’s was political prison during -- before the war ’39, where Hitler put all opponents, own party, to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s292">Many German people was there, that’s was political prison.</span> <span id="s293">And that’s my own concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: But we talk later about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Later we’ll talk about that.</span> <span id="s297">Let -- let’s -- let’s go -- go ahead, I don’t want to interrupt you, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Ah yes, you ask me I -- I have many f -- I have not very close friend, and I -- Jewish people this time before -- during school, because in a class was 40 people, 50, and was two Jewish people, you know.</span> <span id="s299">And was living in different place, like we -- and we not have close connection.</span> <span id="s300">And still we seem the same, Polish citizen, has the same right like we Catholic, Protestant or Muslim, because was couple Muslim too.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: We have the same -- and I feel this -- I was raise in the same feeling, who because you must know and I am sure you know, the Polish Constitution was the second in the world after American Constitution, and it is the same Constitution, freedom from everyth -- everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Did -- wh-when you were growing up in Poland as a kid, before the war, did you experience people expressing anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s304">Did you -- did you understand that there was a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: You know si -- you know si -- this is big word.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: A big word, a big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I live -- I born there, and my race is this time there.</span> <span id="s310">And the feeling was not anti-Semitic so much -- some people, yes.</span> <span id="s311">Like the J-Jewish people has m-more educated in this time -- part -- part, not all, because if we talking about the Jewish, we must divide -- and the problem is, we must divide between -- up to bucar -- Vistula river west, and Vistula river east.</span> <span id="s312">Vistula river west was not big su -- problem.</span> <span id="s313">West -- excuse me, east, was mostly people very sympatic to Communist regime.</span> <span id="s314">Socialist Communist regime.</span> <span id="s315">On the west part of the Poland, I mean, from the Vistula river, was little differ -- different and was from German idea anti-Semitic, and was not catch all of nation.</span> <span id="s316">Was only ma -- some small part.</span> <span id="s317">On east Poland was very big, torrential Communist ideology.</span> <span id="s318">And I lose my --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Well, I think what I -- what I was asking you is, given th -- when -- when people live separately, and in many societies they do this, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So that children are often raised to think --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Oh, excuse me, that’s I -- I not feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: -- now you remind me.</span> <span id="s325">Mostly was a economical problem.</span> <span id="s326">And that’s -- if we call this anti-Semitism, that’s wrong.</span> <span id="s327">That’s was economical.</span> <span id="s328">Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close together and was the same token, more successful.</span> <span id="s329">And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the east, was more lazy, like all the Russian this time.</span> <span id="s330">Not produce so much, not educated so much.</span> <span id="s331">And start the different between Jewish more educated and -- and born on the east part of the Poland, more lazy and more -- not created.</span> <span id="s332">So -- and that’s was all time the different economical.</span> <span id="s333">Not only anti-Semitic -- I understand, because you are Jewish, you are no good.</span> <span id="s334">You are a Polish -- Polish, you are good -- you are good.</span> <span id="s335">And question is, economical -- the answer is economical base.</span> <span id="s336">That’s if somebody called the anti-Semitism, that’s not right.</span> <span id="s337">I not feel this way.</span> <span id="s338">Was some people was, from the point of view.</span> <span id="s339">This is -- Jewish mean this fellow is different like we are, because the fellow has [indecipherable] the fellow has the factory, the fellow working hard.</span> <span id="s340">And ss -- that’s not ss -- for me it’s not ss -- right.</span> <span id="s341">What I understand before the war, that’s was only different on eco -- economical base, not religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: So you don’t think that there was some kind of difference based on the fact that Jews believed differently than Catholics or Protestants?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No, I don’t think so, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s344">I -- I a -- race, you know, but to different people -- in my class, for example, was many -- not many, couple, Protestants.</span> <span id="s345">Nobody never talk about [indecipherable] feel this way, I feel other way.</span> <span id="s346">Generally speaking, like I said before, this was economical base in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay, so let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s348">When Hitler comes to power in 1933 --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: -- between ’33 and ’39, before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: -- there is a rise of Fascism, or the right in Poland as well.</span> <span id="s353">Am -- am I not correct?</span> <span id="s354">There was --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Before the war, was -- for me was not so popular start argument and fighting with the Jewish people, it was not popular.</span> <span id="s356">Some part of student in university created some, we are against the Jews who are educated in our university, because Jewish are 10 percent of the population, and in our class are 40 percent the Jewish people, educated by state.</span> <span id="s357">That’s economical [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s358">And all some student who said Jewish in our class supposed to be 10 percent, not 40 percent.</span> <span id="s359">And now you can call how you like, Anti-Semitist, or economical [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s360">You see, that’s the very big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Do you think that the numerous clauses that was put into effect, the numerous clauses, which didn’t allow as many Jewish students as before was a function of economics?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Economical --</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: -- because some poor guys -- as -- very smart, cannot go to university because there was already, for example, 40 percent Jewish people.</span> <span id="s365">And this guy was [indecipherable] not me?</span> <span id="s366">Why I cannot go there?</span> <span id="s367">You see, that’s the story.</span> <span id="s368">You must look both ways.</span> <span id="s369">And still I have very big respect for -- this time, for Jewish parents, try and pay for education own children.</span> <span id="s370">That’s I mention [indecipherable] we must look after Jewish people.</span> <span id="s371">And take the sample, educate it own people.</span> <span id="s372">And this time, in Poland, many people not think this way.</span> <span id="s373">And Jewish people was ahead, educated own children.</span> <span id="s374">That’s the very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s376">So when you’re -- when Hitler comes to power in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: -- were you very conscious of what’s going on, is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: -- is -- did the papers have a lot of stuff, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: We -- we look all a moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: -- Hitler, and we were so upset.</span> <span id="s384">Why did friends, or British not do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: And Hitler grow, and you know, expend -- that’s was our -- na -- is interesting.</span> <span id="s387">We look -- I said before, two, three newspaper daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And we know, and each as -- from us, especially young people like me was thinking, we supposed to be the people who are honest, and people who are fair for everybody.</span> <span id="s390">He -- old people thinking, no, we are looking a little bit for right side.</span> <span id="s391">I was more liberal, after I grow up and I know a little bit more, I was little bit more towards center.</span> <span id="s392">And Hitler was created, you know, the situation, people start talking about the Jewish problem, and it’s a -- etcetera.</span> <span id="s393">And not many people supported this idea, what I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s395">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Some crazy guy at left or right, that’s was not my idea.</span> <span id="s397">I try balance in my life opinion.</span> <span id="s398">And still Hitler did the worst part what happened to Jewish people, Polish people and other people who was lost life in concentration camp and death camp.</span> <span id="s399">That’s what happened right now, and I not see in the newspaper in America right now mention how many people die, how they this or this.</span> <span id="s400">And now the German raise like big nation and -- and are successful, and our people in America, in Poland, are depress.</span> <span id="s401">That’s my feeling.</span> <span id="s402">That’s my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: When di -- you talked about eating meals with y -- the whole family.</span> <span id="s404">Did you eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with the family?</span> <span id="s405">All three meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: All three meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, we would -- in Poland was differently to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Eight -- seven o’clock was breakfast very quick, very quick, and we go to school, and ni -- later there we come back, three o’clock, and five o’clock was dinner.</span> <span id="s413">And during dinnertime, everybody was supposed to be near table.</span> <span id="s414">That’s -- we -- with my wife, doing the same way.</span> <span id="s415">Our children was raised the same time.</span> <span id="s416">During the meals, we sup -- special evening, six or five o’clock, we supposed to be together and we eat and we discuss and we change our opinion.</span> <span id="s417">That’s very important thing, because this way father know what the children think, children know what father think.</span> <span id="s418">And they -- some idea, you know, left, right, was created, because I heard the other person opinion.</span> <span id="s419">That’s was very -- and was and is important for family connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s421">And did people in your family have different viewpoints?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh sure di --</span></p> <p><span

also go to m-middle you know, and we think that’s the right way.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: You must think about the other fellows, other opinion, other idea, and that’s way we was raised.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And were you afraid of war?</span> <span id="s440">Did your family think --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh everybody -- everybody are afraid to war, if somebody know what mean the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: But were you specifically afraid that Germany would attack Poland?</span> <span id="s443">Did your

germa -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Because I -- before -- because I read three newspaper, I know what mean the Communist who are -- Communist in the book is very nice.</span> <span id="s546">Practically bur -- talking, the east part, this is Asian people, and all time talking differently, doing differently, and you never know what happen.</span> <span id="s547">That’s -- I was scared.</span> <span id="s548">And people who was with me in the same company, know is only right now chance, take our dresses and insignia what was -- because the rifle was already gone, because was taken by Russian, and escape.</span> <span id="s549">We know about, we must do this.</span> <span id="s550">We was prepare mentally.</span> <span id="s551">There is not good.</span> <span id="s552">There i -- west is not good, east is no good.</span> <span id="s553">We must survive.</span> <span id="s554">That, you know, I give him watch, a -- this time for Soviet, have the watch, that’s was drim.</span> <span id="s555">And I have 20 dollar -- 20 zloty, was nice m-money, because p -- my parents give me before I go there.</span> <span id="s556">And we escape, was six people.</span> <span id="s557">Six people and two go north, to Litvah, and two go -- we go to Warsaw, and two go to east.</span> <span id="s558">And this go t -- well, go to east probably, I never heard about it, or probably was killed or something.</span> <span id="s559">Two go -- go north, because this part was close to Vilnos, couple hundred kilometer from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s560">And these two guys, one of the was very famous general in Poland, son, go to Litvah and later they fight in English -- go through the Litvah to [indecipherable] Estonia, and go to Sweden, and later there fight like officer in Navy -- British Navy.</span> <span id="s561">And three -- two guys walk from there through the forest and etcetera, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s562">And the way -- like we walk was not so easy, because you must know, between German and Lithuanian was something close, mean German talk to Lithuanian nationalist who work later, therefore German like not Gestapo, only military unit, and was against the Poland.</span> <span id="s563">Very against the Poland.</span> <span id="s564">Small country, very against the Poland.</span> <span id="s565">And after Soviet destroyed our army from east, these people, Lithuanian -- not all, and mostly, was very upset about the Polish army.</span> <span id="s566">And I myso -- we must walked -- walk to Warsaw during night because on the -- in the forest, I saw myself, many officer hanging, by Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s567">And without the boots, you know.</span> <span id="s568">In other words, we was scared.</span> <span id="s569">That’s was scare.</span> <span id="s570">Because you never know where you go.</span> <span id="s571">We cannot go through the village, because [indecipherable] scared of the village was checkpoint, checkpoint created by Polish Communists, and check you everything, and you know, you never know, you can go to -- later they arrest and go to Siberia.</span> <span id="s572">And between these people with a red band, was many Polish poor guy who was created, who was Communist and maybe Jewish people, poor Jewish people too, who think [indecipherable] new area, you -- a new life because everybody be free.</span> <span id="s573">Fine, be free, only not raise up to free, mean to middle class.</span> <span id="s574">Only turn down -- everybody down.</span> <span id="s575">And the people was thinking that the right way, and was wrong.</span> <span id="s576">And to me going back, we -- to Warsaw, we must be careful where we are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: That’s 800 miles -- kilometer.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: 800 kilometers.</span> <span id="s580">So you walked at night --</span></p> <p><span

id="s586">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: -- and meet other guy help us.</span> <span id="s588">That’s was the reason we were very slow from September to end of de -- December, we walk 700 kilometers by foot.</span> <span id="s589">And before we cross borderline on the river Bug, some big river, we was waiting when we can cross there, because there was German and here was the bol -- the

half million people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: And you know, Polish underground men go to -- through the all borders from Germany to Hispania and later there to Anglia, and Mr. Karski, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: -- that the name, go there and talk to [indecipherable] talk later there to -- to the President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1349">And the people not believe first, and second, between us, Jewish people not help much.</span> <span id="s1350">New York Jewish people not help much Jewish people in Warsaw, because was not -- not believe can happen to people like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Did you know of Jan Karski’s work during the war, or did you only find out about it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No during the war, I know after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: That he was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: And I know him personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: I know him personally.</span> <span id="s1357">A very nice, you know, brave man and etcetera.</span> <span id="s1358">And during this war, underground army cannot do mu -- much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Because was each -- we must be careful with the underground, also many German people live in Poland [speaks Polish here] was spy for Germany.</span> <span id="s1361">And you must be very close -- if we talk together we go outside, not inside because maybe is something not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: -- connect some instrument and that was not so easy.</span> <span id="s1364">Now, every pa -- body criticize.</span> <span id="s1365">For example, Jewish people suggest the railroad tracks in Poland to Auschwitz supposed to be -- supposed to be bombard by alliance.</span> <span id="s1366">Never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: You mean by Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: By -- right.</span> <span id="s1369">By American or a -- or a -- English.</span> <span id="s1370">Never happened.</span> <span id="s1371">You see, because this was calculated risk, is not make sense, we must win the war.</span> <span id="s1372">Meantime, you win the war, and how many Jewish or Polish live -- lost your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: You know that’s politics -- and -- and besides this, you must know one thing.</span> <span id="s1375">After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take first all guns, all radio, all instrument against the enemy, and in Poland was not -- you cannot buy gun, you cannot have some ammunition, because everything German took out.</span> <span id="s1376">And later there, before start the Warsaw uprising, how you can have the guns?</span> <span id="s1377">Buy from the German who are against the war happen, or kill the German and take the ha -- gun.</span> <span id="s1378">Was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Because if you kill one German, a hundred people was hanged tomorrow or -- or shot tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1381">That’s very -- very touchy moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: That’s not so easy, because somebody special, who never know in conspiracy, and never know the organization Armia Krajowa think we supposed to do more, or why you not do this, how you not -- that’s was everything calculated, you know.</span> <span id="s1384">If you do something good for one person and lost two person home, that’s not make sense.</span> <span id="s1385">And etcetera.</span> <span id="s1386">And I am a little bit upset maybe, cause Karski was in the west, and not help -- help, and not support ne -- from American government and from Jewish government -- for Jewish, I am not [indecipherable], in Jewish.</span> <span id="s1387">And that’s was for me big question, why.</span> <span id="s1388">I understand for example, the New York Jewish organization cannot give the guns, cannot give ammunition, and can’t give the money -- money, and for money, American money, you can buy in Poland this time, everything.</span> <span id="s1389">And that’s my point, the personal point view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: I not represent, you know, some organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Right, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: And that’s my personal view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: And I know these people can help little bit more own people.</span> <span id="s1396">That’s my feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Because we Polish people cannot -- Catholic people, we cannot think somebody can help us.</span> <span id="s1399">Only English, French supposed to have some sign, agreement supposed to help Poland, but it never did, and forgot Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: We’re going to take a break because we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Oh, oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1495">What did you see?</span> <span id="s1496">I mean, when you close your eyes, and you think about what you saw when you walked into the ghetto, how different was it from what you saw outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Oh no, th-that’s big different, you know, and how many times you go there -- we were very upset.</span> <span id="s1498">The people laying on the floor -- street, dying.</span> <span id="s1499">S-Some people without the clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: -- because if somebody die on the street, the other people take the clothes and sell or something like this.</span> <span id="s1502">It was very, very upset situation.</span> <span id="s1503">I told you before, the living situation in ghetto was worse like in co -- in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: So did you think that the Nazis -- the Germans were in some ways killing the Jews?</span> <span id="s1505">Without -- without sent -- bef -- this is before they’re sending them to Treblinka, by starving them to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Oh, sure, the German can shoot anybody on street, without a problem, and special in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1507">And not many German was in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Not many Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Only was on the gates and secure the whole town wall to ghetto.</span> <span id="s1512">And inside, I think, was pro-probably -- I never saw, was some Gestapo who give the order to Judenrat, you do this, you do this, you produce this, you give me some goods or something like this.</span> <span id="s1513">And mostly the German ask Judenrat and press -- give couple thousand people daily, daily, for work in east.</span> <span id="s1514">That’s was idea.</span> <span id="s1515">After couple months -- couple weeks, the Polish underground organization check where the people are going on the east, and start know that’s was Treblinka, a-and Sobibor -- Sobibor, and the other camp where the people was killed by gas, and later there cra -- cremated.</span> <span id="s1516">And -- and the last time I remember the Jewish rat was obligated -- mean Jewish rat and -- Jewish police supposed to deliver 10,000 people daily.</span> <span id="s1517">And this go to Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s1518">From Umschlagplatz was sent to concen -- to death camp, not concentration camp, death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q:

not not one, hundred people dead or dying.</span> <span id="s1530">And you know, the people who die on the street, Judenrat organ -- organize the -- some transport.</span> <span id="s1531">Two wheels and platform and two guys, or three guys take the s-street the dad -- dead body and put later there to the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s1532">Because to Umschlagplatz people know more like I know, I understand if was coo -- supposed to be deliver 10,000 people for example, the police take the dead people too, means hundred dead, plus 9,900 people.</span> <span id="s1533">In other words, the transport com-commander inside the ghetto take the dead body and deliver someplace.</span> <span id="s1534">I don’t know, I know it’s not there.</span> <span id="s1535">And you cannot see hundred people -- thousand people right -- right ya -- one day on the street, because each day, or all time continue, was clean the street, by the dead body.</span> <span id="s1536">Still, I saw not one, not two, hundred people dying or dead on the street.</span> <span id="s1537">Was terrible situation, terrible.</span> <span id="s1538">That’s was hunger, people have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1539">Live very bad condition and nobody can help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1541">So this must have been very depressing for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Very depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Very depressing.</span> <span id="s1545">And the -- and the -- from this time, I was little bit not sure, and many Polish poor people, and young, deliver to ghetto food, b-back of a ka -- kartofel mean the potato or something others.</span> <span id="s1546">And work was the Jewish people on the other side, some way, or you saw some hole in the wall, maybe foot by 18 inches.</span> <span id="s1547">The children go through.</span> <span id="s1548">Children go through -- go to Aryan place, and beg or make business, these small guys.</span> <span id="s1549">Bring the money and buy some -- something, I don’t know what kind food.</span> <span id="s1550">Buy something and later right through the hole, deliver there.</span> <span id="s1551">And many people -- many time happened the gendarmes was over there and ki -- killed the guy, young child.</span> <span id="s1552">And we was popular in Poland -- Warsaw, in Aryan area where the young children doing something, buying or -- or begging for food.</span> <span id="s1553">Mean, even, ghetto was terrible, terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1554">I not -- I be very glad not see any more something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Only later there, I saw in my concentration camp, 5,000 body [indecipherable] was burn, because crematorium was working 24 y -- four hours, and not -- cannot burn the body.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: So they burned them in a --</span></p> <p><span

[indecipherable] there hang, you know, and start to do -- liquidate uprising in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: In the ghetto, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1578">I understand that you were arrested twice, as you were going in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Yes, because I carry all the time something in my pocket if I go to -- and people who are -- I know on the other side, begging me, give me something, bring us something, I bring s-something what I can put in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1580">And one day was, you know, sticking too much, and --</span></p> <p><span

through, and I feel we did something good for people, like for example the 12 Jewish people, the -- some got -- leave us chance to live through the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2275">That’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: What do you carry with you?</span> <span id="s2277">Do you think about this a great deal, this part of your history and talk about it a lot?</span></p>

Stalin kill own people, 20 million Russian and Soviet people.</span> <span id="s2289">Hitler kill maybe more, only not kill own people.</span> <span id="s2290">Russian kill own people, too.</span> <span id="s2291">That’s two very bad character people, and I be glad if during my short right now time, I not see somebody who do for our [indecipherable] people something like this.</span> <span id="s2292">And that’s -- that’s my point of view.</span> <span id="s2293">I like people born free and supposed to be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: And so the various genocides that have

and have not chance.</span> <span id="s2304">I was chance, I take my chance and I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: And I am glad the people who were
