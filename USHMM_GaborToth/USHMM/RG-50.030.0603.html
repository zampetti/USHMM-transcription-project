Agnishka Nakur (ph) on October 17, 2010, at the Kindertransport Association Conference in Arlington, Virginia.</span> <span id="s13">We would like to ask you a question about your childhood.</span> <span id="s14">How far do your memories reach and what do you remember about your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: My earliest memory is from somethingjust a scene that took place before I was two years old, so I don't know how oldwhere I'm standing in my crib and I see my father coming into the room, and my mother is already in bed.</span> <span id="s16">After that, there'sthere are not too many things, a scene here, a scene there.</span> <span id="s17">Definitely, I remember from three on quite a few scenes.</span> <span id="s18">There's no continuous memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: I didn't ask you that at the beginning but could you tell us what year you were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born May 1932, in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: In Vienna.</span> <span id="s22">And you just mentioned that you recall the very early memories of your mother and your father.</span> <span id="s23">What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My mother's name was Leonee (ph), her maiden name was Oberzone (ph).</span> <span id="s25">Her father was Croatian and her mother was Czech.</span> <span id="s26">And my father's name was Ernst Steiner (ph) and his parentshis mother was originally Czech and his father Polish.</span> <span id="s27">So they were all from different parts of the AustroHungarian Empire, and they landedmy grandparents all landed up in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So I guess your maiden name was probably Obersteiner, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Obersteiner (ph), right.</span> <span id="s30">Steiner in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Steiner in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, I was only child.</span> <span id="s35">And when I was about two years oldwhen I was born, my father lost his job.</span> <span id="s36">His boss saidthis was during the Great Depression, and his boss said, "I know you cannot support a family on what I pay you so you're fired."</span> <span id="s37">And he never found another job in Vienna.</span> <span id="s38">And he ended uphe was a communist and he ended up finding work in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s39">And when he came back he had to live illegally because the communist party was illegal.</span> <span id="s40">So that was probably the only memory I have of my father, when I wasbefore I left Viennano, II do remember him again.</span> <span id="s41">After he came back, he tried to teach me a few words of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When he returned from Russia, right?</span> <span id="s43">From working in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">And he was jailedhe was caught; he was jailed with Nazis and communists.</span> <span id="s46">Both parties were illegal; they were jailed together as political prisoners.</span> <span id="s47">And when he got outthis was already near the time of the Anschluss; it was in 1938.</span> <span id="s48">And my mother immediately was able to get a domestic's visa to go to England as a cook, so she left first.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And you stayed with your father or</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I stayed with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s51">My mother and I had been living with her mother, my maternal grandmother, so most of my memories are from my maternal grandmother's apartment.</span> <span id="s52">And while my father was away he sent back as much money as he could, but my mother and I lived with my grandmother, and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s53">The second one to leave was my father, who left illegally with friends over the border into Switzerland, and then to France, and eventually he was interned in France, and my rich great uncle from America sent money to take him to New York.</span> <span id="s54">And also, my grandparents, my father's parentsit was my grandfather's brother who was here in New York City, and so they were also rescued.</span> <span id="s55">My great uncle brought them over, and eventually also my father's next younger brother, and my mother and I joined the family in New York in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you mentioned that your father was working in Russia.</span> <span id="s57">What was his job there and what was his profession in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: He was what we now call a high school dropout, but he went to technical school and he became sort ofhis jobI'm not always sure what he exactly studied but he workedbefore he lost his job on my account, he worked for a company that set up medical equipment for doctors, you know, in doctors' officesfluoroscopes and whatever.</span> <span id="s59">They had very little equipment then but whathe took it to the office and he set it up and made sure it was working and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Would you say that you were relatively welloff until he lost his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No.</span> <span id="s64">He didn't get paid very much, and mywhen awhen my mother and I lived with my maternal grandmother, she had lost everything during the course of World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: So there were the remnantsshe had been wealthy.</span> <span id="s67">There were the remnants of that.</span> <span id="s68">She always used to show me the wonderful chinaware and silver and so on and say, "When you grow up and get married, this will be yours."</span> <span id="s69">On my father's side, my grandfather had a small butcher shop, a little neighborhood butcher shop, so they were definitely lowermiddle class.</span> <span id="s70">Myon my mother's side, they were very uppermiddle class, but I never saw anything of that because we lived in relative poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you attend any schools in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Only kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did you have many friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well, I had a best friend who lived across the street.</span> <span id="s75">Her name was Bitte (ph), and she was half Jewish, and I never found out what happened to her.</span> <span id="s76">And I had myotherwise, I can only remember playing with the children in kindergarten, and when we went to the park, always whatever children were together, played together.</span> <span id="s77">So I would bring a ball to play with, or a jumping rope or whatever, and we all played together.</span> <span id="s78">But the only real friend that I remember is Bitte, who lived across the street from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And those children out in the playground and in the kindergarten, did you live in a strictly Jewish district or was it a mixed district?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: It was not a Jewish district.</span> <span id="s81">It was the FourthFourth District in Vienna, and wemy grandmother was told she had to leave butbecause it was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s82">But the kindergarten was run by a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s84">So if you were to describe your family would you say that your family was relatively wellassimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Or did you speak all German between each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, all German.</span> <span id="s88">My grandfather on my mother's side had been one of the founders of the Free Thinkers Association of Vienna, so we were not religious.</span> <span id="s89">And on the other side, my father's father had had a Jewishhe came from shtetl in Poland, had had a Jewish education, and sort of shook the dust off his feet, that was it, no more.</span> <span id="s90">And so I grew up with Christmas trees; I did notwe were not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: You didn't practice any Jewish customs or religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Not at all, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Didn't know any Jewish prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">We learned a little Hebrew song in kindergarten, but I, no, had no religious education in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: And do you recall when the things started to change?</span> <span id="s97">Do you remember when the tension started growing in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: What I noticed firstwell, first of all, I didn't start school when I should have, when I turned six.</span> <span id="s99">I remember my grandmother rented out a room to a boarder.</span> <span id="s100">It was the same room I remember in that scene where my father is coming into the room.</span> <span id="s101">Well, she eventually had to rent out that room, and the lady must have been a Nazi because she gave me a coin for my sixth birthday, and she said, "Soon we'll have a new picture on the coins."</span> <span id="s102">And she was very triumphant; you know, she was gloating over this.</span> <span id="s103">And then I remember the most frightening thing, when the doorbell rang one day.</span> <span id="s104">And my grandmother was a little hard of hearing, she didn't hear, and I kept telling her, "Oma, the door."</span> <span id="s105">And she went to the door and these two men in Nazi uniform came in with the high, shiny black boots and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s106">And they passed through the room where I was, and one of them patted me on the head and said something.</span> <span id="s107">And I have no idea what he said, I justI was terrified.</span> <span id="s108">And they went into the next room with my grandmother and shut the door.</span> <span id="s109">And I heard a lot of talking and then they all came out, and my grandmother came back from closing the front door and she had tears running down her face.</span> <span id="s110">And she said, "We have to move out, we're not allowed to live here anymore."</span> <span id="s111">And then one dayI don't know how many days after thiswe went to a police station, my grandmother and I, and I believe she got a stay, you know, she didn't have to move immediately, because we stayed there.</span> <span id="s112">But I remember the police station, the big picture of Hitler and the flags and so on, which I found very frightening, but she seemed relieved, and I'm sure it's because she got this stay, she didn't have to leave immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Was your mother already in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">My mothermy mother took me to a friend's house outside Vienna, because my parents thought in the first days I would be safer staying with friends of theirs who were outside the city.</span> <span id="s116">And they also had children.</span> <span id="s117">So I stayed there a few days, and my mother, when she put me to bed that first night and she said to be very good and brave and she would see me as soon as possible, that she was leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And you're talking about moving to England right now?</span> <span id="s119">In the house outside the city, it was in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: It was outside Vienna.</span> <span id="s121">And then after a few days my father said I could come back to Vienna, and my grandmother came and got me and took me back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Was there anything specific happening in Vienna at that time that</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s124">I think they were just unsure.</span> <span id="s125">This wasmy mother left in April of '38, so in March '38 is when the Germans actually came in in person, and then she left almost immediately, in April.</span> <span id="s126">My mother was very blond and blueeyed and she looked, if anything, Slovak, not Jewish, if you're going by stereotype.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: So my father pushed her on the Aryan line when it was time to get her papers stamped.</span> <span id="s129">And he said, "These are still Austrians, they'll look at you and they won't ask for proof."</span> <span id="s130">And sure enough, that's what happened, they just stamped, instead of standing in the long, long Jewish line.</span> <span id="s131">So she left and thenshe left me with these friends, and then it couldn't have been longtwo, three daysmy father brought me back.</span> <span id="s132">I think they were just unsure of what would happen in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So that probably happened shortly after the Anschluss, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Beforeactually before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s135">It was in between the marchin (ph) because when she left, the man who stamped her papers told my mother, "Be sure to go to the embassy and vote about the Anschluss."</span> <span id="s136">He was thinking, Good Aryan, she'll vote yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: For the Anschluss, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: So it was part of, you know, this interim period.</span> <span id="s139">And then I have a memory that must have been around Kristallnacht, because I remember comingwalking with my grandmother, and we passed where my kindergarten was.</span> <span id="s140">And as I said, it was run by a Jewish organization, and I saw a truck pulling away with the furniture from the kindergarten and broken things on the ground and broken glass.</span> <span id="s141">So I think that probably was around that time maybe, Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s142">And then the next thing, my father took me to the parkI think it was right before he was going to leaveand at first he had thought he would take me along but then</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: To Russia, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, to France, to Switzerland and France.</span> <span id="s145">And then I think he got a little bit more realistic, that a sixyearold trying to climb illegally over the Alps into Switzerland wouldn't work too well.</span> <span id="s146">So that was when he tried to teach me a few words of English, thinking my mother is more likely to be able to get me to join her.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">My parents realized immediately that there was not a hope if they didn't each go out as quickly as possible and then try and bring me out.</span> <span id="s148">So my mother, in England, was trying to get papers for me to join her.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: She got you on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: That was before theas soon as she left she started trying.</span> <span id="s151">And there was a school, a boarding school that even signed a paper that she had paid for my schooling but the people, the officials, didn't believe it because how could a domestic get up enough money to pay for a year of boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: So they didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">But it was my grandmother who found out about the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s155">I have no idea how, but she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Did she talk to you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span> <span id="s158">All I remember is she toldshe showed me: "I have sewn your mother's address into your coat.</span> <span id="s159">If anything happens, you know that"she told me, "You're going to meet your mother, your mother is going to be there to meet you, and here's her address in your coat.</span> <span id="s160">If anything"you know, "if you get lost or anything, this is where your mother is."</span> <span id="s161">And she packedI don't remember her packing the suitcase.</span> <span id="s162">All I know is I have to leave my doll behind; she didn't pack my doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: I'm sure that was really upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was.</span> <span id="s165">I was only six and the doll would have been a comfort.</span> <span id="s166">But I had a bag with my lunch, the food for the trip, and we left at night.</span> <span id="s167">And although I was usually an obedient child, I clung to her and screamed on top of my lungs when they tried to take me away.</span> <span id="s168">The families were not allowed to go on the platforms so we were in this big waiting room, it was nighttime, and they tried tothe women who were organizing the transport tried to leave me with the other children, and I just held onto my grandmother and screamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So you didn't want to go, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: My grandmother was the lastyou know, this was my bastion, my home, and everybody went away and now she's sending me goodness knows where.</span> <span id="s171">I think I didn't really believe that my motherI don't know.</span> <span id="s172">And so</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did you doI mean, your mother left to Englandit was still very early, you were very young.</span> <span id="s174">I mean, did youdid you remember your mother very well when you were going on the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s176">It was only a few months different.</span> <span id="s177">I left in December of '38; she left in April of '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Were you closer with your grandma or with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: My mother went out to work so my grandmother watched me all day, you know, I was with her all day.</span> <span id="s180">But emotionally, it was my mother.</span> <span id="s181">I mean, always it was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: So did they succeed eventually in separating you from your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s184">Physically, I mean.</span> <span id="s185">They took my fingers off her skirt, and as soon, you know, as I was out of sight of my grandmother I think I just resigned myself: This is it.</span> <span id="s186">I stood with the other children waiting to get on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">[Interview interrupted when person enters room.]</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So we were just talking about you waiting with other children on the platform.</span> <span id="s189">Were there many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I don'tI don't know.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, there were quite a few but I have no idea exactly how many were on that particular transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Were they upset or that mostly was just regular?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I can't reallyI think I was too selfabsorbed toyou know, I justI don't even remember really looking around me at all.</span> <span id="s194">The next thing I remember, I was in a compartment on the train.</span> <span id="s195">There were four of us in the compartment, and I think we were all rather among the smaller ones there, all four of us.</span> <span id="s196">And it was nighttime, so one of the women who escorted us put some blankets on the flooryou know how those compartments</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Between the seats, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Between the seats.</span> <span id="s199">So two of us she put down to go to sleep on the floor and two on the seats, and somewhere in the middle of the night somebody came again and changed us around, so those on the floorI started out on the floor, then I was on a seat.</span> <span id="s200">I don't remember sleeping very much that night.</span> <span id="s201">It was just, you know, it was too confusing and upsetting.</span> <span id="s202">And we got to the German border, I suppose the next morning it was, and I remember being very frightened of the soldiers who came on board.</span> <span id="s203">And they checked everything, and I remember particularly being outraged that one of them took a piece of fruit from one of the children's food packages, and I thought, How can an adult steal from little children?</span> <span id="s204">The thing I don't remember, totally suppressed memory: Apparently I had a small gold locket on a chain around my neck.</span> <span id="s205">My mother was told that a German soldier tore it from my neck.</span> <span id="s206">I don'tI have no memory of that.</span> <span id="s207">I remember being in England some time later and being unhappy that I lost my necklace, but the incident itselfnow, he couldn't have torn it; I would have been cut.</span> <span id="s208">He must have taken it from around my neck.</span> <span id="s209">But that was so frightening, I don't remember it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Do you remember that locket at all?</span> <span id="s211">How did it look like?</span> <span id="s212">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s214">I only remember being unhappy that I had lost my necklace.</span> <span id="s215">Lost.</span> <span id="s216">But I don't even remember from that memory that I knew how come I had lost it, whereyou know, what had happened to it.</span> <span id="s217">Only later my mother told me that my grandmother had given me this locket and a German soldier took it from me.</span> <span id="s218">We weren't supposed to have jewelry, apparently, I don't know.</span> <span id="s219">But I've read other accounts that little girls did have necklaces or whatever.</span> <span id="s220">So I always found it strange that II can only remember mourning for it and not remember the thing itself or the incident where I lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s222">Sometimes that happens, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: And then later that day I was taken to be in a compartment with some older girls, and the rest of the trip was in that compartment.</span> <span id="s224">They tried to distract me</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Mother you a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s227">And I remember going through a tunnel and there was a train that I thought was on fire.</span> <span id="s228">And I realized since it was a coalburning train from those times and there were sparks coming out of the chimney, and I thought the train was on fire, the Nazis must have put the train on fire.</span> <span id="s229">You know, I blamed them for everything; the bad Germans had put the train on fire.</span> <span id="s230">And then we landed insomewhere in Holland, and there had been a blizzard and we couldn't proceed.</span> <span id="s231">We didn't get there until after the boat we were supposed to have taken had already left, and we spentwe got there at night again.</span> <span id="s232">It was nighttime and we were taken to this what looked like an immense hall.</span> <span id="s233">And there were some Dutch women who bathed us smaller ones, and there were rows of cots, and we were put to sleep.</span> <span id="s234">And I thought it was so strange: It's daylight and we're going to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">And then they gave us a hot meal, a hot dinner, the first hot food we had since we left home, and then we were taken to the ship for the channel crossing.</span> <span id="s236">Nighttime again.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What did you have to eat on the train and at that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I don't remember what I had to eat.</span> <span id="s239">Sandwiches of some kind that my grandmother gave me.</span> <span id="s240">I can't remember what I ate, only this business with the piece of fruit stuck with me.</span> <span id="s241">And on the Dutch end, again, I only remember it was hot food, and it was so nice because it was cold, it was winter, and that we had a nice hot meal, and that I thought I could almost understand these women.</span> <span id="s242">It's a Germanic language, but I couldn't totally understand them, so there wasand they seemedI don't know if this is a picture that I made later or if at the time: I really remember that they were rather rosy looking, cheerful, matronly kind of women, and they were ratherthe one who was bathing me was rather dismayed at how thin I was.</span> <span id="s243">Well, I was a thin little girl, always.</span> <span id="s244">It had nothing to do with lack of food, I was just a poor eater and a very thin child, but she was rather dismayed at how thin I was.</span> <span id="s245">The other thing I remember about the train trip was that I was afraid to ask to use the toilet.</span> <span id="s246">Now, it's impossible that I didn't use the toilet the whole time but I was afraid to ask.</span> <span id="s247">So I only went when somebody took me, you know, pushed me to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And who was there to ask?</span> <span id="s249">The chaperonnes?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: There were chaperonnes, there were women, but I didn'tI was afraid to ask.</span> <span id="s251">And I think that was the reason I had a kidney infection by the time Ior a bladder infection.</span> <span id="s252">By the time I reached England I had a bladder infection, because probably I held my urine much tooso that I got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And how about the passage from Holland to England, the one that started at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Oh, lucky you.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I slept.</span> <span id="s257">I had a cabin mate.</span> <span id="s258">Two of us children were put in a doubledecker cabin, and we got a talk about what to do if we get seasick and the bag and laid down, fell asleep, that was it.</span> <span id="s259">And the next thing I knew, it was England, and we disembarked and we were interviewed for the, you know, intake, whatever, and I was talked to by a nun.</span> <span id="s260">And I was afraid of nuns, and here was a nun with atalking a foreign language.</span> <span id="s261">I could say yes and no.</span> <span id="s262">That's all I remembered from my father's English lesson, yes and no.</span> <span id="s263">Doesn't help if you don't understand the question but</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Yeah, that's problematic.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: And then we were taken to Dover Court Camp.</span> <span id="s266">And it was still cold and snowy, and we were put to sleep that night.</span> <span id="s267">Again, it was night, the next thing I remember.</span> <span id="s268">There were small unheated cabins.</span> <span id="s269">You know, it was a summer camp.</span> <span id="s270">Dover Court was a children's summer camp, and the only heat was in the main hall.</span> <span id="s271">There was a potbellied stove.</span> <span id="s272">But we were putwe were given hot baths and put to sleep in the small cabins, and the woman who was there taking care of us told us to rub our legs against the sheets to make them warm.</span> <span id="s273">And the other thing, she gave us woolen robes to put on, bathrobes to put on, and we actually slept in them because it was so cold there.</span> <span id="s274">And the next day we walked over to the main hall where the one stove was.</span> <span id="s275">The little boy walking with me kept talking about his father's ice cellar, and I thought, here it was so cold, my feet were freezing, why is he talking about ice when it's so cold?</span> <span id="s276">And there we had breakfast.</span> <span id="s277">Don't remember what we had but I remember we were organized to dance around the stove to warm us up, you know.</span> <span id="s278">We were</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Was this your idea or did the</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: One of the women, you know, got us all together to dance until we warmed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">And then the next thing I remember was a man who came to adopt a little girl who took me away.</span> <span id="s282">And all the time I was talking about my mutti, and they hadit was a terrible mess, you know, the paperwork on the adult end was a terrible mess.</span> <span id="s283">They were in a hurry to get children out of there and the next train was coming and so on, and so they thought I was an orphan.</span> <span id="s284">Most of the children were orphans, and he camethis man came to adopt.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So he actually really wanted to adopt, not just to take you as a foster child.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s287">He hadhe was a Congressional minister, and he and his wife had a fouryearold son.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: And I was in the easy age group to get adopted.</span> <span id="s290">I was six, I had blond hair then, and so, you know, cute little girls got adopted rather quickly, and he didhe wanted a little girl as a sort of companion to his little fouryearold son.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So did you get adopted?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: He took me with him.</span> <span id="s293">He spoke maybe two, three words German and I spoke my yes and no.</span> <span id="s294">And I also kept showing them the address, and he wrote to this address, and he wrote: To Whom It May Concern, I have a little girl, and so on.</span> <span id="s295">And my mother wrote back: My daughter.</span> <span id="s296">She in the meantime had been trying to find out what happened to me because none of the organizational people seemed tothere seemed to be a terrible mess at that point, and she had gotten a letter from my grandmother that I should arrive such and such a day and nobody could tell her anything.</span> <span id="s297">And she was just recovering from illness, so she was not in good shape to go running around to agencies, so it was wonderful when he wrote.</span> <span id="s298">And he actually would have kept me as a foster child, because she couldn't keep me with her, she was a livein domestic, but I wanted to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s299">And she kept saying, "I'm going to have to put you in school, I can't keep you."</span> <span id="s300">But I just wanted to go with her, so I went with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So that seemed to have been a pretty nice family, the one that</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s303">They must be, because although I was still upset when I was there, because I wanted my mother and where is my mother, the things I rememberfor instance, I had ginger for first time, and gingerit always evokes this memory, and it's a pleasant emotion.</span> <span id="s304">So they were very nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: When you say ginger, you mean ginger cookie?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, just piece of</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Just to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Preserved ginger.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: It waswhen I landed, it was very close to Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So the memories from the foster family to be were pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: They were very pleasant, yes.</span> <span id="s313">But I only stayed there for a few days becausethey sentactually, they sent my mother a railway ticket to come to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: That is nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: And they had very little money.</span> <span id="s316">They had a doll for me as a present but then when Iwhen I wanted to leave with my mother I had to give it back to them because they were going to get another child and they actuallythey couldn't afford to buy a second doll to give to the new child.</span> <span id="s317">Now I understand it.</span> <span id="s318">Then I was very, you know, inside very indignant.</span> <span id="s319">It was a present; you don't take back a present, you know, butso my motherwell, I was finally able to tell my mother that I felt sick.</span> <span id="s320">So the first thing, she took me to the doctor and</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: With your bladder infection, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s323">And then she took me to the boarding school that she had enrolled me in.</span> <span id="s324">And they were a school who were taking refugee children.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: How was your mother able to afford a boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Charity pupil.</span> <span id="s327">The schoolyou know, she paid a little but she could notno, she couldn't have afforded the regular fees.</span> <span id="s328">But the same schoola little boy who was the son of friends of my mother was at that school.</span> <span id="s329">But I didn't stay there long because the school had been an allboy's school, and they were trying as an experiment to have boys and girls together, and they decided it wasn't good, and theyso I had to be moved elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: It wasn't working?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: It wasn't working.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: What was the age group for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s334">It seemed</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Were you two youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I was among the youngest.</span> <span id="s337">I seem to see a vast room with loads of children, and I learned how to eat with my arms tucked in properly, you know.</span> <span id="s338">You don't eat like this, you eat like this.</span> <span id="s339">And they started trying to teach me to read.</span> <span id="s340">I didn't even know English, you know.</span> <span id="s341">It was a little difficult.</span> <span id="s342">But I remember the big fuss when I said my first English sentence.</span> <span id="s343">I remember the matron there asked me, "Eva, where is your handkerchief?"</span> <span id="s344">And I said, "My handerchief is in my coat pocket."</span> <span id="s345">And I would have not remembered it, but she got so excited, and she called to a teacher close by: "Eva said a whole English sentence."</span> <span id="s346">"Eva, say it again.</span> <span id="s347">Where is your handerchief?"</span> <span id="s348">So this was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So actually, they must have been pleasant in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s351">You know, I remember trying hard to follow the reading.</span> <span id="s352">What I could do, they had to teach arithmetic.</span> <span id="s353">They had beads on a piece of stiff wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Abacus?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: But it wasthey were individual pieces.</span> <span id="s356">Like an abacus but individual.</span> <span id="s357">So you had toif you were adding, they gave you two and you had to count how many.</span> <span id="s358">So three plus four is seven.</span> <span id="s359">That I could understand, but the reading Ibecause I didn't really know the language.</span> <span id="s360">But what I remember, I was notnot always happy there.</span> <span id="s361">I remember, for instance, when my mother left me there I againI screamed and I said to her, "I will not learn anything, it's not""you shouldn't waste your money, I'm not going to learn anything, and particularly won't learn English."</span> <span id="s362">So of course, the first thing I did was learn English in selfdefense.</span> <span id="s363">What do you do?</span> <span id="s364">And the other thing I remember that shows I was pretty miserable for part of the time, at least: I remember sitting for hours when I hadwhen nobody was giving me a lesson and they said I could go and play.</span> <span id="s365">It was a sort of play room, and they had equipment for much smaller children also, and they had this little bench with pegs in it, and you took a hammer and you pounded the peg and then you turned it over and youI sat with thatI seem to remember endlessly banging and banging and banging.</span> <span id="s366">So I must have, you know, still been unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Because you were parted from your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I think that was it.</span> <span id="s369">I mean, I was parted from everything I knewlanguage, food, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: How was the English food?</span> <span id="s371">Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I don't remember much about it until later when I began to relax a little and things like kippers andvery strangeand you know That unhappy period didn't last long, but then the school found another place for me because they were getting rid of the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: And while you were still in that first school, were there only the refugee children?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No, no, no, they were mostly English children?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did they play?</span> <span id="s376">Did you guys play together.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I don'tall I remember with playing, aside from this banging on that, was there was an outdoor play area, and I remember going on a seesaw, and a little boy threw a stone and hit me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: And I couldn't figure outhe said it was an accident, that he meant to hit the wall behind me.</span> <span id="s380">And I remember wondering, Is it because I'm not English or because I'm a girl that he hit me with with a stone?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s382">It might have been an accident or it might have been on purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah, I don't know.</span> <span id="s384">But the nextI was back at that school briefly again for a few months in anotherit was a family that had a little day school in the house, and they had a girl and a boy and I camethey took me in to live with them, and that's where I learned to read, actually.</span> <span id="s385">And I was like the third child in the family, sort of.</span> <span id="s386">It wasn't a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Was it a British family?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes, it was British family.</span> <span id="s389">And then they went away briefly for holiday, to relatives, and they took me back to the school to stay for about a week.</span> <span id="s390">It wasn't more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: And who is your seat partner, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No.</span> <span id="s393">Another little girl, I think.</span> <span id="s394">I don't really remember interacting so much with other children.</span> <span id="s395">More with the adults around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Did youwere you able to see your mother often?</span> <span id="s397">Was the school close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Not so close.</span> <span id="s399">I don't remember her coming to visit at that school.</span> <span id="s400">But then the next placeI think it was a fairly brief period where I was at that first school, and the next place where I was with the other children, like a child in the family, I'm beginning to remember more, and there my mother could come.</span> <span id="s401">Not frequently but she cameI remember her coming to visit, I remember they helped me to make a birthday present for her, and I</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: It was a fancy handerchief.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: That's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: And</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did you embroider it?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No, not yet.</span> <span id="s408">Not then.</span> <span id="s409">Later in life my mother taught me to embroider.</span> <span id="s410">But there, I began to relax and my English improved and I finally began to understand reading, what that's all about.</span> <span id="s411">And the last time I was changed school, the one where I stayed the longest, my mother changed me only because she wanted</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: We have to pause.</span> <span id="s413">(Pause.)</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah, so</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: There we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I stayed there for relatively brief period.</span> <span id="s417">I remember being taken to a birthday party for another child, you know, along with Elizabeth and Christophergood English namesand feeling very like a princess, because I was given this fancyprobably one of Elizabeth's old dresses, and I thought, you know, this was it, this was ruffles.</span> <span id="s418">And we went to this children's party and I played and had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And those were mainly British children then that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes, they were allI don't think I had any contactuntil the third and the final school where I spent the year until we came to America, there therewas not another child while I was there, although I understand they took in several children during different times.</span> <span id="s421">But there was alike a teacher's helper who was also from Austria, and I didn't want to have anything to do with her; I wanted to be a little English girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did you speak the German at all or</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I wouldn't speak to her in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you communicate with your mum other than her coming to see her?</span> <span id="s425">Did you draw her pictures?</span> <span id="s426">Or I don't know if you could write in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I could not write in German.</span> <span id="s428">I could neither read or write because I didn't actually go to school at all.</span> <span id="s429">I learned to read and write in England and I wrote letters.</span> <span id="s430">My father at this time was in France and he saved letters I wrote to him in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: In English?</span> <span id="s432">Letters in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: In English, yes, in English.</span> <span id="s434">But he knew a little English.</span> <span id="s435">He knew a little bit of several languages so And thenoh, and then America, because while I was there he came to America.</span> <span id="s436">And I wrote him: I hope you like it in America andI don't know, I have the letters.</span> <span id="s437">He saved these little letters that I sent to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So you started integrating more and being more outgoing after</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, after school I wasI wanted to be a little English girl.</span> <span id="s440">I certainly didn't want to come to America.</span> <span id="s441">I didn't want to be uprooted again.</span> <span id="s442">At least this time I traveled with my mother.</span> <span id="s443">By this time, of course, there were air raids already and</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: So what year did you go to America?</span> <span id="s445">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: November of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: 1940.</span> <span id="s448">And that third school, what kind of school was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: It was a small boarding school called the Mildred Lodge School, in a little town called East Molesey in Surrey.</span> <span id="s450">So it was not very far from London; it was more Hampton Court Palace somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Julia has been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I just went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: So, you know, it wasn't that far for my mother to visit.</span> <span id="s454">Oh, there was one time my mother worked for a while forthe first family treated her so badly she said she would not go to work for rich people again, she would go to work as a general housekeeper to a more middle class family, and she worked for a family where the wife was American.</span> <span id="s455">The husband was British, the wife was American, they had a little baby, and they allowed my mother to have me with her for a week during the summer holidays.</span> <span id="s456">And the lady put red nail polish on my nails.</span> <span id="s457">When the matrons saw my red nail polish when I got back to school, ah, you would thinkit was shocking, terribly shocking.</span> <span id="s458">Immediately she took it off.</span> <span id="s459">And I thought it was so pretty, my red nails, and she just, oh</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: So the first family didn't allow for your mother to keep you for the holidays, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: The first family that she worked for, they had paid her fare so she had to work it off, and she hated them so much.</span> <span id="s462">All the kitchen cupboards were locked and the lady of the house had the key, and when my mother went to cook, she had to come and open all the locks, and as soon as my mother had taken out and so on, everything was locked again.</span> <span id="s463">She hated it so much.</span> <span id="s464">So there was somebody she already knew in England who lent her the money to pay off so she could leave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: And then she went to work for this nice family.</span> <span id="s467">And she would have stayed with them but they moved furtherwhen the bombings became more intense, they moved, and she didn't want to be so far away from where I was going to school so she left there.</span> <span id="s468">And I think what she did next, she went to work inan Austrian restaurant that a group of refugees had started.</span> <span id="s469">So she worked in the kitchen of the Austrian restaurant.</span> <span id="s470">And</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And you at that time were in that second school, right?</span> <span id="s472">Third school, and you were already a little bit older, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s474">By the timewe left in November '39.</span> <span id="s475">I was eight, and I could read and write and I was learning English history and long division and all those, which I hated.</span> <span id="s476">And when I was bad they sent me instead of being able to listen to the teacher read from "The Wind In The Willows" I had to do long division examples.</span> <span id="s477">Bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: It waswell, it was useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">I have onemy mother has one report card, the only one from England, from that school, the third one.</span> <span id="s481">And when I waswhen you were bad you gotaside from being punished, you got what they called an order mark.</span> <span id="s482">And if you wereif you left something where it shouldn't be you got a confiscation mark.</span> <span id="s483">And I had three and a half order marks and 45 confiscation marks, and the note: "Too untidy."</span> <span id="s484">But the general comment from Miss Randall, who ran the school, was something about my happy disposition.</span> <span id="s485">So by this time I was already doing much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Adjusting, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Did you have many friends in that school?</span> <span id="s489">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I remember particularly two girls.</span> <span id="s491">I wasit was a very small school.</span> <span id="s492">There were two classes, the upper form and the lower form, and I was in the lower form.</span> <span id="s493">There was one child younger than me.</span> <span id="s494">Poor little thing was five years old.</span> <span id="s495">She was an orphan and her uncle sent her to the school, and she wanted to adopt my mother.</span> <span id="s496">She so wanted a mother.</span> <span id="s497">And our beds were next to each other.</span> <span id="s498">So I remember her.</span> <span id="s499">Jill was her name.</span> <span id="s500">And I know there were two or three other children who were learning aroundyou know, we were learning about the same material and that if I finished my work sometimes I was told to help Jill with her reading, and I was rather proud of myself that now I could read well enough to help Jill.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was Jill also from___?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No, no, she was an English girl.</span> <span id="s503">There were two nonEnglish people there.</span> <span id="s504">But I know there were other children that came and went from that school, that they took in other refugee children.</span> <span id="s505">My mother said definitely I was a charity pupil because she paid a little bit.</span> <span id="s506">Nobody ever asked her for money for clothes for me, I always had the school uniforms and everything.</span> <span id="s507">And I remember going to church with them.</span> <span id="s508">They asked my mother if I could go to church to be, you know, with all the others, not to be singled out.</span> <span id="s509">I remember us walking in a line, you know, like those picture books of the children with the round hat with the ribbon hanging down.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Like Madeleine.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s512">Yeah, that's what we looked like in the spring, and in the winter we had brown woolen coats and brown felt hats when we went to church.</span> <span id="s513">Until the bombings got bad and then we didn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did that anywhere influence your religious affiliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, if I had stayed longer I would have become probably a nice religious little Church of England girl but I was reunited with my parents.</span> <span id="s517">And one day I said to my mother something about God, and she said, "Oh, we don't believe that."</span> <span id="s518">And I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s519">That was the end of that, no more God.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So you went with your mother, you traveled back to United StatesI mean, not back but for the first time to United States to reunite with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s522">I remember we left in an air raid, by train to Scotland, to Glasgow, and the boat sailed from Glasgow, and it was a tenday voyage because we crossed in a convoy until we reached the Canadian waters and came down, you know, as close to the coast line as possible to New York.</span> <span id="s523">And we landed in New York, and there was my father, who I barely recognized.</span> <span id="s524">And he started speaking German and I said to him, "You have to speak English to me, Daddy."</span> <span id="s525">So he spoke English to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Did you speak German?</span> <span id="s527">Did you remember any German?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I remembered a little.</span> <span id="s529">I can understand somewhat.</span> <span id="s530">Ithe first time I tried to speak German to my father he burst out laughing because I had an English accent in my German.</span> <span id="s531">And somebody who met me as an adult said, "You are the first person I've ever met who has a foreign accent in every language she speaks."</span> <span id="s532">Which I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: That is pretty amusing.</span> <span id="s534">So was it a happy reunion with your dad?</span> <span id="s535">Did hedid you have to wait long?</span> <span id="s536">Did you have to go towhen you were going through immigration in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Wethe immigration was onboard ship, the officer was onboard ship, and we were nearly the last ones off.</span> <span id="s538">My father was already in despair because they said if they're not processed that day we go to Ellis Island and have to be processed the next day.</span> <span id="s539">But we didwe got processed.</span> <span id="s540">And my father bought me at the pier a boxmy first American food, a box of these cookies called Mallowmars.</span> <span id="s541">I don'tthey are a piece of cookie, round.</span> <span id="s542">On top of that, marshmallow, and on top of that, chocolate, all coated in chocolate.</span> <span id="s543">My first American food.</span> <span id="s544">And then we went to my uncle's house.</span> <span id="s545">We were stayingthe great uncle who brought us all to America, we went to his house in Brooklyn and we stayed there for a little while.</span> <span id="s546">I immediately got an ear infection and ended up in Kings County Hospital, in the children's ward.</span> <span id="s547">During this time that I was in the hospital, my parents found an apartment in Manhattan with two sisters who were fellow refugees, and that's where I started school in America and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: And so five of you stayed in one apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s550">It wasin New York, the lowcost housing at that time, they had what they called railroad flats.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s553">On the street side is a living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Opening directly from the living room, no hallway, each room opened from another.</span> <span id="s556">That's why they called it railroad, because one after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: So my parents had the living room, I had the little bedroom right after them, next bedroom the two sisters shared, in the back looking on the back yard was the kitchen where we ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah, kitchen and bathroom next to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did you have to pass each other's rooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: So best room was your parents', nobody was passing their room, or was there an entry to the staircase through their room?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Well, there were two doors, the back doorkitchen door and the front door.</span> <span id="s565">And we stayed there not too long, until my parents could afford an apartment of their own.</span> <span id="s566">Butand then my father joined the American Army when the war broke out here, and disruption again.</span> <span id="s567">I think Iit took a long time until I began to be close to my father because of all the separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What about your grandmother?</span> <span id="s569">Did you keep in touch with her?</span> <span id="s570">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: My mother was able to write back and forth for a while.</span> <span id="s572">In fact, myfor my seventh birthday my mother asked for my grandmother to send some books, German books.</span> <span id="s573">So I have four books, two school books for beginning reading, you know, the first two</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: years of reading and writing book, and Grimm's fairy tales and Andersen's fairy tales, with beautiful pictures.</span> <span id="s576">Those were my presents for my seventh birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">And then there was nothing.</span> <span id="s578">You know, first, the letters came to the old address, then to another address, and after the war, when the Red Cross started helping people find relatives, we found out that she died either on the way to Theresienstadt or in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: So however, unlike most of the Kindertransport people, I did haveI had not only my parents, but one set of grandparents here.</span> <span id="s581">So I grew up fairly normally when it came to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s583">And did you start school in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: They put me in second grade, because they asked my mother when she went to enroll me, "How much schooling has Eva had?"</span> <span id="s585">And she said, "Well, not quite two years."</span> <span id="s586">So they put me in second grade.</span> <span id="s587">Now second grade here, they were still learning how to read, and I was at home reading "Alice in Wonderland" and, you know, real books, and in England I was learning history and geography and they were stumbling through Wilbert sat on the windowsill.</span> <span id="s588">And I think I nearly died of boredom.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: They didn't move you to an upper grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: They did eventually.</span> <span id="s591">The next semester I got moved, you know, but it was very choppy for a while, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Not very stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Not very smooth.</span> <span id="s594">The transitions weren't smooth because I got put ahead and put ahead.</span> <span id="s595">But it allyou know, by the time I was in middle school it was all kind of straightened out.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And did you find United States welcoming or did youhow did you see that move?</span> <span id="s597">Did you feel upset that you have to leave England?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s599">And strangely enough, the first time I was called a dirty Jew was here in the United States.</span> <span id="s600">One of the childrenyou know, they didn't know what they were saying and, you know, it was justI don't remember what I said back but it might have been "dirty Irish," for all I know, that I said back.</span> <span id="s601">I'm sorry but I have to
