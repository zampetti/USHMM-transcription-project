you didn’t know your extended family?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, we could go back to – to Jarocin and to Poznań for holidays; at Christmas, and so on.</span> <span id="s50">So I didn’t – I did know, especially, my maternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s51">My maternal grandfather died during the – a-after World War I, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: You didn’t know know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I didn’t know him at all.</span> <span id="s54">He died very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did your mother have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s63">A: Oldest, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s65">Your father, did he have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yes, he also had – he had one, two, three, four brothers, and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: These are rather large families.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes, they – these are, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Were they city people, town people?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They were – my grandfather, on my father’s side had a – a dairy, so they were farm people, even.</span> <span id="s71">And my mother – th-the father originally was a – a nobleman, he had an esta – they had an estate and they raised horses.</span> <span id="s72">And af – when the inflation in – started after the first world war, he was taking some horses to sell in Germany, and this is what I hear, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s73">And he had no money on the way back home, and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s75">I see.</span> <span id="s76">So she had grown up on an estate, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, but not for long, because the father died rather – th-they were very impoverished aft – very, very early in everybody’s life, really –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: – because of the first World War, and then what – the aftermath of the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: What did your parents tell you about their own childhoods and growing up?</span> <span id="s81">Did they tell you stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: No?</span> <span id="s84">Neither mother nor father.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Neither mother nor father.</span> <span id="s86">Probably there was no time for it, because the second World War started, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So you were an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I was the only child, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: You’re the only child.</span> <span id="s92">What about your father’s service during World War I?</span> <span id="s93">Did you know much about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, th-this is a rather complex story, because since they were living under the German occupation, in a way it was – during the partition of Poland, they were born in 19 hun – 1899 and 1902.</span> <span id="s95">My father had to serve in the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: The Prussian army then.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s98">And he was sent to fight the f – in France, and he was wounded in France.</span> <span id="s99">By the way, when he went to Poland, he stole from everybody th – any photographs of when he was young, so I have – I don’t know some people that are in these photographs.</span> <span id="s100">But anyway, so he served in the German army, and then he served – he – not served, but then the – in the western Poland, in Poznań, around Poznań, his brother and he were involved in the uprising against the Germans, or the Pr-Prussia.</span> <span id="s101">And so he fought in that, and then of course, after the Po-Poland became free, he was – he m – went to – I won’t say it’s equivalent to West Point, but it was a little bit less than that.</span> <span id="s102">I – I – I would say a military junior college, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s103">But he then finished that, and became a professional officer in the Polish army, and then when the Bolsheviks attacked Poland, after the 1917 revolution, he wen – he went to fight the Bolsheviks, and he was wounded again.</span> <span id="s104">But these wounds were not exactly critical, and so – so then, he continued really to advance to the – the ra-rank of cap-captain, and of course then there was – transferred – as I say, I think I was about two, to eas – eastern – southeastern Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What were – what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Stanisław.</span> <span id="s107">Stanley.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay, and your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Valentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Granowska(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Granowska(ph), okay.</span> <span id="s113">What place in eastern Poland were you – was he transferred to?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: He first was transferred to a town called Czarków.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: And I don’t remember much from there, except that we lived – I remember little pieces.</span> <span id="s117">We lived in a quarters for officers, and it really surprised me not long ago, because there was a childless couple there, he was colonel.</span> <span id="s118">Colonel Pułkanikchok(ph) Czepor-Czeporowski(ph).</span> <span id="s119">And Pułkawnik(ph) chek – Czeporowski(ph) really liked me very much, and I – I am not sure how it was, but in the morning I would go – and he was a big man, and I sort of recall jumping on his stomach.</span> <span id="s120">But, I looked him up on the – in Wikipedia, he was finished in Katyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Oh, he – he was murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah, murdered in Katyn.</span> <span id="s123">And there is not much of information on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So – okay, so you remember that –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I remember the name, yeah, and I remember that – you know.</span> <span id="s126">And also remember, since it was within the kor – or any military ki – compound, that I very – and my father had a – I think it’s called a soldier that was ordynan soldiers?</span> <span id="s127">I’m not sure how to – he was – he really was like an assistant to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: And he w – he ca – he was from Silesia [indecipherable] and he – I remember that when he was – once, at Easter, I imagine, to Silesia, to his family, he brought great, great sort of cakes, he made into bunnies, you know.</span> <span id="s130">Because the pa – family was apparently in ba-baking, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So, in other words, he would bring those back for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, he brought them back for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Well, children know what’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Bunny cakes are important.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And so, did you – you said your father at first was transferred to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Czarków.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Czarków.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And – and how long did you – do you have memories of Czarków then?</span> <span id="s142">[indecipherable] memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Well that’s [indecipherable] yes, that’s very sketchy, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And then where was he transferred to?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: And then from Czarków, he was transferred to Zaleszczyki, which is a town – now it’s called Zalishchyky because it’s Ukraine.</span> <span id="s146">But the name is almost similar, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: – the one that existed.</span> <span id="s149">Th-This was a – really a resort town at one time, because it was southeastern Poland on the border between Romania and Poland, and there were beaches there, you know, along that Dniester river.</span> <span id="s150">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Uh-huh, along the Dniester.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s153">So he – he – I don’t know the years in which he was transferred.</span> <span id="s154">I think he probably has it written somewhere because he – when we came to this country, as I say, he started collecting information and photographs when he went to Poland.</span> <span id="s155">But anyway, so that was maybe – maybe a – when I was four.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: When we were transferred to – when he was transferred to Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Was this par – Zaleszczyki.</span> <span id="s159">Zaleszczyki?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s162">And was this part – was this in the mountains as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, the Zaleszczyki were really on the river Dniest, on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s164">On the other side of the Dniest was Romania, and mountains of Romania were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: This was like a plateau where we were, not – not mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s168">Not mountains.</span> <span id="s169">Was it a pretty place?</span> <span id="s170">From what you –</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Very beautiful, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s172">And very unusual, because, as I say, it was a southeastern part of Poland where even grapes that they had – grapes grew, peaches, apricots, and so on.</span> <span id="s173">Which is unusual because Poland is a rather –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Northern.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: – otherwise northern country, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Ca – climate, northern climate.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What kind of place did you live in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: We lived in a – the way I remember, a two story house.</span> <span id="s180">So it – the first a – we lived on the main floor, we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s181">And this – on the second floor, somebody else lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Was this army – army residences?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No, it was not any more army residence, it was just on – an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And your parents rented it from somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, there were – that part of Poland has a – a really – a large – at thats time was called a minority, but a large population of Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s186">And this was a Ukrainian lady who built this house, but she herself lived in a – a really very poor little kind of a – a home, and so we – we rented it, or my parents rented it from her, and she very often then would take me to – to a Russian Orthodox church, especially at Easter, I remember that again, because there were birds in cages, and it was an elaborate production, with flowers and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Did you – was it – did you like going there, was it exotic?</span> <span id="s188">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Oh yes, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s190">Was very – yes.</span> <span id="s191">She was very nice, but as I – we – we just paid rent, and we lived – this was a very nice apartment, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you have electricity?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Oh yes, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s194">This was a modern apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Okay, so you had running water –</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: [indecipherable] running water, toi – yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s198">About how large was the – was the resort town?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Oh, that, I do not know.</span> <span id="s200">I really don’t know, and don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: But it was large enough to have a – oh, it has also a – a – quite a – a large Jewish population –</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: I wanted to ask about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: – it was like a [indecipherable] eastern.</span> <span id="s205">So that I – I really don’t know what the population of the town would be, but it had a beautiful Russian Orthodox church, there was a Catholic church, as I remember.</span> <span id="s206">And there were – there was a synagogue or two, and there were restaurants, bookstores, because I very – my pa – my mother would take me to book stores, and I loved that, because it’s got nice pictures in the books.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Of course, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s208">.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Color pictures.</span> <span id="s210">I did not read yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Well, you know, that’s what books should have, is more pictures and less words –</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: – when you’re a child.</span> <span id="s214">When you’re a child, and that’s what’s interesting to look at, yeah.</span> <span id="s215">And the house itself, did it have an orchard, or did it have a backyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, you know, because this was really, when I look back, a rather sad – as I say, she looked – lived in almost nothing, and there was this nice house, and in the back there was an orchard, and there were apricots growing there.</span> <span id="s217">Especially apricots and you could just go and pick them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Oh, how lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And in front there was a road, and – but it was all – the way I recall it, it was not – there were not many houses around us.</span> <span id="s220">Going down towards the river, more and more houses were built like – were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So maybe you were on the outskirts of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah – well, not outskirts, but I would say outskirts of the area where perhaps people preferred to live, because it was near to the river, and there was a beautiful sight of the mountains on the Romanian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s224">And do you remember whether – I mean, if your father had been stationed there, it must have been for a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s226">He wen – definitely.</span> <span id="s227">You know, that was the beginning of everything in Poland, because Poland lost – for a hundred years lost its independence and since it was partitioned, there were so many entirely different pa – even infrastructure systems in – in different – depending who was o-occupying that area.</span> <span id="s228">My father was – was there, and he was assigned to work with what would be equivalent again here, at one time there was something called ROTC, or something in high schools where they – they were preparing the – the young men for – for the service in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So, for a military career.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: He was like – like cadets.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Cadets, yes.</span> <span id="s233">But these were schools that were not primarily military schools, but he – he was involved in that, and fe – he was very much – he was a very athletic man.</span> <span id="s234">He was involved in physical education with them too, and so on, playing soccer.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So, he was involved with youth –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: – when he – when he was transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes, primarily, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s240">At home, did your mother keep house, or did she have help in – in keeping house?</span> <span id="s241">Tell me a little bit about what her daily life was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: My mother did not have to do an – almost anything.</span> <span id="s243">In the house we had a maid, and we also have someone that ad – that brought from the farms, milk, eggs and so on.</span> <span id="s244">And she did not have to clean the house.</span> <span id="s245">That – th – it was like a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s246">She was cleaning the house, and she was living with us, in a separate room.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Was she Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes, she was, yes.</span> <span id="s249">I – I have even a picture of her somewhere.</span> <span id="s250">My father stole it from someone in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: I’m sure they gave it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, no, he – I – you will see, the back of the pictures are torn out of albums, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Oh, good gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No, but anyway – so – no, so she – her work was primarily with what you would s – call here, soup ki – charity work.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: There were many poor people, especially the minorities were very poor.</span> <span id="s257">So she was involved with that.</span> <span id="s258">And – but we also – and of course Father had that – the soldier, which I – I don’t know what it’s called in English.</span> <span id="s259">You know, an assistant, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Tell me what it is in Polish.</span> <span id="s261">What was it called –</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Ordynans.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Ordynans.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So the soldiers rank was ordynans, or his duties were ordynans.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: His duties were ordynans.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s268">Maybe some way we find a translation of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s271">And – and so your mother was involved in a lot of charity work?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s274">Did – tell me a little bit about home life.</span> <span id="s275">Was it – what do you remember from –</span></p>

id="s280">A: – was beautiful.</span> <span id="s281">Was na –</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, it was too short, but very beautiful.</span> <span id="s284">You know, I – I – of – I had nice toys, and I had beautiful books, and Mother and I would go on the – in the horse-drawn carriage really, t-to stores to buy books, and I remember a few instances – and of course, there was this orchard in the back, and it was beautiful weather.</span> <span id="s285">The weather was – in summer is very beautiful in that part of Poland.</span> <span id="s286">We would go to the river, to the little beach – at that point in the beach was nothing like it is now, what I see.</span> <span id="s287">But I also remember at one time on the beach there was a huge commotion because a black man came.</span> <span id="s288">And they – nobody in Poland yet saw any black people.</span> <span id="s289">But I will tell you that I already had a black doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">So, you know, we cou – I – I don’t know how I got it, but anyway, my favorite doll was something which was like not really a doll, but something you put on a bed.</span> <span id="s293">It had long legs and so on.</span> <span id="s294">So I liked that, and of course later on, I – I received a dog, a little pinscher dog, sort –</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: A Doberman pinscher?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Doberman pinscher.</span> <span id="s297">A little guy.</span> <span id="s298">And of course, I – I was a rather nasty child, so of course I would – th-the dog knew how to walk on hind fi – legs, but I would try to put dresses on it, and so on.</span> <span id="s299">Terrible.</span> <span id="s300">But I also remember that the housekeeper – yeah, it’s all in bits and pieces, but the housekeeper, at one time, was preparing a cherry cordials or something.</span> <span id="s301">The – lots of cherries and she was boiling them.</span> <span id="s302">And of course, then she put – had to put vodka in it, or whatever, and I si – I loved those cherries, but they stopped me, because I mean, I almost – almost drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: But I remember that was very good.</span> <span id="s305">I also remember that I did something horrible.</span> <span id="s306">I went to my parents’ bedroom, and there was a very beautiful crocheted bedspread.</span> <span id="s307">I quietly took the scissors and cut it all up.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: You know, and of course to this day nobody knows why I did it, but I did it.</span> <span id="s310">But then, since they saw that I was – I did it – you probably – no, you wouldn’t know it – maybe your parents were – you know, over the sinks, where the faucet was, there was something hanging there that was nicely embroidered, but – so they took that piece and gave it to me and said here, you want to cut anything, cut that.</span> <span id="s311">I never touched it.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s313">Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s314">You must have been too small to understand what was going on, you know, what you –</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Well, let’s hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Oh dear, oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: So then I also – I remember going – I don’t know why it – that thing I remember, ah – going to a – that was like a bar, but not a bar.</span> <span id="s318">And then there, on the walls – my father and I went, and it was a big event because my father and I took me there for – he had a beer, I don’t know what I had, but on the walls there were figures from Disney, you know, there were Seven Dwarves, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Well, that’s quite a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You know, Mickey Mouse was born around those times.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s323">And I also, of course, remember I – th-they – my mother – of course, th-there were – we didn’t go to stores to buy coats, dresses and so on, but I always – I remember my – some of my dresses, because I liked them so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Does that mean that someone would – that your dresses were made –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: – for you, tailored for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yeah, oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s328">Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: She had somebody do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, I don’t remember the – the seamstress, but oh yes.</span> <span id="s331">Well, at that time you didn’t have ready-made anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: It sounds like a very nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Was very nice, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Tell me about your father, as far as his personality was concerned.</span> <span id="s337">Was he an outgoing person, or a more reserved person?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Oh, he – very outgoing, very talkative.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: But he didn’t tell you stories from his childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">I believe because they – he was alway – I don’t remember, you know, sitting down with him.</span> <span id="s345">I – I – you – I remember sitting on his knee, you know, on his knees, but I don’t remember what we talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Of course, of course, yeah.</span> <span id="s347">And your mother?</span> <span id="s348">What kind of a personality did she have?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: She wa – she was more reserved.</span> <span id="s350">Rather reserved.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Were you more scared of one than the other, or you weren’t scared of either of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Oh no, I – I – I’m telling you, I – I was a nasty child, I was not scared of – but yeah, I – I think I probably would be more s – would say that I – my mother was stricter with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: So, yeah.</span> <span id="s355">I was spanked several times, there’s no question.</span> <span id="s356">Especially after I – they didn’t spank me after I cutted that bedspread, I am not sure why, but I was spanked several times, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Were your parents religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s362">So, you didn’t go to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: We did go to church, but I – not regularly, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I once remember again being in church, and running to the front of it, that’s what I remember, and they, of course, had to pull me back.</span> <span id="s366">But that’s – no.</span> <span id="s367">But we were not – I – we were not very religious, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And did you start school?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s370">I started school in 1939.</span> <span id="s371">I went to school for two weeks before the war really was ending, and the Soviets entered Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So, you – you didn’t go to school until – you were born in 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And so you were seven years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s376">Six, seven, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s378">I see, so it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Because I was born in December, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Do you have any memories of the summer before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Oh yes, we had a beautiful summer.</span> <span id="s382">We went on a vacation to Ratzkibor(ph) which is now in Lithuania, it was near Vilno – Vilnius.</span> <span id="s383">And it was a – to this day I remember the beautiful forests, beautiful.</span> <span id="s384">And when the storm came, trees were knocked down.</span> <span id="s385">I remember being taken by my father, and he was showing it to me.</span> <span id="s386">We were – the reason we really went to – to Ratzkibor(ph) was because there was a camp for these young guys from high schools and so on, and my father was involved with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yeah, they called him Mussolini, because he – he always would – he had very nice hair, but he always would really shave his head, because he thought that was really healthier not to have it.</span> <span id="s389">Could we stop for one minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Of course we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: My nose is running.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Sure we can.</span> <span id="s393">I didn’t notice, I was so involved in your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s395">From one side [break] Just like who a – for the – and my father then was involved with these young people, but he would for the night would come to – with us, to be with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So maybe it was the camp name.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe Ratzkibor(ph) was the camp name.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah, but bor means a forest, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s400">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: So, I don’t think it was the name of the camp, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I – perhaps, but I doubt it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And – and so you really remember that, that summer –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Oh, very well, because there was this lake, and we – Father would take me and the other kids on the boats on – on the lake, and a – as I say, tha – thi – tha – thi – the smell of the woods, I can s-still smell it.</span> <span id="s408">On the way there, we stopped in Vilno – Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: And the – in Vi-Vilno there is a – a – a huge gate, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Over the gate there is a – a statue, or a – really a pain –</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: – a picture – painting of the Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: The Black Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: The Black Madonna, right, and at that – that – that is, as I recall – I recall seeing that.</span> <span id="s417">I also recall hearing that even Jews would stop and genuflect in front because it was such a revered painting of the Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Really, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Well, it – mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: And of – of course I remember th-the Lithuanian food, really, or pole – Polish-Lithuanian food, because we go back in Lithuanian and Poland for centuries, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: So, I remember obwarzanek, which is like bagels, but with a difference.</span> <span id="s424">They were on a piece of rope, and they were little, and rather hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: That’s true.</span> <span id="s426">They still make them that way.</span> <span id="s427">And that’s a lot – that’s a lot that stayed in your mind, in your memory for that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Oh that I remember, because that was ’39 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">Now, in ’39, you’re a child, you’re a little girl, so I don’t as – suspect that – that mu – much of the – of whatever discussions might have been, would have – would have reached you, but perhaps some did.</span> <span id="s431">Were the grown-ups talking about – about anything that had to do with politics, that you remem –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: My parents, since they were brought up in the west, knew Germany very well.</span> <span id="s435">To this day again, I remember my father putting on the radio, and listened to the insane, hysterical speeches by Hitler.</span> <span id="s436">And everybody was apprehensive, but when the day came when – a-after – it was already after the war started, and my father – and that – that’s a later story, but a – the last days really, of Polish resistance to the – to Germany.</span> <span id="s437">My mother, to – for a long time was saying that Father said, stay here, stay here.</span> <span id="s438">This will be a very short war, because the bri – Great Britain will be coming to help.</span> <span id="s439">Well.</span> <span id="s440">But yes, there was a lot of – I could feel that something horrible was coming, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s442">So your – it reached down to the children, it reached down to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Oh yeah, we – we knew that sa – something was going on, you know.</span> <span id="s444">And th – of course, when the war started, that’s another long story.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: We will talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So, this last summer, after – after this vacation, you returned to – I forget how to say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: You returned – the family returned to Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yes, but I – yeah, and I must say that it was a – again, th-the – it was August alre – mid-August, I think, and you know, war st – was start in sep – September one.</span> <span id="s453">There was – th-they cut the st – we cut the stay short, so it was also already pressure that something was coming.</span> <span id="s454">We knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Because it was August already, so Father and everybody – and th-the camp was closed very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s462">And you returned then to Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And did your father stay around, or did – was he called up for mobilization?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: He – he stayed around, because he was also not only taking care of the young, but he was involved in the border corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: What was the border corps?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: It was called cop(ph).</span> <span id="s470">And – but again, I – I am not sure that – there must have been some reason for transferring him from the west to the east.</span> <span id="s471">I don’t know if that move – I mean, I’m sa – excuse me, I – I’m just overthinking maybe, but I think the move was not smart, because my father and my family didn’t know anything about the Soviets, really, they were more anti-German than the – they didn’t know about what – what Poland endured in – on the eastern front, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Mm-hm, they were western Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Right, yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s474">So – but anyway, so he – no, he was not called.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: He was not called.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Th-The – September first came, and I re – that I remember too, it sort of sticks in my mind.</span> <span id="s477">I was at home with our housekeeper, and my mother apar – went for a hair – to have her hair done.</span> <span id="s478">And I saw her we – ma – the housekeeper, I think, already knew that some – he – she heard it on the radio that the – that the war maybe started, because she took me to the window, and we were all way – both of us are waiting for Mother to come, to sort of confirm it, or whatever.</span> <span id="s479">And yes, she came, and it – and again, it was sort of a – something horrible.</span> <span id="s480">Something is happening anyway, horrible or not, yeah, at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What was your housekeeper’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And your dog’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Sotka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Sotka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And another question, since you were so close to the Romanian border, you were separated just by the river Dniester?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you ever go on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Ah yes, I was very proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: A bridge was built across the Dniest from Poland to Romania, and there was a dedication of the bridge.</span> <span id="s493">And Father and I – I don’t know if Mother went with us – went across the bridge, you know, because this was an opening, and I-I guess he was one in – of the sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Dignitaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, maybe.</span> <span id="s496">So we went, and I was then, again, very proud of myself, because I brought home, in a bag, grapes.</span> <span id="s497">And it was smuggling them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s499">The grapes were from the Romanian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was there a similar town on the other side of the river?</span> <span id="s502">Or was it – or was there no settlement there?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, the – on the other side, a mountain is, really, mountains were.</span> <span id="s504">There were mountains.</span> <span id="s505">There were – was no beach or anything on the other side, very –</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: No town?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: There was a town, but I don’t remember the town at all.</span> <span id="s508">I just remember go over, and then coming back.</span> <span id="s509">And I guess my mother wasn’t there, because I brought these grapes to my mother, I was smuggling them.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Do you remember the color of the grapes?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Green.</span> <span id="s513">And so this was your one and only time in Romania?</span> <span id="s514">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s516">So the bridge must have been quite new.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Oh, brand new, there was the opening of the bridge.</span> <span id="s518">I don’t know what year it was, you know, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: And – and the bridge itself was – it – did – were motor vehicles able to cross it?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes, absolutely yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Pedestrians too?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Pedestrians, but – yes, because I – we – we walked across.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: And do you remember seeing any of the Romanian soldiers in their uniforms or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, no, n – I don’t remember that at all, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s528">All right.</span> <span id="s529">Okay, so September first happens –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: – and your mother comes back from the hairdresser, and it’s confirmed that there is this war –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: – that has started, and by Germany attacking Poland.</span> <span id="s534">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Well then, what starts is, first of all, there are – let me see what comes first?</span> <span id="s536">No – yeah, this is what comes first.</span> <span id="s537">So then, schools are closed, and my mother takes to schools, all blankets and pillows, and goes there to set up beds, because everybody is thinking that the wounded, and people, refugees would be coming from the west, which is true, they later come.</span> <span id="s538">So th-th-the – everybody was preparing for, really, the influx of –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: – people from the west, and – but then also – which was, you know, one night – and now I look, it was foolish, but there were trenches being built so – in case of bombs dropping, we would go into those trenches and hide.</span> <span id="s541">We went – when there were alarms, we used to even go under beds, you know, and into the orchards there.</span> <span id="s542">But it – when these trenches were being dug, I thought it was great, because they allowed me to do something too, so I was – felt very important, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: It was exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Absolutely exciting.</span> <span id="s545">And then – there were quite a few alarms that the bombs were, but only one bomb f-fell on Zaleszczyki, which is am –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yeah, because was way –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: In the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Southeast corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: But each time there would be an alarm, I would fuss, and insist that this dog is taken with us, you know, and sometimes wit – they – we were – w-we didn’t know whether the bombs were co – ba – the planes were coming to bomb us.</span> <span id="s552">So I can imagine they were very mad at me, because they would has – somebody would have to go back to get the dog, and then we’ll hide, you know, and – as a matter of fact, very often we hid in that hut where our landlady lived, under her bed, because it was lower, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So her hut was close to the house she had built?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes, yes, it was very unusual sit – set – set-up, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Well, I could understand if she had no income, then the house she built provided her with income.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Exactly, exactly, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Because I don’t think there was any th – she didn’t have any relatives there, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Was your father with you during these alarms, or was he first –</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, he was away.</span> <span id="s563">I don’t know what – you know, what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: But he was still in Zaleszczyki?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Zaleszczyki, he – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s567">All right, so there were alarms, there were trenches being built, the school was being prepared for refugees.</span> <span id="s568">What happened after that?</span> <span id="s569">A: After that, I remember also – that must have been already when the family from Warsaw came, as a refugees to our home, because I wa – I remember that the – the son in that family, who I don’t know, he was me – he was like a teenager maybe ni – maybe 18, and this – took me, with little flowers, and lifted me wa – up at one time, as the recruits were going to be put on – they had trains to go to fight the Germans in the west.</span> <span id="s570">So, you know, I was giving flowers to – to these soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s572">So, were you close to a train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yeah, there was a train station there.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I don’t know how close we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s577">It sounded like you were saying that –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: We probably went there and – knowing that they will be leaving, you know, everybody was saying goodbye, and you know, really trying to-to – to-to give them courage to go, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s580">So you remember that incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And – and so, why did the family from Warsaw come?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Well, they came because the – Warsaw by then was being bombed, life wa – bombed out, and they came to us because my father and the – the father of that family that was – the name was Zhaglietski(ph).</span> <span id="s584">He – my father and he served together in Czarków before that guy wa-was transferred to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: And there are some politics involved, but I won’t go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s588">Well, does that have something to do with your story, this – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: No.</span> <span id="s591">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And so they came, and they were now running from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: They were running from Warsaw, yeah.</span> <span id="s595">There were many refugees coming, even – of course, they knew us, so they stayed with us.</span> <span id="s596">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s598">Why would refugees be coming to your southeastern corner of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: They were – because, a-as the armies were retreating, they were retreating to the east –</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: – unaware of the fact that there is this non-aggression pact between Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s602">Everybody was waiting for help from the west.</span> <span id="s603">France gave up, and Great Britain didn’t come in strong enough and early enough to do anything, and the Polish army was being defeated, and as – si-since the Germans were coming from the west, and the Poles were fighting them, th-the soldiers and the officer, everybody was really ret-retreating to the east and, you know, standing for a while against the Germans, but then defeated again.</span> <span id="s604">And then on – Russians came in from the east, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did anybody cross over to Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes, very many people crossed to Romania, especially dignitaries from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s607">So they – my – my father, and the last days, this is what I remember, when he said to us, you stay here, you know, because it will be blitzkrieg, short war.</span> <span id="s608">And yes, he, with really an adjutant to the unfortunate leader of – military leader of Poland at that time, tha – he crossed, with his family, with my father, with the guy from ma – my father’s friends from Warsaw, while his family wer – the wife, their daughter and son, stayed with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: The military leader of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: The wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: The wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: – wife, daughter and son, of my father’s friend</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Zhaglietsi(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Zhaglietski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Zhaglietski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And you – but the military leader of Poland also traveled – went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Ah – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Ring – Rydz Śmigły.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s625">And his adjutant really, which we knew, was Mineke(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s627">And did you see these dignitaries crossing?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I saw cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: You saw cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: You know, black cars going fast, fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: I don’t remember, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did people think that they’re being abandoned?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Absolutely, you know, th-th-this was not the way to do it.</span> <span id="s635">Now, on the other hand, if they didn’t – even my father didn’t cross, and th-they were then interned in Pole – in rem – Romania, in camps, because Romania joined the Germans, as one of their – for – for a while there was a neutral country.</span> <span id="s636">Many people also crossed to Hungary, you know, but absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s637">On the other hand, they were in between Germany and Russia.</span> <span id="s638">If the ones that were caught by the Russians ended up in – in the slaughterhouses in Katyn, Starobielsk, you know, and so on, so it’s the 15,000 Polish officers and policemen were just shot in the back of the head, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: So at that time your father also left –</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: – with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Was your mother upset that he did?</span> <span id="s644">Were you upset that he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, everybody was saying well, the war is going to be short, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s646">The – the – ar – our – our allies will come and save – you know, help us.</span> <span id="s647">And as I say, nobody – that I know for sure, nobody thought that the Russians will just enter from the east, you know.</span> <span id="s648">There was no resistance to them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And so this must have been in those first two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes, that – that’s what I remember, that he – I was on the knee and he was saying stay here, the war will be – it will end soon, you know, goodbye.</span> <span id="s653">So I was assured, and I – throughout then – you know, I don’t – what we went through, I always was sure that my father will save me from everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s655">So your – your mind was put at rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh yes, I never – I don’t – I – I was never – maybe I was apprehensive when all this was going on, but I was never afraid, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And yet, on an individual level, no, but aw – yet, people felt abandoned, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: – imagine.</span> <span id="s660">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s662">Well, you know, maybe not at the time when all this was going on, because nobody had the time to think about it.</span> <span id="s663">But – but right now, you know, years later, after we escaped from really, Russia, everybody starts to talking about it, yes.</span> <span id="s664">But no – nobody considered Śmigły Rydz to be a good leader anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s666">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: You know, he – he – he succeeded Pilsudski, who was really revered, you know, h-his heart is buried in Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: That’s true, yeah.</span> <span id="s671">And so, hi – the successor, I can’t pronounce his name – how do you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Śmigły Rydz.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Śmigły Rydz.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Rydz.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Śmigły Rydz.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Śmigły Rydz, yeah, it’s [indecipherable] Rydz.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: He – why wasn’t he respected as much?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: He was not respected because I – I don’t believe he has known much about politics.</span> <span id="s679">There were many factions at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s680">I – y-you know sa – some people wanted s – si – thought that it would be better to sort of la – give concessions to the Germans, you know, because it supposedly all started about the corridor up there, which is f – a farce.</span> <span id="s681">Some said, well, you know, we are Slavs, maybe we should be looking to the east.</span> <span id="s682">So then – Poland was only free for how many years?</span> <span id="s683">Twenty-five years or so?</span> <span id="s684">And that – so there were – there was a lot going on in politics.</span> <span id="s685">Of course, I’m reading about it now, so I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So this is not your direct memory –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: – this is just what you’ve learned afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: – no, no, that’s not my – no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s691">And I try to distinguish that because –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: – in some ways, we have to know the context, and you can only explain the context from what you find out later.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: But at the same time, we need to know where is it I directly remember this, but I don’t, you know – and si – and you’ve been telling me very accurately.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And – and I appreciate that.</span> <span id="s698">You – you dig the trenches, cause they’re exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Because you’re a little girl, you’re seven years old, you know, that – that’s how children respond.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And – and so that was the last time you saw your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes, this is the last time I saw my father for 12 – 13 years, you know.</span> <span id="s704">So – so then, within weeks, really – I don’t know how long after – I don’t know even when – when they – this happened, but anyway, weeks later, sometime – by then it started raining, you know, and I remember, you know, statements to the effect, oh why didn’t it rain sooner?</span> <span id="s705">The times would be – would have been stopped, you know, the Germans would have been really buried in the mud.</span> <span id="s706">It was raining very hard, and it – I know now that it was September 17, but I didn’t know what –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Did you ever – did German tanks ever enter your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: We have not seen a single ger – as I say, only one bomb fell there.</span> <span id="s711">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s713">All right, so September 17 –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Seventeen, it – I remember being taken to the window, and it was pouring rain when the so – Russian soldiers were coming in.</span> <span id="s715">And they were – again, maybe I don’t remember it, maybe I heard it, but they were very poorly dressed.</span> <span id="s716">They bayon – their guns were, you know, on – on pieces of rope, and so on.</span> <span id="s717">And so I was taken to the window to just, apparently show – to – to see who was coming, and they were coming and coming.</span> <span id="s718">Very soon after, we – schools opened again, you know.</span> <span id="s719">Now Russians are in, and while I hated school when the school started under the Polish – you know, when I was still free.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh, I just thought it was terrific, because they took me, with a red flag, on a parade.</span> <span id="s722">I didn’t have to – to – what I recall on the Polish schools is the fact that I had to – to ra – not – not to write even letters, but to make little, you know – learn how to stay within the lines.</span> <span id="s723">I hated it.</span> <span id="s724">I also remember from the Polish school, and I’m not sure why, when the priest came in this long robe, and told us a story, and I thought it was horrific – I-I guess he, I don’t know in connection with what, that there was this stork eating frogs, you know.</span> <span id="s725">I don’t know why I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: There was a story and it had storks, and it had frogs, and you weren’t very impressed by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No.</span> <span id="s728">But, when – when the Russians took me on a parade, and told me to wave a red flag, you know, and do nothing really, in school –</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: That was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: That was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Were there still refugees who had wanted to go to Romania when the Russians arrived, do you think?</span> <span id="s734">A: Well, there were a – yes, as many wounded soldiers, many wounded officers, many pe – refugees continued to – to really a – during the nights and so on, bribe, or have guides take them over the Dniest to Romania and Hungary.</span> <span id="s735">Yes, many pe – many – really civilians also escaped that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Even when the Russians were already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Because when the Russians came in, I mean, I think they were rather disorganized at first, that – that – but it was very – it was dangerous to cross the pa – to go across the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s741">So at one point it wa – you know, when peop – before they came, there was uncertainty when people crossed, in that on the Romanian side, they were interned in camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: – but there wasn’t any danger from the Polish side, of letting people go.</span> <span id="s744">But when the Russians came, there was – it was dangerous then.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well, sure.</span> <span id="s748">Because that was the border, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: So what else – what else happens?</span> <span id="s752">School opened, you had red flags, you went on parades.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah, and very soon after, the – there would be – there would be people who knew my father.</span> <span id="s754">And I hate to say it, but it was a young Jewish fellow – I – I don’t know the fellow, but I know that there were people that work in the city government, and they tried to s – to probably save their own skins, too.</span> <span id="s755">So this young guy, one night, I remember him, how he looked, came with a group of what’s ek – now KGB, or was KGB, NKVD [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: NKVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: NKVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Soldiers, they would – they surrounded the house outside with these huge guns, and they always would come, as I recall, we would be sleeping, and around – soundly, and there would be pounding on the door, and they would come in, surround the house, go in, stand inside.</span> <span id="s760">They would line us around at the walls, and they would start saying, where is my father, and he – he’s going to be hanging, or you know, we cut his throat, and so on.</span> <span id="s761">And my mother did not know Russian.</span> <span id="s762">She knew German quite well, but not Russian, and had one time – this – this – this was funny.</span> <span id="s763">I, of course, don’t remember that, but I heard it now several times.</span> <span id="s764">I mean, before, several times.</span> <span id="s765">They came, and they would open everything and steal, because they would – they had let all the criminals out of the prisons, saying that they were really suppressed by the [indecipherable] capitalists of Poland, right?</span> <span id="s766">So they were free now.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So the – excuse me, I’m going to interrupt right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: You – you’re talking about the first time, and then several subsequent times?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: So was it the same people each time?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, I don’t – no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: But the first time [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: The first time the guy – the young guy brought them in and – but he then disappeared from the scene.</span> <span id="s775">He was never seen before – later.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And did you know him from earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Not – not I, but my mother recognized him as a clerk from the city hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: I see, so she could recognize who he was, the rest of the people were strangers, the rest of –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh [indecipherable] the Russians, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Okay, so, now here I have another discrepancy in here.</span> <span id="s781">Was it Russian soldiers who came to the house, or these released thieves from the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: All right, Russian soldiers would do the stealing?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s787">They – and they would open everything, and you know, ward – it’s called wardrobe, I think –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yeah, a wardrobe –</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: – inste – because not – not a closet, and Mother had dresses there, and then, you know, we were not exactly rich, but I – since Mother didn’t know – this is the story, Mother didn’t know Russian, when they said to the wi(ph) portnikha, my mother thought that portnikha means you belong to some party, and my mother was trying to – Mother said no, no, I don’t belong to any party.</span> <span id="s790">And portnikha means really seamstress, a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: So they thought that she was a seamstress?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s793">So that –</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Because they would look at the dresses and see that they were sewn?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah, right, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s797">Did they take those clothes?</span> <span id="s798">Or did they leave them?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I don’t remember that, you know, I only know that slowly things were disappearing.</span> <span id="s800">That I know.</span> <span id="s801">From the house.</span> <span id="s802">And there was food that also disappeared, and at first we didn’t know what was happening to it, you know, the fruit preserves and jams and so on?</span> <span id="s803">And one time I went to this – the orchard in the back, and it was our housekeeper that was doing it.</span> <span id="s804">She would slowly take the food and hide – hide it behind – I don’t know, that wa – that was where some shelves were, we found them.</span> <span id="s805">I found them, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So in – so i – I mean one could feel like you’re being betrayed by all sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s808">Well, let’s face it, there were – were some really – Ukrainians didn’t like the Poles there.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Well, how was your landlady, how did she behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Landlady disappeared.</span> <span id="s811">I don’t remember landlady was doing anything, really.</span> <span id="s812">I don’t remember what – what happened to her – to her, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s814">But y – your housekeeper was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And she was stealing the stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: You – ah, you never know –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: – what happens with people, you know, in – under circumstances, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s822">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: How di – how was your mother taking all of this?</span> <span id="s824">Did her manner change, did her mood change?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: My mother was, by then, really very tense and – and on – nervous, you know.</span> <span id="s826">I mean, was physically you could see that th – she was changing, yes.</span> <span id="s827">And she was als – always a sm – she always smoked, which was not good either.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s829">So she was smoking more?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Smoking more, bu – and also very tense, as I recall, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Very tense.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So they came not just one time, they came several times?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Several times, almost one night after another, and supposedly looking for my father, but it was – I don’t – wa – it was extremely difficult for any human being that is thinking or reasonable, to see the reasons why things were happening, they were – and why we were even taken to Russia, right?</span> <span id="s835">Why?</span> <span id="s836">What – how did we contribute to economy of Russia?</span> <span id="s837">Nobody – right?</span> <span id="s838">No ha – right, correct?</span> <span id="s839">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: All – all right, so the – this first time they came, do you remember whether it was still the fall, or already winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Fall.</span> <span id="s842">Late fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Late fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s845">November, I think.</span> <span id="s846">Again, it wa – it was rainy season, so that was not yet – you know, winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: No snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: No snow, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: What was Christmas like that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I don’t even remember Christmas, because by Christmas we were already – they came and they told us to get out, and we went on these horse-drawn carts to another town, a si – a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Oh, so in other words –</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: They threw us out of the house, and didn’t let us take anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: But in the meantime – excuse me, I – I just want to make a point.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: That all this I – also was done because supposedly when the Russians entered, they asked – they wanted to register everybody, and asked people whether it’s – they were from – originally from west or east.</span> <span id="s859">And of course by then, when we saw Russians, my mother, of course, went and registered that she’s from the west.</span> <span id="s860">And everybody thought that if – and that’s what they – the Russians assured us that if you were from the west, you would go back to say, you know [indecipherable] in Poznań, where my mother’s family was.</span> <span id="s861">But this was a trick.</span> <span id="s862">It’s just to get everybody on the list, to know who is who, where and how.</span> <span id="s863">And then that – those lists were used to deport us to Russia.</span> <span id="s864">Q: Okay, but when you were first taken from your home –</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: – that was in November or December?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: It was getting already cold.</span> <span id="s868">I would say maybe beginning of December.</span> <span id="s869">I – I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: What is that – do you remember the – the night itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s872">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: – again – again, they came, they pounded on the door, surrounded the house, get up, get up.</span> <span id="s875">And you know, I grabbed, of course, the dog, and we were put on – on these carts driven by horses, with again soldiers surrounding it.</span> <span id="s876">And we didn’t know where they would drive us, but they drove us to a small village called Tłuszcz –</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Tłuszcz.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: – which means fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: But – and they put us in one room.</span> <span id="s881">There were the pe – the family of Zhaglietski(ph) there, th-the ones that escaped Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: – except –</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: The husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: – the husband, and we, and we didn’t know what was going to happen then.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: But hang on a second.</span> <span id="s887">Were the Zhaglietskis(ph) still living with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Oh yes, that – this is the reason why they por – por – were deported to Russia with us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So they were still there with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And you said you weren’t able to take anything.</span> <span id="s894">No food, no clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yeah, no food and no clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And no dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Dog, yes.</span> <span id="s898">I made sure that the dog went with us.</span> <span id="s899">And I had a – a small, like a suitcase, you know, and I took that, because I still have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: You still have the suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s902">It’s little.</span> <span id="s903">And it was, as a matter of fact, purchased way back in Vienna, when we went, you know, for – on a last vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s905">Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s906">So – so, from your home – did you at least dress like wintertime, or were you put in –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yeah, we sa – we had a co – yeah, I remember having a coat on, yeah.</span> <span id="s908">Like wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: And so, with the appropriate shoes, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes, still appropriate everything –</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: – yes, for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: So not like in nightgowns out on the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No, absolutely not, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: We were still dressed – we – we did not suffer from cold, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: But no valuables, no jewelry or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: No, everything was left – I mean now, everything you had, you know, what – what you had.</span> <span id="s921">Dishes, everything was left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: And so then you –</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Pictures on the walls, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s924">Oh, by the way, pictures on the walls, and silver – I remember this one time, even prior we – th – prior to when the Russians came, there was somebody, and I somehow recall this was a teacher who lived down the street.</span> <span id="s925">And one night the raincoats were put down on the floor, and one – because we didn’t have many valuable, but one valuable painting, and then silver was wrapped in different raincoats, and the guy took it, and buried it in his backyard.</span> <span id="s926">But I’m sure it’s not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So it was supposed to be for safekeeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I imagine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s934">So you’re taken to this village that means fat?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: And you’re put in one room, together with the Zhaglietskis(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Which, it meant your mother, yourself, Mrs. Zhaglietski(ph), her teenage son.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: And teenage dot – daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And teenage daughter.</span> <span id="s941">So five of you –</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: – in this one room.</span> <span id="s944">What did that room look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Well, it was still heaven compared to – to – to what we had in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: But you didn’t know that yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: So what did that room look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Like any room.</span> <span id="s952">It still had electricity even, I think, as I recall.</span> <span id="s953">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So was it a small house, a small hut, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: It was on the second floor, so it must have been some two story house.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t know who lived on the bottom floor.</span> <span id="s957">But it was very cold all the time, and we were hungry all the time, because by then there was nothing, and the winter set in.</span> <span id="s958">I do not remember – you ask me about Christmas – I don’t even – I don’t remember, I – there was no Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s960">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: There was no Christmas.</span> <span id="s962">A – I – the – my – my father, who was, as I mentioned, he was outgoing, and he was a very fair man, and he – you – minority, so-called minorities really, were very much favorably inclined towards him, although sometimes military men were not exactly viewed favorably.</span> <span id="s963">So, there was another house where a – a Ukrainian family lived, in Tłuszcz.</span> <span id="s964">And I also remember that they were very nice to us, and th-that they warned my mother that we will be deported, you know.</span> <span id="s965">But what can you do by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s967">Was there any word from your father, as to where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: None.</span> <span id="s969">None.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: So you had no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s972">Well, I – the feeling all – always was, you know, he just wants to – to stay and live, and you don’t know what the next day will bring.</span> <span id="s973">I – you sort of – you develop that kind of a sense, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So how was your mother, was she s – was she increasingly still more nervous and more tense, by the time you were in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Not maybe increasingly, but it was the same, just sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: As before.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: – nervous, yeah.</span> <span id="s978">Nervous feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And how did the – the Zhaglietskis(ph) – how were th – how were they behaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Well, these two young people already, were fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph), whom I called aunt because, as I say, we first met in Czarków, you know, so I – I like her very much, and she was a very – she – she was a very – she had the great sense of humor, so even in horrible situations, she would come up with some silly joke, or whatever.</span> <span id="s985">But a – so y-yo – she – she really kept us in good spirits.</span> <span id="s986">In a way it was – I don’t know if Mother and I would have survived without that family.</span> <span id="s987">I mean it, because my mother became pr – wa-was not well at all, physically, and otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Tough, very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: So, how long did you stay in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Okay, then we spent the winter there, until April, but April was still very cold, April – so no – we were fore – forewarned that we’ll be deported, by the Ukrainians next door, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: I’m going to interrupt.</span> <span id="s993">Was this a large village, or a small village?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Very small.</span> <span id="s995">A hole in the ground, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: And very far from your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: That I am not sure, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1000">I don’t even remember how long it took us to get there from Zaleszczyki, I really don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: That’s close enough that the Ukrainians – neighbors knew your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Knew – correct, yeah.</span> <span id="s1003">Because it was a – yeah, it was a – yes, very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: You know that everything was sort of sparsely populated at that time, it’s not so – yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1009">So they’ve given you a warning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And you know it’s going to happen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: – you just don’t know when.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1015">And you are a – you didn’t know when.</span> <span id="s1016">So we would go to sleep, but we didn’t know whether anybody would be coming or not.</span> <span id="s1017">So on night, [indecipherable] was pounding on the door.</span> <span id="s1018">Very, very cold night, that I remember.</span> <span id="s1019">Extremely cold, snowing and so on.</span> <span id="s1020">And the – the Russian soldiers came in, and told us [speaks Russian] again, you know, get out, get out.</span> <span id="s1021">So ya – you are sleeping soundly, and then you are ar-ar-aroused from sleep, it’s – it’s a – everybody was sort of in a daze, and I remember that pi – Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph), who as I say, had a sense of humor and so on, when – she was very emotional, too.</span> <span id="s1022">So she started throwing things at the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1023">I remember that, you know.</span> <span id="s1024">So we – we just put whatever we had on ourselves – and of course I had my suitcase, you know.</span> <span id="s1025">But the dog, I-I was saying well, the dog has to come with us.</span> <span id="s1026">But somehow, that – that Ukrainian ca – ne – next door, they’ll take – they said they’ll take care of the dog.</span> <span id="s1027">So they took the d – Sotka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: The dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And I also remember – so then they packed us onto these sleighs, horse-drawn, extremely cold.</span> <span id="s1030">And this one Russian sol – I remember that, he took his coat, or whatever he had on top of his coat, and put it on me, you know, bi – tha – tha-that time I think I – as I recall, I really felt scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1032">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1033">Did you cry, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No, I didn’t cry, but I felt it.</span> <span id="s1035">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: You felt the fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: I think if I cry, that it would freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: So, by – it took hours to get to the station, and I don’t know what the station was, what the name of the town was.</span> <span id="s1042">But by then it was light, and there were people standing and some of them with bread, and whatever, to give to us.</span> <span id="s1043">So then they packed us in – into the cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s1044">And I don’t know how to, again, cause there were – on both sides of the cattle wagon there were these platforms, I think two of them.</span> <span id="s1045">And we landed on the uppermost one, and I don’t know how long it took them, but it probably took them a long – th-the – a whole day.</span> <span id="s1046">And then they shut the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Were you able to ta – get any food from those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s1049">We did get some food from the people, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: So you weren’t completely – you had at least something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Absolutely, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1052">And – but it was great that these people wanted to do it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: How many people do you think were in your wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1057">Many.</span> <span id="s1058">I would say maybe a hundred or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: But I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s1061">On every platform, 25 or so on every platform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Oh yeah, packed together, you know.</span> <span id="s1064">But that was good, because then ke-kept us warm, you know.</span> <span id="s1065">No, I mean, I’m – I’m joking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: So you were laying down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: So was – I remember sitting in the corner, they put me in the corner on the upper shelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: And I was – my – my mother and Auntie Zhaglietska(ph) and her two kids.</span> <span id="s1070">And there are – then, on the other side, I know there was somebody that was very sick, old, because he was right – right away lying down.</span> <span id="s1071">And there was a little baby, I know, but I don’t remember much, you know, of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: You didn’t know any of the other people on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: No, no, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: So the – so then the journey started, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Was – were people standing as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No.</span> <span id="s1078">Nobody was standing.</span> <span id="s1079">Everybody was on – on these platforms, nobody was standing, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1081">Was there any kind of heating in the place, in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: I think there was in the – in the middle, in between, something, but I – I frankly don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1083">I only remember a hole in – in – in the middle, where one had to relieve oneself.</span> <span id="s1084">I don’t remember a little sto – but there must have been something, because it – we would have frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1086">I have a very sort of unhygienic question, but I want to understand things.</span> <span id="s1087">Was that hole covered, or was it open?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: No, it was open.</span> <span id="s1089">No, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: It was open –</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: – that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So, not only was it there for everybody to relieve themselves, but cold air could come in through that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1095">So the stove wouldn’t help much, if it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No, no, the stove – but I – I – I am – I somehow think there was a stove, but I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: That hole I remember well.</span> <span id="s1099">You know, later on, people would say oh, another – the transport already came by.</span> <span id="s1100">Because if you looked through – you know, you – there were no windows, but if you looked, behind the train there was a – a really excrements all over the tracks.</span> <span id="s1101">And I – I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Ew.</span> <span id="s1103">But you could see it, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh yes, you could see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: You saw it through the hole?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: No, I saw it – I – it – it’s in the – the wall of the train, there were, you know, a – slits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Sl – ah, slats, or s – slit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Slit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Slits, you could see that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: They somehow even told me to look.</span> <span id="s1111">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: So, for about – for – for three we – 21 days we were inside the-these – these wagons, and the train would go very slowly, stop whenever they wanted, I think.</span> <span id="s1114">And the only food that we got from – from the soldiers that were all around, and they were, I think in – in the front, in the back of the train, very, very salty dried, or frozen fish.</span> <span id="s1115">And the water you had to – to get by going to the front of the lock – of the train, to where the locomotive was, because these were steam engines, I imagine.</span> <span id="s1116">You got kipyatok, hot water from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Is kipyatok a Russian word?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Kipyatok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Hot water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: I want to ask a couple of things.</span> <span id="s1122">Do you remember how many wagons made up this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Oh, I do not know, but it was long.</span> <span id="s1124">I don’t know, I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: So what would they do, they would open the doors and allow people to go to the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: One – one or two would go, they wou – they would have to rush for the water wi-with a pail – I don’t know that we had, or they gave us a pail – and would bring it in.</span> <span id="s1127">But if somebody decided to stay in the train, they will be left there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: On the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: – in the middle of nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Yes, several times.</span> <span id="s1132">You know, not in my – not in our –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: – wagon, but it happened.</span> <span id="s1135">But anyway, so they would bring the water, and you – th-the fish you couldn’t almost eat, whether you were hungry anything.</span> <span id="s1136">And that was our – for days, that’s what it was, for about what?</span> <span id="s1137">Twenty-one days was – was no food [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: So it was one pail of water for a hundred people on the – on the wagon, or however many there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Well yeah, you didn’t – this was hot water, it was cold, so nobody – I – we were not – I don’t remember drinking much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: But did everybody get some?</span> <span id="s1141">Could one pail sa – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s1143">I – I don’t remember that, you know, I can’t rem –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: – you know.</span> <span id="s1146">One sort of becomes occupied with what is there, oneself, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1148">So they would go to the front, and I – I – I also need to understand, but maybe you can’t explain this to me, it was hot water from the locomotive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: But, I would think that water wouldn’t be particularly clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1152">It was hot – th-tha-that – it probably wasn’t, but I – I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1154">That could be also a technical question.</span> <span id="s1155">Because maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: That’s – that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: – maybe there is a way –</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: – th-that – because if it really wasn’t clean, then a lot of people would have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Oh yes, from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Yes, from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: From that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1165">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Well, did anybody die on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Oh, the only –</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: In your wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yeah, the only thing I remember is – is the – a baby that died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: And somehow that it was thrown out, you know, the – because the train didn’t – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Were there men on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: So there were some places where there were families with men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Correct, yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: It wasn’t just women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: And do you remember crossing the border from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Oh yes, that was very emotional, because apparently someone knew that we were cr – leaving Poland, and they started singing, and it was like a wave of singing, you know.</span> <span id="s1182">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Did you stop at tracks to change the rails, or no stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: No.</span> <span id="s1185">But you are absolutely right, I think there is a different in rails, but I don’t remember stopping, or changing rails, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: What were people saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Well, they were all crying, and very sad, you know.</span> <span id="s1188">Very, very sad, I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Was there a particular –</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: – they were almost not talking, just singing this – we ask you God, to – to protect us, some like – all that – it was not a Polish anthem.</span> <span id="s1191">I know that some of my friends that were deported say that they were – people were singing the Polish anthem.</span> <span id="s1192">I don’t remember – I remember this religious song, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Do you remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Could you si –</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, don’t ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Really, please.</span> <span id="s1199">Because I’ll become emotional.</span> <span id="s1200">I really do.</span> <span id="s1201">To this day.</span> <span id="s1202">It’s crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: You sure you don’t want to share that with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: So that people would hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: This is crazy on my part [sings in Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1208">Thank –</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: No, I – I – I – I appreciate that even though there is a cost, that you were willing to do that.</span> <span id="s1211">I want to have peop – for people to have a sense of – of what – what was going on in the hearts of those who were being taken over – taken across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Did you see other things through the slats in the windows i-in the car, you know, the sla – the little slits?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1215">No.</span> <span id="s1216">No, I d – I don’t even remember looking much, except as – as we – I am – I – I confirmed it with the Zhaglietska(ph) – Marisha(ph), the – the daughter.</span> <span id="s1217">I said to her, am I hallucinating, or – I believe when we were crossing the Ural mountains from – from European Russia to the Asian Russia, we stopped; because I remember we stopped, and they opened the doors.</span> <span id="s1218">And there was a beautiful field of flowers; yellow, I – I – by then it was spring.</span> <span id="s1219">Yellow, beautiful flowers.</span> <span id="s1220">And she confirmed, she said yes, it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Oh, that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: So your memory was not playing tricks on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1227">To this day I remember it.</span> <span id="s1228">Maybe also being cooped up so long, everything looked more beautiful when – when you are in the open, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: So – so that – were you allowed to go out of the train at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes, yeah, I remember being on the ground, yeah.</span> <span id="s1231">It – again, we were probably in the middle of nowhere, but yes, we were allowed to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1233">What was your final destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: We didn’t know, and they would just put us here and tha-that is a – sometimes the train would stop, towards the end of the journey, and some wagons were detached, and we didn’t – we – we didn’t know, you know, who – whose wagon will be detached.</span> <span id="s1235">And then from those wagons, the people would be taken somewhere.</span> <span id="s1236">And when one point, after about 21 days, the wagons stopped, and it was – wa – we [indecipherable] Kazakhstan, you know, and they let us out, and they – they – thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: And this is how, in the middle, it was steps, open steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Fields, st –</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Tell me what did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: S-t-e-p-p-e, steppe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Tell – ex – describe to somebody who’s never been and never will be on a steppe, what does a steppe look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: It’s like an open, flat prairie, going f-forever.</span> <span id="s1245">Flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Does it look just like a prairie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Oh, well, it all depends on the time of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: But i-in the s – in the summer when we were there, the whole steppe, just like the prairie, bloomed beautifully, gr-grass was growing.</span> <span id="s1250">But I would say it’s very similar to a prairie, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1252">Did you have any documents with you?</span> <span id="s1253">Like I.D.s or passports, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: No, I do – no, nothing.</span> <span id="s1255">No, nothing.</span> <span id="s1256">We had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: You just had your little s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: There was no I.D., nothing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: So you just had your little suitcase from Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Yes, mm-hm, and I – whatever I put there.</span> <span id="s1261">And I had, apparently, a few of the photographs, because later on I started drawing something on the back, since there was no paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1263">So – so people were let out, towards the end of the journey, in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1265">They – and they were then taken to collective farms, different collective farms.</span> <span id="s1266">But before – I – I – I would like to say something else too.</span> <span id="s1267">As we crossed the Ural mountains, and then I know we were in a – well, really – Siberia really is – is just an imaginary kind of a – a place.</span> <span id="s1268">But where Siberia sort of borders Kazakhstan, we crossed to Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s1269">The tow-town was called Nowosibirsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Nowosibirsk, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Si – very big town.</span> <span id="s1272">We were taken to be deloused, because the Russian thought that Poles are really a-absolutely uncivilized, because they don’t have delousing stations.</span> <span id="s1273">So we were – we were taken t-to – for a ba – for a shower, or whatever it was, but it – to clean ourselves, and to be deloused.</span> <span id="s1274">And in order to be deloused, everything was taken from us and put into, I don’t know, hot ovens, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1275">So that no matter where – you had to give everything up, so whoever had anything made out of leather became nothing, because it was shrunken, you know, almost burned.</span> <span id="s1276">I remember gloves like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Leather gloves, and then they come back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yes, leather gloves, nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s1281">So then – so, after delousing and a bath, we then proceeded to – to where – oh, the – our wagons were left behind, and the rest went elsewhere, I am sure, you know, to other collective farms, and we were put on a carts driven then, because that’s Kazakhstan, oxen.</span> <span id="s1282">And very slowly we got to this collective farm.</span> <span id="s1283">The – the village was called Peschanka, and the farm was a sovkhoz which was even higher than a collective farm, it was Soviet collective farm, and it was a – a – of the name of Lenin, you know, Lenin’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: So it was Lenin’s sovkhoz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Sovkhoz, that’s right, s – Lenin’s sovkhoz.</span> <span id="s1286">So, this was a pig farm.</span> <span id="s1287">So, w-when we arrived there, there were already some deportees from Russia itself.</span> <span id="s1288">When Stalin took over, there were ex-Russian Orthodox priests, and intellectual – some intellectuals – I don’t know, of course, who was who.</span> <span id="s1289">But th – I remember they were standing, and as we got off, they were sort of – their heads were – shaking their heads, saying that we – we will get used to it.</span> <span id="s1290">Neechyebol (ph) privyknesh’, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Neechyebol(ph) privyknesh’.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1293">That’s the attitude, I think to this day.</span> <span id="s1294">Now they have neechyebol(ph) privyknesh’ for Putin.</span> <span id="s1295">But anyway – so, this is how is – our life started on this collective farm, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Okay, let’s cut for a second.</span> <span id="s1297">[break] Okay, before the break, we were talking about the journey to Siberia: that it took 21 days, and that by the time you arrived, it was already spring.</span> <span id="s1298">And that your mother was sent – I mean, you and your mother were sent to a sovkhoz, Lenin’s sovkhoz, and it was a pig farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Tell me, did anybody come at any time, from the time you were, you know, released from the train, to the s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: – to the sovkhoz, and tell you why you had been arrested, or where you were going, or – or anything official at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Not a single word.</span> <span id="s1304">We just were put a – and there were other Polish family, off the wagon, or maybe two, three wagons, really, quite a few families.</span> <span id="s1305">And some were from Zaleszczyki, the same time – town, but some were not.</span> <span id="s1306">Nobody told us anything, we were all put into a hall, wh-which was a hall in a school.</span> <span id="s1307">But that school was not really operating, there were no students there, it was ju – so we were first put to there.</span> <span id="s1308">And I frankly don’t remember what – what we – whether we were given anything to eat, or anything of that sort, but I – th-this was memorable, because we – we were put on the ground, you know, because there was nothing, we’re just on the floor, rather.</span> <span id="s1309">And all of a sudden they showed us a movie with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: In the middle of Kazakhstan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yes, yes, yeah, I – don’t ask me why.</span> <span id="s1312">So I remember that, and I know that it happened, because I’m – as I say, on one or two photographs I have, on the back, I pictured, I think, I know what – how the costumes were, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1313">I drew it.</span> <span id="s1314">So no, nobody was telling us anything, and ah – so that was spring.</span> <span id="s1315">I remember co – to continue living in that place until winter, or maybe the beginning of – you know, winter starts earlier there.</span> <span id="s1316">So it was maybe no – I don’t know what month, but it was snowing.</span> <span id="s1317">And one time it snowed so much, and that – there – the – we couldn’t get out, because it’s similar to what’s happening in the east now, or was, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Okay, well right now we’re talking – you’re referring to a recent snowstorm, in the past –</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1320">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: – few days, in January 2015.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Correct, on the east coast.</span> <span id="s1323">You – you couldn’t get out, and you sort of looked down and you had to dig yourself out of that of that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1324">It was extremely cold, crowded, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: This is where you lived for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yes, we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: – several months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Several months before we were then allotted, or put into a hut that was half dug in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: – and half outside.</span> <span id="s1331">It was made of mud, really, with straw in it, for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What was the name of this place?</span> <span id="s1333">Do you remember what the place name itself was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: The place of the name was Peschanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Peschanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1339">You know, later on I rem – I probably don’t – but later on when I started writing – I started writing in the camp around Teheran.</span> <span id="s1340">I have diaries, that’s why I remember some of this stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Oh, I see, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: I’ll show you one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1344">Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">So, you were in Peschanka for at least four or five months in the school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1347">That’s the – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: – hall, and then in a hut nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Did your mother have to go work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: My mother was not working.</span> <span id="s1352">Everybody else went working, because if you don’t – didn’t work, you didn’t get this bread that’s as – you would not call bread, but you know, that was all rations.</span> <span id="s1353">Was like a piece of heavy mud, but it was fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Did you have to buy it, or was it given to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s1356">No, it was given to us.</span> <span id="s1357">We didn’t get any money, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: No.</span> <span id="s1360">No money was exchanged.</span> <span id="s1361">And even if we had money, there was nothing to buy anyway.</span> <span id="s1362">It was all a – like a barterer economy.</span> <span id="s1363">You – we – in order to – to exchange anything for food, you gave what you had, you know: a coat, gloves that were shrunken, but a – just a – one item for another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Material item.</span> <span id="s1366">So, I did not go to school, but there was a family with us, who were again, teenagers, and they appealed to me because they were teenagers.</span> <span id="s1367">And all of a sudden it just – I don’t – one of them became sort of my teacher, or whatever, and I sort of started writing.</span> <span id="s1368">I didn’t mind writing on pieces of everything, and it was no longer a chore.</span> <span id="s1369">All of sudden I hated every Russian, maybe.</span> <span id="s1370">I was very mad at them, at what they were doing to us.</span> <span id="s1371">I don’t remember being very frightened, but I was always sort of angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Well, it’s – it’s a very natural response.</span> <span id="s1373">Your mother – now, you said that when you had, even at that beginning of the deportation, your mother was not quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1375">She had that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Well, she had the heart problem to begin with.</span> <span id="s1378">So, it got progressively worse, because I’m sure she was very much upset, and so on.</span> <span id="s1379">So, there were, of course, exiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too, but they had nothing to give you to help you when you were sick.</span> <span id="s1380">But they were extremely good doctors.</span> <span id="s1381">But they were exiled like we, because they were doctors, they were enemies of the state again.</span> <span id="s1382">So, they somehow wrote that my mother didn’t have to work, which was worse, because then we didn’t get that piece of bread, but the Zhaglietska(ph) family shared with us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: I see, so you were kept alive –</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Beca – and did all three of them work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1387">And one of them, the – the brother worked as a laborer in – in some factory with Russian workers.</span> <span id="s1388">And he – one time obviously, without knowing how, that everyone spied on everyone, said that Polish workers had it much better than the Russian workers, and they – somebody in that factory denounced him.</span> <span id="s1389">So, of course, I don’t know how many days after, maybe very soon after, again, soldiers came, surrounded us, and surro – came into the – where we were staying, and shoved us again together, and took him to the gulag, you know.</span> <span id="s1390">He was 19.</span> <span id="s1391">So he ended – and the mother went crazy, you know, just crazy.</span> <span id="s1392">So that he – he ended up i-in the gulag itself, in the prison camps.</span> <span id="s1393">Fortunately, he survived, but he had many stories to tell too, as I recall, after that, because he met such strange and different people, and of course was awful, awful.</span> <span id="s1394">Worse than on a collective farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1396">All because he had said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: – that Polish workers had it better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1400">Because you know, what’s the purpose of communism, right?</span> <span id="s1401">To improve the workers’ conditions, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: So then there were two of them left to work for four people, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1404">Yes.</span> <span id="s1405">But then, the gir – young woman, Marisha(ph) – I don’t know what she did before, but again, the winter – after winter, then – then there was spring, but in the – in the – in summer, I remember that Marisha(ph) worked in the pig farm, and then they gave me a job of being her assistant, because you had to sort of herd the pigs in the steppes, otherwise they would go, and be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: They would run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: So – but that was a pass, because then we would si – well, we would really steal from the pigs.</span> <span id="s1410">Of course, if you were caught, that was gulag again, but fortunately –</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: How could you steal from a pig?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Well, the pigs ate something which is called makukhay(ph), and it was what the pigs were eating, and they even – even ha-had some milk, which we never saw.</span> <span id="s1413">And that we didn’t steal, because you couldn’t take it with you.</span> <span id="s1414">But makukhay(ph) is a sunflower from which the oil, sunflower oil –</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Is pressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: – is pressed out, and it’s sort of smooshed together, and it’s rather hard, but you know, is given to the pigs, and we ate that.</span> <span id="s1417">So that was a plus, in a way, because there were some – some vitamins in it, I imagine, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So it was already prepared food for the pigs –</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: For the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: – for the pigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: And when you would take them out to keep watch on them, you would be able to eat whatever –</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Whatever we found, yes.</span> <span id="s1424">We sometimes also ate what grew in the steppes, like, I don’t know, grass that was sort of tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1426">And – and so you were helping her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: You were helping her by – by – how many pigs did you have to keep watch on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Oh, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Was it a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Many, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And were the pigs slaughtered on this farm as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: No.</span> <span id="s1436">I – no, they were taken somewhere, and of course, sold to the elite.</span> <span id="s1437">You know, Moscow, Leningrad, or whatever – Stalingrad, rather, you know, and everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: So, you never saw any meat, you never saw any pork?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: No, not a single piece of meat, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: No meat.</span> <span id="s1442">There were some cows around.</span> <span id="s1443">I don’t remember drinking milk.</span> <span id="s1444">Basically it was da – the – th-that bread, and what we could steal.</span> <span id="s1445">Some people worked digging – digging out potatoes, and they would steal potatoes by putting them – you know, you had a coat, and you put it in between.</span> <span id="s1446">So they – some people were very heavy with that, but y-you were – had to be very careful, because that meant again, gulag, if you were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: But again, the Russians did not have it better, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Except they ate maybe a li – they ate better, because they probably here and there had the garden, I don’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: So that you were in the hut together with – I forget the fa – na – family name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Zhaglietska(ph) family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Zhaglietska(ph) family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: And you shi – the four of you, after the boy, and what was his name, the 19 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Zbishu(ph) Zbigniew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Zbigniew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Like Zb</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Yeah, so Zbigniew Zhaglietski(ph), after he was then sent to the gulag, it was the four of you in the hut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1461">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: And when you’re – when you went out with Marisha(ph), was that her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: And her mother, to work, your mother was left in the hut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Did she cook for any – for everybody?</span> <span id="s1467">What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Yeah, that’s wha-what she did, but mo-mo-mostly, she endless – spent endless day – days being interrogated by – by the secret police in that vi – stupid village, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Oh yes, endlessly.</span> <span id="s1471">Endlessly asking her wh-wh-where is my father, and that she’s spying.</span> <span id="s1472">I mean, you couldn’t do anything there, but – but so, she would go, and I never knew that she would be coming back.</span> <span id="s1473">And of course, one time she was even denounced, again by a – an elderly woman who had a – a daughter, and the – that daughter was sickly, so she did it for an egg, because she thought that the daughter’s sickness, which was – I think she had TB, but I don’t remember now – that eggs will help her.</span> <span id="s1474">I remember her taking the egg, taking the eggshell, and crushing it, and giving it to that – you know, with the egg, because she thought, you know, that consuming the eggshell would help her.</span> <span id="s1475">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: And in order to get the egg, she did – how wa – how did you find out then?</span> <span id="s1477">What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Well, it – it – it was obvious, because she would – you know, I – I wa – didn’t do – didn’t look at it that way.</span> <span id="s1479">I only saw the egg, and then the – I – you know, what – what was said among us, that she was spying on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1481">Was sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: On everybody, not only on my mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Was she also one of those who was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Yes, of cour – yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1485">An elderly woman, and it wa – she was from Zaleszczyki too, with her – she was deported with her daughter, and a little grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: That must have been very bitter, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Oh – oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1488">But somehow – later on we met in Teheran with this family, and it – we became reconciled.</span> <span id="s1489">We did not feel any – because we knew – y-you know, people, I – I guess, react strangely, you know, and the – we are hungry, or we are desperate to save your own child.</span> <span id="s1490">They emigrated to South Africa then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: After that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: From Teheran, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: So, your mother, even though she got a certificate that she was ill and couldn’t work, was nevertheless called to be interrogated –</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1497">That wa – that – I – the two had n-no connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1501">I see.</span> <span id="s1502">She must have been in quite a nervous state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: She was, and th-this is – th-this was tough for – for me in that time.</span> <span id="s1504">So – because I would wait, and I never – and it was endlessly she would be called, and I – it was futile, I mean, just think of it.</span> <span id="s1505">In the middle of nowhere, wha-what is she doing se – what is she sending, anyway?</span> <span id="s1506">You couldn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Yeah, what could she –</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: There was no electricity, no radios, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: What kind of a spy could you be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Right, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: – that’s a nice system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: And very tough on a child, very tough.</span> <span id="s1514">Were you – it sounds like that you couldn’t really turn to her for comfort, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: No, that’s true.</span> <span id="s1518">I – this is why I – as I mentioned before, I think – I mean, unfortunate as it was for them to be deported with us, the Zhaglietski(ph) – especially the mother Zhaglietski(ph) – Zhaglietska(ph) had me – ha-had us both really.</span> <span id="s1519">Me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Yeah, so you gu – so if you had some issue, or some problem, would you go to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Ah, yes, yeah, I would, but I don’t remember that I ever really complained about anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s1522">I was always angry at the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Are you still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yes, but I – well, for a while that dropped off, thinking oh, poor people, they – because we knew that they suffered too.</span> <span id="s1525">But after they won so-called freedom with Gorbachev and so on, the Perestroika, I said well, great, they will be on the way now, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1526">And look what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1527">It – it’s really – it seems to be in the Russians’ character to – to have some – to – to like to be dictated, and be enslaved, really, you know.</span> <span id="s1528">I mean, we – they have a dictator now, and for the sake of the great Russia – they love their country, they love their piece of land, but th-they – somebody said that the Russians are – are – are good friends, but bad citizens, and I think that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1530">How did things go forward?</span> <span id="s1531">How did they progress?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: So when, as I mentioned, which is very interesting, there were German co-colonies, or really collective farms, because apparently, when the communism thrived in the – Russia – or thrived maybe it is bad word – some Germans emigrated, really, to Russia, and they were put on collective farms, and those farms when – were run better than the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Sovkhoz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: – So-Soviet – Soviet farms.</span> <span id="s1535">So, since Mother knew German, in order to get anything again – not for money, but for a piece – say, a good tooth, or whatever, she would go and once she brought honey, I – I – I remember.</span> <span id="s1536">So the – the – we lived, and we – we tried to – to – to really eat as well as we could, here and there, you know, not to starve.</span> <span id="s1537">I know I was sick.</span> <span id="s1538">I don’t know if I had scarlet fever, which is now very – or – or something else, but I was very sick once in Russia, but not – not – not very sick otherwise.</span> <span id="s1539">And so I – I and Marisha(ph) worked with the pigs, and we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s1540">And wh-when winter came you really – I mean, our breath would freeze.</span> <span id="s1541">We would be unable, or even don’t want to go outside, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: This was the winter of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1544">1941?</span> <span id="s1545">Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">So we all, in 1941 then, in June, all of a sudden the news came – and of course there were no radios, there were just loudspeakers sometimes, but that was not announced during – by a loud speaker.</span> <span id="s1547">Somebody came in June ’41, and told us that the Germans attacked Russia.</span> <span id="s1548">So everybody was ecstatic about it, people were happy, including the Russians that were there.</span> <span id="s1549">Because finally the Stalin era will perhaps be finished, you know.</span> <span id="s1550">And I don’t know how, but – how we got the news that the Polish government in exile in Great Britain started negotiations already, talks through the – the British officials, with Stalin, or whoever was th – one of the other henchmen in Russia, they started looking for the deported Poles, you know, and especially officers, you know, so – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: But you didn’t know that at the time, when you were in this farm in Kazakhstan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: No.</span> <span id="s1553">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: I wanted to ask something else: aside from how you were greeted by these Russian exiles, who said you will get used to it, you will get used to it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: – and the doctors who were good, and tried to treat –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: – your mother, but had no – did you have contact with these Russian deportees and exiles?</span> <span id="s1559">Did – was there talk and – and communication with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: There was not much talking with them, because my – very few people spo-spoke Russian, and there was not much talking with them.</span> <span id="s1561">And as far as me as a child is concerned, I did play with chi – Russian children, you know.</span> <span id="s1562">And there were two boys, and the father was in charge of some sort of a – like a lumberyard, I remember.</span> <span id="s1563">So – but there was not much of a contact otherwise.</span> <span id="s1564">No, and there was no – no – no – you e – I think that perhaps nobody was discussing anything with each other because everybody was afraid of everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s1565">You could go –</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: You – your own circle, that is you, Mrs. Zhaglietski(ph), and your daughter, yo – that didn’t affect you.</span> <span id="s1567">You were like a cell.</span> <span id="s1568">You –</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: – you – you trusted one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: You were like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: And all the po – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Basically, all the Poles were like that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1577">Except the grandma, who needed the egg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1579">I don’t remember anyone – I then heard later on that there was somebody else, but I don’t even know if it was in our – on our collective farm, that was like that.</span> <span id="s1580">But there were people that were trying to save their own lives, and denouncing others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: The winter of ’41, you stayed inside, you said because it was so cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: When spring came, were you working again, helping Marisha(ph), or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: No.</span> <span id="s1585">They some – they threw me off of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1587">Okay.</span> <span id="s1588">Maybe you were eating too much of the pigs’ food, you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1590">No, I hope they didn’t know about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1592">So in June ’41, you do learn that Germany attacks the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: But the other developments, you don’t know about yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: The ones about the negotiations for Polish officers, and so – and how – how did that summer progress?</span> <span id="s1597">What were you doing, and what was your mother doing during that summer?</span> <span id="s1598">Was she still being interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: All of us – all – yeah – I don’t remember that that month she was or – you know, what month it’s ended, or whatever – her interrogations or whatever they – you know.</span> <span id="s1600">Really, intimidation and harassment, you know.</span> <span id="s1601">But what – after that – that was announced that – it was announced that we have amnesty, that we can move freely through Russia.</span> <span id="s1602">Well, now – now, think of it.</span> <span id="s1603">You are in the middle of nowhere, and you are going to move freely in Russia.</span> <span id="s1604">So all the Poles – again, I don’t know how we found out all this, but somehow all the Poles tried to get out from collective farms, which was not easy.</span> <span id="s1605">They didn’t want to let us go, and of course they did – physically it was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1606">So I can’t tell you though, how the news that the Polish government was sending emissaries, or representatives to try – trying to find us, I don’t know how we got the news.</span> <span id="s1607">But Zhaglietskis(ph), my mother, and some other family decided to get out of the sovkhoz – called sovkhoz house and go, move towards a city, and Semipalatinsk was the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: How do you say that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Semipalatinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Semipalatinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Semipalatinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Yeah, yeah, it’s a – it’s – was known when they started to sending Sputniks down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: You know, it’s Kazakhstan nearby.</span> <span id="s1616">So, by whatever means again, bribery through – not – not so mu – mun – there was no money, but whatever you had, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: To sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1619">To exchange.</span> <span id="s1620">So we somehow got out of Peschanka to a port on a river that’s Irtysh river, because I remember that, getting on a – some boat.</span> <span id="s1621">And we then proceeded south, to Semipalatinsk, and I also remember that there were – I remember seeing it somehow, in that the German colonists that were before, really highly – in a way fr – relatively highly regarded, because they settled in communist country –</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So they have been German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: – they were being deported because the Russians attacked from the west.</span> <span id="s1624">So they were now taken o-off of their collective farms and thrown out.</span> <span id="s1625">The Russian [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Because Germany was attacking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Because Germans were attacking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1630">So they were taking over, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: So – but these must have been German communists, or people who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Oh yes, absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: They were people who ideologically were for the social system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: [indecipherable] Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1636">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1638">So – so then a – aw – down the Irtysh we somehow – I don’t know what the – what means of transportation we took or may – because I don’t think Semipalatinsk is on the Irtysh.</span> <span id="s1639">We landed in Semipalatinsk, where also Zbishu(ph) who was released from prison, because the amnesty was proclaimed for all, found himself there, and found a room with Russia – Russian couple, and it was the – so when we first arrived, I’ll never forget, we went to see wh-where we were going to stand – and again, quite a few Poles living together, but it was in the city, and so on.</span> <span id="s1640">But anyway, that – the landlady and her husband were eating potatoes just covered with butter, I – I – I almost fainted right there.</span> <span id="s1641">Food was always on one’s mind.</span> <span id="s1642">But the – the landlady’s husband was a chef at some cadet school, so he would steal from them.</span> <span id="s1643">This is how they had lots of food, but they don’t – didn’t share it with us.</span> <span id="s1644">Instead again, we stole from them, because the landlady had in – in her – like basement, da – un-under – dungeon-like area, really.</span> <span id="s1645">She had like a tall – toasted dark bread.</span> <span id="s1646">So we si – we would position guards to see if she was coming, and one would go down and steal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: To be – everybody needed to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1649">Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1651">So Zbigniew had found a room in their place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: And then all five of you were in this room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: All five plus a – one more fellow whose mother died in Peschanka, and we buried her in the steppes, so there were six of us –</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Six people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: – six people.</span> <span id="s1657">And Semipalatinsk then did get some – some representative of the Polish government, you know, they were sent all over Russia to be looking whose – who – who is there.</span> <span id="s1658">Nobody knew what happened to the 15,000 Polish officers, you know, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1659">So, we then found out that there is a Polish army under the British – British are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Authority, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: For – being formed in the south, in – in Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s1664">So, since everybody wanted to get the heck out of Russia, you know, maybe we – we should be going south.</span> <span id="s1665">So everybody from [indecipherable] to the north, everybody was trying to get south.</span> <span id="s1666">And again, you had to bri – in the meantime, war is going on, as far as Russia is concerned.</span> <span id="s1667">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Can we interrupt just for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Yes, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: When you say Russia, do you mean the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yes, I do, sorry, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: – Kazakhstan is not part of Russia, nor is Uzbekistan, but they were all part of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Absolutely true, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Okay, okay, just wanted to make sure –</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Norman Davis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Yes, he’s absolutely right, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1680">Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: So we – we somehow – we started going south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: And it is 1941, already maybe fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And of course we – it takes a – days to get to where supposedly the Polish army is being formed.</span> <span id="s1687">And I – again, you have to – the trains are slow, overloaded.</span> <span id="s1688">You wait at stations, you wait at different stations, and lice is all over, all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: That’s why they had delousing stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1691">You – you – you wait in the station, you s – you know, it’s crowded, and so on.</span> <span id="s1692">So li – you – you open that – you – you look –</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: In your sleeves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: – a long – you have sleeves like that, and they are crawl – marching, you know, every – marching.</span> <span id="s1695">But again, the Russians would say, oh, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1696">When new people, cleaner people come to the station, the lice with leave you.</span> <span id="s1697">And do you know that supposedly they did, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: I want to ask something; when you were able to leave Peschanka, is that the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Were you issued any documents, or any permission, so that if anybody stopped you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Yes, I believe, I believe so, but I – I wouldn’t know it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1703">So you got some piece of paper that showed you are allowed to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yes, I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: But I would – I – I can’t guarantee it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: So there you were at the stations, together with lice who also want to leave the Soviet Union, and you are trying to get south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1711">So we get south, and by then it’s b – the – almost December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: So we get south, and there is nothing but some tents and a few Polish men who escaped, or walked – and people walked thousands of miles.</span> <span id="s1714">Sa – some people ca – some – in some families, mother and father were dead, and th-the eldest child would carry youngest one.</span> <span id="s1715">So this – just tragic stories, you will hear them probably.</span> <span id="s1716">Awful stories.</span> <span id="s1717">But anyway – so, we arrive and there’s nothing.</span> <span id="s1718">And when we – but a few tents, and a few men that still don’t have uniforms, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: So where was this place that you arrived to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yangiyul, it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Yangiyul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: So – so, there is nothing.</span> <span id="s1725">Nobody is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Waiting for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: – doing anything.</span> <span id="s1728">And we were not the only one doing this, but we never – I not – don’t remember ever meeting anybody else in that place where there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: So we then – this – deci – we decide to go back, because at least we know – to Semipalatinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Because if you didn’t go back, you would end up on another collective farm, worse than the one you were probably in, because that is Uzbekistan, you know, there’s not really, I don’t know, sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: And again, later on I find out that many people just disappeared, because they – they stayed on another collective farm, and that was the end of them, you know.</span> <span id="s1735">It’s just – just not ba –</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: So they were forgotten, they were never registered, never –</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: So we go – we start going back, which was worse than coming – going south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Winter is – is – it is – is there, cold.</span> <span id="s1742">So when we arrived in Semipalatinsk, I didn’t have any shoes on, and of course, cold, and I – I – my feet were frostbitten, and they don’t bother me now, but they bothered me England, because we came from warm climate to ba – anyway, so there we arrive, and the – the room was still there, because maybe one of the guys still was there, I don’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: So we go, and we then – there is a representative of the Polish government in the – established in Semipalatinsk.</span> <span id="s1745">And material help comes from U.S. and Great Britain, for example, shoes and so on.</span> <span id="s1746">And again – but it all takes time.</span> <span id="s1747">So we then start back to go south in – in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: So you stayed the whole winter in Semipal-palatinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: [phone ringing] Can I cut please?</span> <span id="s1751">[break] So, you stayed the winter in Semipalatinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: And you lived in this one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: And you got some sort of material help from the Polish authorities, that was sent through Americans and British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And then, you’re there for several months, and in the summer you start to go south again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1759">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: And – why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Why?</span> <span id="s1762">In order to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: And by now we know that there is – that there – there are -- Zbishu(ph), the – the Zhaglietski’s(ph) son, already joined the – I think he was, later on he was in the air force, but he went south before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: But of course, there’s no communication, it’s just tha – with this representative here, that – tha-that – so we – we start going south again.</span> <span id="s1767">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: This is now summer of ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1770">It’s now easier, because it’s summer.</span> <span id="s1771">But I do remember by then, trains filled with wounded Russian soldiers being transported.</span> <span id="s1772">I mean, on – not even under cover.</span> <span id="s1773">There were many wounded.</span> <span id="s1774">I’m sure they went the – ended up in gulag later on.</span> <span id="s1775">But anyway – but a – so we – when we then arrive in Yangiyul –</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Again, the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1778">There is – oh, there are tents and there are many Polish civilians there, but – and the Polish soldiers, th-their rations came from the British army.</span> <span id="s1779">So they shared the food with us, because Stalin didn’t want to give any food to us at all.</span> <span id="s1780">So they shared the food, and prior to our arrival, there were already two – two transports out of Russia, over the Caspian Sea to Teheran.</span> <span id="s1781">So we then end up really closing the camp, and whatever civilians are there – and again, you know, when you arrived in the south, and you started to eat a little bit better, everybody was getting si – ty-typhoid, dysentery.</span> <span id="s1782">Lack of vitamins, you know, I was covered with something, I don’t remember what it’s called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Sores, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Sores, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Yeah, some sores.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Oh – yeah.</span> <span id="s1787">Lack of vitamins, I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: So were you able – I mean, were – were you able to leave because your father was a military officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: No, it – it’s just that we were able to li – leave because we were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1791">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: So it wa – it – his – that he was in the military had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: No, nothing whatsoever, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Well, the worst really was for the so-called minorities, because from day one, Jews were considered to be citizens of – of Russia.</span> <span id="s1797">They – Russians were their saviors.</span> <span id="s1798">So it was very difficult at times to – for a Jew – Polish Jew –</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: – to emi – to go – get out of ru – Soviet Union, I’m sorry, with us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: So because – okay, because they weren’t considered Polish citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1803">They – they were deported to be saved by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1804">Well, anyway, so then, after everything was being liquidated, the rast – last group of the soldiers, and of – very many were very sick, you know, as I say.</span> <span id="s1805">Well, once you start eating, and you were starved so many years.</span> <span id="s1806">So we then, from yangilu – Yangiyul, go to something called Krasnovodsk, which was on the cas – port on the Caspian Sea.</span> <span id="s1807">And on – with the last transport from Russia, we escape.</span> <span id="s1808">Again, you have to leave everything on the ground.</span> <span id="s1809">By then it’s very hot, and we are from very cold north.</span> <span id="s1810">No shoes, so now the feet are absolutely suffering because it’s so hot.</span> <span id="s1811">But anyway, to the very end, we are not sure that we’ll get on that ship.</span> <span id="s1812">The ship was overloaded, everybody was sick on the ship, and we crossed the Caspian Sea to what used to be called Pahlavi, for the shah of Pahlavi, now it’s a different name, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Okay, I want to interrupt right here.</span> <span id="s1814">You mentioned before that for minorities; and you gave us an example; Jews who were from Poland who were deported, had difficulties leaving.</span> <span id="s1815">Did you know, or did you see any Jewish people who were in your wagon, or in the – or in Peschanka, I think it was that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: We – did you know of – of such families, or such individuals who would –</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: I only knew of one.</span> <span id="s1819">I wouldn’t recognize a Jew from non-Jew, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: But I knew of one Jewish person, and she was with us almost throughout this – this experience.</span> <span id="s1822">She was a – a wife of a Polish major.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And she had two sons.</span> <span id="s1825">And they – of course, again, she – she was left with us, I don’t know where she was in pa – Semipalatinsk, I – maybe she even lived with them, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1826">But anyway, sh-she – but she, perhaps because she was married to a Polish military man, it was easier for her.</span> <span id="s1827">And no, she didn’t regard herself maybe as – as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Yes, Maria Kuska(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Maria Kuska(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: And her two sons had been deported with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1834">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: And they had gone to the same pig farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: No, a – I don’t – I don’t remember them from the pig farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Okay, you remember them in Semipalatinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: And then they were very nice to me, because they – they – then tha – joined the Polish army, so we reconnected with everybody in Teheran, and of course they – I was small, and ti –</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: And everybody liked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: – so they – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Everybody liked you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: They took me for – for ice cream, and they were already in the army, so they had money, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: So – okay, so let’s go back to the ship.</span> <span id="s1846">You say it was overcrowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1848">That was a nightmare, really.</span> <span id="s1849">So, we are on the ship, and I don’t know how long it took to cross to Pahlavi.</span> <span id="s1850">We cross in Pahlavi and we are just down t – on the beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Shore, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: And there is trans – transit ca-camp, really, in Pahlavi, because I – all the transport were coming.</span> <span id="s1853">Not all.</span> <span id="s1854">I – I should – I should not say it because some people went o-ov-over land, to Isfahan, which is another – I think Adamchik(ph) went that way, but I wouldn’t bet.</span> <span id="s1855">Yeah, I think Adamchik(ph) went that way.</span> <span id="s1856">But anyway, so we just are dumped in that transit camp, and dysentery is everywhere.</span> <span id="s1857">I – and there are – there is nothing but sort of walls made of like reeds, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1858">We were not there too long, and then we were put – maybe because we were almost the last coming out of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Do you remember – did you leave in which month in the summer of ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: I think it was August, but I wouldn’t bet on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: I can go to my diary.</span> <span id="s1863">No, I am joking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Oh, and excuse me, you had said you had to leave everything behind, but you had your little suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: So you could take your suitcase with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: I definitely carried it all.</span> <span id="s1870">I – don’t ask me how.</span> <span id="s1871">I have it still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Is na – wasn’t probably nothing in it.</span> <span id="s1874">But you know, rings, and all that – if any – but, of course, nothing was by then left.</span> <span id="s1875">But if you ha – even had a pillow, you had to le-leave it on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1877">And the reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: I think one of the reasons [indecipherable] thinking now, was that in order to – to fit the – all the people that were trying to be on that ship, you had – y-y-you could not – y – th-the less you took, the more people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: – could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1882">I see.</span> <span id="s1883">Okay.</span> <span id="s1884">So, you’re in Pahlavi, and then from there what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: On buses we are take – we are – we drive through the Iranian mountains, very steep precipices, you know, one or two buses fell down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Really, yeah, really.</span> <span id="s1888">A-And very na – well, you know, when they – in the mountains it’s very dangerous, you know, it – to be on the mountain.</span> <span id="s1889">But anyway, so we arrive in Teheran, and we are put in camp number one, which has nothing, you know, just a piece of land, very dry, hot.</span> <span id="s1890">And there is – was a building which was a hospital, because many people right away – a very primitive hospital, but a building.</span> <span id="s1891">So, we are in camp number one, and I don’t know, there were about three or four camps.</span> <span id="s1892">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: So you were on the outskirts of Teheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, no, not Teheran itself, no.</span> <span id="s1895">And there are many other camps around Teheran, mainly of military camps.</span> <span id="s1896">Indian – the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, I mean al-all – almost every country was re – military was presented militarily around there.</span> <span id="s1897">But th-this was a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s1898">So there – there’s nothing at first, and slowly they build again, like a platform where we just sit and I – the w – the – they then give us – they carry food in pails to us, you know, and it’s all – usually it was something with rice, you know.</span> <span id="s1899">But oh – I all – we always have this food on mind.</span> <span id="s1900">When I look –</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: You’re still hungry.</span> <span id="s1902">At that point you’re still hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: Well, we all – yeah, I mean, food was some sort of an obsession.</span> <span id="s1904">I – I mean, the fact that maybe one had food, one wanted more, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1905">But anyways –</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1912">So – a-and of course, schools are already set – Poli – Polish government in exile again, I mean, I don’t know how they did it, but they set up schools right there.</span> <span id="s1913">I was two years behind, so they – I have to study faster, but we sit on – literally on the ground, studying.</span> <span id="s1914">We have teachers, we don’t have any books, but we – we slowly start schooling again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Did you write between the line now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1917">No, there were no lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: There were no lines any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: None, no, no.</span> <span id="s1920">But I wrote in my diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: So you started writing a diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Oh yes, I started writing the diary in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: And you were how year – how many years old there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: You were 10 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Did you have the idea by yourself, or did somebody suggest it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Nobody suggested it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: What are the things that you wrote in that diary?</span> <span id="s1930">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Today I – I am – I am very mad, because they not only looked for lice at – when I was at school, but when I came to my barracks.</span> <span id="s1932">That was what.</span> <span id="s1933">And today was a great dinner, because we ate so much.</span> <span id="s1934">And then I wrote about the people that w – that we lived with on this platform first, and then they build barracks.</span> <span id="s1935">So – but the worst part for me, and for many children, because we – there was something called Egyptian eye infection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Oh, the headache was splitting, the eyes were puffed up, filled with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Mucus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: – pus, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Pus, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: And you couldn’t open them, and then they would, of course, try to – to finish that infection and they would line us up outside in this heat, dry heat, and with the sand or soil just in – in the air, and you stood there, and they would give you, you know, drops into the eyes.</span> <span id="s1942">It was – it was excruciating.</span> <span id="s1943">And one time, we still were on these plat – there was no cover, of any sort.</span> <span id="s1944">And the toilet facilities were something else.</span> <span id="s1945">No, ju-just a hole, a huge, long hole dug in the ground, with planks put over it, you know.</span> <span id="s1946">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1947">And one night, you know, I – I endlessly probably cried, because you couldn’t open eyes, so my mother takes me to that – I need to go, she takes me there, and I fell inside.</span> <span id="s1948">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1949">Because you – you don’t have any facilities to wash yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: She – I don’t know how she – but it – well, it – it was cured, you know, but it was one of the horrific pains.</span> <span id="s1952">But anyway – so, the school started in that camp, you know, and we slow – slowly started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: How was your mother’s health, now that she was in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Well, she again was – she again was hospitalized in that building, I remember, that was the only building, because she had heart problems, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1956">And in this camp, were you able to inquire about your father and where he might be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: It wa – came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: So you didn’t know if he was dead or alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: No, we didn’t know where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1963">How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: In that camp?</span> <span id="s1965">Let me see.</span> <span id="s1966">I would say, no – not very long, about maybe six months.</span> <span id="s1967">Because Mother then got a position at this Polish military headquarters where she went around the camps, doling out money to the wives of officers.</span> <span id="s1968">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Like she was.</span> <span id="s1970">She was a wife of an officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1973">So this would have been, let’s say, in the winter of ’43, if you were there for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Correct, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Yeah, about half a year, so winter, spring, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Correct, right.</span> <span id="s1977">So we moved, since Mother gets the job, and so did Marisha(ph).</span> <span id="s1978">We moved to – on – in – in a room in a home of a Persian – it – Iranians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: The home – the home is on – and there are just a few homes, and in the middle there is a little pool.</span> <span id="s1981">It-It’s like a inya –</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Courtyard, yeah.</span> <span id="s1984">That – that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Sounds pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: – usually [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1987">Very pretty, but it was very small.</span> <span id="s1988">Oh yes, very pretty, but – so, we move there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: This is still Teheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yes, Teheran.</span> <span id="s1991">And the la-landlady lost her husband, we are told, because a Polish Jewish lady sto-stole him from – but, she had the brother who – who was – they were Muslims.</span> <span id="s1992">He was an extremist.</span> <span id="s1993">On – on the holiday of Ramadan, he would go and beat himself with chains and so on.</span> <span id="s1994">But, she had a cat, which I liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: [sneeze] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1996">Okay, she had a cat that you liked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1998">And I have a – even a picture of that cat.</span> <span id="s1999">And she had a daughter, whose name was Azar(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Azar(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: And Azar(ph) and I became friends, because we were almost the same age.</span> <span id="s2002">And Azar(ph) and I would go to the bazaar, and I learned Farsi.</span> <span id="s2003">I did speak Farsi, and I know how to write my name in Farsi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Oh, oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Which I did.</span> <span id="s2006">So, from time to time then, in my diary I write, today, mean Iranian girls pulled my hair and so on.</span> <span id="s2007">But overall, Azar(ph) was very good, and Azar(ph) wrote in my memory book, or whatever it’s called, in Farsi.</span> <span id="s2008">I tried to have it translated.</span> <span id="s2009">It was translated once correctly, and then Adamchik(ph) lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Oh, the translation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Because he wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s2014">But so, it’s something in there, since you know, flowers fade, but words stay, and maybe a hundred years from now they’ll still live.</span> <span id="s2015">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: That’s a lovely thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Very lovely, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: So – and so, when we lived in Teheran, there were schools in Teheran, Polish schools in Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Did miss – Did Mrs. Zhaglietska(ph) come with you, or were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: – they were with you too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: So, in Teheran, the – the Polish school I – I had to go – I went to Polish school in the city itself.</span> <span id="s2026">The school was near some huge palace, and park, where at one time, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin met.</span> <span id="s2027">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2032">And of – they were – we were – we would go by while they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2035">But we off – never saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: You would –</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: But did you see lots of different kinds of officials and vehicles, and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: No, you know, because it was very deep inside some gar – this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2040">No, but we knew it was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2042">And you knew they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2044">So, in Teheran, Marisha(ph) loved to go to the movies, so we – Marisha(ph) and I would go to American movies, where American edwa – soldiers would look and offer us once gum, and we didn’t know what tha – to do with chewing gum.</span> <span id="s2045">And in Teheran, the ice cream, the Iranian ice cream, I think it was maybe – wasn’t it invented, sorbet and ice cr – invented?</span> <span id="s2046">Excellent ice cream, so we ate that.</span> <span id="s2047">And of course, again we were fixated on food.</span> <span id="s2048">So it was – and we didn’t have that much money.</span> <span id="s2049">So I remember, you know, in this street, Lazar(ph), there was some club or something, where the American soldiers were going boogie-woogie.</span> <span id="s2050">Really.</span> <span id="s2051">And then they would come out, which was even worse for me, they would have this white bun with lots of ham in it.</span> <span id="s2052">And I said to myself, if I could only have half of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: That – the – Teheran was overrun with every kind of, you know, mili – because shah was – people were – even Russians were there, which is military Russians.</span> <span id="s2055">And there was the German spy, fifth column sp fi – fi-fifth – I mean, German spies were there too.</span> <span id="s2056">Everybody was in Teheran.</span> <span id="s2057">Teheran was a beautiful city, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: What exotic things you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: You’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: And in such a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: So I come here, I go to Illinois Institute of Technology, you know, for the first time, which is another long story.</span> <span id="s2062">But I go there, and I take English 101, and I compared Teheran with Chicago, and the guy almost falls off the chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2064">And you ex – you start speaking in English about what you’ve seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Well, I will tell you, my spoken English was horrible.</span> <span id="s2066">I knew how to write well, but I did not –</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: You took time –</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Because when you don’t use the language, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Oh yeah, but we started studying English already in Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: I am, you are, she, it – it – he, she, it is, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: All of this.</span> <span id="s2074">So, how long did this last, this employment for your mother and living in that small house with the courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Oh – mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2076">Until about ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: So about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: About a year, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2081">And then, of course, the headquarters in – in Teheran closed, and camp – Polish refugee camps are sort of th – th-this is a ho – ho – a very ho – great burden on Iran, really.</span> <span id="s2082">The shah was very nice, but – for – to us –</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: – maybe not to his people.</span> <span id="s2085">So then we – when the headquarters close, and the – all the Polish army goes fighting in Italy and Libya and Egypt, we are – we move – I don’t know how we, but I think again, people were moved to different British colonies in the a – in Africa, Kenya, what’s now Tanzania.</span> <span id="s2086">India.</span> <span id="s2087">Mexico accepted some orphans.</span> <span id="s2088">United States didn’t want to accept anybody.</span> <span id="s2089">But anyway, the Brits distributed us through the colonies, and I don’t know why we landed not in a colony, but in what’s now Palestine – Israel, because it was their buffer state.</span> <span id="s2090">So we – in a convoy of these dodgers, they were these huge trucks, we traveled through Iraq and Jordan to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Did you know where your father was by now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Still no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Until Lebanon.</span> <span id="s2095">Later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2097">So you traveled to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2099">So we g – we – we – in Jerusalem then, again, because of the Polish government, there is some – we do got some money.</span> <span id="s2100">There are Polish military schools, but I am too small for those.</span> <span id="s2101">There is a Polish girls’ boarding school in Ein Karem, which is near na – Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2102">So I – we – Mother, Marisha(ph) and Zhagliets(ph) – Pana(ph) Zhaglietska(ph) and I land in Ein Karem, and are Polish people there, quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s2103">So I go to school there, and again have to catch up two more years, so which I do through summers and so on.</span> <span id="s2104">And this was bliss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: So what was your mother doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Nothing really.</span> <span id="s2107">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: So her job ended in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: Absolutely, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: And your – and how were you supported?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: By this little si – do-doling out of money from the Polish government in exile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: So you would get support for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Military or not, I’ll get support like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: And the – no electricity, no running water, but the in – Ein Karem is known for the – is a place where Saint John was born.</span> <span id="s2116">And my Arabic landlady had a huge, huge vineyards, and fig orchards, and olive orchards.</span> <span id="s2117">And they had the olive press, and you know, I am talking as you – oh, terrific, but yeah, but no electricity, no running water.</span> <span id="s2118">We would then go for water to Saint Mary’s spring with – there is a legend or belief that when Saint Mary vi – is – Saint Mary visited Saint E-E-Elizabeth, the spring sprung, you know, ages ago.</span> <span id="s2119">Pristine, beautiful water, and you know, I learn how to carry my water on the head, too, I’m – and it – I love really riding through the olive groves on dine – donkeys, and so on, and my landlady had two young daughters – three daughters, one was married.</span> <span id="s2120">And the married one had a little boy whose name was Juju(ph).</span> <span id="s2121">And Juju(ph) would come always to us, and by the way, we could buy bread from really Jewish stores in Jerusalem, but it was delivered to – to – of course, no – no pig meat [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: No pork.</span> <span id="s2123">No pork.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Chicken and chicken, I hate chicken to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2126">Too much chicken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2128">But – well, it was not too much maybe, but I – I – you know, ev-every – once a week we had chicken.</span> <span id="s2129">But fruit, the oranges were outstanding, you know, we – we really came back to life.</span> <span id="s2130">So we were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Were you – was this the place where you finally had good food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2133">Oh yes, really good food, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: And did that mean that you stopped thinking about it so much, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Well, I have to – I have to go to my diary.</span> <span id="s2136">I d – I don’t think I – no, I did not think as much, no.</span> <span id="s2137">Now I have real girlfriends, we like to go and the – the – you know, it’s mountainous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: So on – on the slopes of the mountain there were like stairs, where the Arabs planted different crops.</span> <span id="s2140">So we would go and jump, who is jumping higher or lower.</span> <span id="s2141">I jo – joined the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s2142">We went f – the flowers grew wild, th-they are called cyclamens, I still have them on the windowsill, I just love those flowers.</span> <span id="s2143">We would pick those flowers, we were very happy.</span> <span id="s2144">And we studied, and we went to Jerusalem, and of course the sc – in – in the school we – we would stage different –</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Plays?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: – plays and so on, and I was in the play, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s2147">So it was – that probably was the – now, the best parts of anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: How long did it last?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: It lasted – you know, the war ended in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: And as – where were you when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: Right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: And my –</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Do you remember the day that it ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: Well, the news came.</span> <span id="s2158">I – I remember the feeling, you know.</span> <span id="s2159">The war ended for all, but not for us, we can’t go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2160">That kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: That kind of feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Was the j – j -- Zhaglietski(ph) family still with you?</span> <span id="s2164">A: Well, the Zhaglietski(ph) family are still with us, but in the meantime, we find out that my father was in the – the – as prisoner of war, and somehow landed in the pri – as a prisoner of war with the Zhaglietski(ph).</span> <span id="s2165">You know, his friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: He had been captured in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: He was interned in Romania and then really given up to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2170">When Romania became real friend.</span> <span id="s2171">Of course, they – I think they had – Romania had oil i-i-in – at one – in one – in their industrial area.</span> <span id="s2172">But anyway, so – what was I saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: You – the Zhaglietski(ph) was interned with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: So, we find – we threw – we found my father, and he found us, through the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: He tried then to – he wa – so after he was – they were liberated by the Americans, on Easter, they were – before they were liberated, they – they – the owa – my father was in a – in a prisoner of wa-war ca-camp near Stuttgart, which was an industrial city.</span> <span id="s2179">The Germans started to shove them east.</span> <span id="s2180">They ha – were marching, and in one place, bomb falling, and there they were – they were doing something behind some barn, he told me, and all of a sudden the Americans arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: So, during this march, he’s liberated by the American forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: So when bo – th-the older officers that were – or military men that were liberated were then, of course, given the uniforms of the Polish army again, as part of the Eighth arm – British army.</span> <span id="s2185">And when he started looking for us, the war ends, and my father, since he knew German well, he – there were displaced persons camps, so he was – made the – the Romanian nationalities, he wa – he – he was the le-leader or director of the Polish group.</span> <span id="s2186">Many problems to de – when he was talking about it, he was most proud because he married off women with children that were who knows where – from where, he married them off, 50 of them off to men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2188">So – so th –</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: [indecipherable] matching men – Polish men with the Polish women.</span> <span id="s2190">I met some of them here in – yeah, in – in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Was he a good matchmaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: Yeah, because yes, then – it lasted, yes.</span> <span id="s2193">I’m sure he was not the only one, the priest was involved, you know.</span> <span id="s2194">But any – th-this is rather strange, because the British then were accepting the Polish military man that the – and allowing them to emigrate from the camps to Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: From Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: From Germany, and e – if the military man had the family, they were allowing the family to come along.</span> <span id="s2197">My father supposedly got on the train to Great Britain – you know, they were – of course, not directly, and he then, at the last minute, while Zhaglietski(ph) went to England, he got off the train.</span> <span id="s2198">So there are many suppositions why he did.</span> <span id="s2199">So – but anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: What are these suppositions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: I – I – I don’t know, I – I fi – one is, and that may be true, because my father was very sort of socially minded that he didn’t want to abandon the people, or he had some – some woman, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2202">One of the two, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: In the meantime, I was just waiting for the ideal father, and in Ein Karem, many of my friends whose father appeared, you know, and I was endlessly waiting, but no-nothing happened, o – you, obviously in Ein Karem.</span> <span id="s2205">But then we find each other, and Father tries to give letters to us, to the e – the Jews that were in the camps, and were going to Israel, you know, Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Oh, so he’s still –</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: But none arrived, none arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: No letter arrived, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: No letter – le –</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: Yeah, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: So he – he finds out that you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: You were there in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: And we find out – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: And that’s through the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2218">Geneva, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: So then – okay, so the war ends, and since Zhaglietski(ph), the – the man o – head man of the family is in England, Marisha(ph) and Pani(ph) Zhaglietska(ph) are allowed to go to England.</span> <span id="s2221">Many people go to England, we are left behind.</span> <span id="s2222">We are left behind, and the Polish communist government tries desperately to ta – to – to really pressure us – and also the Brits too, everybody was pressuring us, go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2223">My mother just couldn’t even think of it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: She still, even later on, she would very often look behind her if anybody was listening, you know, just – just a habit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: But anyway, so we – we remain, and the few families without fathers and so on, the s – the war, or civil war between the Jews and the Arabs starts, and we’re in an Arab settlement, and there are prob – you know, Arabs go on our roof, because there’s flat roofs, and just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: – shoot, shoot, shoot, you know.</span> <span id="s2230">And in – sometimes at night – the village surrounded, really, by Jewish settlements.</span> <span id="s2231">In the meantime, the British let criminals out of the prisons, and there comes a Muslim – in that village, I must say, there are two so-called muftis, one – or leaders, one is Muslim, and one is Christian in this village where – Ei-Ein Karem.</span> <span id="s2232">It’s on – I remember it well, because it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: This is wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: – first day be – yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: This is now ’46.</span> <span id="s2237">This – this is Thursday before Easter, and was beautiful night, moon shining and all of that, so I – I went to church, and the Christian mufti was there, and washing his feet.</span> <span id="s2238">And we are sitting – I mean, consider is no electricity, so sit and enjoys – well, enjoys life maybe better because of it.</span> <span id="s2239">But anyway – and all of a sudden we hear a shot.</span> <span id="s2240">This criminal, Muslim criminal that was let out of prison, killed the mu – Christian mufti.</span> <span id="s2241">From then on there was chaos in the village, and again there was endlessly alarmed that the Jews are coming, when Jews aren’t – were not coming.</span> <span id="s2242">Very few Poles left.</span> <span id="s2243">My bri – English teacher was still there.</span> <span id="s2244">He was from – Polish American from Pittsburgh, I think.</span> <span id="s2245">So he saw there was strength to negotiate for the whole group, there were maybe about 50 of us left, just women with children.</span> <span id="s2246">And the school closed in ’47, only half a year, you know, of schooling, because the war – this was going on, shoot – shootouts were going on.</span> <span id="s2247">So, in Ein Karem also, there was a – a – it’s like in a valley, there was a mountain on which there was – it was called Moscow B, where the Russian nuns resided since Tsarists time.</span> <span id="s2248">They had their little houses, their little church.</span> <span id="s2249">And of course they – th-the Muslim Arabs really, were accusing them of again giving signals to the Jews, you know, just too totally ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2250">But anyway, we were used to go around the village, and nobody bothered us, but when we – we would now go, and one of us had eyeglasses, these Muslim are – I don’t know where they even came from, but anyway, they – they would – right away would ask us if we are Jews.</span> <span id="s2251">Yehudi, Yehudi?</span> <span id="s2252">Becau – and there were guns, you know.</span> <span id="s2253">Because you had eyeglasses, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s2254">But anyway, so we were pressured to – to – to be repatriated to Poland, Mother then stopped us, really insisted that we cannot do it, so about 50 of us, women with children, through this – in a red – Red Cross – really with Red Cross signs, go, during the shootouts from – we are driven to Lebanon, where there are still schools, or maybe one left.</span> <span id="s2255">Were tall like that one you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: So, again I had to catch up, because again I was half a year behind in schooling.</span> <span id="s2258">But then again, Lebanon is beautiful, beautiful.</span> <span id="s2259">Lebanon –</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: So, you were – at least there was no war going on between –</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Absolutely, was beautiful and quiet, the Mediterranean Sea, all that.</span> <span id="s2262">So, we were in Lebanon, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: And where’s – your father at this time was still –</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Germany.</span> <span id="s2267">Very few really communications, because you know, mail was not re – exactly going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: So, in Lebanon I went to – I finished equivalent to high school, you know, I graduated.</span> <span id="s2270">And again, there were very few of us left there, so Great Britain accepted us.</span> <span id="s2271">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: So this is without your father, but just because of your own status?</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: Yeah, well, they didn’t know where to take us.</span> <span id="s2274">We were in Lebanon then, not – I shouldn’t say we, but Mother was pressured to emigrate to Australia because Australia was filled with men, but no women.</span> <span id="s2275">And final – and my mother, we knew in that, then we would never be reunited with my father because Australia was not accepting men that were over 50, my father was 51.</span> <span id="s2276">So – but anyway, she also told them that I can be a housemaid anywhere, not only austr – but that was, you know, it was tough again on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Horribly.</span> <span id="s2279">But again, I’m going to emphasize that the teachers that were teaching us, and our mothers, you know, especially our – men too, of course, but mostly I was surrounded by females, it just – I – th-they were just amazing.</span> <span id="s2280">There were professors from a university even in Wilno that were teaching us, you know.</span> <span id="s2281">So, we go to England on a ship, in 40 – oh no, now it’s ’49, ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2283">That’s quite late.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: That’s four years after the wirl – war ends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2287">And in England, we end in – there are so-called hostels, where the families of – well, after the war, as I say, Great Britain accepted –</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: – the military that was not returning to Poland, and there were hostels where we live in Quonset huts, you know.</span> <span id="s2290">And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: What’s a Quonset hut?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Oh, it is a – a building that was built for – during the second World War.</span> <span id="s2293">It’s sort of made of tin, the semi-circle –</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Circular.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: A tin –</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2298">And we are in – in a camp in – near – where – oh, it was named [indecipherable] Bosworth(ph).</span> <span id="s2299">Usually these camps were – were the flyers, especially American flyers used to live, and then they were give – just left there, so we occupied them.</span> <span id="s2300">So after a while, I want to continue, because in Europe we not only have the high school, but we have two more years lytseum(ph) – lyceum.</span> <span id="s2301">So – and of course, by then you had to also have some British certificate that you did something in schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: So, I am accepted to something called Stowell Park Polish girls’ school, and it is in Quonset huts, where the American shell-shocked – and that is far away from our camp, but you know, you go by bus, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Where American shell-shocked soldiers were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Yes, pa – during the war, when – when they were, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: Okay, so the school is in such a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2308">Now it’s come back –</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: But the soldiers were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: Beautiful setting on some estate, of some lord, you know, but it’s there.</span> <span id="s2313">So I was there for about – everything is rationed, and I don’t have – I just have sandals, and the winter comes.</span> <span id="s2314">And this is when my frozen-bitten f-feet start hurting very much, almost like wounds, you know.</span> <span id="s2315">So I ask my father to send me – because by then we are in contact, send me something from Germany, and he just didn’t unders –</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: So he doesn’t come to Britain when he finds out you’re there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2318">He doesn’t, and he – there are letters that I now see exchanged, and it – it was really moth – my mother wanted him to come, and we wanted to stay in Britain, because we knew almost – you know, we went through Russia with ma – Soviet Union with many people.</span> <span id="s2319">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Oh, so there were many people from the Soviet Union who had been deported, who were in Britain, and so you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: Oh, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: – you had a circle of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Absolu – yes, absolutely true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: So, in Stowell Park, there were three girls from Lebanon, that I knew in Lebanon.</span> <span id="s2326">One of them now lives in Sherwood.</span> <span id="s2327">So, we sort of kept together.</span> <span id="s2328">In the meantime, my mother was corresponding to – with my father, and he then wrote, you know, that we – he has a sponsor in the U.S.</span> <span id="s2329">So the sponsor in U.S. then – a sponsor meant that you have to guarantee somebody’s place to live in and work.</span> <span id="s2330">You had to have guaranteed position where you worked, in factory, of course, but you had – so we then, Mother and I, I was in – in that school for one year, in ’51 by now, I think, ’50 – ’50, ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: Well, when did you – what year did you go to Britain, 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Forty-nine.</span> <span id="s2333">So yeah, ’50 - ’51.</span> <span id="s2334">So then Mother and I go to join my father in Germany, and after 12 years it was really – I mean, I can’t say it’s a shock, but it was like meeting a stranger, you know, there was this small station in Wentorf, was the name of the town, German town.</span> <span id="s2335">We get off the bus, and there is this man, we don’t know what to do with him, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: So, but anyway, you know, it – after 12 years it’s tough for anybody to get anywhere together, but – but we did.</span> <span id="s2338">It worked out, to a point.</span> <span id="s2339">But anyway, so then, we – we are in a transit camp in –</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: Together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A: – Wentorf, and of course, you have to go through numerous interrogations again.</span> <span id="s2342">Not only interroga – physical examinations, everything.</span> <span id="s2343">It took a month, or a month and a half, you know, and the – you do help in the camp, which is fine.</span> <span id="s2344">And I – the – finally we are put in front of the American representative, I think equivalent to a consul – you know, coun – someone from the American consulate, on the grounds of the camp.</span> <span id="s2345">And finally he said yes, but it’s still not certain that U.S. wants to accept us because my mother has a heart problem, so how are we going to support ourselves?</span> <span id="s2346">So, we said, well, we both will work mad – I and – and my father.</span> <span id="s2347">So finally it – we are accepted, and we then leave our – our – how many months later we left, I don’t know, about two, three months, through all this.</span> <span id="s2348">And we leave from Bremenhaven(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Bremerhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2351">On a ship called the General Macrae(ph) with other refugees from other countries too; Latvia, you know, and Estonia even – Lithuania I didn’t, but Latvia I remember, a very nice couple.</span> <span id="s2352">So then we – it’s October, the seas were rough, but we somehow made it, and we arrive in New York, and we very quickly then, within hours, get on a train, and arrive in Chicago, Dearborn station, which nonexistent.</span> <span id="s2353">They preserve the building, but that’s – I think it’s like a shopping mall there.</span> <span id="s2354">But – so we then stay with our sponsors and literally the next day, Father goes to work at Cherriads’(ph) lumber company, although he doesn’t know how to be a carpenter, or whatever it’s on – and I go to to work for Butler’s Specialty company, where there is the mean owner, not – I – I mean, he – he – he thought I was scum, but he also was very mean, I remember, because he was – I was not used for – to people who were really disrespectful to elders.</span> <span id="s2355">And this guy, I find out, is – is just awful to his uncle who is an old Jew – these were Jewish people – I mean, he was awful.</span> <span id="s2356">But anyway, so I work there, and in the meantime, the my – the director of our school in England keeps writing, continue studying, because I studied quite well, you know.</span> <span id="s2357">So I am – I try to look, but you are lost, you are the only one, you know.</span> <span id="s2358">I work in this factory, on an assembly line, and I – as I am closing the boxes, I am reciting Polish poetry.</span> <span id="s2359">But I met very nice Mexican girl there, but the Polish ladies were saying, why do you want to study, you know, it’s the – you know, just keep working, you know.</span> <span id="s2360">So I was sort of a black sheep, because I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s2361">So I start – this Polish director from the Polish school, Dr. Falinski(ph) sends me to some priest, who wants to put me in the high school, and I don’t need to go to the high school any more.</span> <span id="s2362">And then he also tells me well, there is a mission in Africa, maybe you like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2363">No.</span> <span id="s2364">So then wa – sends to another Polish organization which they tell me, why don’t you learn to type.</span> <span id="s2365">That’s it, you know.</span> <span id="s2366">And I said – I said to myself, well, I can learn how to type at home [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2367">But anyway, so we stay for a short time already, with the sponsors.</span> <span id="s2368">I work at Butler’s Specialty company.</span> <span id="s2369">And then we find a room.</span> <span id="s2370">Again, it’s all very near to the U.S. Steel Corporation, you know, where many Poles lived, and there was a Polish kind of a community there, on the south side, which is unlike, you know, the Polish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2371">So, the landlady’s name is Piney(ph) Biernatska(ph), and she’s just a – she le-learned how to write and read by herself.</span> <span id="s2372">Her husband died very early because he worked in the steel mills.</span> <span id="s2373">The air was polluted like heck there, you know, because of dust, in that time, you know.</span> <span id="s2374">It’s amazing what happened since.</span> <span id="s2375">So then I se – I – Tolek(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Your friend from Lebanon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Lebanon, and a guy with whom I was in the same classroom, start writing to me – they were in Baltimore somewhere – and saying well, you know, you have to – you should apply directly to a university because you know, they were at Johns Hopkins already, and they accept our matriculation, which was a surprise because it was – but anyway, so okay, okay, so I’m sitting, working at the factory, then I get a better job.</span> <span id="s2378">I get a job in the slaughterhouses in Wilson and company, meat company, on the sou – on the way away from us, I have to go hours before I get there.</span> <span id="s2379">I am a messenger there, okay.</span> <span id="s2380">So, the smell is horrible there.</span> <span id="s2381">I – I had to take two buses and a tramway to get there, so it took hours.</span> <span id="s2382">But anyway, I come back, and again – I one time, because we shared the bathroom with our landlady, and landlady had two si – by then one married son, and two unmarried ones, and one still lived with her.</span> <span id="s2383">And I’m in that bathroom, I am sorry to tell you, and I am looking into the wastepaper basket, and I find a – a bulletin from Illinois Institute of Technology.</span> <span id="s2384">And I don’t know any better, but I look and I say, this is near.</span> <span id="s2385">Because my zip is 17, and IIT is 16.</span> <span id="s2386">It wasn’t near.</span> <span id="s2387">In the meantime, Tolek(ph), he says well, try it.</span> <span id="s2388">We, of course, don’t have the telephone.</span> <span id="s2389">I use somebody else’s telephone.</span> <span id="s2390">And I then meet the dean of the evening school, it was called.</span> <span id="s2391">And yes, he said, yeah.</span> <span id="s2392">Oh, they know about po – our Polish schools in exile.</span> <span id="s2393">And I started then – very soon I – I worked, but I then after work from Wilson and company went to the evening school at IIT.</span> <span id="s2394">My 101 English was the first class.</span> <span id="s2395">And then for five years I then went to evening school.</span> <span id="s2396">After Wilson and company, I got a job at the savings and loan, Calumet Savings and Loan, where it’s – savings and loans were still sort of an ethnic kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: – financial institution, so they needed someone with Polish and English; some people didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s2399">So I worked there while I went for five years to the evening school, and my mother, of course, worried every – every evening because – but I – this was – at this point I would never venture to do it, but, I mean, 11 o’clock I was standing with U.S. Steel workers waiting to another bus, and all was well, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Not any more.</span> <span id="s2402">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: And that’s how you did it, that’s how you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: And then – yeah, then I transferred to the day school, and I finished it in two years, th-the undergraduate, and then they gave me teaching fellowship – teaching si – assistantship there at IIT, so – and I got my Masters there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: In what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: In business and economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2408">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: And then they gave me – they – they gave me – UFC gave me a fellowship, and so I – I have one year towards my PhD., but I – by then my mother died, and my father was losing his job, and I had to work and it was too much for me.</span> <span id="s2410">I quit after a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2412">A question that’s a little bit delicate.</span> <span id="s2413">In some ways, did you lose your father when he left for Romania, and – in 1939, and you didn’t see him for 12 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: I think so, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s2415">But it didn’t stop me from sort of really wanting to find him, to have him.</span> <span id="s2416">That’s very true.</span> <span id="s2417">He was a very bitter man towards the end, after we arrived here.</span> <span id="s2418">Very bitter, very bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: A different person than the one you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: Totally.</span> <span id="s2421">Very bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: That must have been hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: Yes, very hard.</span> <span id="s2424">That has been very hard, because I sort of idolized him, you know.</span> <span id="s2425">Everybody was having fathers coming back, they were all ha-happy, you know when they saw fathers, and here it was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: And also a disappointment for you mother for suffering so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: Oh, that’s exa – precisely.</span> <span id="s2428">I think that that’s what really was killing me, because it’s only towards the end of her life, which was – my mother died at 54.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Whoa.</span> <span id="s2430">Young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: Yes, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: So it was only – she died in ’56, so it was only five – four years.</span> <span id="s2434">Towards the end they sort of were getting along better, I thought, you know.</span> <span id="s2435">It was – nothing was – there were no quarrels, maybe it was better if there were, but th-there was a feeling that it just was not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: How sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: Mm-hm, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Well, I mean, so much had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: There is so m – mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: So much had happened to both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: And you had to hold so much in –</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: – throughout what you were going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: A tough price.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: A very tough price.</span> <span id="s2449">Have you ever been back to jeli – the lovely village that – that you were deported from?</span> <span id="s2450">The lovely town you were deported from?</span> <span id="s2451">I forget the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: Zaleszczyki.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: No, that’s now Ukraine.</span> <span id="s2455">I went twice to Poland.</span> <span id="s2456">Once in the 50s, after my mother died, and that was really emotional.</span> <span id="s2457">That was still under communists – communism, and I-I took – I flew to England, and then England – there was an Anglo-Polish li – bus lines, because many Poles would go to England to shop, the ones that could.</span> <span id="s2458">So I then arrived in England, and again, I sort of got reunited with Marisha(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: By then she had three children, and I then want – took the bus – we crossed the channel, and in Ostend we took the bus through several – several countries, you know, th-the west – th-the western countries in Europe there.</span> <span id="s2461">Ho-Holland, and so on.</span> <span id="s2462">And we then – that was very interesting, because we stood a long time at the border between East and West Germany, and there were the Russian soldiers with their little red stars.</span> <span id="s2463">And s – but then, after we crossed the border, going through East Germany, they would – they had stopped the bus once again, the East German soldiers, with machine guns, you know, how much money you have?</span> <span id="s2464">And you went through East Germany, and really, this was a depressing view, again.</span> <span id="s2465">Just depressing.</span> <span id="s2466">So then, we arrive rather late on the border between East Germany and Poland, and these were everyb – those women, everybody that was there, you know, they ha – they bought lots – they said, oh no, they’ll stop us, and then look through all of this.</span> <span id="s2467">They let us through, they didn’t look at anything.</span> <span id="s2468">But this was really emotional again.</span> <span id="s2469">Very emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Re – you know, the memory is coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yeah, very.</span> <span id="s2472">Because all of a sudden you – you – you really saw – and the ba – I must say that compared to the East German soldiers, these Polish soldiers were so nice, you know.</span> <span id="s2473">Elegant.</span> <span id="s2474">And all of a sudden, there was a storm coming, and I – there were farmers, you know, in the – and they were speaking – I her – we heard them, you know, speaking Polish.</span> <span id="s2475">They were doing something with str – you know, str – you know, st-straw –</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: With hay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: With hay, hay, right, right.</span> <span id="s2478">It was so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Those were – that’s what –</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: – you remember from that first trip.</span> <span id="s2482">Was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2486">And the second trip I – I made in the 70s, still communist.</span> <span id="s2487">The first trip they even – th-th-they – you – you had to go and register.</span> <span id="s2488">In Poznań I went to register.</span> <span id="s2489">And the guy asked me so, why didn’t I return to Poland?</span> <span id="s2490">But I told him all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: You told him the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Yeah, was very, very strange that nobod – but yeah, they would follow you on the streets at that time still.</span> <span id="s2493">The second time when I went, I didn’t feel that anybody was following me.</span> <span id="s2494">I did register, but it was a nothing – 1970s, late 1970s.</span> <span id="s2495">The second time I went because my – my one cousin I wa – th-the letters that were coming were rather strange, that he was jailed, and so on.</span> <span id="s2496">That was my uncle’s two sons, so it was again a very strange, because one was in the army, and obviously sold himself just to make his living [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2497">And the other one, I – I don’t know what was the matter, but he was in jail.</span> <span id="s2498">So I thought of helping.</span> <span id="s2499">We – we helped –</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: You helped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: – you know, the families, whether we knew them or not, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2503">Just tell me very briefly, you yourself, you got married, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: Tell me, your husband was American, or s – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s2509">After working at the savings and loan, and after getting my – what was it, my Masters, I start looking for a different job.</span> <span id="s2510">They gave me some position at the savings and loan, but the owner’s son was an idiot, excuse me, you know.</span> <span id="s2511">You know, he – he would not tell me that the customers were coming in, you know, and I don’t know what that was about.</span> <span id="s2512">But anyway, so then I got a – I started looking for a job, and got a job at the Harris bank, which still exists [indecipherable] Harris bank.</span> <span id="s2513">And again, I – I was very much surprised that the human resource person knew, oh yes, the – some doorman that had apartment went through – through experiencing the war, and he was happy now to be a doorman, which is true.</span> <span id="s2514">We would – all wanted to be free.</span> <span id="s2515">But I – so I start – they – I got the job as a commercial credit analyst.</span> <span id="s2516">What we did – what I did, there were only three women in a department of 15, and one of them was my husband, he was also a commercial – except we women wouldn’t be in any way considered to become commercial lending officers.</span> <span id="s2517">We were there to look at the work o-of all these men, their analysis of a particular request for a commercial loan, and decide what was wrong, or what – so that’s how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s2518">The first time I met him, he’s big, and I said oh, this guy looks like a true American bully – excuse me guys.</span> <span id="s2519">But he very well read, and he – he’s ve – was very – knew about that – what went on in – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: – Europe, and so on.</span> <span id="s2522">So, we first went to a Polish movie, and – because he’s interested in movies.</span> <span id="s2523">It was at Roosevelt University, and that’s how it all started.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2525">And you have how many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: A boy and a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2529">Andrea is 45, she’s a girl, and a boy, Mark, who is 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: And one –</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: And one grandchild, nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: And old man at nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2535">Have they – have your children – were they interested in your story, in your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s2537">Ye – yes.</span> <span id="s2538">When Andrea, two, three years ago, got her Masters from the Art Institute of Chicago in writing, and she wro – she started in – anyway, she started a book, but it’s not only about me, but about her relationship with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2540">But, at any rate, you talked about what you had gone through with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2542">Absolutely yes, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Yes, both of them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2546">I would like to conclude the formal part of our interview –</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: – right now.</span> <span id="s2549">Thank you very much for a – a truly, unbelievably descriptive, and very moving testimony today.</span> <span id="s2550">It’s very much appreciated, and I thank you for that.</span> <span id="s2551">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with Sabina Soltysiak Berggren, on Ju – January 30th, 2015.</span> <span id="s2552">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2555">[break] Great, I like that shot.</span> <span id="s2556">All right, so Mrs. Sabina, please tell me what is it that you are holding here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: I am holding a little suitcase that was purchased in 1939 in Vilnius, and I have kept it ever since, through all the countries that were enumerated before, and here it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: So this is what you got the summer of ’39, it was purchased then, and then when you were deported, it is what you took with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: Can you open it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: See, I even wrote my last name here, in a horrible way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: Can you focus on that?</span> <span id="s2563">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s2564">Well, a child’s handwriting.</span> <span id="s2565">It’s a child’s handwriting, yeah.</span> <span id="s2566">Very moving.</span> <span id="s2567">Would you able to – you got it?</span> <span id="s2568">Could you tilt it a little bit, so we could see the inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Higher, lower, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Fine.</span> <span id="s2571">You’re fine.</span> <span id="s2572">And you say you car – what did you carry in that suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: Well, a few photographs that I somehow – I don’t know why I put them there, but it – I – th-they are saved, and they are still somewhere.</span> <span id="s2574">And I used the back of the photographs to – to draw something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2576">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2577">You can close it.</span> <span id="s2578">And we’ll take a f – a photo of the side, you know, maybe the front side of it, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: This, or –</span></p> <p><span

up like this – yes, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: You see that – I have here my name in Farsi, or Arabic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2594">And then you have a date of 1942 on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: Now, the date here, I put – I – frankly I cannot rely very well on the dates, because I see that I messed them up.</span> <span id="s2596">When Marisha(ph) looked at it, she pointed out what was ’43 was ’42, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2597">But here it says – let me see what it says here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: I’m talking about the left hand side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Left ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: The left hand side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Oh, th-that – that is – has nothing to do with anything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Oh, okay, all right.</span> <span id="s2603">So, could we get the cover of that as well?</span> <span id="s2604">Even it’s just a plain black cover.</span> <span id="s2605">And could you turn to the first entry page?</span> <span id="s2606">Is that dated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: Yes, but as I say, it’s dated ’43, but I think it’s ’42, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s2609">If we could hold that up.</span> <span id="s2610">We focus in on that.</span> <span id="s2611">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2612">Do I see some photographs down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2614">I just wanted you to sh – I wanted you to see the photograph of my first class in the camp number one, near Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: That’s that.</span> <span id="s2616">Okay, if you hold it up like this –</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s2691">No, it has to be ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: In 1938.</span> <span id="s2693">So, a year before everything happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: Right.</span></p>

these types of documents before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s2700">This is the first time I’ve seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s2702">And it – they refer to – I see your mother, which is a DP registration record.</span> <span id="s2703">Can you tell me a little bit – when you look through them, what do they say to you, these documents?</span> <span id="s2704">That one, and the others.</span> <span id="s2705">You can take it down and flip through it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: That they are very accurate.</span> <span id="s2707">I’m surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: I really am.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: What are they accurate about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: Well, where we were.</span> <span id="s2712">They – they – the year that – where we were.</span> <span id="s2713">I – I – I – I’m astounded.</span> <span id="s2714">Who keeps this?</span> <span id="s2715">How – how did they get into the – the – this registry.</span> <span id="s2716">Well, I know it’s displaced persons, but when did they collect all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: After the war.</span> <span id="s2720">It looks like most of these are documents after the war, from – they are from the international tracing service.</span> <span id="s2721">Do they have a value for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: Yes, because I – I’ll have to per – really look at them more carefully, but it just comes back what – what I believed was – is true, and here it is Vandorf(ph) resettlement center, you know, for example, you know.</span> <span id="s2723">And it – that – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: So it substantiates your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: Yes, in a way, yeah – well, in a way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: Not in a way, yes.</span> <span id="s2728">Unbelievable, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: Do you think that – do you – this service, and these – this archive is available through – a digitized copy of the entire archive is at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and people can give requests to find out if they have family documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: Oh, very –</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: What do you think – do you think it’s something that is valuable for people to know and have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2733">You know, after a while you sort of – I don’t want to say we – you lose your identity, but you think to yourself – you – you want to connect with others with similar experiences, and when you go from – when the – the way we went from country to country, here and there, you lose – you lose relationships.</span> <span id="s2734">And then you try to reestablish them, but it’s very difficult, because years go in between, and it’s totally different when you were 10, and now you are 20, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2735">And there were so many – you know, you had friends, but they all disappeared, because some went to Australia, some went here.</span> <span id="s2736">I don’t remember some of their names.</span> <span id="s2737">And it’s – it also somehow affects you, it seems to me, where you just look – lose connection with people that you – you really were close to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: And when you see this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: And when you see this, you know, it sort of comes with, oh yeah, I really did exist, it really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: So it’s not only – it’s not only documentary proof against those who would deny your story, it is documentary proof to yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2744">Yeah, you do – you probably don’t need that proof, but it’s good to see that it’s here, tha-that someone really took the time to put it all together, and oh yeah, here I am, yeah.</span> <span id="s2745">And in [indecipherable] Beirut.</span> <span id="s2746">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2747">Yes, very much.</span> <span id="s2748">Very ex – amazing amount of ra – from what I see, very accurate documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2750">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Okay, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
