were born, when and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">EP: Certainly.</span> <span id="s4">I was born in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands on July 13th, 1928.</span> <span id="s5">Both my parents, Moritz Heinrich and Flora, were born in Rotterdam as well.</span> <span id="s6">My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s7">He had a wholesale business in carpeting, in furniture textiles and in curtains.</span> <span id="s8">We lived in Rotterdam in the residential area at the northern edge of the city.</span> <span id="s9">I had two older brothers, both who are now deceased.</span> <span id="s10">The oldest died in Bergen-Belsen at the age of 23.</span> <span id="s11">My second older brother survived with me and died in 1978.</span> <span id="s12">He never came to the United States.</span> <span id="s13">He stayed in Holland after the war, married there and had children.</span> <span id="s14">I would classify our family in a sociological sense as middle-class, perhaps slightly tending towards the upper-edge.</span> <span id="s15">I use standards here.</span> <span id="s16">We had an automobile, we had two servants.</span> <span id="s17">These are several of the measurements that one would use.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">EG: Was there a large Jewish community in Rotterdam at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">EP: Rotterdam, if I remember correctly, had a Jewish community between 14,000 to 16,000 people.</span> <span id="s20">These figures are somewhat approximate.</span> <span id="s21">I can’t be entirely certain.</span> <span id="s22">My understanding is that, after World War II, less than 200 survived of that community.</span> <span id="s23">The Dutch-Jewish community in general was very badly devastated.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">EG: Did your family experience antisemitism before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EP: Well, let me begin personally, since I was very young when the war began; that is when the Dutch [Germans] came to Holland on the 10th of May of 1940, I was not quite 12 years old, so that my only recollections would be rather narrow, but I do not recall any incident that had antisemitism affecting me personally.</span> <span id="s26">I went to public school.</span> <span id="s27">I had gone in fact to nursery school before the first grade of elementary school called a Freugel school and I had then gone to elementary school, and I don’t recall anything.</span> <span id="s28">Nor so I recall my parents ever mentioning antisemitism, but again it may have been because I was simply too young.</span> <span id="s29">We did belong to one of the two major synagogues in Holland.</span> <span id="s30">We were not particularly observant.</span> <span id="s31">We did go to synagogue for the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s32">We were perhaps rather liberal.</span> <span id="s33">My parents regarded themselves as liberals.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">EG: Did you go to Hebrew school or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EP: I had training.</span> <span id="s36">Both my brothers and I were trained for Bar Mitzvah but we...this was done by a private teacher coming to our house.</span> <span id="s37">We never went, I certainly didn’t, and I am fairly sure neither did my brothers ever go to a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s38">All three of us had Bar Mitzvah...I had Bar Mitzvah in 1941, that is, before we were deported.</span> <span id="s39">All three of us read portions of the Torah, on the Bimah but I must say, looking back, that Jewish education in Holland was very inferior.</span> <span id="s40">We were drilled in the Hebrew part to read, we received a smattering of Jewish history, and that is about it.</span> <span id="s41">The lesson would be for maybe two or three years once a week at home.</span> <span id="s42">Compared to what my children received in this country, it was certainly very inadequate.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">EG: So there was no organized Hebrew School like we have here?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">EP: Not that I am aware of.</span> <span id="s45">The problem in Holland was that there was neither a Reformed or a Conservative Judaism.</span> <span id="s46">One either had to belong to an Orthodox synagogue or there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">EG: I see.</span> <span id="s48">So, your parents provided it for you privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">EP: Yes, they provided it.</span> <span id="s50">And, I remember the Hebrew instructor I had very well.</span> <span id="s51">He later on became the chief, later on, I mean after 1945, became the Chief Rabbi of Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s52">His name was Melamed which, of course, means teacher in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s53">But, looking back on it, as I said, it was really very inadequate.</span> <span id="s54">And the result is that my Hebrew today is really very inadequate or insufficient because I feel that the training was not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">EG: Well, that was the culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">EP: It was the culture at the time, and because if one’s parents were very observant, one would have gone, not to what today in this country one regards as Hebrew school, but to a cheder which would be in place of the regular public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">EG: Well, I get the picture, it was either Orthodox or on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EP: Well yes, but even so the synagogues were all eventually Orthodox because the bimah was in the center of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EG: So, it was a Sephardic service?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">EP: No, no it was not.</span> <span id="s61">Sephardic, the only Sephardic synagogue that I am aware of was in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s62">This is Ashkenazi, but the bimah was in the center and the women were upstairs.</span> <span id="s63">This was a very historic synagogue that we went to in Rotterdam and the building went right back to the middle of the 18th century.</span> <span id="s64">It was right on the river where the [unclear] was, and it was unfortunately destroyed in the bombing in May 1940.</span> <span id="s65">Both major synagogues, the other one being the more modern that is from the 19th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">EG: It sounds very interesting.</span> <span id="s67">Are there any pictures of this available?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">EP: Yes, as a matter of fact I do have pictures, I have upstairs.</span> <span id="s69">I have a book of the Rotterdam Jewish community and a relative of mine in California has a little Delft blue tile of the outside of this.</span> <span id="s70">I have a book of photographs that was published some years ago, that a cousin of mine sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EG: Yes, that sounds very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">EP: I can show it to you afterwards, if you like.</span> <span id="s73">But of course, the text is in Dutch and not in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s74">But the synagogue, now the synagogue that I had my Bar Mitzvah in in 1941 was much smaller.</span> <span id="s75">It was really a chapel in the Jewish old-age home.</span> <span id="s76">Because the two major synagogues had been destroyed in the bombing which destroyed and leveled so much in the center of Rotterdam and has become of course one of the prime examples of terror bombing by the Germans in the early part of the war.</span> <span id="s77">Like Coventry, like Belgrade.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">EG: Yes.</span> <span id="s79">Apparently you still lived there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">EP: We lived in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s81">We lived and I have some very vivid recollections of that bombing, because we lived through it.</span> <span id="s82">A bomb fell outside our house, a block up, and our house caught on fire because of it.</span> <span id="s83">An entire block up in flames because of incendiary bombs.</span> <span id="s84">And, I remember later on in the same day of the bombing...it must have been now the 13th or 14th of May, we manned pumps because the water system had been bombed and there was no pressure in the lines.</span> <span id="s85">About a block from us was a very fine villa, with a thatched roof and it was in a little park where there was a pond, and the thatched roof was burning, people were carrying out all sorts of valuables out of the house, and here I was with other men and I was only yet a boy, manning a hand-pump, to pump water out of the pond to pour water or spray water on the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">EG: That was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EP: No, no that was in 1940 during the invasion.</span> <span id="s88">Rotterdam, you see, was a key defense area in what was called Fortress Holland.</span> <span id="s89">And the Dutch had flooded the lower end.</span> <span id="s90">And the Dutch army received a German ultimatum to surrender Rotterdam or they would be bombed.</span> <span id="s91">If my knowledge is correct, the surrender, in fact, had been announced.</span> <span id="s92">The Dutch said they would surrender the fortress or fortification.</span> <span id="s93">The bombs had already been sent and apparently missed the signal being recalled and in a short bombardment the center of Rotterdam was completely wiped out.</span> <span id="s94">I have an entire album of photographs of that as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">EG: At that particular point there was no difference between the Jewish and Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">EP: Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s97">In these early days of the war, after all, there was no ghetto or anything like that in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s98">There were Dutch and this is really a quite separate story, because Rotterdam had been flooded for over four days, when the war began on the 10th of May, Rhine barges opened up and the German soldiers came out and were smuggled into Holland.</span> <span id="s99">Paratroopers were dropped in the middle of Rotterdam to seize the bridges.</span> <span id="s100">And there was street fighting for two, three days and because the Dutch army put up a very good defense, the Germans had failed to capture Rotterdam and so we were in the midst of all of this.</span> <span id="s101">We thought of fleeing south.</span> <span id="s102">My father had a car and the reason that we didn’t and - now of course it appears extremely foolish - was, my father said “Well I don’t have enough money on me.</span> <span id="s103">I have to go to the bank and get money, but the banks are closed and there is no way to get money.”</span> <span id="s104">Of course we should have just got into the car and fled south.</span> <span id="s105">We might have been able to get to Spain.</span> <span id="s106">Well, we didn’t do this.</span> <span id="s107">We stayed put.</span> <span id="s108">I remember that in the midst of the bombing, when the bombs were falling, we ran out of our house, and ran down the street to go to a safer place.</span> <span id="s109">I remember that after Rotterdam surrendered, a block away, there was a very fine liquor store and in fear of German soldiers coming and drinking alcohol and going absolutely wild, that every bottle in the shop was smashed, and that the floor of the place was literally filled with wine and liquor.</span> <span id="s110">You could stand there and could smell it, and everything in there was being smashed so it wouldn’t fall in German hands.</span> <span id="s111">A neighbor of ours who had quite a wine stock poured it all down the toilet because, again, he didn’t want German soldiers to get drunk.</span> <span id="s112">People do crazy things, under circumstances like that.</span> <span id="s113">These are things that I recall that come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EG: There must have been things that made a big impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">EP: Well, another thing, of course, immediately after the bombing, so evident is the concussion.</span> <span id="s116">Everywhere it knocked out windows, in spite of the fact that we had taped the windows.</span> <span id="s117">The streets were literally so littered with glass that one was walking on glass all the time.</span> <span id="s118">Amazingly none of us was seriously injured by flying glass.</span> <span id="s119">Fragments can kill people.</span> <span id="s120">None of this was, which was in itself amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EG: Must have been some type of miracle, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">EP: In our own house we had a large flat over a store, a flat that was two stories.</span> <span id="s123">A number of plaster ceilings had fallen down because of the concussion of the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">EG: And all your family was together at home at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">EP: All of the family was together.</span> <span id="s126">As a matter of fact, we happened to be guests at that moment to an aunt and uncle who lived in Finland and had returned about 5 days earlier, when the war broke out in Finland, for a spring holiday, and who were now caught.</span> <span id="s127">There was a sister of my father and her husband who were now caught in Holland and they never did get out.</span> <span id="s128">My uncle died during the war and my aunt was deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s129">So, they were staying with us, and we were all together and we stayed all together until August 1942.</span> <span id="s130">In that period, a number of things happened.</span> <span id="s131">Shall I continue to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">EG: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EP: We moved in probably July or August 1940 to a somewhat smaller but much more modern flat in another part of Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s134">I don’t quite know why we moved, whether it was somewhat cheaper in rent or whether our apartment or our flat had been too damaged, but I was too young to be told that.</span> <span id="s135">But we moved, and at first we continued to go to the public schools.</span> <span id="s136">Looking back now and understanding better, very gradually measures began to be taken that began to separate the Jewish community, or the Dutch-Jewish citizens from the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s137">One of the things that happened and affected me personally in 1941 was that it became...it was forbidden, from the new school year 1941-1942 on for Jewish children to go to public school.</span> <span id="s138">This was one measure, as a historian I know, following the Nazi policy in Germany where Jewish schools had to be set up.</span> <span id="s139">These were not religious schools; these were copies of the public schools.</span> <span id="s140">Thus, in 1941-42 I went to a Jewish high school, that meant all the students were Jewish and all the faculty was Jewish.</span> <span id="s141">Indeed, we had an outstanding faculty.</span> <span id="s142">And we met in a barn building, a sort of rump of a building that had survived around which there was nothing.</span> <span id="s143">It could have been a high school, part of it which remained standing after the bombing.</span> <span id="s144">I’ll never forget that year because it was in many ways a very stimulating year.</span> <span id="s145">Jewish children from all over Rotterdam had to go to that one high school and I think I was there a year in the first or second grade of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">EG: Were you still allowed to see your non-Jewish friends that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">EP: Yes, I used to play.</span> <span id="s148">There was no problem with that.</span> <span id="s149">Sometime in either late 1941 or early ‘42, I cannot put my finger on that, there came a new restriction that, of course, affected all of us, and that was the wearing of the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s150">Where we could now no longer go out without being marked.</span> <span id="s151">In all of this, the Dutch population was affected, but I can’t say from personal recollection to what extent.</span> <span id="s152">Naturally, since I was going to school with other Jewish children, my friends were now mainly Jewish.</span> <span id="s153">Another restriction that I recall that became, as I will explain later, very serious that sometime in the early summer of 1942, the hours to shop for groceries were restricted and we could only go certain hours of the day and, apparently, home deliveries of groceries, which was a very normal fashion or a normal practice in Europe before World War II, was also forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">EG: To Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">EP: To Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">EG: Were you restricted to the stores where you could shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">EP: That I do not know.</span> <span id="s158">I only know about the hours.</span> <span id="s159">I don’t think it included the shops.</span> <span id="s160">But I can’t answer that for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">EG: Were food articles rationed at this time, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">EP: Some rationing had started, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EG: For everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">EP: For everybody.</span> <span id="s165">But again it wasn’t yet too serious.</span> <span id="s166">We were eating quite well.</span> <span id="s167">There was as yet no deprivation of any sort of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">EG: But Jewish people couldn’t shop as much as...?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">EP: Well, apparently it began in July or June of 1942, restrictions were imposed, and this was very important to me because it eventually affected the manner of food delivery at home.</span> <span id="s170">Our groceries used to be delivered and it led my mother to violate the law.</span> <span id="s171">And I’ll explain in a minute that this became serious.</span> <span id="s172">Something else that I was going to mention, in terms of restrictions... oh yes, my father had, as I said earlier, a wholesale business, and at some time during 1942, in the first 6 months, suddenly a man arrived at our door - my father had his office at his house although he had a warehouse, a wholesale warehouse which was separate - a man arrived at our door who informed us that he had been appointed by the German authorities as trustee of my father’s business; der Treuhnder, is, of course, a German term.</span> <span id="s173">This was part again of the German occupation policy of gradually taking over all Jewish businesses and, although my father’s business was not very large, simply going down the list had led eventually to him being appointed.</span> <span id="s174">And in effect, he took over my father’s business.</span> <span id="s175">I remember my father’s panic and deep concern about this.</span> <span id="s176">One other aspect of our gradually restricting circle of life was that sometime in, probably 1941, or early 1942, my father sold his car.</span> <span id="s177">He, apparently...the car, being a young boy the car meant a great deal to me was, I think, a 1938 Chevrolet, but he either felt that he could no longer use it, gasoline, of course, was one of the things that was restricted.</span> <span id="s178">Anyway, he sold that.</span> <span id="s179">But, beyond that, things weren’t too restricted yet, for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">EG: Did your father still work in his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">EP: Well, he still tried to carry on, but once the trustee had been appointed, he really was no longer very much in charge.</span> <span id="s182">This came relatively, just before we were deported.</span> <span id="s183">We were one of the first families deported from Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s184">This is something specific that I will get to in a minute.</span> <span id="s185">There is one other thing that I..</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">there are several other things that I want to mention until I come to what happened to our family specifically.</span> <span id="s188">We lived fairly close to the new zoo in Rotterdam and there in the winter of 1941 and early 1942, the Dutch-Nazi leader Anton Muzet came to speak.</span> <span id="s189">I decided that I wanted to go to see him.</span> <span id="s190">That is, stand on the street and see him drive by.</span> <span id="s191">Well, I did this and then went home to tell my father, who of course, gave me a thorough lecture about how could I have done this.</span> <span id="s192">Well, I was just interested.</span> <span id="s193">I was not politically conscious.</span> <span id="s194">But here was someone who somehow played a role.</span> <span id="s195">So I saw him.</span> <span id="s196">It was of no significance whatsoever.</span> <span id="s197">And now, sometime in the summer of 1942, it was either June or July, I remember my father came home in a terrible panic because there had been some sort of roundup of Jewish young men.</span> <span id="s198">The word we used for this was an Italian word it was razzia.</span> <span id="s199">And my father was terribly upset, he had his older son who was now 21 years old, and he was terribly worried about my older brother.</span> <span id="s200">This put now definite fear, if not panic into our lives.</span> <span id="s201">And, as I said, this must have been in June or July, probably in July 1942.</span> <span id="s202">There was also then, I do know this, rumors that we would be deported.</span> <span id="s203">And my parents were aware of this and the rumors were...that deportations would take place to Poland.</span> <span id="s204">And I remember very specifically my father saying, “I will never allow this to happen to us.”</span> <span id="s205">And as a result, and I did participate in this, we began to make plans with Christian friends, and we had some contact apparently with the underground, yes okay, I’ll mention that it was the underground, that we would flee.</span> <span id="s206">We would take what might be called an underground train to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s207">We had plans.</span> <span id="s208">We were going to take the train to south of Holland to Brabant.</span> <span id="s209">We would bicycle across the Belgian frontier.</span> <span id="s210">We would be aided.</span> <span id="s211">We would go through Belgium into northern France, the Maquis would somehow get us over the Jura into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s212">We had plans.</span> <span id="s213">My father had accumulated some money and we had made contacts.</span> <span id="s214">Do you want me to stop, do you need to...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">EG: No, I just need to watch the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EP: I have to back up here.</span> <span id="s217">Our contact -</span></p> <p><span id="s218">EG: Who is the Maquis?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">EP: The Maquis is the French underground.</span> <span id="s220">This was the Dutch, the Dutch had contacted the Belgians, the Belgians would have contacted the French.</span> <span id="s221">One of the reasons in fact, that we were able to do this - my oldest brother had graduated from high school, I guess in 1939 or 1940, and had been studying chemistry with a chemist, a trained chemist from Hague who it turned out was an officer in the Dutch army and who had such underground contacts.</span> <span id="s222">In fact, this is one of the tragedies.</span> <span id="s223">He offered my brother, my oldest brother, a chance to stay in England.</span> <span id="s224">In those days apparently in the lake in northern Holland, in the province of Friesland, these planes used to land at night and pick up people, and my brother was given the chance to escape.</span> <span id="s225">My father would have none of this.</span> <span id="s226">In those early days, he felt that it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s227">Later on, of course, he deeply regretted this.</span> <span id="s228">But, anyway, we did have some contacts through this individual, and I do not know of all the details of this, but I know that we had plans apparently in August of 1942 to try to make a run for it.</span> <span id="s229">It was dangerous, we were aware of this.</span> <span id="s230">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s231">EG: But, this was something you could do as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">EP: We planned to do it as a family.</span> <span id="s233">There was still sufficient freedom in 1942.</span> <span id="s234">In 1941 as a family we had taken a vacation together in Brabant, which is in southern Holland on a farm.</span> <span id="s235">We could still take the train, we could still go by bicycle on long trips.</span> <span id="s236">There were no restrictions.</span> <span id="s237">And as I said, we were a family of boys and ready to do this.</span> <span id="s238">And then, in the second week of August, I can be fairly specific on that, around the 7th or 10th of August 1942, my parents received a summons to come to the police station in Rotterdam, the headquarters of the police.</span> <span id="s239">This, I don’t need to tell you, is a very unusual thing, because as law-abiding Dutch citizens we never had any contact with the police.</span> <span id="s240">We had no idea...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">EG: I see, it must have been something.</span> <span id="s242">Wait a minute, I want to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Tape one, side two: Long pause before tape starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">EP: This summons to the police was, of course, unusual.</span> <span id="s245">My parents went together and in the late afternoon my father came back alone.</span> <span id="s246">My mother had been arrested, and had been held in prison.</span> <span id="s247">Now, when I tell you the reason for this, it’s quite incredible.</span> <span id="s248">About two houses down from us, actually an apartment house, lived the Inspector of Police.</span> <span id="s249">He turned out to be a Nazi.</span> <span id="s250">And, he observed that my mother had had some groceries delivered to her house, and this was illegal.</span> <span id="s251">This is something that she had done all her life, as a housewife.</span> <span id="s252">I can’t tell you if it was a Jewish grocery or non-Jewish grocery, I doubt it was a Jewish one, but probably one that she had done business with for maybe 15 years.</span> <span id="s253">She had called as usual to order something, quite forgetting that it was no longer allowed, and the manager and owner had probably said this was an old customer, and had probably not paid attention either, but the delivery had been observed.</span> <span id="s254">We had registered as Jews.</span> <span id="s255">I have to go back here again to 1940.</span> <span id="s256">On of the first acts of Dutch occupation, or the German occupation authorities, had been to require all Jews to register, and as good law-abiding citizens, we had done so.</span> <span id="s257">Terrible mistake.</span> <span id="s258">Of course, now, hindsight.</span> <span id="s259">So we were listed, it was known that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s260">Anyway, my mother was kept arrested.</span> <span id="s261">This meant, of course, that we were now caught.</span> <span id="s262">We could not leave.</span> <span id="s263">Our whole plan to go to Switzerland, on the underground connection had fallen to the ground.</span> <span id="s264">About...I may be a little wrong on the date because I think my mother was in prison for four weeks, and so the arrest may have actually taken place in late July or early August.</span> <span id="s265">I do know that we were deported on the 22nd of August, and I think that she was in prison for four weeks so that I may have been somewhat a few days off.</span> <span id="s266">Anyway, around the 20th of August, two police inspectors came to our house and informed us that we could be reunited with our mother, but that the only way we could do this is that we would have to go with her to a camp in Holland.</span> <span id="s267">This camp was called Westerbork.</span> <span id="s268">Westerbork in fact had a prewar history.</span> <span id="s269">This is of no great renown to the Dutch.</span> <span id="s270">German refugees, Jewish refugees, coming from Nazi Germany into prewar Holland had temporarily been housed there.</span> <span id="s271">It was in the province of Drenten in northeastern Holland, very close to the Dutch frontier, in a fairly uninhabited part of Holland.</span> <span id="s272">We were told that we would have to be ready in something like 24 to 48 hours to join her, and we would be taken by Dutch police, on the train to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">EG: During the month that your mother was in prison, were you or your father allowed to see her?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">EP: I know I didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s275">My father may have gone to see her, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s276">No action was ever taken against her, that is, no court procedures were ever held for anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">EG: And of course there was no possibility to...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">EP: No possibility to do anything.</span> <span id="s279">We didn’t know what this... We did become aware of the charges, but there was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s280">Just wait and find whether she would be released or whatever.</span> <span id="s281">And, then, when the police came, I remember this very specifically, it was rather in a vicious way that we were told that my mother would be freed - they had good news but we would have to join her, to be deported to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s282">Now, I do know that the first round of deportations had just then started, and what happened was that the Dutch post office sent notices to people and there was some Jewish families living around us, who were then informed by mail that they had to arrive at a certain date, with only that which they could carry, at a collection center and they would be put on a train to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s283">But we were a special case.</span> <span id="s284">I never did quite find out why.</span> <span id="s285">Anyway, on the 24th of August, 1942, we all came to the Dutch police station, the headquarters of the police in Rotterdam and there were united with my mother and the next morning we were put under special guard on the train.</span> <span id="s286">It was not a special train, it was a regular scheduled train to Utrecht and from Utrecht I think we made a connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">EG: So it was the Dutch police...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">EP: The Dutch police, right.</span> <span id="s289">And as a matter of fact, looking back on it, when we changed trains in Utrecht they were so lax that if I had run away then, I could have easily escaped.</span> <span id="s290">I could have managed without any difficulty to run away.</span> <span id="s291">They were very pleasant about all of this, they were in no way cruel.</span> <span id="s292">They delivered us to...</span></p> <p><span id="s293">EG: Were there any Germans involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">EP: Not in transfer until we got to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s295">That was a different situation.</span> <span id="s296">That was guarded by the Germans, as far as I remember, but, again, when we arrived in Westerbork it was very early in the whole process of deportation.</span> <span id="s297">And the first thing that was done in Westerbork, I remember that, was to build a railroad through.</span> <span id="s298">I don’t recall how we were taken, probably by truck, from the railroad station near Westerbork.</span> <span id="s299">But, while I was at Westerbork, a spur line was built so that trains could come right into the camp, and it is that the entire deportation from Holland took place, because Westerbork became, to use the German phrase, SS Polizei Deutschlage.</span> <span id="s300">It became a transit.</span> <span id="s301">And, we were one of the first arrivals and what happens, then, is a rather unusual story, because, instead of being deported in late August or early September to Poland, we managed to hold on, to hang on, to stay in Westerbork from August 1942 until February 1944.</span> <span id="s302">And we saw, in fact, virtually the entire Dutch-Jewish community pass before us, including some of our relatives, including my 83 year old grandfather, and once or twice, we ourselves were on the point of deportation, and then we were pulled out of the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Now, this gets a little complicated, and I’m not sure that I remember all of the details.</span> <span id="s304">Anyway, very shortly after we arrived in Westerbork, my mother was found to be ill.</span> <span id="s305">I cannot tell you if this was partly feigned or real, but she was sent to a regular hospital in Groningen which was the university hospital in Groningen which is the capital of the province of Groningen in the northeastern part of Holland, just north of.</span> <span id="s306">And she stayed in that hospital from early September 1942 until February 1944, so that my mother all of this time, maybe pulled some strings there and was not in Westerbork at all, and that was one way that we managed to hang on.</span> <span id="s307">And there were other ways.</span> <span id="s308">Because we arrived so early in Westerbork, all of us got jobs there in the camp bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s309">My father became, I don’t know what to call it, a registrar or the manager of one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s310">My brothers did something.</span> <span id="s311">I don’t recall what.</span> <span id="s312">I became a messenger boy, but I had a marvelous title and even an arm band.</span> <span id="s313">The name was Ordinance.</span> <span id="s314">And, in the process, we became very well known in the camp.</span> <span id="s315">We made, of course, connections, political connections.</span> <span id="s316">The interesting thing was, there was an office in that camp headed by an elderly gentleman, German-Jewish, who had been there apparently from the pre-war era, who was sort of a liaison with the Germans.</span> <span id="s317">His name was Vechtel and I became an Ordinance in Bureau Vechtel.</span> <span id="s318">I haven’t the slightest idea what Dr. Vechtel did.</span> <span id="s319">He had a doctor’s title, but I ran messages and I was all over the camp.</span> <span id="s320">I knew when a new transport was arriving.</span> <span id="s321">I knew when a train came in, that a train would go to the east.</span> <span id="s322">Usually when it became fairly systematized, it amounted to a thousand people a week that were sent on the train.</span> <span id="s323">Gradually, as these transports became systematized and the railroad spur had been built, the SS became more prominent in the administration of the camp.</span> <span id="s324">Nevertheless, security in the camp was fairly lax.</span> <span id="s325">And, I remember once or twice being sent out of the camp to a nearby place, outside the barbed wire and I just walked out and I was not stopped.</span> <span id="s326">Again, I could have escaped but it never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s327">Perhaps because, perhaps I was too young; perhaps because we felt fairly secure.</span> <span id="s328">Again...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">EG: Now this Westerbork was a transit lager.</span> <span id="s330">It wasn’t a ghetto where people stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">EP: It was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s332">People stayed in barracks.</span> <span id="s333">Although men and women were separated, they saw each other all day.</span> <span id="s334">There was a lot of registration.</span> <span id="s335">When you came in, you had to list what you had with you, what you’d left behind.</span> <span id="s336">There was a whole outfit in Holland, that after people had been deported, emptied out these homes and it became a very profitable business.</span> <span id="s337">But I only know this by hearsay.</span> <span id="s338">And, let me say, too, that while food was not plentiful in Westerbork, it was sufficient, and I will admit, I am not ashamed that I became one of the specialists at somehow finding food or plainly stealing it.</span> <span id="s339">I became excellent.</span> <span id="s340">I was very good at going into the kitchens in the food supply and managing to scare up extra rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">EG: Did you live with your brothers and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">EP: Yes, I lived with my brothers.</span> <span id="s343">We were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">EG: And your mother was in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">EP: My mother was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">EG: Otherwise she would have been separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">EP: She would have been in a separate barrack.</span> <span id="s348">I also recall that toward the end, when things began to slow down, and there was more space, we had something like a little apartment in camp.</span> <span id="s349">We were all together.</span> <span id="s350">But my memory of that is very vague.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">EG: When your mother was in that hospital, outside of the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">EP: Oh, this was quite a distance away.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">EG: Could you see her?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">EP: Once, we went to visit but that involved a 2-3 hour bus trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">EG: Could you have escaped at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">EP: Yes, we could have, but I think we probably went under some sort of escort.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">EG: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s358">I guess you really wouldn’t have gotten too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">EP: Well, that depends.</span> <span id="s360">I was young.</span> <span id="s361">I spoke, of course, the language...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EG: I mean your father and brothers...</span></p> <p><span id="s363">EP: That again was it.</span> <span id="s364">I mean to leave, somehow, the family, if I had been older, more organized, or if I had known what was in store... Again, there was only once an incident that I now recall which should be mentioned here.</span> <span id="s365">The commander of the camp, these were the grne polizei, I think probably the SS, was a man by the name of Genecker.</span> <span id="s366">He was in prison in Germany after the war, and they tried to try him again.</span> <span id="s367">Anyway, we had a sort of parade or drill area where a group of prisoners, deportees, had been lined up and during one of these assemblies - I don’t quite know the purpose of why the people were standing there - people tried not so much to protest as to argue with Genecker that they should not be deported.</span> <span id="s368">And he spoke to them in German which most of us were able to handle and he sort of lost his temper and said, “Nein, nein, sie gehen in gaz.”</span> <span id="s369">[You are going to be gassed.]</span> <span id="s370">We...while I heard this, the significance of this never made an impact on me.</span> <span id="s371">This was 1942-43...general knowledge of Auschwitz and, of course, the execution and gassing of people was not known.</span> <span id="s372">If there would have been knowledge, if there would have been knowledge of what really happened to people in Poland, I suspect that there would have been far more protest.</span> <span id="s373">People went on the whole peaceably.</span> <span id="s374">They thought we were being resettled.</span> <span id="s375">I remember one group of young Zionists marching to the train to be deported and singing the “Hatikvah”.</span> <span id="s376">That was impressive.</span> <span id="s377">I also remember very distinctly in September 1942, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services in Westerbork which was held in the barrack, where we were surrounded by the iron bedsteads, 2 and 3 high, and that either one of my brothers or my father said, “Well, this is one High Holiday service that we won’t forget.”</span> <span id="s378">Now, the fairly long period that we spent in Westerbork created probably a false sense of security.</span> <span id="s379">We thought we were going to be able to hang on, and as I said, a couple of times when, there weren’t enough people, because of the quota, a certain number of people had to go each week, could not be filled, then the Germans would resort to rounding up what might be called the more permanent staff of camp.</span> <span id="s380">Nevertheless, we had really managed loopholes [unclear] to be pulled out again [unclear] the selection process.</span> <span id="s381">It’s obvious now, although it wasn’t obvious to me at the time, that by the beginning of 1944 they were beginning to run out of people.</span> <span id="s382">I mean Holland was virtually free of Jews.</span> <span id="s383">There were, of course, Jews underground.</span> <span id="s384">Some of my cousins who survived in the underground, but aunts and uncles and a grandmother, these had been underground, and they had been caught and had been sent to Westerbork and we had all seen them go on the train.</span> <span id="s385">Now, we also had some contact with people outside the camp.</span> <span id="s386">We could send letters, we could have some foodstuff sent to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">EG: Did you get any information about what was going on in the Western world at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">EP: No, not very much.</span> <span id="s389">Of course, before we were deported, Hitler had gone to Russia.</span> <span id="s390">The invasion of Normandy would not take place until we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s391">But the last half of ‘42 and ‘43, well we may have gotten some warnings.</span> <span id="s392">There were some radios in the camp, I do remember that vaguely, and we may have known, but I don’t recall now, the landing in Africa or the invasion of Sicily.</span> <span id="s393">I was still fairly young.</span> <span id="s394">I was 14 or 15, and the political news didn’t interest us that much.</span> <span id="s395">Or at least me, that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">EG: And, as you said, you felt sort of in a false sense of security.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">EP: Yes, a false sense of security.</span> <span id="s398">I knew my way around the camp.</span> <span id="s399">I never, incidentally, went to school.</span> <span id="s400">There were some attempts to organize a school in the camp, but that failed, and I was then too free and too wild.</span> <span id="s401">The whole...one really should make a study of what the relaxation of standards and civilized behavior does on young people.</span> <span id="s402">I was something of a wild devil.</span> <span id="s403">I took all sorts of chances especially in finding my way around, and, literally, to use the word of the time, “liberating” food supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EG: That was part of the German plan to disrupt...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">EP: Yes, to disrupt the structure of life.</span> <span id="s406">Yes, so I never went to school in that period in Westerbork and I was sort of growing up rather wild.</span> <span id="s407">Anyway...oh, I know what I wanted to get to.</span> <span id="s408">My father had some business contacts and had apparently arranged, I cannot tell you how, that we would be in a rather select group of Jews that would be deported to a special camp.</span> <span id="s409">The basis of this was, so it may have in fact been made up, since my father was an importer and exporter he had a wholesale business, he had done business with England, with Italy, that, if the Germans won the war we could be exchanged for foreign exchange.</span> <span id="s410">He had a sister in America... apparently the Germans had bought this idea that he was a fairly important businessman and could be exchanged for scarce foreign exchange.</span> <span id="s411">How we got on that list, how we managed this I do not know, but it was achieved.</span> <span id="s412">By late January, early February, in 1944, my mother was sent back from the hospital to Westerbork and this was probably an indication that our days were now numbered, although again this is now somewhat vague in my memory.</span> <span id="s413">Anyway, we were deported in February, I can’t give you the exact date, in 1944, but we were not sent to Auschwitz, we were sent on a special train to Bergen-Belsen, which is, of course, in northwestern Germany near Tsela, on the Luneberg heath.</span> <span id="s414">It was a rather special camp.</span> <span id="s415">It was not, in the traditional sense of the word, an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s416">Here there were indeed several different camps together.</span> <span id="s417">There were Russian prisoners of war, there were French prisoners of war, in separate camps, and then there was this group of Dutch Jews and there may have been some other French or Belgian Jews I am not too clear, yes, there must have been, because of the train later on.</span> <span id="s418">These were all select Jews who apparently they had special plans for.</span> <span id="s419">In fact, now that I recall, it is from that camp in Bergen-Belsen that later on in 1944, two small contingents of Jews were allowed to go to Palestine, because - how this was arranged I do not know - and these people really did get to Palestine.</span> <span id="s420">Moreover, in that camp at Tsela we once or twice received small food packages from Sweden that were apparently paid for by our relatives, aunt and uncle, in America, and that we were allowed to get and at very critical periods supplied us with some food that may have very well kept us alive.</span> <span id="s421">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EG: They knew where you were?</span> <span id="s423">You could get word to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">EP: Yes, apparently.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t know quite how that was achieved.</span> <span id="s426">I do not remember that we received any mail, only these once or twice packages in Tsela, in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">EG: I think the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">EP: Yes, the Red Cross once or twice made a visit to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s429">I remember that, too.</span> <span id="s430">But the situation in Bergen-Belsen was much more difficult and much more severe than in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s431">Again, there was, of course, separation of men and women although only by barracks, not by camp.</span> <span id="s432">Conditions were much harsher, food was much more limited, and the work was much harder.</span> <span id="s433">I was in a barrack with wooden beds stacked three high, I was on top.</span> <span id="s434">I remember once at night when I got out in the middle of the night I fell down and fell on the brick floor.</span> <span id="s435">Outside from almost being knocked out, nothing happened to me.</span> <span id="s436">The first work we did in Bergen-Belsen, which was very hard work, is dig an enormous pit which was apparently meant for a septic tank, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s437">And we dug a huge pit that may well have been later on used for a grave, a mass grave, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s438">And we also had to push railway lorries up a small track that could then be tipped over.</span> <span id="s439">It’s hard to describe.</span> <span id="s440">It was specifically meant to carry sand or gravel and then when you got there you pushed on a hinge in the center and they would simply empty out.</span> <span id="s441">I remember digging and I remember... this was now, I was now 15 going on 16, pushing these lorries.</span> <span id="s442">That was the first work.</span> <span id="s443">It may have lasted a month or two months, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s444">Work was done that in the morning we lined up on the drill grounds and then the guard would come pick us out for specific labor groups.</span> <span id="s445">My brothers were very tall, my oldest brother was 6’7”.</span> <span id="s446">He was very tall and that made him an immediate object for attention and he was always picked on the first to be picked for work.</span> <span id="s447">After the initial work of digging this pit, I was then assigned to what is known as the shoe battalion.</span> <span id="s448">(Tape ends before it was completely used up.)</span> <span id="s449">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s450">EG: I neglected to ask you when you were talking about Westerbork, was there any organization among the Jewish residents of Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">EP: I was not aware of any, but that doesn’t mean that there wasn’t any.</span> <span id="s452">I was simply too young.</span> <span id="s453">But, there is one thing that I do recall.</span> <span id="s454">In fact I have some evidence with me.</span> <span id="s455">I still have the evidence.</span> <span id="s456">We organized a theater group, and we put on a cabaret, Cabaret Westerbork.</span> <span id="s457">I still have the program.</span> <span id="s458">I have a whole file of things.</span> <span id="s459">There must have been.</span> <span id="s460">There was one other thing that happened in Westerbork, of which I also have the evidence.</span> <span id="s461">Sometime during our stay there... I don’t recall exactly when... the Germans gave the opportunity to Jews who wished to avoid deportation to do so by allowing themselves to be sterilized, through a surgery, through an operation, and you had to sign a form.</span> <span id="s462">I have copies of that form.</span> <span id="s463">So, I suspect that there may have been an organization, a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s464">There almost must have been because my father worked for the organization, but he was only on the barrack level, he was not on the central committee.</span> <span id="s465">He would have avoided that because he did not want to take responsibility.</span> <span id="s466">It was obvious to us that certain decisions had to be taken, but to him at least, it was obvious that he would have found them morally unacceptable.</span> <span id="s467">So, he kept himself at a low profile.</span> <span id="s468">I remember that cabaret very well, because I went to it, and it made an enormous impression.</span> <span id="s469">There were some very fine Jewish actors.</span> <span id="s470">Not all of the Dutch, and, as a matter of fact, the entire cabaret, I think the entire text was in German and the Commander Genecker and all those came and thought it was terrific and applauded and sat in the front row.</span> <span id="s471">And, there was lots of, you know, good cabaret humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">EG: That was really amazing in a place like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">EP: No, it wasn’t, because I had read later on that in Auschwitz there were orchestras and everything, and plays were put on as well.</span> <span id="s474">It was a way to keep alive, to keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">EG: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">EP: So, it was not all that amazing.</span> <span id="s477">Should I go on with my?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">EG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">EP: Now, the second type of work, the second shift of work in Bergen-Belsen was, as I said, shoe commando and this is now almost seems comical but of course, it wasn’t at the time.</span> <span id="s480">We discovered that there was at Bergen-Belsen literally a mountain of old shoes.</span> <span id="s481">It must have been at least 10 or 15 feet high, and this was part of the German effort to save resources.</span> <span id="s482">These were worn-out shoes, that was very obvious.</span> <span id="s483">These were old shoes that the Germans had saved.</span> <span id="s484">We sat in a tent at long benches and we took those shoes apart, the nails, the cardboard, the leather, whatever.</span> <span id="s485">They were completely separated and they were all put, each piece was put in barrels.</span> <span id="s486">And, in the next three or four months we conquered that mountain completely.</span> <span id="s487">Every shoe was taken apart, and I’m sure that the products were useable in the economy at war that was very short of raw materials, so I must say I’m afraid, that I contributed to the German war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">EG: Do you find out whose shoes they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">EP: No, they were German.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t think they were shoes from Auschwitz, no, because they really showed signs of being very badly worn.</span> <span id="s491">I’m pretty sure that they had simply been collected all over Germany.</span> <span id="s492">If they were, let me say, of course, that question has come to me later...there was no indication that they were from another camp.</span> <span id="s493">Later on we found things from another camp but that was the third phase of my work detail before I became ill.</span> <span id="s494">After the shoes had been conquered...by now it must have been the summer of 1944, or maybe even the fall, the situation for Germany began to change.</span> <span id="s495">I was not aware of this.</span> <span id="s496">We did know two things.</span> <span id="s497">One, we somehow learned of the invasion of France, the Normandy Invasion.</span> <span id="s498">That didn’t make an impact because that was far away.</span> <span id="s499">However, we also became aware, and that was a strong rumor, of the attack on Hitler’s life in July, and at that point, the guards were extremely nervous and more vicious than usual.</span> <span id="s500">So, we were aware that something had been going on, but we didn’t know details.</span> <span id="s501">The third type of work that I did, and this as I said must have been the summer or early fall of 1944, was the railroad detail.</span> <span id="s502">And this was very had work.</span> <span id="s503">I was taken in the morning, and we took it, we did it because there was somewhat more food involved.</span> <span id="s504">We were put on trucks in the morning and taken to the railroad station outside Bergen-Belsen where trains were arriving, and what these particular trains were, they were freight trains loaded with parts of barracks.</span> <span id="s505">At the time we didn’t realize these must have been from camps in the East where the Russians had arrived.</span> <span id="s506">And we were unloading them.</span> <span id="s507">It was very heavy work and there were two men to a freight car.</span> <span id="s508">And we had to unload the entire freight car.</span> <span id="s509">In the process I think I must have then injured my back, because I have had back problems ever since.</span> <span id="s510">But this was the sort of work that I did for several weeks.</span> <span id="s511">And of course we were at that railroad siding under guard.</span> <span id="s512">We had no chance to escape.</span> <span id="s513">By then not the lack of food but the inadequate diet of getting bread and soup essentially once a day was taking it’s toll.</span> <span id="s514">Now it’s at this point... oh, two more transports arrived from Holland, from Westerbork, in Spring of 1944 and that kept us somewhat informed of the outside world.</span> <span id="s515">Bergen-Belsen was much more isolated than Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">EG: Was your father put on this work detail also?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">EP: No, my father did not do any major work.</span> <span id="s518">It was discovered in camp at Westerbork that he had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s519">Not Westerbork, I think it was at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s520">He was...that he had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s521">One of the reasons for this is, I’m now convinced, is that he ate entirely too little and gave most of his food to us.</span> <span id="s522">Anyway, he was put in a special barrack where there were people who were ill, but there was no difficulty seeing him.</span> <span id="s523">My oldest brother Hans began to get very ill.</span> <span id="s524">He had a number of physical breakdowns and before his last illness, he became partly paralyzed.</span> <span id="s525">He had to walk with a cane.</span> <span id="s526">And he had a badly infected hand.</span> <span id="s527">He didn’t do much work.</span> <span id="s528">He did one type of work that we discovered later.</span> <span id="s529">He wrote poetry which has been published in Holland.</span> <span id="s530">It was all in Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">EG: And he was only 23, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">EP: He was 23, he was born in 1921.</span> <span id="s533">He was 23 years old.</span> <span id="s534">And he must have suffered spiritually and mentally very much.</span> <span id="s535">It is obvious from his poetry.</span> <span id="s536">He was obviously more aware, maybe I was a tougher character, or maybe because I was so young, I was simply not conscious of things yet.</span> <span id="s537">But I somehow managed to keep going.</span> <span id="s538">I lived through the first two, I lived really through all the work details.</span> <span id="s539">My middle brother also managed to somehow hang on, although both he and I had one night a very bad experience when we came back.</span> <span id="s540">I can’t even remember why.</span> <span id="s541">The guards decided we ought to be punished.</span> <span id="s542">We had done something wrong - either we had spoken when we shouldn’t have been talking, or something.</span> <span id="s543">Anyway when we had arrived at 6:00 or 7:00 at night to be sent home to the barrack in the drill-ground, we were told to stand with our noses against the barbed wire at the fence, and for punishment we had to stand there for several hours until the guard came along and told us to go.</span> <span id="s544">But, somehow, we both managed to keep going.</span> <span id="s545">So that my middle brother, as I’ll call him, and I continued to work until... and I can’t give you an exact date on this, but probably sometime in the fall of 1944, that things began to be very badly deteriorated in the camp and the reason for this simply was, one word: lice.</span> <span id="s546">The absence of sanitation.</span> <span id="s547">In the beginning we had still been taking showers.</span> <span id="s548">Although that was not all that healthy because we made to walk wet and undressed through the cold weather back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s549">Anyway, we had managed somehow to keep clean in some way.</span> <span id="s550">But, partly because, perhaps, also new transport had arrived from the East that were already in bad shape, people began to come.</span> <span id="s551">By now, of course, the Russians were beginning to put great pressure on in the East.</span> <span id="s552">We began to be infested with lice.</span> <span id="s553">And, as a result of that, we all became sick because lice carried typhoid.</span> <span id="s554">[typhus-ed.]</span> <span id="s555">And, sometime in the fall of 1944, I became ill and so did my oldest brother, and my oldest brother could not fight the infection and he died in November.</span> <span id="s556">There was no way to get the fever down because we didn’t have any medication.</span> <span id="s557">I apparently was very ill.</span> <span id="s558">There were apparently whole weeks that I was not even rational.</span> <span id="s559">I could really block it out.</span> <span id="s560">I could remember nothing.</span> <span id="s561">I do remember my mother coming to visit me once with a little extra food.</span> <span id="s562">That is a vague recollection that I have.</span> <span id="s563">One other thing that happened that stands in my mind which was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s564">My mother had long hair and it became impossible to keep it clean and then she too became infected and her head had to be shaved and, that of course, was a dreadful experience.</span> <span id="s565">Somehow I did survive the typhoid [typhus] fever and I had it at least twice, maybe three times.</span> <span id="s566">But apparently in December...</span></p> <p><span id="s567">EG: Without medication?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EP: Without medication.</span> <span id="s569">In November, I remember that my father came to tell me that my brother had died, which, of course, broke him completely.</span> <span id="s570">Anyway, in either December or January, around that time that my brother died, I finally threw off the fever, and I was allowed to get out of bed.</span> <span id="s571">I was in some sort of sick ward.</span> <span id="s572">But when I got out of bed, I fell on the floor because I had absolutely no strength left.</span> <span id="s573">My legs wouldn’t carry me.</span> <span id="s574">And I literally had to learn to walk again.</span> <span id="s575">I remained extremely weak and I remember once that I had to go up three steps in to a barrack and that I couldn’t negotiate it.</span> <span id="s576">I had to crawl.</span> <span id="s577">I was so weak.</span> <span id="s578">In the first month of 1945, my parents were then still alive and my middle brother was still alive, and now the camp was becoming terribly overcrowded.</span> <span id="s579">More and more people being added, not just to our camp but to other camps next to us, that you could observe.</span> <span id="s580">Another thing that began to happen now, not so much in our camp but in the prisoner-of-war camp, people began to die like flies, and the sight that you may have seen in photographs, I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s581">People stacked up like corpses.</span> <span id="s582">Row upon row.</span> <span id="s583">Moreover, I know that in Bergen-Belsen, certain dying prisoners, most of prisoner-of-war, were given gasoline injections which is fatal.</span> <span id="s584">It will kill you after agony of several hours.</span> <span id="s585">Apparently, this was some sort of crude experimentation.</span> <span id="s586">I remember one specific incident when my brother and I were watching where two prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp said the prayers of the dead over dead comrades.</span> <span id="s587">Finally - oh, in February or March, 1945 - the camp was bombed by the British Air Force.</span> <span id="s588">Why?</span> <span id="s589">We don’t know but several barracks caught on fire, several people got killed, some part of the camp inhabitants.</span> <span id="s590">Some helped to put out the fire.</span> <span id="s591">Oh, yes, some other things that come back to me now, that I talked about the international nature of the camp.</span> <span id="s592">We had among, in our own Jewish camp, Jews were separate, we were international because we had Greek Jews and they were not the most pleasant.</span> <span id="s593">In fact, some of them were criminals elements, and they all were the Kapos or foremen.</span> <span id="s594">And they handled the food distribution.</span> <span id="s595">This led to a lot of corruption and comes back to me now.</span> <span id="s596">One of them whose name I remember was a character by the name of Albala.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">EG: How could you communicate with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">EP: German usually.</span> <span id="s599">Pigeon-German.</span> <span id="s600">German became the lingua franca, the international language.</span> <span id="s601">We all spoke German.</span> <span id="s602">Well, to somewhat jump here, we were informed sometime in early April that the camp would be evacuated.</span> <span id="s603">At least our section would be evacuated.</span> <span id="s604">Because the British army was close.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">EG: April, 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">EP: Yes, April 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">EG: Almost the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">EP: Almost the end of the war.</span> <span id="s609">And, as far as I can recall, around the 9th of April, we were taken in trucks, my father, my mother, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s610">We were still together, of course.</span> <span id="s611">Our oldest brother had died.</span> <span id="s612">We were put in trucks and then put on a train.</span> <span id="s613">A very old train, some with cattle cars.</span> <span id="s614">We were not in a cattle car.</span> <span id="s615">I would call it a fifth-class railroad passenger.</span> <span id="s616">Wooden benches, very old.</span> <span id="s617">And, the train began to move; we did not know where.</span> <span id="s618">What apparently the intention was, was to destroy the entire train, with people in it.</span> <span id="s619">We were taken by locomotive, sometimes we sat on a siding for a few hours, the locomotive disappeared.</span> <span id="s620">The train got bombed, or machine-gunned, thinking that the British or Americans that it was an ammunition train.</span> <span id="s621">We tied some white bedsheets to the top of the train to indicate that it was not.</span> <span id="s622">We got to the River Elbe.</span> <span id="s623">We were on a bridge, we went over the bridge.</span> <span id="s624">The bridge blew up.</span> <span id="s625">The plan had apparently been to blow us up on the bridge but the detonation didn’t go off in time.</span> <span id="s626">Now we were on the other side of the Elbe.</span> <span id="s627">We continued to go and we arrived eventually in Berlin.</span> <span id="s628">And we went from west to south to the suburbs of Berlin.</span> <span id="s629">We saw the... in April, 1945, the subway was still running in Berlin.</span> <span id="s630">We were in the suburbs where we could observe it because of our vantage.</span> <span id="s631">We continued in the southeasterly direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">EG: Still on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">EP: Still on this train.</span> <span id="s634">Sometimes we’d stand on the siding for a day or two if we had no locomotive.</span> <span id="s635">Once we ended up in the countryside scouring for food, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s636">We somehow got away although we had an SS guard.</span> <span id="s637">Once we got back in just the nick of time as the train was pulling away.</span> <span id="s638">We managed to get on at the last minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">EG: Was there any water on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">EP: I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s641">We must have.</span> <span id="s642">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s643">We cooked a little bit on the open platform between the cars and once a wooden part of it caught fire and the SS came and was very angry with us, and kicked a hole in part of the train and the bricks that we had made into... Anyway, one night we stopped and the locomotive disappeared and we just stood there.</span> <span id="s644">We stood there and we went to look for food but we didn’t find much.</span> <span id="s645">And one morning we came out and there was a soldier standing there that we did not recognize.</span> <span id="s646">In a different color coat with a rifle and a fur hat, and he stuck out his hands and said, “Tavarish” [comrade].</span> <span id="s647">During the night we rushed into town and occupied the area.</span> <span id="s648">We were in the neighborhood of a small German village called Trbitz, which is between Breslau and Leipzig.</span> <span id="s649">We were in southeastern Germany, near, well, I would say the northern part of Silesia.</span> <span id="s650">Anyway, we were now freed within the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s651">The Russian army had moved in.</span> <span id="s652">And, the Russians...oh, incidentally, a typhoid [or possibly typhus] epidemic raged on the train and people were dying and as the train moved we used to throw corpses off the train, to get rid of people.</span> <span id="s653">What can one do?</span> <span id="s654">So that while originally there may have been 800 people who were on the train, I don’t know how many, by the time the war came to an end, the number was going down all the time, and then the Russians told us to get off that train immediately.</span> <span id="s655">They needed it for their war effort and they told us, “You see Trbitz there.</span> <span id="s656">Go into that village and occupy it.</span> <span id="s657">Throw the Germans out of the house.</span> <span id="s658">It’s yours.</span> <span id="s659">Just take it.”</span> <span id="s660">It was very easy.</span> <span id="s661">The Germans were now different Germans.</span> <span id="s662">The Russians had come in and it’s hard to describe it to you, but the Germans now knew that we were suddenly no longer prisoners.</span> <span id="s663">We were now friendly with the Russians, although that sometimes took some doing communicating with the Russians is not easy.</span> <span id="s664">Anyway, my brother and I ...</span></p> <p><span id="s665">EG: What did this Russian do with the German guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EP: Oh, we saw them being led away.</span> <span id="s667">They were being handled very roughly.</span> <span id="s668">The guards were immediately made prisoners, they were beaten and they were taken away.</span> <span id="s669">We went into the village, my brother and I, and we found a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">EG: Your parents were still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">EP: Well, then, we had to... By now my mother was very weak and my father was weak and I found a little cart and I literally, on the cart, took them into Trbitz.</span> <span id="s672">Now, at least, we had a little decent place in which to live, but we had no food.</span> <span id="s673">We had to go scouring for food, then.</span> <span id="s674">I remember getting my hands on a bicycle and going to various farmhouses in the little villages nearby and I only managed to get a chicken.</span> <span id="s675">But, then, going on the road back, I ran into some Russians.</span> <span id="s676">See, there were a lot of Russians too, who were forced labor, who were now free, and they stole my bicycle.</span> <span id="s677">Easy come, easy go.</span> <span id="s678">So, I walked back to the village, still with my food, and managed to ... we managed to eat something.</span> <span id="s679">But, unfortunately, now, the typhoid [typhus] epidemic, the fever as we called it, had got to my parents, and, in fact, we infested the whole village.</span> <span id="s680">Everybody was sick, including the Germans who lived there.</span> <span id="s681">It was literally an epidemic.</span> <span id="s682">The answer that the Russians took was simply to isolate the whole village, give us some aspirins.</span> <span id="s683">And leave us alone thinking things would work themselves out.</span> <span id="s684">My mother died from the fever on the 20th of May, 21st of May.</span> <span id="s685">My father was then also very ill, and I was ill again having again gotten it.</span> <span id="s686">The Russians came and took my father and I to some sort of hospital, where my father died on the 1st of June.</span> <span id="s687">I again recovered from the fever.</span> <span id="s688">My brother, my middle brother, apparently did not get the fever.</span> <span id="s689">He was all right.</span> <span id="s690">So, now it was early June and my brother and I are left.</span> <span id="s691">And you had no idea of the current conditions.</span> <span id="s692">We had a few Russian nurses.</span> <span id="s693">One man had pneumonia, and they tried to treat him with the old-fashioned method of glass suction cups and instead of treating him, they greased his back and then stuck the glass cup over a candle.</span> <span id="s694">Well, the nurse knocked the candle over and set fire to the man’s back.</span> <span id="s695">And they put it out with the blanket and then proceeded with the treatment.</span> <span id="s696">I can’t tell you whether the man lived or died subsequently.</span> <span id="s697">I just don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Sometime in June, in the first two weeks of June, when the frontiers between Germans was still very fluid, it was discovered by the Americans that in eastern Germany there were people from Western Europe and an arrangement was made for an exchange because there were a lot of Russian laborers and prisoners-of-war in the western sector.</span> <span id="s699">Anyway, on the 18th of June, I remember this because it was my father’s birthday, we were taken from Trbitz by truck.</span> <span id="s700">There were not more than 200 of us left, probably less, to Leipzig, and this... in Leipzig, we were housed for maybe one or two days.</span> <span id="s701">I must say that Leipzig was very badly destroyed and it gave us an immense pleasure to see how badly Germany was destroyed.</span> <span id="s702">We were, of course, filled with hatred, and a desire for vengeance.</span> <span id="s703">We, after a very short stay in Leipzig, not more than one or two days, we were put on an American Red Cross train that had been permitted to come, to pick us up, and it was at this point that we really began to get some medical care, my brother and I, and I ...(Long pause), I remember meeting a Jewish nurse of the American army and I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s704">She was wearing a Star of David and had in it the number 13, and I asked, “Why was that?”</span> <span id="s705">and she said that 13 was a Jewish lucky number.</span> <span id="s706">Anyhow, the Red Cross train took us too... We were taken on this Red Cross train from Leipzig to Lige, in Belgium and then, if I remember correctly, we were taken... Excuse me, I’m usually not that emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">EG: It’s only normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">EP: First we were taken into Lige and we were housed for a while in Lige, I think in a monastery or something like that, and while we were in Lige the little handbag with a few clothes that we had were stolen.</span> <span id="s709">I don't know however how that took place.</span> <span id="s710">We were then taken by truck to Maastricht, which is the capital of the Dutch province of Limberg, a southern part which is called the Dutch panhandle.</span> <span id="s711">Anyway, here we now entered into the Dutch jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s712">The Dutch government was, of course, again functioning.</span> <span id="s713">We went through a sort of a health control inspection.</span> <span id="s714">And, it was discovered that my brother had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s715">And he was therefore not permitted to travel on because this was a very dangerous, communicable disease.</span> <span id="s716">He was put in a hospital right away in Maastricht.</span> <span id="s717">I was allowed to go on and told I was on my own to get back to Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s718">There were no trains running because all the bridges over the many rivers in Holland were all destroyed.</span> <span id="s719">I found out however after a couple of days that there were trucks taking food delivery and so on and that I could probably get a ride on a truck.</span> <span id="s720">And, indeed, I managed to get a space on a truck and we went across rivers on old ferry boats and trucks put on ferries, and it took me all day but finally, I think it was on the 5th of July, I got back to Rotterdam, and the truck dropped me off in the front of City Hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">EG: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Tape two, side two: Long pause before tape starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">EP: The truck then took me to Rotterdam, an all-day trip, through very badly damaged country and on the 5th of July, I remember exactly the date, in front of City Hall in Rotterdam, they dropped me off and I was back in the city where I was born and I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s724">I didn’t have more than the shirt on my back.</span> <span id="s725">So, irony of ironies, next to City Hall, is the headquarters of the police where I had originally been taken in and I went back there and said, “Well, is there any sort of Jewish home?”</span> <span id="s726">They said, “Yes, there is.”</span> <span id="s727">Anyway, they took me there and a few Jewish refugees, some who had been in hiding and others who had just got back from some places in Germany, were living there, and the head of the home, a sort of a manager, was somebody who had been a Jewish undertaker and had an undertaking business before the war and survived and who knew my family and knew my name, and, of course, I asked him, ”Are there, do I have any relatives left?”</span> <span id="s728">I knew that several of my cousins had gone into hiding, and the question was, had they managed to stay in hiding.</span> <span id="s729">And I mentioned their names.</span> <span id="s730">It took a little doing because one of them had married and he didn’t right away recall her maiden name, but, yes she was there.</span> <span id="s731">I think in the next day or something like that two of my cousins appeared and, in that way, I began then to ... to... I left the home shortly after and lived for awhile with one of them.</span> <span id="s732">These were very difficult days because one didn’t know how housing had to be literally allocated to the Jews who had survived, in terms of business and making a living.</span> <span id="s733">We had literally nothing for awhile.</span> <span id="s734">We did get some money grants from the government to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">EG: And your brother?</span> <span id="s736">How long did he have to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">EP: My brother stayed in Maastricht for a few weeks and he was brought to...I am not sure on that...I think he was brought to Rotterdam briefly, or even directly.</span> <span id="s738">Anyway the Dutch government flew to Switzerland to go to a sanitarium.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">EG: Of course, you knew where he was, but how did he know where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">EP: Oh well, I communicated with him.</span> <span id="s741">Anyway, he was taken and received the best care in Davos.</span> <span id="s742">He was in Davos in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s743">He stayed there from either July or August 1945, until about the Spring of 1946, March, April, May or something like that.</span> <span id="s744">Then he came back to Holland, although subsequently he suffered from recurrences of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s745">In those days, there were no drugs.</span> <span id="s746">Well, do you want me to go on in terms of my immediate post-war situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">EG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">EP: Well, I had no desire to stay in Holland.</span> <span id="s749">Of course, I did have a sister of my father, my aunt and uncle who had gone to America in 1939, and I had an intense desire to leave Holland and go to America.</span> <span id="s750">This wasn’t so easy because there weren’t even any diplomatic relations with America.</span> <span id="s751">It was only in October 1945.</span> <span id="s752">Then an American consulate opened in Rotterdam, and I went immediately to register, to emigrate.</span> <span id="s753">[unclear] In the meantime I had started school in the second grade of high school but I really didn’t fit in at all.</span> <span id="s754">I was too old.</span> <span id="s755">I was now 17 and my whole wartime experience, my whole outlook...I can now looking back see was one of not wishing to be restrained or restricted by any Dutch schoolmaster or classroom.</span> <span id="s756">And, so I quit school after no more than a month or two, and I was told at the American consulate that I would have to wait, because I wanted to go on an immigration visa and I was a quota visa.</span> <span id="s757">Since I knew I was going to America, I decided that I wanted to learn something useful, that I could make a living at, and somehow I hit on idea that I wanted to become a diamond broker.</span> <span id="s758">I had been in Westerbork acquainted with the head of the largest diamond factory in Amsterdam, a man by the name of Asscher.</span> <span id="s759">And he had survived the war, [unclear].</span> <span id="s760">Anyway, I went to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s761">I had some money and told him I want a job.</span> <span id="s762">I want to learn the diamond business.</span> <span id="s763">And he said, “Okay, I’ll take you on.”</span> <span id="s764">So I moved from Rotterdam to Amsterdam and got an apartment and was in the business.</span> <span id="s765">I learned various aspects but only superficially, for about six months.</span> <span id="s766">Then in the meantime, I was developing a terrible cough and I went to see a specialist, and he said, “Well, you have a spot on your lung but there is nothing to worry about.”</span> <span id="s767">Then, in maybe August or September of 1946, I was told that my visa had come through and I could go to America.</span> <span id="s768">My aunt and uncle of course, had to give a guarantee, an affidavit, but I had to get passage, and that was very, very difficult in 1946.</span> <span id="s769">And you got a visa for four months.</span> <span id="s770">It was non-renewable, and if you failed to get passage...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">EG: You had to start all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">EP: At the bottom of the list.</span> <span id="s773">I did get passage on a Dutch ship.</span> <span id="s774">It was very inadequate and had to be paid in dollars by my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s775">They would not take guilders on the Holland-American line.</span> <span id="s776">And I managed to leave Holland on the 19th of October, 1946, and it took 10 days to come by ship.</span> <span id="s777">Out of Rotterdam, I landed in...</span></p> <p><span id="s778">EG: Hoboken.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">EP: Yes.</span> <span id="s780">You know?</span> <span id="s781">You came that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">EG: No, but that’s where the Holland-American line lands.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">EP: It is not exactly the place to enter the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">EG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">EP: And, the moment that I arrived in the United States it was discovered that I was very seriously ill with tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s786">It was a miracle that I wasn’t sent back because there are restrictions against this.</span> <span id="s787">It is a communicable disease.</span> <span id="s788">I had been examined by a doctor, a Jewish doctor, at the American Consulate in Rotterdam, and he said, “Do you have a cough?”</span> <span id="s789">and I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s790">My English was then very inadequate.</span> <span id="s791">I said I had a cold and he let me slip through.</span> <span id="s792">Anyway, the moment I arrived, my aunt and uncle, who had come all the way from California to meet me, took me to a doctor, a specialist in New York, and he said, “Well, he’s very, very ill and he may not live beyond three months.”</span> <span id="s793">So, they took me back to California and put me in a sanitarium, and I recovered in 6 months.</span> <span id="s794">So, after that, I then began a new...I think we might end it at this point unless you want more detail.</span> <span id="s795">I mean, what happened in California, is really quite a separate story.</span> <span id="s796">My recovery was, I think, partly luck, partly much better circumstances, partly the treatment I received.</span> <span id="s797">It was a very old fashioned treatment - called pneumo - [unclear] - partial collapse of the lung, where air is pumped in between the diaphragm and the lung and that part of the lung is...</span></p> <p><span id="s798">EG: Allowed to heal.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">EP: Yes.</span> <span id="s800">It is immobilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">EG: Well, and also your will to live.</span> <span id="s802">That’s probably what contributed...</span></p> <p><span id="s803">EP: Probably.</span> <span id="s804">I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s805">So, that’s the story.</span> <span id="s806">Now, you know there may be other details I’ve forgotten, or that may come back to me.</span> <span id="s807">But basically in an outline, that’s the situation and, you know, it does involve a certain amount of emotional strain when I talk about it.</span> <span id="s808">More than I anticipated, than I expected, which is why I try not to talk about it.</span> <span id="s809">Immediately after the war, in 1945, we used to talk about nothing else.</span> <span id="s810">And you used to meet people in Rotterdam and Amsterdam that went through so much hurt.</span> <span id="s811">I apparently talked of nothing else and people didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s812">I did not understand then.</span> <span id="s813">Maybe I was too young.</span> <span id="s814">I can understand now.</span> <span id="s815">You want to forget.</span> <span id="s816">The great luck to me was that I not just left Holland, but I left Europe and I went to an entirely different world.</span> <span id="s817">I went to California of all things in 1946, and then I made such a completely clean break, and from then on, I began to almost be born again.</span> <span id="s818">I did not go back to Europe until 1958.</span> <span id="s819">For 12 years I did not even have any contact with Europeans.</span> <span id="s820">Then in 1958 I had finished my studies and had a doctorate degree in my pocket and was an instructor at Stanford University.</span> <span id="s821">It was a very different person who went back to Europe and had then some perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">EG: Didn’t you feel kind of hurt or angry that these young people your age that you met in California had been completely spared all these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">EP: No, oh no, I never...What I learned very quickly, very early on was simply not to talk about this because there was no understanding and people weren’t particularly interested.</span> <span id="s824">There’s an old saying that “Your hurt means nothing to somebody else”, and in the immediate post-war period, the universities were full of veterans from World War II who were very motivated to make something of themselves.</span> <span id="s825">I went to Berkeley, and the GI bill was sending all sorts of people to college who never would have gone to college, and I wanted to make something of myself, I had to study.</span> <span id="s826">There was one thing that I always had a love of even as a young man, and that is history.</span> <span id="s827">I was very interested in history.</span> <span id="s828">My aunt and uncle wanted me to become a physician, a doctor, typical standard idea.</span> <span id="s829">I couldn’t be interested in that.</span> <span id="s830">I had absolutely no interest in that.</span> <span id="s831">I fairly [unclear] strongly, although I would not hear of it, and eventually I chose to study what I wanted to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">EG: Good for you.</span> <span id="s833">Especially after all your experiences.</span> <span id="s834">I guess you were even more interested in what brings this...</span></p> <p><span id="s835">EP: Yes, people have often wondered how could you possible study German history and I can be very objective and detached there.</span> <span id="s836">I can really understand... I can’t always explain, but I can understand what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s837">You know, I think I’ve taught German history for many years now.</span> <span id="s838">I’ve been teaching, since 1955.</span> <span id="s839">I’ve been teaching for 28 years, and I like to think that I did a fairly objective treatment of German history.</span> <span id="s840">But, anyway, there is no doubt that going to California and starting a whole new life was really what saved my existence.</span> <span id="s841">If I had stayed in Europe, I would either have died of tuberculosis, or I would have turned into a criminal element.</span> <span id="s842">I am sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">EG: Why are sure of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">EP: Well, because I was not interested in any education or training.</span> <span id="s845">I was interested in “making it”, and I was beginning to be awfully interested in 1945 or 1946 in the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">EG: It was the only to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">EP: That was the only way to survive.</span> <span id="s848">There were very few restraints or moral guides except the one of survival...of World War II.</span></p></body></html>
