1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">01:00:19</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Will you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s13">A: Kate Bernath.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Where were you born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born August 27, 1927 in Szikszó, Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me about your family and and your life in Szikszó.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Uh, I come from a family of three children.</span> <span id="s18">I had two brothers and I was the youngest, a girl, and my father was a businessman and we were sort of middle-class Jews in town and, uh, I look back on my childhood as quite happy and, uh, even though there were a lot of dark clouds on the sky, we children were always protected and and, uh, shielded sort of and, uh, had quite a happy life.</span> <span id="s19">I, we thought so anyway.</span> <span id="s20">Until the... it really began to get bad and we started to hear all the the different rumors about, uh, what's happening all around us but we thought that maybe some people are exaggerating it and, uh, it would never happen to us.</span> <span id="s21">We are loyal Hungarian citizens and, uh, nobody would harm us.</span> <span id="s22">Our father, grandfathers fought for the country and, uh, and, uh, it's really just scaring us with these things.</span> <span id="s23">But then in, uh, April, March actually, 1944, when the Germans came in, we had to put on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their houses actually and, uh, we were not allowed to travel, have businesses or go to school or do anything.</span> <span id="s24">I mean we knew that it is happening.</span> <span id="s25">It is happening.</span> <span id="s26">And, uh, within a few weeks we were all rounded up and sent to a ghetto in, uh, the nearest bigger town named Kassawhere we were in, uh, very bad circumstances already.</span> <span id="s27">No money was allowed to brought with, only certain amount and we had to leave all our possessions at home.</span> <span id="s28">Just everybody was allowed, uh, uh, backsack of some little clothes and and no food and no money and then we didn't, no, no future.</span> <span id="s29">Didn't know what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s30">As and surely enough, uh, we were, uh, there four weeks maybe in the ghetto when the Germans took us out from the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">01:03:34</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Before we get to that, were you seeing a young man in the middle of all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s34">I, I was, uh, quite, uh, popular (laughter) and, and, uh, seeing we were ri...as I said we had a very social life and, and, and very happy life in a way.</span> <span id="s35">When we were not, we couldn't go to, we couldn't go to, uh, the movies so we entertained ourselves at home.</span> <span id="s36">I</span></p> <p><span id="s37">1 Košice, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">mean we tried to make the best of a bad situation and, uh, this certain young man was, uh, more attentive than others and (laughter) we sort of became semi-officially engaged.</span> <span id="s39">Uh, he had to go off to the forced labor camp, but, uh, we promised each other that if we both come back, we going to get married someday.</span> <span id="s40">But that was, uh, a very iffy situation of course because you really didn't know what was going on, but but when you're young you don't really think that way.</span> <span id="s41">I mean you don't really think you're going to die.</span> <span id="s42">You may say it, but, but it doesn't feel like, you know, you don't feel it.</span> <span id="s43">You don't realize it what the word really means.</span> <span id="s44">So we (pause) going back to back going back to Kassa, one, one, uh, day the Germans brought in these, uh, wagons and we were rounded up, I think eighty of us in a wagon, old and young and and sick and, uh, crying and and, uh, even whatever little we had they took away from us.</span> <span id="s45">No food.</span> <span id="s46">And the doors were locked on us and was, everybody was looking out under little windows in the cracks which way we're heading, because nobody told us anything.</span> <span id="s47">I mean we, everything was rumored but no...nobody said you're going here or you're going there and we thought we're going to work.</span> <span id="s48">Everybody said, oh, you're going to work so it's not the worst thing.</span> <span id="s49">We're going to work but, uh, my father sort of, uh, he was, uh, we called him a pessimist.</span> <span id="s50">(laughter) He he felt that he knew what that that it's going to be terrible and, uh, he said that we're heading for the, out of the country.</span> <span id="s51">I mean because if we were going to work, they would have bring us to the other direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">The trains would go to the other direction.</span> <span id="s53">And, uh, sure enough, in three days time--it took us, wait a minute, three days--yes, three days to arrive to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">01:06:36</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Tell me about that trip.</span> <span id="s56">What was the trip like?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, you hardly could sit down in the wagons and, uh, and, uh, I don't even remember having any food.</span> <span id="s58">We must have some food with us but, uh, I don't really recall recall it.</span> <span id="s59">And, uh, some people were sick, really out of their mind, old people, senile people and they were crying and yelling all night long and if somebody had to go to the bathroom, then then there was a little, uh, little pail there, and everybody, men and women together, everybody, uh, seeing that you're going to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s60">It's, it was just so humiliating, humiliating and, and, uh, horrible.</span> <span id="s61">So all they can do is cry or pray or or or try to soothe each other and, and sitting down on the floor and and mothers with their children and, uh, resting in their heads in their lap and it was just an awful trip.</span> <span id="s62">And, uh, little did we know that at least we were together.</span> <span id="s63">As soon as we arrived to Auschwitz, uh, they were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s64">We didn't know what Auschwitz was or where we were and was all of a sudden they opened the doors and these these, uh, men with, uh, striped uniforms started to drag us out and the Germans, uh, patrolling with their German Shepherds and and yelling, " , , schnell, schnell."</span> <span id="s65">Everything has to be done "schnell" all the time.</span> <span id="s66">And as soon as we got off, even our backsack what we could carry with us, uh, we tried to get it.</span> <span id="s67">They threw, they threw it all out on the side and we didn't need it anymore actually, but we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s68">And, uh, and men and women were separated right away.</span> <span id="s69">Separate lines.</span> <span id="s70">And, uh, when we were going in the lines, uh, this this, uh, German officer in a uniform, he was just telling which way to go for everybody, left or right.</span> <span id="s71">I remember him asking my mother how old she was and she said, "Vierzig" [GER: forty] That's all she was.</span> <span id="s72">And he sent her to the other side.</span> <span id="s73">(Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet.</span> <span id="s74">I mean we had no idea of, of, uh, what was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s75">And then they told us that you're going to see them later, that you're going to see them at night.</span> <span id="s76">They're taking the young people to work and, uh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">01:09:42 Uh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us.</span> <span id="s78">I remember some who were twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to step aside.</span> <span id="s79">They wanted.</span> <span id="s80">The rest of us were marched to the bath, to, to take a shower, to a bath.</span> <span id="s81">We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to find them, and they brought us into this huge room where the showers were overhead and they locked the doors on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out.</span> <span id="s82">Little did we know that our parents got the same showers with the gas on.</span> <span id="s83">Uh, when we came out from the showers we came out on the other door so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or anything.</span> <span id="s84">Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey cotton dress.</span> <span id="s85">No underwear.</span> <span id="s86">I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet, wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s87">And we were marched into a barrack where there were these, uh, so-called bleachers (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, bunks.</span> <span id="s88">Twelve of us on one, so if one turned around, all twelve had to turn.</span> <span id="s89">Uh, one bowl of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup or anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others.</span> <span id="s90">And, uh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from Czechoslovakia, were our Blockältesters.</span> <span id="s91">They were the overseers.</span> <span id="s92">And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the camp routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see your parents again.</span> <span id="s93">You might as well forget about it because they are already in the, marched into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s94">We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest dream that that something like this could happen.</span> <span id="s95">We thought they were just, uh, being rude to us.</span> <span id="s96">They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they were for so many years already.</span> <span id="s97">And, uh, we just shrugged it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">01:12:50 We we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer, volunteer for anything.</span> <span id="s99">Go out of here.</span> <span id="s100">This is a death camp, and, and, uh, the farther you get away from it the better it is.</span> <span id="s101">So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the transports were coming in day and night from Hungary.</span> <span id="s102">Actually I was in the first transport to leave Hungary to Auschwitz, and, uh, day and night they were bringing in people and even the gas chambers couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make room.</span> <span id="s103">We had to make room for the newcomers.</span> <span id="s104">We were sent to, uh, Cracow, P_aszów the Lager was called.</span> <span id="s105">It was the most horrible place on earth.</span> <span id="s106">I think it was worse than Auschwitz, even though it had no crematorium.</span> <span id="s107">But we worked very, very hard there.</span> <span id="s108">Four o'clock in the morning we had to get up to for Zählappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for hours under the stars in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s109">This was in May, but it was in the mountains, and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and everybody was cold.</span> <span id="s110">And, uh, staying there after after the Zählappell we were marched out to work.</span> <span id="s111">The camp was situated on a, on a mountainside and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep mountain, that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the mountains.</span> <span id="s112">And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done "schnell" and, uh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast.</span> <span id="s113">Now when you have a three size too big pair of shoes on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy and and go up on the mountainside, it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all day long.</span> <span id="s114">And by the time we came back home on the other side of the mountain, uh, sometimes the food ran out already.</span> <span id="s115">Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some soup with, uh, some barley, barley soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">That was our mainstay for three months, every single day.</span> <span id="s117">Barley soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">01:15:59 And, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it was very cold there in them.</span> <span id="s119">We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we realized it, it was full of lice, this clothes.</span> <span id="s120">So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide from the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; it was, uh, we suffered a lot there from, from, uh, from the other people.</span> <span id="s121">From the other camp-mates who were, who were not, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming from, from our, our, uh, homes and they were already suffering for years and years and they thought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language.</span> <span id="s122">We don't belong.</span> <span id="s123">But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the partisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the camps and, and the front was coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there.</span> <span id="s124">And we were sent, we were sent back to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">01:17:36 Of course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip Auschwitz betwe...between Auschwitz and Cracow, the distance should be three hours.</span> <span id="s126">It took us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August 5th I remember.</span> <span id="s127">Hundred and thirty us of us in one wagon.</span> <span id="s128">It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed off and I, the train stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on my head.</span> <span id="s129">I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out with a covered wagon.</span> <span id="s130">How can it be raining?</span> <span id="s131">Until I found out that the humidity in the wagons was so high that it was coming down in drops from the ceiling.</span> <span id="s132">We had absolutely no water, no food, no air.</span> <span id="s133">After three days when we finally arrived in Auschwitz and they opened the wagon doors, we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in Auschwitz and we're perhaps going to the gas chambers, and this will be the end of our journey.</span> <span id="s134">(Pause) Uh, but we didn't go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s135">We went back to another lag...uh, camp.</span> <span id="s136">I think it was the C Lager they called it.</span> <span id="s137">And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair was shaved.</span> <span id="s138">Before they didn't have time because usually when a transport arrives, the women are all shaved.</span> <span id="s139">Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...it didn't, they were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came back to Auschwitz, they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like I told you.</span> <span id="s140">And, uh, they tattooed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">01:20:05 This was just another...we really didn't care at that point.</span> <span id="s142">We didn't think that that we, we, we really ex...ceased to be human beings.</span> <span id="s143">We were just a number already but who care...I mean it was beyond us already.</span> <span id="s144">And, uh, in Auschwitz, in Auschwitz I didn't work.</span> <span id="s145">It was just a transport Lager alread...an an an experimenting Lager.</span> <span id="s146">We...we didn't have to work.</span> <span id="s147">But, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh, Zählappell for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a group of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm.</span> <span id="s148">And, uh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s149">The rest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything.</span> <span id="s150">Just...just waiting, and...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections.</span> <span id="s151">Selections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going.</span> <span id="s152">So everybody was trying to avoid it.</span> <span id="s153">But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time kept telling us, "Just try to get out from here.</span> <span id="s154">Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the crematorium is always working.</span> <span id="s155">Uh, if...if you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive."</span> <span id="s156">So one day, when there was a selection in our block, uh, I was together with a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s157">We decided that, uh, "Let's...let's go for the selection."</span> <span id="s158">They needed five hundred girls for this selection; and, uh, I was the four hundred and ninety-ninth and she was the fifth...fifth...five hundred[th] to be selected.</span> <span id="s159">And there was two more girls with us--also cousins--who were cut off, and they remained in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s160">They never came back alive.</span> <span id="s161">We were...we were, uh, really lucky ones.</span> <span id="s162">We were sent to, uh, a factory to work in Augsburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s163">Uh, I believe the factory belonged to Messerschmidt.</span> <span id="s164">That's what I was told.</span> <span id="s165">It was, uh, situated on Ulmerstrasse in Augsburg; and it was not a concentration camp in the regular sense, becau...we were locked up.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, we were not allowed to leave the buildings; but, uh, we were living in the factory building.</span> <span id="s167">It was a huge L-shaped building and we were living in one on one side of it with the Ger...with our German guards and, uh, we were working in the other side of the building, so we never left the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:23:46 We went through the basement, up to the other side to work and, uh, our food was a little better than if we were not working.</span> <span id="s169">And our guards were not hitting us like they were in Cracow with the, with the leather--uh, I don't know what you call them--and there were plenty of beatings there and and so we were, uh, handled more humanely.</span> <span id="s170">Nevertheless, uh, we were hungry constantly but, uh, there was five hundred of us.</span> <span id="s171">Five hundred Hungarian girls and, uh, we were working hard for the Germans.</span> <span id="s172">The German civilians worked in the same place but not together with us.</span> <span id="s173">Separate, separate departments.</span> <span id="s174">Uh, had a lot of air raids in those days in Germany.</span> <span id="s175">The Americans came constantly.</span> <span id="s176">Every night we could set our clock by it that what time the air raid is going to be and we were happy about it.</span> <span id="s177">We were glad.</span> <span id="s178">We were wishing they would bomb the place down and, uh, with us together (laughter) whatever but, uh, the Germans didn't--we had to go to the air shelters every night because the Germans wouldn't leave us up there.</span> <span id="s179">They were afraid we, we might signal the airplanes.</span> <span id="s180">One day there was a bomb fell on our courtyard and it never exploded.</span> <span id="s181">The German workers said that it's because the Jews are here.</span> <span id="s182">They, they already felt that they lost the war.</span> <span id="s183">Actually the Germans felt it.</span> <span id="s184">They knew it.</span> <span id="s185">But of course everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s186">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s187">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s188">They wouldn't talk to us, uh, but, uh, they they they knew that, uh, it's getting out of hand.</span> <span id="s189">Don't forget this was toward the end of the war and, uh, we tried we tried to do our work so we should sabotage a few of their airplanes but I don't know if it succeeded or not (laughter) but uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s191">01:26:25</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well we were we were I was working in the they called it where our job was to, to these parts we were dipping into these chemicals so they shouldn't oxidize because when they put them in the planes they're, you know, rusty, they're not treated, uh, good enough so we tried to manipulate a little that it shouldn't be so good but I don't know.</span> <span id="s193">It was just a hope that maybe we did some good.</span> <span id="s194">And, uh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s195">Our, uh, German the, the Hauptscharführer (ph) who was, uh, the after a while he became very mean and we, we heard rumors that his son was killed at the Russian front and he took his frustrations out on the Jews of course and, uh, but we were, we were--uh, in the midst of all our troubles we were trying to cheer each other up.</span> <span id="s196">If one was feeling very low, we, we tried to tell them, we, we dreamed about things what we were going to do when we got liberated.</span> <span id="s197">We were all...we never thought for a minute, I never thought for a minute that I'm really going to die.</span> <span id="s198">I, it just did not sink in.</span> <span id="s199">I mean with all these horrors around me I, I always thought that we were dreaming of, of things--when I got home I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and I just want to see this, this war end and just live for the day when we see the Germans defeated.</span> <span id="s200">And that kept us alive.</span> <span id="s201">Never to lose hope.</span> <span id="s202">If you lost hope that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s203">It was so easy in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s204">All you had to do is reach out for the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s205">They were electrified.</span> <span id="s206">We will not do them the favor.</span> <span id="s207">We said if they want to kill us, they'll have to kill us.</span> <span id="s208">We are not going to die (laughter) becau...because it's, it's, uh, if we knew that our parents would be alive or, or we said we, we, we fight.</span> <span id="s209">We can do it.</span> <span id="s210">We, we, we are going to stay alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">01:28:55 But of course it, it became more and more heated the the war.</span> <span id="s212">It it, uh, to us, uh, middle of, beginning of April we had to leave Augsburg because the bombings were unbearable and, uh, I suppose the factory shut down for whatever reasons.</span> <span id="s213">They, they put us back into the wagons and, and, uh, we were headed for wherever camp would take us and we were taken actually to several camps where they had no room for us.</span> <span id="s214">And finally we wound up, uh, a place called Mühldorf.</span> <span id="s215">At this time we belonged to, we were under Dachau jurisdiction I suppose.</span> <span id="s216">Uh, this, this belonged to the camps Dachau already and, uh, we stayed in, in Mühldorf.</span> <span id="s217">When we arrived there we saw people there who were in much worse shape than we were.</span> <span id="s218">I mean they really looked, uh, walking corpses.</span> <span id="s219">And, uh, we had to go out to work, uh, mostly these bombed out places.</span> <span id="s220">They took us to the town of Mühldorf I suppose and, uh, cleaning, uh, bricks of the house that were bombed out and uh ...the middle of the area was such a bombing... that my ...cousin was laying next.</span> <span id="s221">We were laying on, uh, on the ground, uh, during the attack, next to a tree and and we couldn't see each other from from the smoke.</span> <span id="s222">But, uh, nevertheless, we didn't care about the bombs.</span> <span id="s223">I mean we were happy that there were bombings.</span> <span id="s224">One, uh, I just you, just didn't think about, uh, living or dying or whatever may come or, or you were a fanatic just to see the Germans defeated.</span> <span id="s225">That's all we lived for.</span> <span id="s226">And we knew it full well it, it will be done but the question was will we see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">With all our dreams and our deep-down each and every one of us knew that they're going to kill us in the last minute.</span> <span id="s228">They're not going to let us live to, to come and testify.</span> <span id="s229">It was just by accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">01:31:47</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: What happened to me?</span> <span id="s233">This Mühldorf, Mühldorf was evacuated.</span> <span id="s234">About six thousand people altogether I suppose.</span> <span id="s235">I'm really not good at, uh, these things because I don't know.</span> <span id="s236">I was just shoved here and I was shoved there.</span> <span id="s237">Nobody told me anything and, uh, and, uh, we were in, as I said put into wagons again and, uh, supposedly, I heard rumors we were heading to Innsbruck which was, uh, exterminating pla...uh, Lager again to to finish us all off.</span> <span id="s238">But, uh, the Ger...the the front was over more, all around us, the fightings and, uh, there were more important things for the locomotives than to transport us.</span> <span id="s239">So we were stranded for days here and days there.</span> <span id="s240">I mean the train didn't move.</span> <span id="s241">We were just left, uh, left there on the tracks.</span> <span id="s242">And, uh, one day, one day somebody noticed that all our guards left.</span> <span id="s243">And, uh, somebody, I don't know how, some man or broke out of their their wagons and opened all the wagon doors and they said, "Uh, we have no guards.</span> <span id="s244">The war is over.</span> <span id="s245">You're free."</span> <span id="s246">Let's go wherever.</span> <span id="s247">So where should we go.</span> <span id="s248">You know, we were a group of, uh, girls together who were all the time sticking it out and, uh, finally we saw everybody is running away from the wagons.</span> <span id="s249">We started to walk.</span> <span id="s250">This was, uh, fields there and, uh, finally we came to a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s251">Uh, came to this farmhouse.</span> <span id="s252">Uh, somebody who spoke German told the German man there that we are from a neighboring, uh, concentration camp and we were left on our own, and we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s253">Could he please give us something to eat?</span> <span id="s254">So he said to go up to, for us to go in the back and, uh, he's going to try to find us something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:34:18 A little later he came back and brought some, some food and no sooner we started to eat, this SS soldier came with his machine gun pointed at us and tells to the German guy that uh Juden so and uh Raus, Raus, everybody.</span> <span id="s256">Raus.</span> <span id="s257">They brought these these, uh, trucks.</span> <span id="s258">They rounded up all six thousand people back to the wagons, but it was beating and shooting and and, uh, it was just a terrible, uh, situation.</span> <span id="s259">On top of all there was a big thunderstorm and, and, uh, we were pulled back and and bleeding and, and, uh, wounded and pushed back into the wagons.</span> <span id="s260">No sooner we were back in the wagons, the American fighter planes came and started to bomb all around us.</span> <span id="s261">So much so that there were a lot of, lot of casualties at that point and, uh, and, uh, in the middle of the night finally the wag...the train started to move again.</span> <span id="s262">We, we were going to, to, uh, we were on our way.</span> <span id="s263">People were crying and, and, uh, it was a hopeless situation.</span> <span id="s264">After a couple of days one night when we were standing on the tracks, the, somebody opened the door and asked if we had any wounded or dead in our wagons, because they are from the Swiss Red Cross and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s265">We were near the Swiss borders.</span> <span id="s266">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s267">We were so, so we didn't care anymore and, uh, and, uh, the girls started to shout they're not moving out of this wagon anymore.</span> <span id="s268">Come what may, we're staying there.</span> <span id="s269">And, uh, so we stayed the night and in the morning we saw the American soldiers coming by with the trucks and, and, uh, and they started to bring us some food and, and, and, uh, then we knew that that the war was over and this was May 1st, 1946</span></p> <p><span id="s270">01:37:02 and, uh, from then on and, uh, from then on, uh, they took us into a neighboring, uh, place called Feldafing which was, uh, it originally a Hitlerjugend camp.</span> <span id="s271">It was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s272">It was on the Starnbergsee.</span> <span id="s273">It's a big lake.</span> <span id="s274">And, uh, they they disinfected us.</span> <span id="s275">They took us, took away all our clothes whatever we had.</span> <span id="s276">They gave us, they didn't have any clothes for us, so they gave us pajamas, whatever they could find and, uh, fed us and, uh, from then on it was, uh, much easier.</span> <span id="s277">But of course, uh, we didn't know what happened to our families and, and, uh, anybody around us and it's just, uh, you couldn't think.</span> <span id="s278">You couldn't, uh, do anything and it, it took many, many months before we became human again.</span> <span id="s279">It's, uh, (pause) I, I of course I skipped a lot of things over, over a lot of things which, uh, which was, which was worse than the camp itself, all the dehumanizing, all the suffering, the not-knowing what happened to, to our loved ones, whether we're going to see them again or not, and our properties, without we're left without everything and anybody and and it was just a horrible horrible experience.</span> <span id="s280">But uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you go, did you go back home?</span> <span id="s282">01:38:53</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, I went back home after after a good while because the transportation was very bad.</span> <span id="s284">I mean there was none.</span> <span id="s285">There was none, and we just had no way of, uh, turning.</span> <span id="s286">There was no papers, no money, no, no transportation.</span> <span id="s287">So I remained in this camp for, uh, three, four months I believe after the liberation.</span> <span id="s288">No, well in September, September when we heard there were some trains going already back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s289">I went back to Hungary and I found the brother who was already home.</span> <span id="s290">He was, survived the camps.</span> <span id="s291">My other brother who was with him was killed in the last days of the war.</span> <span id="s292">And, uh, he was on one of these marches uh- -they were, they were together all the time and and, uh, and this younger brother of mine</span></p> <p><span id="s293">2 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">became sick so he was taken to another camp and my older brother thinking that he was going to go that camp to be with my younger brother again, he went on this march and he never came out from there, in the last days, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you meet up with your fiance again?</span> <span id="s296">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Well, he was, uh, waiting with open arms (laughter) and he was waiting with open arms, but, uh, we were not ready to get married.</span> <span id="s299">I was, uh, there was no, uh, nothing and nobody and we really had to get ba...back to normal life to get adjusted.</span> <span id="s300">We, we didn't know what, uh, was happening to us.</span> <span id="s301">And, uh, but after a few months back in Hungary we, we felt that this is not the, we could not live here any longer.</span> <span id="s302">All the feelings what was in us made it impossible to, to readjust to life in Hungary.</span> <span id="s303">With all the hatred and all the non-caring what we received from our Hungarian friends and neighbors, we just did not see life possible there anymore.</span> <span id="s304">So we decided to try to get back to Germany and there, from there as displaced people we were going to be able emigrate either to Israel, uh, Palestine or America.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">01:41:41 He had relatives in America who wanted him to come here and, uh, so we went back.</span> <span id="s306">We became engaged in Hungary and, uh, started out on our journey and, uh, finally we got married in Germany in Leipheim .</span> <span id="s307">This was DP camp, and on the way we got of course a lot of help from Jewish organizations, mainly from Joint, United Jewish Appeal and, and, uh, UNRRA kept these camps open.</span> <span id="s308">Of course the life was very harsh in these DP camps, but, uh, I suppose, uh, we had our freedom.</span> <span id="s309">Our freedom to go nowheres because actually nobody wanted us until finally the Congress passed an act in 1948 or 9 and we were allowed to come to America.</span> <span id="s310">And we're ever grateful because we found that, uh, we had a good life, uh, with all our memories and all the, even even more so because we appreciate it more, whatever we got and, uh, whatever we achieved, uh, we are, we are allowed to achieve, we're very thankful for it and we see the contrast, how people are.</span> <span id="s311">It was really unbelievable to us that, that it could happen that, uh, that, uh, of course the German people paid for, for their mistakes and everybody does for the mass hysteria what swept through Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: But you, you have been happy now?</span> <span id="s313">01:43:33</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s315">We are, uh, I mean happy.</span> <span id="s316">Of course, we miss our families terribly and we, we never forget about them.</span> <span id="s317">We always talk about them.</span> <span id="s318">It's became part of our lives.</span> <span id="s319">No matter how much we don't want to, whenever I get together with my friends or relatives, the subject comes up.</span> <span id="s320">We always wind up in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s321">But, uh, we somehow we learned to live with it.</span> <span id="s322">I suppose it's, uh, some...uh, sometimes you don't believe it yourself that, uh, you really went through all this and you are, you, you still are a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Is there anything you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Uh, what I want to add is that, uh, people should be vigilant all the time not to, not to think that, uh, this really doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s325">All these all these, uh, hate mongrels what come up in the world and and people, if they're not personally marked they think that it's nothing.</span> <span id="s326">It will pass by.</span> <span id="s327">It will blow away.</span> <span id="s328">But, but if you let it go out of hand, then this, this can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Also I want to add that never lose hope.</span> <span id="s330">Until there is life there is always hope.</span> <span id="s331">If I, if I wouldn't give two cents for my life.</span> <span id="s332">I, like I said, I always felt that no matter how much, uh, front we're going to put up, they, they at the end they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s333">And and but we did not give up hope.</span> <span id="s334">We didn't go around--I'm going to lay down and die.</span> <span id="s335">At the end, uh, some of us survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s337">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">01:45:44</span></p></body></html>
