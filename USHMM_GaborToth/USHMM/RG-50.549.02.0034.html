so that we make sure that we’re recording here?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay, it’s -- it’s nice meeting you and finally be able to talk about the second part of my life and hope that it will make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Well, first of all, I wanted to go back and ask you a couple of factual questions.</span> <span id="s16">Th-Th-The names of your mother and your father and your sister and your grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Okay, my father’s name is Dr. Bruno Deutsch.</span> <span id="s18">My mother’s name is Eleishka Deutschova, born Hoobervar.</span> <span id="s19">My sister’s name is Zoozanar Holobecova, maiden name Brunova.</span> <span id="s20">She is sister from my mother’s first marriage.</span> <span id="s21">And my grandparents, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: From my mother’s side is Dr. Adolf Hoober, grandmother Paula Hooberva, born Klepfnacherva.</span> <span id="s24">From my father’s side, my grandfather’s name was Samuel Deutsch and my grandmother’s was Jenny Deutschova, born Meyerva.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s26">One of the things you mentioned in the video interview was that your grandfather had some poison that you were to have used if things got really unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: When did you find out about the fact that he had this poison and what were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I do not exactly remember when the subject was brought up.</span> <span id="s30">I simply do not remember.</span> <span id="s31">It -- It, in all likelihood was mentioned casually.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: But it -- it -- it re -- it came up while you were on the run -- while you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s35">It wasn’t later, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: No, it was -- it was -- it was while we were on the run.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Do you remember your reaction to finding out about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Another thing having to do with the video was your time in the Catholic orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And you had said that you weren’t really aware of religion at that age, but there were a lot of different experiences with religion, that you had.</span> <span id="s42">You had the Catholic orphanage, you-your own religion.</span> <span id="s43">Were you aware of -- of your place in any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I do not think that I was bothered by it, because during the war, I was about a half a year or eight months, hidden under assumed name in -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister, so that somehow I was used to Christianity, as far as that goes.</span> <span id="s45">But, when I was deposited in that orphanage, it was already after liberation -- very shortly after liberation.</span> <span id="s46">And my parents made it clear to me that I will be there only a very short time and I can only assume that the nuns were instructed that I’m there only temporarily, for a couple days or weeks.</span> <span id="s47">So they have not tried to impose any of their influence upon me.</span> <span id="s48">It was like -- like, if you will, to -- to -- to be deposited in a day care center, if you wish.</span> <span id="s49">There was one fellow I befriended there, during those few days.</span> <span id="s50">He used to -- he spend there a whole war.</span> <span id="s51">He was Jewish, but he was not circumcised, so there was apparently no way t -- of proving that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s52">But that -- that didn’t have any lasting influence upon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: When the war ended, you were 13.</span> <span id="s54">You were in this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And since the video interview stopped at that point --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: -- perhaps we could pick up the chronology and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: -- talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s62">After some very short time in the orphanage, one of my relatives -- and I don’t remember exactly whether it was my sister or my parents, came to pick me up and we came back to Ungarrishbrote or Uerskibrote, the town from which we fled in 1942, to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s63">If I remember correctly, in those -- in that period that I was in the orphanage, my parents succeeded having our house returned to us.</span> <span id="s64">Because, during the war, our house was occupied by Christians, who were not very pleased, apparently, to vacate the house after the war.</span> <span id="s65">Because majority Christians who found themselves into those situations, assumed that the Jews have perished.</span> <span id="s66">That they will be able to stay there forever.</span> <span id="s67">So, we returned to our own house.</span> <span id="s68">I remember, after few days or weeks, I joined the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s69">I had got -- got a nasty infection on my foot and had to be operated on and had to be transported for the operation to Ungarishradish or Werskaradishka, which had a hospital.</span> <span id="s70">And the only doctor in Ungarishbrote who was available, said that because the war has ended such a short while earlier, they didn’t had any ether -- anesthesia, to put me to sleep.</span> <span id="s71">So I had to go to Ungarishradish for operation.</span> <span id="s72">I stayed there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s73">My father, in the meantime, traveled throughout the Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s74">Mainly -- his dental office was confiscated by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s75">And the provisional Czech government wanted to return it to him, but of course, the original equipment, God knows where it disappeared.</span> <span id="s76">So, the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans.</span> <span id="s77">So he can choose any dental office that he wants to, with one condition, that the office will stay in that city in which it is.</span> <span id="s78">And the Czech government promised to find for us an apartment in that city.</span> <span id="s79">So, from what I understand, my father looked over about five or six dental offices and has selected one in the city of Zenime or Zenoimal, which is about one hour by train away from Vienna, in southern Moravia.</span> <span id="s80">And in, I think September of ‘45, we have moved.</span> <span id="s81">Correction, it must have been later.</span> <span id="s82">October or November, we have moved to Zenoimal.</span> <span id="s83">And while in Uerskibrote, I started getting private tutoring lessons, because I was still at a compulsory school age.</span> <span id="s84">And the debate was with the school board, whether I should be admitted to a class according to my chronological age or placed in a class according to my academic knowledge.</span> <span id="s85">And until that issue was resolved -- because the local school board didn’t had any instructions how to proceed.</span> <span id="s86">So, in the meantime, I was having a private tutor, so I think that during the summer of ‘45, I was spending it with a tutor.</span> <span id="s87">And in September, I started school.</span> <span id="s88">In the meantime, the ruling was that I had to attend classes according to my chronological age.</span> <span id="s89">So, of course, I was -- I was totally unprepared, after four years -- five years being out of school.</span> <span id="s90">So I -- I always had very poor grades as a result.</span> <span id="s91">And then my father selected the dental office in Zenoimal, so we have moved to Zenoimal.</span> <span id="s92">I remember the travel throughout the Czech Republic by train was an ordeal, because th-the cars were not only filthy and dirty, but all the windows were broken.</span> <span id="s93">And it was -- the trains were running, God knows how.</span> <span id="s94">So Zenoimal -- the city of Zenoimal, I think at that time, it -- it must have had a population of about 20,000, was heavily scarred from Germans fleeing to Austria.</span> <span id="s95">There were several burn out tanks left over in the city.</span> <span id="s96">A great part of the city was in ruins.</span> <span id="s97">And almost all the windows in Zenoimal were broken, because allies were bombing Vienna.</span> <span id="s98">And Vienna Noiseshtatel, which had apparently German ammunition factories, and from the vibration of the bombs, the glass of the windows simply broke.</span> <span id="s99">So, then I stayed in Zenoimal, I think til about 1947.</span> <span id="s100">Yes, in May of 1947, I finished my compulsory educational requirements, which at that time, were nine grades.</span> <span id="s101">I did not qualify for high school, simply because of academic deficiencies.</span> <span id="s102">And the fact that I was Jewish and suffered from a lack of education was not taken into account.</span> <span id="s103">And in 1947, the problem was asked, okay, what do I do now?</span> <span id="s104">The city of 20,000 people did not have many opportunities for young people.</span> <span id="s105">There were a couple openings in various trades.</span> <span id="s106">In the Czech economy at that time, usually somebody who selected a trade went into apprenticeship status for next three years.</span> <span id="s107">So, there were openings if you wanted to become a barber or a painter or a sales clerk.</span> <span id="s108">All those trades are -- required three years apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s109">But somehow it came to my attention that a textile factory was looking for apprenticeship connected with bort and learning classes.</span> <span id="s110">So, the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship, with half a day of practical work in a textile factory and half a day of classroom work.</span> <span id="s111">I succeeded, with my father’s help, to enter the program and left home to a small village in which there was a textile factory.</span> <span id="s112">I-It used to be owned by Jews.</span> <span id="s113">And I started as an apprentice in -- in that factory and I believe that the program was the first year.</span> <span id="s114">We were to rotate in the textile factory, from department to department and the second year you should have selected a department, which would become your specialty.</span> <span id="s115">So I finished the first year, but even during the first year, I still had physical problems, because I was extremely weak as a result of the war.</span> <span id="s116">Furthermore, I never felt quite home, because I was the only Jewish apprentice in our class of about 60.</span> <span id="s117">So I was sort of a curiosity.</span> <span id="s118">And I finished, I think, first half of the second year, when my parents suggested that -- by that time, it was 1948.</span> <span id="s119">The Communists already took over the government of Czechoslovakia when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s120">Do you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Yes, that’s a good point to go back and -- and ask you questions about that period.</span> <span id="s122">Did -- Did you feel, because you were behind in your schooling, did -- did that make you feel -- a-and your experience was different from others in the village, I -- I assume, so wh -- did you feel alienated or -- or set apart from -- from your -- your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I -- I do not think that I felt alienated from my classmates, maybe because all of them were on the nine year track, rather than on the 12 year track.</span> <span id="s124">And simply, they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews, because they grew up under normal conditions, with the exception of -- of -- of the war years.</span> <span id="s125">But in Zenoimal, a great percentage of the students in the nine -- in -- in -- in the lower grades, commuted from neighboring villages.</span> <span id="s126">And they were sons of farmers, who basically didn’t feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the cities.</span> <span id="s127">Because in the -- in the outlying areas, you know, the Nazis didn’t had such a tight control like over the population of -- of -- of larger cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s129">Who were most of -- who were your friends?</span> <span id="s130">Did you make close friend during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I made some friends, simply because -- I got to tell you something, I was not tremendously interested in catching up with my academic deficiencies, simply because I didn’t had a -- a specific goal in mind.</span> <span id="s132">While I was going to school in Zenoimal, it never occurred to me, “Gosh, in -- in a year or two I will be finished, what do I do then?”</span> <span id="s133">It -- It never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s134">I -- during the war, because of my being locked up always in -- in rooms, I had tremendous energy, which first had to be satisfied.</span> <span id="s135">And, as a result, I played soccer.</span> <span id="s136">I was very good at soccer.</span> <span id="s137">Although, because of my physical -- being physically weak, I didn’t -- I wasn’t able to run for a long time.</span> <span id="s138">But still, I was a very good soccer player in my own group of youngsters.</span> <span id="s139">So, most of the time, I tried to catch up on the physical activities, which I missed during the war, rather than on the emotional side.</span> <span id="s140">The physical deficiencies came to me more naturally than the academic development.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What were some of the physical ailments?</span> <span id="s142">You said you were weak --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: I had, several times, very bad ear infection.</span> <span id="s144">You see, in those days, although penicillin was all ready -- after the war, was already invented, but it was question of availability.</span> <span id="s145">So that was -- that was problem number one.</span> <span id="s146">Then, when, during your formative years, you are continuously locked up, your body does not get the opportunity to develop physically.</span> <span id="s147">And consequently, I -- I was weak, physically and undernourished.</span> <span id="s148">So all that, first of all, I had to catch up with.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know what I ever caught up.</span> <span id="s150">Basically, I will tell you something, I think that I caught up with most of the deficiencies, but I was always out of sync.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you talk with your -- your mates and -- and your schoolmates and friends about your experience during the Holocaust -- during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No.</span> <span id="s153">Nobody was particularly interested in it.</span> <span id="s154">At one time one of my teachers suggested that I write a book.</span> <span id="s155">But, you know, coming to a 13 year old boy with a task, why don’t you write a book about your experiences, didn’t -- didn’t sit with me quite, quite well.</span> <span id="s156">I didn’t see any purpose for it, you know.</span> <span id="s157">Because it’s -- it’s completely different than looking at it in hindsight, 50 years, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: You would think that s -- that some of your friends would -- would be curious or -- or perhaps you would be wanting to tell them because there was an adventure about -- I mean, there was partly an adventure.</span> <span id="s159">I mean it ma-may not have felt that way to you, but if I were a classmate and I had a friend who’d -- who had done what you did during the war, I might be curious about hearing -- hearing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I don’t think -- I don’t think that the issue was ever -- ever raised.</span> <span id="s161">You know, okay, I’m -- I’m -- you are right, had it happened now.</span> <span id="s162">But don’t forget, you have to project yourself to those days.</span> <span id="s163">Czechoslovakia, for example, looking in hindsight, had only small number of newspapers that were all published in the capital city of Prague.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t remember ever seeing a local newspaper.</span> <span id="s165">Television didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s166">Radio -- those people who could afford a radio, Czechoslovakia had only two or three radio stations which had three or four times a day news, the news were mostly of international nature.</span> <span id="s167">So that news penetrated very, very slowly at -- int -- to the population.</span> <span id="s168">Usually news that was of local importance appeared on a bulletin board.</span> <span id="s169">Every city had, on -- in the major streets, had big bulletin boards, where some officials used to paste announcements.</span> <span id="s170">But otherwise, you simply didn’t know what is happening, unless you heard it over the radio, or if you knew a foreign language, to listen to Radio Vienna or -- or -- or some adjacent city, listening to the news that way.</span> <span id="s171">So that people didn’t know exactly, what was happening -- what happened in the past.</span> <span id="s172">And I do not think that people were all that curious to find out somebody else’s experiences.</span> <span id="s173">Maybe -- Maybe -- Maybe people -- don’t forget that Christians in -- in those days, after the war, felt guilty.</span> <span id="s174">Because the Judaism in -- in -- in -- in -- in Czechoslovakia, the anti-Semitism was more of a religious character.</span> <span id="s175">We Jews were not so much despised by the Czechs because we were wealthy or -- or -- or -- or more successful, but whenever the word Jew was thrown into my face, it was always labeled, you Christ killer.</span> <span id="s176">So, you know -- and that was after the war against the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So, saying that was against the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes, against the Czech law, to point out that -- that expression.</span> <span id="s179">There was absolutely nothing forbidding to -- to be very antagonistic toward Gypsies, but the Jews were sheltered, as far as that goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did -- Did you experience any blatant anti-Semitism during those years that you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: To be very honest with you, no.</span> <span id="s184">If there was, it was well hidden.</span> <span id="s185">It was not -- not -- not obvious to me.</span> <span id="s186">Furthermore, I -- I think I was not even looking for it.</span> <span id="s187">I have not -- not memory that I have experienced anything of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you have Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Zenoimal had very, very small Jewish population.</span> <span id="s190">I -- I -- I think that there were about half a dozen Jewish families in -- in all of Zenoimal.</span> <span id="s191">No, I don’t remember any -- I don’t remember nobody my own age bracket.</span> <span id="s192">There were a couple Jewish families, but these people very much older.</span> <span id="s193">They were more my parents age.</span> <span id="s194">And then I was -- I had no particular reason to seek out Jews.</span> <span id="s195">I felt very comfortably with Christian friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: That’s a pretty difficult age, adol -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: That’s a pretty difficult age, adolescence, for anybody.</span> <span id="s198">Given that what you had gone through from ages, what, nine to 13?</span> <span id="s199">Was your adolescence -- do you remember it as being a happy time?</span> <span id="s200">A -- A difficult time?</span> <span id="s201">Or -- Or -- Or fairly normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I -- I -- I don’t -- I cannot recall my feelings, but I didn’t see anything extremely difficult in it.</span> <span id="s203">It was more of a physical discomfort.</span> <span id="s204">And simply I -- I think that we all were resigned to our fate.</span> <span id="s205">I did not know of the alternatives.</span> <span id="s206">Somehow it was made clear to me that complaining will not help, that we simply have to wait out end of the war.</span> <span id="s207">And I recognized that fact and tried to make -- not fight it.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What was your relationship with your parents during the period from the end of the war to the time you went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: That was -- that was a little bit strange.</span> <span id="s210">My father and my mother had frequent fights, but I never knew exactly the nature of the fights, because they were all done in my absence.</span> <span id="s211">You know, children, if they’re left out -- whenever something very serious took place, the children were sent out of the room, or parents waited for the children, while they were in school or outside, to -- to settle their differences.</span> <span id="s212">So there was a tension between my parents, but the tension was also caused, to a great deal, by my sister, who was no longer living with us.</span> <span id="s213">She was eight years older than I and she was trying to find her own way, recognizing that the c-city of Zenoimal d-does not have many opportunities to offer her.</span> <span id="s214">Furthermore, she was already marriage age, so she was living in -- in Prague and later on in Burno, in Brinn, working as a secretary -- steno for some firms.</span> <span id="s215">So there were also tensions caused because of her.</span> <span id="s216">But overall, the time after the war was not -- before I left for Israel, was not entirely smooth.</span> <span id="s217">And only later, when I came to Israel, I realized why.</span> <span id="s218">But by then, I was already thousands of miles away, not being in the position to influence the situation one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: And what was it that you realized at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s221">Now, I have to go a little bit back to talk about the last days prior to departure to Israel.</span> <span id="s222">I do not know whether, in retrospect -- I have to mention that after leaving for Israel, I have never seen my parents again.</span> <span id="s223">Consequently, I cannot ask them for details of those days.</span> <span id="s224">But, my father arranged for me to go to -- to emigrate to Israel with a group of youngsters my age.</span> <span id="s225">I have met with part of that group.</span> <span id="s226">Neither one of -- of the group was from Zenoimal, they all were dispersed throughout Czechoslovakia, but these individuals were already together a year or two in preparation for pioneering life in Israel.</span> <span id="s227">So, I was attached to that group.</span> <span id="s228">And that group belonged to a very left oriented political party.</span> <span id="s229">It was almost Communism.</span> <span id="s230">That -- the group had aimed to emigrate to Israel and supplement membership of a kibbutz -- very left oriented kibbutz.</span> <span id="s231">And I felt extremely uncomfortable after arriving in Israel, in that kibbutz type surrounding.</span> <span id="s232">Because, I was exposed to the Communist propaganda in 1948 and I was able to realize that the Russians were extremely anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s233">So, I began to realize that I fled Communism of Czechoslovakia, just to come into a different form of Communism in Israel.</span> <span id="s234">But it -- it -- it was not initiated in my mind by -- so much by politics, but by various actions of that group, to which I supposedly had to conform to their way of life.</span> <span id="s235">For example, all the personal clothes -- clothing were taken away.</span> <span id="s236">They were all arranged in a group type -- communal type bank.</span> <span id="s237">You got clothing, two sets a week, depending on your size.</span> <span id="s238">You didn’t know whose clothing you are wearing.</span> <span id="s239">Meals were given in a mess hall.</span> <span id="s240">Every morning you have to look at your schedule where you were attached to work that day.</span> <span id="s241">So I became extremely bitter, fleeing from Communism in Czechoslovakia, facing myself with Israeli Communism, although it was that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s242">Furthermore, no money.</span> <span id="s243">We were -- the kibbutz was quite a few miles from any village.</span> <span id="s244">Everything you needed, you had to go to the group leader and ask for it.</span> <span id="s245">Everything was allocated to you.</span> <span id="s246">Toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, shaving blades, shoelaces, everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s247">You were permitted to write one letter a month.</span> <span id="s248">It was -- that group gave you the postage stamp.</span> <span id="s249">So it was extremely regimented type of life, which -- which didn’t sit with me.</span> <span id="s250">But I’m not quite certain, my father signed some documents, which legally obligated me to that group.</span> <span id="s251">But I think -- yes, I exited Czechoslovakia on 10th of April, ‘49.</span> <span id="s252">It was a -- one of the last transports of Jews that was permitted to exit Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s253">There were about thousand of us.</span> <span id="s254">By train we rode from Prague to Italy.</span> <span id="s255">At that time was in existence, international refugee organization, was I think United Nations sponsored.</span> <span id="s256">And we ended up in a transition camp in Tranee, in Italy, which is not far away from that port, Barre, in Italy.</span> <span id="s257">And there we waited for ship to take us to Israel.</span> <span id="s258">We spent some two weeks in that camp because April ‘49 was Passover and the Israeli ship didn’t wanted to sail during Passover holiday.</span> <span id="s259">So when we came to Israel -- yes, I mentioned, we left 10th of April Prague, we arrived in Israel, 26th of April, ‘49 in Haifa.</span> <span id="s260">From there we went to transition camp, which again went against my grain because it had a fence -- concertina fence, with guards.</span> <span id="s261">We were sprayed heavily, DDT and each time you wanted to exit the camp, you had to clear it with the guards at the gate.</span> <span id="s262">And after several days in the camp, trucks came pick us -- pick -- pick us up and we were driven to the kibbutz, where all these events took place.</span> <span id="s263">So, in the kibbutz, I think we worked about three days a week and two days a week we learned Hebrew and geography of Israel.</span> <span id="s264">That was still in ‘49 -- in April ‘49, when we arrived.</span> <span id="s265">It was not quite a year since establishment of state of Israel, which I think came into existence in my -- May of ‘48.</span> <span id="s266">But then, the war with Arab nations took place, so I came to Israel just shortly after the cease fire with the Arab nations was signed.</span> <span id="s267">So there was still great deal of uncertainty whether it will not flair up once again.</span> <span id="s268">Do you have any questions up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: No, you were leading up to the story about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And that you’d found out that something about them --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s273">May I -- I will -- I will come to it little bit later?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: But I would like to skip it for the time being.</span> <span id="s276">In -- I came to the kibbutz, I think, in about -- taking the refugee camp into -- I think in May of ‘49, we finally came to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s277">And in November of ‘49, I quit.</span> <span id="s278">I simply had -- I had enough of it.</span> <span id="s279">I had some very distant relatives living in Haifa, so with their permission, I got room and board in their household.</span> <span id="s280">And from November of ‘49, to July of ‘50, I lived with them and worked on various odd jobs.</span> <span id="s281">In a factory for mirrors, in a factory for -- that was making plastic buttons for furniture.</span> <span id="s282">Until, in July of ‘50, I was drafted into the service.</span> <span id="s283">I ended up with agricultural unit which had na -- an acronym, Nuchile, nor koletseem luchem, and went to basic training in Jerusalem for three months.</span> <span id="s284">And after the basic training, we ended up -- again we were divided into groups and my group was put for a training of about six months in a different form of a kibbutz, called Moshaf.</span> <span id="s285">There we were to learn that particular trade -- that agricultural line and after the six months of training, we were to -- as a group of military personnel, we were to settle on the border with Jordan and build a village, an agricultural establishment.</span> <span id="s286">For that reason, we were discharged from uniform military, but had to stay for the duration of ma -- our military obligation in that village, under paramilitary rules.</span> <span id="s287">Leaving that village prior to expiration of the military obligation would have meant that you would have been drafted and put back into uniform.</span> <span id="s288">So, with various finagling, I was able to leave that village temporarily, because the village was unable to support all of us.</span> <span id="s289">So some -- some of us had to go and seek outside employment.</span> <span id="s290">And I found a job with a Israeli corporation that was laying a pipeline from Tel Aviv to the Negev desert.</span> <span id="s291">And part of my pay, I was sending to my village, not so much to support them economically, but to show good faith that I still am in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And this -- the village in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: In Israel.</span> <span id="s294">And that labor camp that was laying that pipeline, was on the edge of the desert Negev, about two hours by car from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s295">And that village that I was obligated to, was on the border of Jordan and Israel, where this was deeper, in the southern part of Israel.</span> <span id="s296">And in the labor camp -- it was a regular labor camp with the barracks made of wood.</span> <span id="s297">Every morning you exit to work on the pipeline and in the evening you return.</span> <span id="s298">There was a mess hall.</span> <span id="s299">You were paid regularly -- a regular salary according to classification of your particular work.</span> <span id="s300">And there I stayed for about a year, I think.</span> <span id="s301">In the meantime -- now I began to realize what was happening back in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s302">A radio announced the trials took place -- I don’t know whether you are familiar with that, in -- in the 50’s, quite few ministers of the Czech Republic were sentence to be hanged.</span> <span id="s303">You know, these were out of made -- made up trials, accusing them of being spies for the US And Stalin was simply out of his mind by -- by -- the Communist regime was very, very tight in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s304">Then one day, I received letter that my mother committed suicide, and now I have to go back again.</span> <span id="s305">Some place and some times, during the war, when we were hiding in the mountains, in the bunker, two fellows, young fellows, came to the bunker and I don’t know until this day how did they found us, suggesting that we should return, that they actually will help us across the border, back to Protecterat.</span> <span id="s306">Because Protecterat, by that time, was cleared of Jews.</span> <span id="s307">And if we will be in hiding in Protecterat, the Germans will have no reason to look for us, because all the Jews were already sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s308">So I don’t know the fine points, where we were to hide on the other side, but they were guiding us from the bunker, across the border, back to Protecterat, when we were to rest in a tourist resort, which was exactly on the border.</span> <span id="s309">And as we approached the tourist resort, subtly we heard barking of dogs.</span> <span id="s310">And that usually was a bad sign.</span> <span id="s311">So these two guys told us to wait, that they will go and take a look why the dogs are barking and they simply never came back.</span> <span id="s312">So, we returned to the bunker.</span> <span id="s313">And now events took place as I said before, normal.</span> <span id="s314">We waited out the war without knowing what happened to these two guys.</span> <span id="s315">After the war, we were called as witnesses to court.</span> <span id="s316">These two boys were supposedly caught in that resort by the Germans and forced to collaborate.</span> <span id="s317">I don’t know exactly what that meant -- these were young fellows, in -- in their early 20’s -- what was actually meant by collaborations, but in the early years, after the war, there were criminal cases by the hundreds, throughout the whole Czechoslovakia, against various collaborants with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s318">That took place long before the Communists took over Czech Republic.</span> <span id="s319">And we were called witn -- to be -- be witnesses on behalf of these two fellows.</span> <span id="s320">And I do not remember exactly what sentence did these two boys got or whether they were liberated.</span> <span id="s321">Unfortunately that did not end there.</span> <span id="s322">In 1948, while I was in the textile school, I started having feeling that not everything is okay at home, but I was unable to put my finger on it.</span> <span id="s323">Namely, every month, I came for a weekend home and my mother was always in tears and my father was furri -- furious.</span> <span id="s324">And I didn’t know whether these were -- whether they had differences as man and wife or what -- what -- what was nature of their conflict.</span> <span id="s325">So, sometimes -- and I don’t know exactly what time period, was I able to begin to put things together.</span> <span id="s326">I suspect that the first time I got some form of picture in 1965, when I visited Czechoslovakia back for the first time.</span> <span id="s327">The following thing has developed.</span> <span id="s328">These two boys joined a -- became member of a club, American - Czechoslovak friendship.</span> <span id="s329">And when Communists took over Czechoslovakia, they began to arrest all the members of this club.</span> <span id="s330">And the two fellows approached my mother, because we lived so near Austrian border, whether she can help them to escape to Austria.</span> <span id="s331">And it was a whole group of Czech patriots in Zenoimal, who were involved in helping to escape -- various people.</span> <span id="s332">There was custom officials involved in it.</span> <span id="s333">Postal officials involved in it.</span> <span id="s334">They smuggled people on trucks that went across the border to de-de-deliver packages.</span> <span id="s335">So people were hiding behind the packages.</span> <span id="s336">But nevertheless, the Secret Police got wind of it and arrested the whole group of people, including my mother, and put them on trial.</span> <span id="s337">And I still have at home, documents of the trial, the whole protocol.</span> <span id="s338">I do not remember when -- how long the trial took place -- for how long, but my mother was freed, simply because she claimed that she wanted to -- to repay the boys their goodness that they helped us to -- tried to help us during the war.</span> <span id="s339">She was freed.</span> <span id="s340">But the Secret Czech Police tried to convert my mother into a snitch to spy on others.</span> <span id="s341">My mother was imprisoned for about half a year.</span> <span id="s342">And in 1952 or ‘53, out of desperation, she jumped out of the window of the police station.</span> <span id="s343">And that -- what I got in a letter notice while I was in that labor camp in Israel, building the pipeline, I got a letter from my sister.</span> <span id="s344">So, as time went by, bits and piece of -- of the pieces began to -- to make sense what was happening.</span> <span id="s345">And even though my parents send me to Israel, they promised that they will join me in the next transport.</span> <span id="s346">And looking at it back now, I think there are two versions -- two possibilities.</span> <span id="s347">The Czech government began to realize that it is letting too many medical doctors out of Czechoslovakia and they are weakening their own economy.</span> <span id="s348">So they stopped issuing emigration permits to medical doctors.</span> <span id="s349">That is one possibility.</span> <span id="s350">The other possibility is that my mother was already heavily investigated by the secret police and they did not wanted to let my parents exit.</span> <span id="s351">Which of the two forms is correct, I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You’ve had to piece this story together yourself, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s354">My sister didn’t wanted to help me much, because apparently it was too horrible for her to repeat it.</span> <span id="s355">But my sister was living nearby and she must have witnessed every step of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Did you have any contact with your father or did you speak with your father or -- or correspond after you --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Just correspondence.</span> <span id="s358">But don’t forget that my father died in about 1962.</span> <span id="s359">My mother died in ‘53.</span> <span id="s360">Their letters were heavily censored.</span> <span id="s361">Every letter that left for western country was very heavily censored, so that you were absolutely in no position to -- to get clear answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Wh-What is the effect of the news of your mother’s suicide on you, in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was devastating, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s364">For short while I started blaming my father, not knowing the details.</span> <span id="s365">I thought that she committed suicide because of some -- some family disputes.</span> <span id="s366">So I had ab -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Wh-What is the effect of the news of your mother’s suicide on you, in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: It was devastating, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s369">For short while I started blaming my father, not knowing the details.</span> <span id="s370">I thought that she committed suicide because of some -- some family disputes.</span> <span id="s371">So I had absolutely no evidence as to the true nature of what was happening.</span> <span id="s372">So, for long time, I was angry at my father.</span> <span id="s373">But slowly, slowly, the picture began to clear itself up.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: I -- I read, I believe, the transcripts of your video interview, that -- that you believed the -- the rape of your mother during hiding had something to do with -- might have had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s375">Is that -- is that not correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I -- I don’t think that that -- because that -- her -- her suicide took place nine years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s378">There -- there was a trial -- the men who raped your mother were put on trial, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Not the man himself, but the commandant of that unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And were you present for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s382">Apparently, there was enough -- the evidence -- and I came across his name not long ago, here, in the museum.</span> <span id="s383">That -- that trial had such heavy evidence against him for so many other things, that this was not needed.</span> <span id="s384">Although it would have been pleasure, maybe, to be present at the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Where was the trial, and what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: The trial was in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s387">He was Slovak.</span> <span id="s388">The trial, I think, was in 1946.</span> <span id="s389">Again, it was one of hundreds and hundreds of trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And what became of this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I think that he got the rope.</span> <span id="s392">So, you know, being very cynical, everybody can die only once.</span> <span id="s393">So -- but I -- I know I was shaken up by my mother’s suicide.</span> <span id="s394">But, then the trials were taking place, you know, for the government in -- in Czechoslovakia and friend of mine who -- with whom I was sharing room in that labor camp, Puther Margolias, his uncle was -- also got the rope.</span> <span id="s395">So we shared our misfortune with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You’re not aware of what happened to the man under this commander who -- who was executed?</span> <span id="s397">The -- The man who actually committed the rape?</span> <span id="s398">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s399">No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: There were farmers who helped you out --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: -- during your hi -- period in hiding, and a Lutheran minister?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you ever go back and find out what happened to them, or talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Is that later in the story, when you returned, or is this during?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No, no, it just about a year ago, I wrote about -- and it came in a very interesting fashion, back.</span> <span id="s409">I wrote about my experiences in a magazine called Phoenix, which was dealing with these issues and apparently somebody has read my story and he and his wife went for a visit to Czechoslovakia and spent part of their time to retracing my experiences.</span> <span id="s410">And they also published their experiences in the same magazine.</span> <span id="s411">When I came, in ‘65, to Czechoslovakia back, for the first time, I was told by my sister -- I asked about that minister, and my sister was not quite sure what has happened to him, except knowing that he has spent some time in jail.</span> <span id="s412">But, my first visit in Czechoslovakia was only two weeks long and I simply did not have enough time, nor I didn’t know just what can I do under the Communist regime and what can I not?</span> <span id="s413">Because I came from US, which was their biggest enemy and every time you went to a city, you had to report with the local police station, who registered.</span> <span id="s414">And when you exited, you had again to let them know that you are leaving.</span> <span id="s415">So, I didn’t know exactly what -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s416">But this fellow wrote up that the minister was imprisoned by the Communists and freed eventually, after several years, but in such a poor health, that not long thereafter, he died.</span> <span id="s417">And I have that article with -- even with his photo, of that minister.</span> <span id="s418">You see, there were couple Christians, during our experiences, who actually practiced Christianity.</span> <span id="s419">Who didn’t just go Sundays to church, who actually practiced Christianity.</span> <span id="s420">But there were very few and far in between.</span> <span id="s421">And the minister was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Do you know what became of some of the farmers that helped you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: One of them was executed with his whole family, for hiding us.</span> <span id="s424">That was after we were caught, because we didn’t report, like we promised, so he was executed with his family.</span> <span id="s425">Another farmer, his son was a schoolteacher, who actually supplied me with a false school certificate, giving me an assumed name and assume identity.</span> <span id="s426">He was caught by helping partisans, and executed.</span> <span id="s427">So, his father’s lost two sons.</span> <span id="s428">Some of them simply died natural death.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Were you close to those families -- those farm families?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: You spent a lot of time with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Sort of like aunts and uncles, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Well, they were very close to us, because most of them -- not all of them, but most of them did it in gratitude towards my grandfather, because he was their medical doctor.</span> <span id="s435">He was responsible for their well beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What -- What happened to your grandparents after the war?</span> <span id="s437">A: We are talking about my maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s438">Well, my -- my paternal grandparents -- my grandmother and my aunt went into concentration camps and perished there.</span> <span id="s439">And my maternal grandparents that were with us all the time, returned after the war to their house in Slovakia and simply died of old age.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: What was your relationship with them?</span> <span id="s441">Did you stay in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s443">That was a very close relationship, very close relationship.</span> <span id="s444">Because it was our grandfather who actually -- due to his profession and due to his contacts, saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So you visited with them and spent some time with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you communicate with -- with them and -- when you had gone to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: In -- Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s449">But again, the letters were in a -- in a sort of a cryptic form, not very clear.</span> <span id="s450">You had always to read between lines and fictitious names and symbols.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: When did you find out about your -- your father’s parents, that they had died in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, my grandparents -- my grandfather from my father’s side, died in 1923.</span> <span id="s453">That was long before Hitler.</span> <span id="s454">I do not know the circumstances of his death.</span> <span id="s455">My grandmother and aunt, they simply have not returned to co -- from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s456">I do not know exactly in what form the Czech provisional government notified the relatives of those people who failed to return.</span> <span id="s457">I don’t know in what form they did it.</span> <span id="s458">But, you assumed that after the war has ended, if you were not contacted within some sensible period of time, that the person simply has died.</span> <span id="s459">So I think that it became very -- then, it also became clear to us that my grandmother, when -- when she went to concentration camp was already some 75.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">Do you know which camp she was sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, and if -- if you wish, we can look it up in the Theresien book -- in that memorial book.</span> <span id="s463">She and her daughter, my aunt, first went to Theresienstadt and then they continued from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s464">But, the fact that somebody was shipped from Theresienstadt in a transport to a different camp, that does not mean that that person has actually died in that camp.</span> <span id="s465">That person may have died while he was transported to the camp.</span> <span id="s466">And that, nobody will ever be able to establish the fact that certain people have died already, on the train.</span> <span id="s467">Those that went to gas chambers, okay, they’re registered in the camp, going to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s468">But those that died on the road to the concentration camps, that would never be, probably, established, where exactly, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: I wanted to go back to y-your father’s decision to have you go to Israel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What was the -- the motivation?</span> <span id="s472">What was his reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s474">My father, in all likelihood, felt very uncomfortably with the approaching Communist regime.</span> <span id="s475">And it didn’t take him too long to convince me to leave Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s476">He sweeten it up by the fact that they will -- he and mother will join me and we’ll start life in a free country again.</span> <span id="s477">Then, I began to feel pressure in that factory where I was apprentice, in that school, began to feel pressure, Communist pressure to conform.</span> <span id="s478">I already began to feel it, even before I left for that trade school, in my soccer club.</span> <span id="s479">My soccer team was suddenly required to come to a Communist school.</span> <span id="s480">I don’t know how -- how -- they used to call it agitation center.</span> <span id="s481">It was sort of a cultural center, in which the Communist events took place.</span> <span id="s482">So we were -- if you want to play soccer next Sunday, you have to come Tuesday, wearing a white shirt and a red scarf, to that Communist cultural center and start singing various songs glorifying the labor.</span> <span id="s483">If you will not come, you will not play soccer game next Sunday.</span> <span id="s484">So that all started to go against my grain.</span> <span id="s485">I don’t think it was with a full understanding what Communism is, but all that order giving process began to remind me so much of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s486">Didn’t the Nazis did exactly the same thing to me?</span> <span id="s487">Telling me what stores can I visit, what streets can I go to and what am I permitted to do and what not permitted to do?</span> <span id="s488">So that began to ring in my -- hey, we are going into another -- another -- another commini -- another Nazi era.</span> <span id="s489">But instead of swastikas, this one has a -- has a hammer and sickle.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Well, then you faced the conformity in Israel as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: And then I began to face the same thing again, in Israel was starting to take place.</span> <span id="s492">So all of that rang bell, back to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s493">And the Communism, whether yo-you are being taught by a Jew or by a Christian, doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s494">It’s the same lady in a different dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What was the name of that left leaning group that -- that you went with to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: It was a political party called Ma Pum.</span> <span id="s497">I do not believe that it exists any more, it simply changed it’s name today.</span> <span id="s498">But it was not Vanegorian, nor Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s499">It was Ma Pum.</span> <span id="s500">It was a very leftist, Zionistic, Communist organization.</span> <span id="s501">Marx, Lenin, all nine yards involved, only having a Jewish flavor.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: I read somewhere that where you said you were lonely in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: That -- That -- because I didn’t fit that particular group, I was ostracized.</span> <span id="s504">I felt very lonely, at least in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s505">Then, in July of ‘50, when I joined the military, the army, at least in the basic training, I f -- began to feel very comfortably.</span> <span id="s506">Because these were all fellows my age and the Israeli military, at least in the basic training, in my days, gave me the same feeling like a US soldier must have when he joins the Marine Corps, that you have a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And did you feel loyalty toward Israel?</span> <span id="s508">Or patriotism toward Israel in -- in being in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I do not think that it came so much -- that it was so much question of patriotism toward Israel, because I still kept hoping that my parents will come.</span> <span id="s510">But as -- when my mother committed suicide, it became quite clear to me that my father will never leave.</span> <span id="s511">I started losing -- I don’t think that I had Zionistic enthusiasm.</span> <span id="s512">Israel, for me, didn’t mean much, because I simply didn’t had the upbringing or the contacts with that affili -- that kind affiliation.</span> <span id="s513">I started looking toward US because I had here an uncle, my father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When did you begin to think about US?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: To be honest with you, I already started thinking about it on the ship, while we were sailing from Italy to Israel.</span> <span id="s516">I already approad the captain of the ship, asking him how do I emigrate to America and I remember that shocking expression on his face.</span> <span id="s517">Here he is, responsible for some ship of 1500 immigrants and people are already asking him how to exit Israel.</span> <span id="s518">So he told me, “Young man, you will have to give first Israel lots of sweat and blood before you will be able to exit Israel.”</span> <span id="s519">But that was my first thought.</span> <span id="s520">What, if ever, things will not work out?</span> <span id="s521">Because I -- I wanted very badly, family.</span> <span id="s522">And I didn’t had in Israel, nobody truly close.</span> <span id="s523">They -- the closest was in US or in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: That’s -- it’s interesting that you would feel lonely, you know, obviously you were missing your parents, but there were so many other survivors in Israel, that one would think that there might be some common bond.</span> <span id="s525">But did -- did you feel that, or did -- and did you talk about your experience much while you were in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s527">You see, this is -- although it is a very logical assumption, but it’s completely false.</span> <span id="s528">Number one -- it’s false for two reasons.</span> <span id="s529">Number one, in the first years after liberation, if you will, everybody tried to forget the past.</span> <span id="s530">That has not changed, even with people’s arrival to Israel.</span> <span id="s531">You see, everybody has a different time limit for forgetting.</span> <span id="s532">Some forget quickly, some forget never.</span> <span id="s533">But, people were not very open and willing to talk about their individual experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s534">Secondly, everybody who came to Israel, with the exception of those that ended up in a kibbutz, had to start finding their own living -- making their own living.</span> <span id="s535">And that began to -- to take majority of their time and occupation, to -- to try to si -- find some economic way of supporting themselves.</span> <span id="s536">So that -- that was reason number two.</span> <span id="s537">These were the two most important reasons.</span> <span id="s538">And reason number three, that although majority of the Jews of those days that came to Israel were survivors of the Holocaust, but they came from different countries.</span> <span id="s539">So, consequently they did not had much in common, culturally, except, you know -- I don’t know, it -- it -- it is still -- it still puzzles me even today, you know, the only thing that we do have in common, maybe, is the Bible.</span> <span id="s540">But once everybody grows up in -- in different country, under different circumstances, the only thing that we have in common are that we are all human beings, you know?</span> <span id="s541">The culture affinity isn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: You said in your video interview, one of the reasons why I never liked Israel is because I always felt that the wound of the Holocaust will never heal --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: -- if you will continuously --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: -- remind -- be reminded of it every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s548">You know, the Israeli government tried to -- to establish a bond between the newcomers and the oldtimes and the state of Israel and they did so -- one of their very may -- met -- maybe effective weapons was continuously try to remind us that it was Israel who accepted us after the war.</span> <span id="s549">Because the Communists wouldn’t let you to emigrate anyplace else, except to Israel.</span> <span id="s550">And the Israeli government also, in -- in their propaganda, was preaching that in -- in -- in unity is -- is strength and in division is weakness.</span> <span id="s551">So, you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s552">I -- I -- I’m not easily -- I was never easily influenced by -- by that kind of propaganda, because I have experienced it many times before.</span> <span id="s553">Maybe I’m -- even today, it takes me awhile to sort things out, but eventually I think I -- I see the light.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: The -- The comment about -- your comment about the wound of the Holocaust will never heal if you continuously reminded of it, is sort of in contrast to the other -- th-the famous -- I guess maybe it’s Elie Wiesel, you know, where we’re doomed to repeat if we -- if we don’t remember.</span> <span id="s555">D-Do you see those two in -- in contrast, or are you talking about what was going on in Israel, with -- with the Israeli government constantly reminding you as a way of bonding you together?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No, you see, the difference probably, without having been able to analyze it from that angle, I think the basic difference between my bitterness or -- or scars of the Holocaust and Elie W-Wiesel or Wiesel’s is a difference i-in our ages.</span> <span id="s557">You know, I -- I -- I don’t know exactly how old Elie is, whether he is my age or he’s older, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s558">But then, the Holocaust itself does -- didn’t affect everybody equally.</span> <span id="s559">It -- It depends on your emotional make-up.</span> <span id="s560">So that for me, at least, I -- I fear and I am playing back, you know, sometimes in my mind, I am going -- I am doing like the Monday morning quarterback talk.</span> <span id="s561">Undoubtedly, had my mother not being involved in that affair, had Czechoslovakia not been raped by the Nazis, then Czechoslovakia -- had not been for the Nazis, Czechoslovakia would not have been Communist in ‘48, I would have had probably a normal childhood, like thousands and thousands of people in -- in the US have, who grow up normal lives, you know?</span> <span id="s562">Even here, no -- not -- not everybody is liked by everybody, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s563">But if you -- you -- you have freedom to -- to move, you have freedom to -- to select, to do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s564">But the Holocaust put on me a label.</span> <span id="s565">I still feel the yellow star here.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: A-And what goes along with that feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Feelings of inferiority.</span> <span id="s568">Feelings of second class citizenship.</span> <span id="s569">Suspicion.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B [blank] Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: -- feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Feelings of inferiority.</span> <span id="s573">Feelings of second class citizenship.</span> <span id="s574">Suspicion… These probably are the first things that come to my mind.</span> <span id="s575">Certain amount of bitterness, specially of having lost time.</span> <span id="s576">Because, as I told you initially, I continuously feel I’m out of sync.</span> <span id="s577">I am about 15 to 20 years behind in experiences.</span> <span id="s578">I’m certainly not fully acclimatized.</span> <span id="s579">Language problems, cultural barriers, if you will.</span> <span id="s580">I don’t feel comfortably in large groups of people.</span> <span id="s581">So, you know, these are some of -- some of the residues.</span> <span id="s582">But again, as I told you, I don’t know exactly to what degree they are a product of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: An-And how much were the -- are the products of just who you are or who you would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s587">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Do you spend much time thinking about that, or -- or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: You know, I -- it’s interesting how it -- how it -- how it -- how it started.</span> <span id="s590">I think that I began to think about it when I started working for the US government, with Affirmative Action.</span> <span id="s591">That what triggered the whole blasted thing in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well, again, I began to feel categorizing people, bracketing people by nationality, by religion, by color.</span> <span id="s594">I again began to feel like I was going back to those blasted Nazis.</span> <span id="s595">Didn’t -- did -- didn’t they do exactly the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Eve-Even though the motivation was supposedly for --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Completely different, but it reminds me so much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: What was the job and what -- what year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Well, I joined the federal government in 1972 and I began to feel the Affirmative Action for the first time in 1974 or 1975.</span> <span id="s600">It may have been called differently in those days, but so many slots have to be allotted to women, so many to minorities, people with Hispanic names.</span> <span id="s601">You know, it again started labeling people who have priority over you, to whom you have to sacrifice your progress, because they are disadvantaged.</span> <span id="s602">But then I began to ask myself, “Gosh, why are they disadvantaged?”</span> <span id="s603">I came here with 10 dollars in my pocket, waiting five years for emigration visa to the US.</span> <span id="s604">I started in New York as a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s605">And I started going to night school, first in preparation for GED high school equivalency test, then after passing that, I was going to college at night, paying for it through my own pocket.</span> <span id="s606">So I was begging to ask, “Why are those people given all the privileges, where I was not given it?”</span> <span id="s607">I never asked for it, didn’t wanted it.</span> <span id="s608">It’s a free country, you can do whatever you want to.</span> <span id="s609">So, I again begin to feel I am cheated by something.</span> <span id="s610">I had to work and pay for it and they get it free of charge.</span> <span id="s611">On the contrary, they are encouraged to come forward and raise a hand.</span> <span id="s612">And I -- I -- I know it’s very unfair to make that comparison, but that’s exactly how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Have -- Have those feelings been resolved, or do you still ask that question?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: They were later on reinforced, when I -- it’s a long story, an ugly one, when I was forced to resign from the government.</span> <span id="s615">I -- I rej-rejoined it at a lower grade, with a different command.</span> <span id="s616">I worked for the Department of Defense.</span> <span id="s617">I joined a military district of Washington, where I even got a supervisory -- low supervisory position, but I was supervising black workers.</span> <span id="s618">And there it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s621">But not the same anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s622">It was just -- just different kind of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s623">You know, there is economics anti-Semitism and there is religious anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: And what kind was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: This was probably the economic anti-Semitism, connected with envy.</span> <span id="s626">That you Jews are born smart.</span> <span id="s627">You Jews own all the banks.</span> <span id="s628">You Jews have formed some con-conspiratory groups to wipe us out.</span> <span id="s629">And in addition to anti-Semitism, it was also intensified by being white.</span> <span id="s630">The fact that I have tried to -- to explain to -- to -- to these people that there are many black Jews, too, who eventually feel exactly like the blacks feel here.</span> <span id="s631">The black Jews of Israel are also extremely unhappy with their lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Did this anti-Semitism that you experienced -- you said this was in the -- in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: In civil service.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Civil service?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: A-And what was -- what were the -- what were the years, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: That very strong ones, with the -- with the black population, that was from 1988 through 1997.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And did that make it difficult for you to do your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s640">Extremely difficult, extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s641">Eventually, I -- I resigned my supervisory position.</span> <span id="s642">But that didn’t -- didn’t make it any easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Did you say you were forced to resign?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, I was forced to resign as a civil service, but that may have been -- may have been an anti-Semitic -- may have had a reason, anti-Semitic, but I am not hundred percent sure.</span> <span id="s645">Can we take a short break?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: I was curious about your time in Israel -- just finishing up your time in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Cause you had said that you were reminded of the Holocaust every day, or -- or often.</span> <span id="s651">How -- How were you reminded?</span> <span id="s652">How was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Well, it was pointed out th-that Israel was, after all, the only country that was willing to admit us as immigrants.</span> <span id="s654">That unless we Jews will stick together, the Holocaust can reoccur once again.</span> <span id="s655">And that we Jews are hated every place we go and we have to stick together in a -- in one country and not be dispersed throughout the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And what was the effect of that message upon you?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Frankly speaking, I said baloney.</span> <span id="s658">I always felt very comfortably living side by side with people of all religion and all national origins.</span> <span id="s659">And I didn’t see any reason for living in a pure or elistic type society.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And your -- your plans, even from -- you had said earlier, your -- your boat trip to Israel, where you were looking beyond.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Can you talk about the events that led you to -- to leave Israel and come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: I do not think that it happened -- the decision probably started already in Czechoslovakia, because I do not believe that my parents truly planned to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s664">Later on, it -- it -- it turned that that was the only way out, but the original plan was to join my uncle in New York and my father already, in Czechoslovakia, started learning English and prepare himself for US dental examination for foreign doctors, which he knew that he will eventually have to take.</span> <span id="s665">So that the seeds were already planted in my mind in Czechoslovakia and I started putting them into action in about 1952, I believe.</span> <span id="s666">Not knowingly.</span> <span id="s667">I was still in the Israeli military.</span> <span id="s668">I walked to the emba -- American embassy in Tel Aviv and they asked me several questions and when they discovered that I’m still under military obligation, they told me that they cannot even register me until I am discharged from the army.</span> <span id="s669">And about 1953, I came back.</span> <span id="s670">I was already di-discharged.</span> <span id="s671">They said they cannot register me once again, because US has closed emigration quota for Czechoslovakia, because Czechoslovakia supplies arms to North Korea.</span> <span id="s672">And, as you know, at least in those days, emigration quota to US was determined by the country of your birth, not of your si -- current -- present situ -- citizenship.</span> <span id="s673">And Czechoslovak quota was very small, furthermore, it was closed.</span> <span id="s674">Furthermore, I had no right to any preferential quota.</span> <span id="s675">So that I would be asked, if I still was interested, to come back once the closure is lifted.</span> <span id="s676">So I came back in ‘54, when finally I was able to register under a non-preferential quota and it took five years before finally I was called to submit my documents.</span> <span id="s677">By that time I have discovered that I don’t have a birth certificate, so I have to go to the Czech embassy to apply for birth certificate.</span> <span id="s678">Then, I didn’t know I had to submit an affidavit of support, which I had to obtain from somebody in the US.</span> <span id="s679">So I had to write to my relatives in Czechoslovakia and my grandfather was able to broker -- can you visualize Communist censored letters from Czechoslovakia to US, trying to broker for me a affidavit of support to come to the US?</span> <span id="s680">It was very, very delicate operation and through some very distant relatives whom I -- until that point, never met, sent me an affidavit of support and lend me money for passage, because my savings went all for preparation of the papers, because everything had to be translated from Czech to English and from Hebrew into English and the Israelis had to pay some taxes, because -- which I -- I’m not so certain that you know of that fact, that when you emigrate to Israel, the Israeli government, at it’s own expense, puts you through a language course and puts you through that refugee camp.</span> <span id="s681">But, for all that the Israeli government pays, from the donation of the American government, the dollars and the Jews that donate money to Israel.</span> <span id="s682">So, a certain fixed amount of money is granted for absorption of a single person or a family and so forth and so forth.</span> <span id="s683">And that is a open debt which you have.</span> <span id="s684">As long as you are staying in Israel, the debt is never called, but once you want to leave Israel, they send you a bill for all that.</span> <span id="s685">So I had to pay it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: How much was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Today it would be equivalent to about 500 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: But if you are earning about 30 dollars a month, 500 dollars is lots of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And you were, at this time in your early 20’s?</span> <span id="s691">A: In -- in my -- about middle 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Early to middle 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What -- What were you doing -- what -- for employment, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Okay, I was a taxi driver at night -- night time employ taxi driver.</span> <span id="s696">I worked for time for a inter-urban taxi company that had the old DeSoto taxis, seven seaters.</span> <span id="s697">We competed with the bus service from city to city.</span> <span id="s698">Then I worked in the cities as night taxi driver.</span> <span id="s699">And shortly before emigration, I finally found a job in a refinery, as a laboratory technician.</span> <span id="s700">I was taking a course with the Haifa Institute of Technology, an extension division course for laboratory technicians, so I found a job there.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did you -- Did you have any other schooling in -- during this time in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: In Israel, only those -- the half a year that I was in the kibbutz and apparently got maybe two days a week some lessons in Hebrew, geography and little bit history and language, but no -- no -- nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Were you involved romantically with anyone?</span> <span id="s704">Did you have relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I think that I came close to it several times, but none never -- never anything developed to -- to a serious stage.</span> <span id="s706">There was -- there was, again, the differences in cultural background, you know?</span> <span id="s707">The fact that two people are Jewish doesn’t -- doesn’t make them automatically see eye to eye.</span> <span id="s708">There are that -- the s -- very same differences, like between here, a man and woman, you know, they are no different.</span> <span id="s709">Then Israel, in those days, had economic -- tremendous economic difficulties.</span> <span id="s710">Apartments were in very short supply.</span> <span id="s711">In those days it was almost impossible to rent an apartment in Israel.</span> <span id="s712">You had either to buy it, like you buy a co-op here, or a condominium, or you have to put key money.</span> <span id="s713">I don’t know whether you are ever -- you know, familiar with that concept of key money.</span> <span id="s714">Let’s say you are renting an apartment.</span> <span id="s715">You have to put -- just as an example -- 10,000 dollars as a deposit to the landlord and you pay him a month, 10 dollar rent.</span> <span id="s716">The next year, your deposit goes down to -- from 10,000 to 9,000 and your rent goes up to 20 dollars.</span> <span id="s717">The third year your key deposit goes down to 800 dollars and you have to pay him 30 dollars a month in rent.</span> <span id="s718">When it reaches zero, can you see the see saw?</span> <span id="s719">When it reaches zero, you have to start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s720">And simply, very few people have the money to put for the key deposit, so that many couples cannot get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Was that a -- a difficult time of your life, i-in Israel, those five years waiting for --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: -- the papers to come through?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, that was -- that was not so difficult from economic point of view, because taxi drivers, you know, were able to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s725">But the problem was that when there came something as more serious decision to be made, a long term commitment, I did not know which way to go, because I have -- had -- had no assurance that I will ever receive visa to US.</span> <span id="s726">And even if -- if I did, I never knew when it will come.</span> <span id="s727">It was continuously disrupted by my being recalled to reserve duty, to the military.</span> <span id="s728">By that time, I had already the rank of corporal in the Israeli army and the higher your rank is, the longer period you serve in the reserve obligations.</span> <span id="s729">And they slice your obligation into segments, it’s not one unit.</span> <span id="s730">It’s a week here, two weeks here.</span> <span id="s731">And the Israeli economy in those days, even when you worked, they did not reimburse you with salary to -- to the time you had to serve in the military.</span> <span id="s732">And you got military pay according to your rank and that was peanuts, because the Israeli military claimed that they are feeding you, they are dressing you, so they give you only couple dollars monthly spending money -- pocket money for cigarettes and razor blades.</span> <span id="s733">And in the meantime, if you rented someplace a room, you still had to pay rent for the room after you exit the reserve obligation.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So, it was 1959 when --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: -- you finally got your papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: -- yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: -- taken care of?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Can you tell me about your -- your trip to the United States and what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Okay, the trip -- the trip itself, I don’t know why I felt very ambivalent because I knew what I am leaving behind, but I didn’t know what I went facing.</span> <span id="s742">Israel, in those days -- Lute Airport didn’t accommodate jets.</span> <span id="s743">I flew out with a Super Constellation, four engine prop airplane from Tel Aviv -- from Lute, which is not far away from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s744">Our first stop was Paris.</span> <span id="s745">I flew with Air France.</span> <span id="s746">In Paris, I stayed about two or three hours and boarded another Super Constellation to New York.</span> <span id="s747">And Paris already accommodated jets, so there were about four passengers on the whole Air France jet prop plane to New York.</span> <span id="s748">By the way, the jet planes fair was more expensive than the prop.</span> <span id="s749">So I slept almost all -- from Paris to New York, it took about 12 hours.</span> <span id="s750">Stretched myself across all those three or four seats and slept most of the way.</span> <span id="s751">Arriving in New York, it was not Kennedy Airport, but it was Idlewild Airport in those days.</span> <span id="s752">I arrived, I think about 4:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s753">The immigration officer was already sleeping behind his desk.</span> <span id="s754">I think I was the only immigrant.</span> <span id="s755">The airport was deserted.</span> <span id="s756">He looked at my papers and say, “You just made it in time.”</span> <span id="s757">I came three days before my entry visa was to expire.</span> <span id="s758">And there were waiting some very distant relatives, for me, at Idlewild Airport, who took me to their apartment in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s759">I slept there, I think, for about 10 hours.</span> <span id="s760">First time that I was able to eat a decent European type meal and have apples.</span> <span id="s761">You know Israel is very, very short on apples, because of the climate.</span> <span id="s762">And I went to visit my uncle and aunt, from whom I had a letter waiting for me at the airport, to come to visit them.</span> <span id="s763">Do we have any gaps to close?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Well, I don’t know whether we talked about this on tape, or whether I asked you on tape, or whether, when we were discussing this earlier, why you had chosen -- why you had decided to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Oh, because of -- because I realized that my family from Czechoslovakia will not join me and the second best -- I wanted family -- was my uncle, my father’s brother, who used to be extremely wealthy, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s766">And now I have to digress little bit from this original -- from the story.</span> <span id="s767">You see, my family, like many Jewish, central European families, my family was very large, but dispersed.</span> <span id="s768">The dispersion was not caused by Hitler, but it was caused by the break up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.</span> <span id="s769">Consequently, people who were born in Vienna or in Budapest, finally -- suddenly found themselves being citizens of a independent, but different country.</span> <span id="s770">The monarchy disappeared.</span> <span id="s771">And as a result, there was a barrier between us, because they were living in foreign countries.</span> <span id="s772">Not only that, but at the time of the break up of the monarchy, I think in 1920 -- around 1920’s, US established immigration quotas and there was no longer Austro-Hungarian quota, which never existed anyhow, but everybody who went to come to the US, came according to the quota of the country of which he was a citizen now, in which he was born.</span> <span id="s773">So some people had to wait long time, some people didn’t had to wait long at all.</span> <span id="s774">Some family’s entry to the US was actually broken up because the husband was born in a different country than the wife.</span> <span id="s775">And my uncle, after the first World War ended, was one of f-four brothers.</span> <span id="s776">Leo, who was the oldest one, emigrated to United States in 1913, one step ahead of the police.</span> <span id="s777">He was gamble -- he was gambling in cards and horses and apparently signed some IOU’s, which he was unable to redeem.</span> <span id="s778">So, the Austrian police was after him, and in those days, if you were a crook in Europe, you came to United States, like Al Capone.</span> <span id="s779">So, he came to the US.</span> <span id="s780">He settled here, but severed contacts with his family, so we didn’t know whether he is alive or not.</span> <span id="s781">And he lived in New Jersey, in a small town called Morristown, about one hour from New York City.</span> <span id="s782">His brother Herbert became extremely wealthy textile mer -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: -- became extremely wealthy textile merchant in Brinn -- in Burno, second largest city in Czechoslovakia, dealing with silk.</span> <span id="s784">In those days, silk was still in it’s pure form imported from China, was very expensive.</span> <span id="s785">And he was a multi-millionaire, who every year spend vacation in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s786">And, at the start, when Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia in ‘38, he found himself in Switzerland, vacationing with his whole family.</span> <span id="s787">So, he never went back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s788">He had enough money with him, still, to make him very comfortable, but no longer multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s789">From Switzerland, he went to France and from France to Portugal.</span> <span id="s790">Someplace along the road, he obtained entrance visa to US, which later on proved to be false, not valid.</span> <span id="s791">In Portugal, he finally -- no, he obtained visa to Canada, which was not fal -- which was false.</span> <span id="s792">So, in Portugal, he was able to obtain visa to US and from Portugal he emigrated to New York, where he settled and became partner in a textile store.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: This is Herbert --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Herbert --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Deutsch?</span> <span id="s796">Was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Deutsch, Herbert Deutsch.</span> <span id="s798">He, his wife and his daughter.</span> <span id="s799">But his wife, excuse me that expression, was a bitch.</span> <span id="s800">She didn’t wanted me to US.</span> <span id="s801">And every letter that I wrote to him, pertaining to an affidavit of support, she didn’t showed him.</span> <span id="s802">She threw it into garbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Why didn’t she want you to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Because she was afraid that it will cost them money to support me.</span> <span id="s805">She was very greedy.</span> <span id="s806">She was a very hateful woman.</span> <span id="s807">You know, why some people are hateful, she all -- supposedly came from a family that was full of hate, so she was very hateful.</span> <span id="s808">Their marriage was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s809">In 1955, I think that Herbert has discovered his brother Leon, living 50 miles from him.</span> <span id="s810">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: In Morrisstown?</span> <span id="s812">A: In Morrisstown.</span> <span id="s813">But Herbert never forgave to Leon those years of silence and the heartbreak he caused to Jenny -- to his mother, by not letting himself known that he is alive.</span> <span id="s814">So that was Herbert, living in New York, he didn’t send me affidavit of support.</span> <span id="s815">My grandfather brokered that affidavit of support through a distant branch of the family, who were born in Austria, who went first to Cuba and from Cuba came to the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What were your first impressions of -- of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I was overwhelmed, simply by it’s size, by it’s complexity.</span> <span id="s818">I was like Alice in Wonderland.</span> <span id="s819">I was perplexed, to be very basically honest with you, with American packaging.</span> <span id="s820">I bought a shoe polish, I remember and I was lost about how to open the lid of it.</span> <span id="s821">That was the first time that I bought milk in a paper container.</span> <span id="s822">I was unable to follow instructions how to open various things and how to approach.</span> <span id="s823">Push here, pull here, you know?</span> <span id="s824">With left finger here, right finger there.</span> <span id="s825">I was totally lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: And I familiarized myself with American culture by watching television, but I got many wrong impressions, because in those days there were shows like “Father Knows Best”, where there was solution to every problem.</span> <span id="s830">And I said to myself, “That’s impossible that America is so different that they have solution for every problem.”</span> <span id="s831">You know?</span> <span id="s832">I began to feel tremendously shortchanged that I have so much catching up to do, because I’m not even -- I -- I don’t come even close to thinking in those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: When did you discover that that -- the TV world was -- was much different than reality?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: I do not think that it came overnight.</span> <span id="s835">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s836">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s837">It certainly came a long time after I have been in the US.</span> <span id="s838">And certainly it did not come while I was in New York.</span> <span id="s839">It must have come about 10 or 15 years later, when I started to discover the differences -- not only the differences between TV and reality, but differences between the fact that -- and please don’t take it personally, that US parents have tendency to give too great of a positive public relationship spiel to their children -- to their offsprings.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: For example?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Okay, after -- after being about a year in New York, not seeing eye to eye with my uncle, I was -- I realized that I can never live up to his expectations.</span> <span id="s842">Furthermore, he didn’t wanted to realize that I, at the age of 27, cannot be molded the same way a 10 year old can be.</span> <span id="s843">So I -- while in New York, I visited my uncle in Morrisstown and I found a wonderful old man, who certainly was sorry for what -- for his behavior in the younger days.</span> <span id="s844">But my New York uncle didn’t wanted to forgive him.</span> <span id="s845">He said that he forgives him, but whenever discussion came to it, it was still there.</span> <span id="s846">I decided to leave New York and move to Morrisstown.</span> <span id="s847">My Morrisstown uncle found me a job in a department store in Morrisstown, I became a shoe salesman.</span> <span id="s848">And my Morrisstown uncle attached himself to a wealthy Jewish family in Morrisstown.</span> <span id="s849">He worked for them.</span> <span id="s850">They owned a hotel, a very small, rundown hotel, but nevertheless, he was living there.</span> <span id="s851">And he found, in that family, a second home.</span> <span id="s852">He attached to hi -- to himself to that family.</span> <span id="s853">And they treated him very nicely and he felt very warmly toward them.</span> <span id="s854">And they were extremely wealthy.</span> <span id="s855">And they looked upon me in a very favorable fashion, that finally my uncle, who from 1913, until 1960 was alone, finally found family member who likes him -- who loves him.</span> <span id="s856">So they liked me because of it.</span> <span id="s857">But, they always gave themselves as example of American success.</span> <span id="s858">They always pointed out to me their children.</span> <span id="s859">Let’s say, their married daughters.</span> <span id="s860">They claimed that if you take a good boy, from a good family and match him -- match her up with a good girl from a good family, that it has to be success.</span> <span id="s861">And they continuously -- they also pointed out to me, couple times, that I cannot expect the greatest success in US, because I have no background.</span> <span id="s862">It took me quite awhile to figure out what they mean by background.</span> <span id="s863">That --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: What di -- What did they mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Background, you don’t have address, identifiable address.</span> <span id="s866">Your family tree is not in the US and is -- it is unknown.</span> <span id="s867">That they meant by background.</span> <span id="s868">When I kept talking about atmosphere in the US as opposed to atmosphere in Israel, they said, “Oh yes, we know.</span> <span id="s869">I-In Israel the atmosphere is -- is semi-tropical.”</span> <span id="s870">They didn’t know that I mean by it, cultural atmosphere.</span> <span id="s871">They were -- they were very commercially oriented.</span> <span id="s872">They had no formal education whatsoever.</span> <span id="s873">But they were Polish Jews, who -- who were -- usually the Polish Jews were always looked upon in Europe -- when you want to see a small merchant, that is Polish.</span> <span id="s874">Like Tuvya in -- in -- in “Fiddler on the Roof”, you know?</span> <span id="s875">A small, little merchant selling buttons, or -- or -- you know?</span> <span id="s876">So they too, gave me couple times, feelings of inferiority, but based upon commercial basis.</span> <span id="s877">Then, the relatives here, in the States, distant relatives, who were in Austria, one was a carpenter, one was a tailor.</span> <span id="s878">They came to the US, the tailor became a very successful tailor in New York.</span> <span id="s879">The carpenter opened a plastic factories in Teaneck, New Jersey, very wealthy.</span> <span id="s880">So, you know, the whole structure, family structure, disintegrated and started to taking a different shape and form, once it broke up, in different countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Did you have -- keep in correspondence with your father at this point, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I kept correspondence with my father until his death in na -- 1962 or ‘63, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: And what was the relationship like?</span> <span id="s884">What we -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: It was again, the letters were censored.</span> <span id="s886">He was extremely proud when I passed the GED equivalency high school examination.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: What -- What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: That was 1961.</span> <span id="s889">Because he, like all fathers, predicted that you will -- he told me, “You will grow up to nothing.</span> <span id="s890">You will never amount to anything.”</span> <span id="s891">But I don’t think that -- that he -- he -- that was more a phrase or expression.</span> <span id="s892">Had he taken in account the handicaps that I had, he certainly would not -- not -- not -- not think of -- of -- of all that seriously.</span> <span id="s893">Then, when I told him that I was able to gain admission to a university, he was extremely proud.</span> <span id="s894">But, when I first came to Czechoslovakia in ‘65, he was already dead.</span> <span id="s895">And I was able to come to Czechoslovakia in ‘65 because my uncle in Morrisstown died and left me inheritance of about 4,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s896">I remember 1,500 dollars went toward his funeral.</span> <span id="s897">I have spent about 2,000 dollars towards my tuition in college, because I went to a private school.</span> <span id="s898">No state school in New Jersey wanted to admit me because I had a very, very low score on -- how was it called in that time -- Princeton College Boards.</span> <span id="s899">And state school said, “No, we have strict regulations, try private school.</span> <span id="s900">They don’t have such strict regulations.”</span> <span id="s901">So I was admitted, but I had to pay, in those days, oh about -- beginning tuition was about 27.50 per credit hour.</span> <span id="s902">And by the time I finished, it was about 55 dollars per credit hour.</span> <span id="s903">And multiply it by 130 credits and I paid for everything from my own pocket, except those 2,000 dollars that my uncle left me.</span> <span id="s904">So, I left myself thousand dollars for a trip to Czech Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And what was the purpose of the -- of the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: To be reunited with my sister and with my aunt.</span> <span id="s907">My mother had a sister in Czechoslovakia, which lived in the house of my grandfather and grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: And how long did you visit?</span> <span id="s909">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: I stayed one week with my aunt and uncle in Slovakia and one week with my sister in Zenoimal.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Wh-What do you think -- wh-what left the most impression on you, your visit?</span> <span id="s912">Did you go back to your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Which one?</span> <span id="s914">To Orskiboat?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Th-The village that you lived in before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s917">There was absolutely no time.</span> <span id="s918">You see, I was working for Allied Chemical Corporation in Morrisstown and I got only two weeks vacation.</span> <span id="s919">And furthermore, I planned the vacation between semesters.</span> <span id="s920">It took me 10 years to finish the college.</span> <span id="s921">Because of money and language, I had to take it very slowly.</span> <span id="s922">And I went year round, both summer sessions.</span> <span id="s923">I took six credits during regular semester.</span> <span id="s924">That meant four nights a week and I took two courses during the summer.</span> <span id="s925">One in the first summer semester and one course the second summer semester.</span> <span id="s926">And there were only two weeks open window between the summer sessions.</span> <span id="s927">And between the second summer session and beginning of the fall session was the cheapest air fare.</span> <span id="s928">So I took advantage of it and went to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Did you visit your father’s gravesite?</span> <span id="s930">A: No.</span> <span id="s931">Because, in Czechoslovakia in those days, nobody was -- was -- nobody was buried.</span> <span id="s932">The state did not permit it, only cremations took place.</span> <span id="s933">And visiting somebody’s grave whose ashes are there didn’t mean anything to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: How did you resolve your feelings that -- the fact that the last time you’d seen your mother was -- was when you left for Israel and the last time you saw your father was -- was when you left for Israel and that they’d both died and you’d never seen them?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: I never resolved it.</span> <span id="s936">I still didn’t -- don’t know how to deal with it.</span> <span id="s937">I am asking myself -- well, I -- had I stayed in Czechoslovakia instead of emigrating to Israel, I probably would not have changed anything on my father’s death, because he died of stroke, you know, at the age of 73.</span> <span id="s938">That probably would not have changed.</span> <span id="s939">But where I feel little bit guilty, had I stayed in Czechoslovakia, maybe my presence would give my mother a reason to stay alive.</span> <span id="s940">And maybe she would not have committed the suicide.</span> <span id="s941">But see, sa -- there are too many maybes, you know?</span> <span id="s942">And that what irritates me continuously, that there are -- I have so many perhaps and maybes in my background.</span> <span id="s943">And here and there I succeed finding an answer.</span> <span id="s944">That this truly would have happened or did happened, regardless of my staying there or exiting.</span> <span id="s945">You know, sometimes I have the feeling that I’m carrying on my shoulders the responsibility for the whole human race.</span> <span id="s946">And then I -- I begin to realize that if that subways train comes five minutes later, I have no -- no -- no leverage o-over that, you know?</span> <span id="s947">But nevertheless, it -- it causes me quite a bit of frustration.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Why -- Why do you have this sense of responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s950">I simply don’t know.</span> <span id="s951">Maybe the luck of contribution -- that nobody has asked me.</span> <span id="s952">That I found myself like a leaf being tossed by the wind and not being able to -- to direct the way the wind will blow or -- or the leave will be -- will be scattered.</span> <span id="s953">I would like to have more input into what is happening to me.</span> <span id="s954">And until I came to the States, I really didn’t have any input.</span> <span id="s955">Things were happening outside my control, completely.</span> <span id="s956">I didn’t have a handle on my own fate until I came to the States.</span> <span id="s957">And it took me time -- a long time in the States -- not that I didn’t had the freedom to choose my fate, but I didn’t know exactly what to choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: How did you finally feel as though you got a handle on your -- on your fate?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: First of all, it took me quite a -- quite a bit of time to decide what is it I want to study.</span> <span id="s960">I didn’t wanted to study accounting to begin with.</span> <span id="s961">I wanted to become a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s962">But my background in -- in math was not sufficiently strong to gain admission to engineering school.</span> <span id="s963">Then, engineering school was five years long, instead of four years.</span> <span id="s964">That would have created another problem.</span> <span id="s965">Then, I felt that to study something other than accounting would require a much better knowledge of the English language than I possessed .</span> <span id="s966">Then the school, even though it was a private university, regulated to some degree, the sequence of the courses I was taking -- I had to take.</span> <span id="s967">Because everybody who was admitted under GED had first to take English, History, Math and Language, before taking anything else.</span> <span id="s968">The 15 -- the first 18 or 24 credits, you were simply on probation.</span> <span id="s969">So I -- I felt like walking continuously on a thin ice.</span> <span id="s970">And then American girls had tremendous influence on my way of thinking.</span> <span id="s971">Because I heard, in Israel -- you know, Israel is a haven for Jewish American women.</span> <span id="s972">And I don’t mean it as a joke.</span> <span id="s973">You would be surprised how many American Jewish women come to Israel to find a husband.</span> <span id="s974">And some of them are extremely wealthy and some of them are really willing to compromise and go down very low on the economical le -- ladder to find a Jewish husband.</span> <span id="s975">Many marriages end up in a disaster.</span> <span id="s976">Very few American Jewish girls stay in Israel.</span> <span id="s977">They usually bring their husbands to the States.</span> <span id="s978">And many of the Jewish boys simply don’t measure up to the expectations.</span> <span id="s979">But, in Israel, in my days, there was generated the saying that American girls have tremendous body, but instead of a heart, they had a computer.</span> <span id="s980">And that was confirmed to me when I was dating American Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s981">I -- for first 10 years, I dated only -- tried to date only Jewish American girls and it was always the same result.</span> <span id="s982">“You are a nice boy, but you are nothing economically.”</span> <span id="s983">The girls told me, “We are seeking somebody who has it made already.”</span> <span id="s984">Again, I was out of sync.</span> <span id="s985">“Yes, you have perseverance.</span> <span id="s986">We see that you are going nights to school, you are trying to better yourself.”</span> <span id="s987">But I got my BS, I was 37.</span> <span id="s988">By that time, most fellows already are partners in some business or self-employed or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: When did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Huh, that is a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s991">I worked at Allied Chemicals in Morrisstown and I was renting a room with a family.</span> <span id="s992">He was also from Czechoslovakia and she was from Italy.</span> <span id="s993">They were Christians, but they were honest, good family.</span> <span id="s994">And one day, in 1968, his uncle from Czechoslovakia came to visit.</span> <span id="s995">Because in ‘68, if you remember th-the Prague’s sprink liberated the exit and he succeeded coming to the US for a visit, leaving his wife and children as hostages that he will come back.</span> <span id="s996">And we started talking and he said, “Look, you will have absolutely no problems --” he asked me why I’m still single, so I describe him the situation and he said, “Look, that doesn’t surprise me.</span> <span id="s997">You simply don’t fit, culturally with American girls.</span> <span id="s998">You would be much better off finding a Czech girl.”</span> <span id="s999">So I said, “Well, how that would be possible after so many years not being there?</span> <span id="s1000">A whole generation or two were born.”</span> <span id="s1001">So he said, “Leave it to me, I will look around.”</span> <span id="s1002">And he lined up about five or six girls and I came for a visit.</span> <span id="s1003">I went out with all of them and I selected one.</span> <span id="s1004">And in 1970, I went once or twice again to Czechoslovakia and I established correspondence with one of the girls and it clicked without any problems.</span> <span id="s1005">And in 1970, I was about to graduate in August and in June of 1970, I went to Czechoslovakia and got married there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: So, these Czech women, were they in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: How -- How were you dating them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I stayed in Czechoslovakia for a month and I went out with each one of them and I finally decided on one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: And this was set up by you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: By that friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And had you corresponded with them, at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: With two I kept correspondence until I severed the correspondence and I began to concentrate on that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: And why was it that you selected yo-your -- your future wife?</span> <span id="s1015">What was it about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Chemistry.</span> <span id="s1017">The Czechs gave me bloody hard time to get married.</span> <span id="s1018">You cannot visualize how many documents I needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: How soon after you -- you met, were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: About two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: So she came back to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span> <span id="s1023">We were -- we were married in Czechoslovakia, it took her three months to process the papers.</span> <span id="s1024">But the three months were delayed by US, not by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s1025">We started processing our papers for the marriage about year earlier.</span> <span id="s1026">That has to be satisfied the Czech government first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: So, your courtship took place -- did you travel to Czechoslo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Travel and correspondence.</span> <span id="s1029">And she’s not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Meerka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1033">Did you talk with her about your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: -- your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I think I did, but she is much younger than I.</span> <span id="s1037">She is 16 years younger than I, so she did not have first hand experience.</span> <span id="s1038">Furthermore, she was born already under the Communist regime.</span> <span id="s1039">But she had couple girlfriends who were Jewish, who were -- I -- I don’t know whether the girls or their parents were product of the Holocaust, so she knew what I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Had you talked about your Holocaust experience with -- with very many people in -- in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: No.</span> <span id="s1042">Not -- not -- not -- not many, not many.</span> <span id="s1043">In all honesty, I think that in Morrisstown, where I spent 10 years, I didn’t speak about it once.</span> <span id="s1044">I belonged, because of my Morrisstown uncle, in a Jewish congregation, a very modern congregation, sort of a religious how they call it, Reform Judaism.</span> <span id="s1045">But not one of the Jews there ever, ever asked me about Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s1046">I do not know just what -- what it is about -- the American Jews, they are a completely different breed.</span> <span id="s1047">You know, the -- sometimes you are wondering what sort of a Jews are they to begin with.</span> <span id="s1048">For example, when -- when -- when there were wars of -- I used to teach the Hebrew language in that synagogue to kids.</span> <span id="s1049">So there was a war, I don’t know, in ‘67, between Israel and Arabs, and one of the boys came to school after the war has ended and said, “Mr. Deutsch, isn’t it fantastic we beat the Arabs?”</span> <span id="s1050">They are riding on the coattails of the Israel when Israel does something great.</span> <span id="s1051">But they don’t want to recognize Israel when things are not going so well, you know?</span> <span id="s1052">So I -- I don’t think that the American Jews know exactly where and how do they fit, whether they are American or they should be Israelis.</span> <span id="s1053">Then they don’t know exactly how the Judaism fits into the Israeli structure.</span> <span id="s1054">They are very confuse and very ambivalent about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And how do you see yourself fitting in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: For me, Judaism is a religion and nothing more.</span> <span id="s1057">Israel is a society composed of Jews, but that’s it.</span> <span id="s1058">And the Jews of Israel go to various synagogues, to Orthodox, to Reform.</span> <span id="s1059">And as far as beyond that, they have absolutely nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1060">What is united -- uniting -- uniting them is the danger from the Arabs on one hand and the bad memories of anti-Semitism and Holocaust from Europe.</span> <span id="s1061">And not having -- not being for the Holocaust, I’m not certain that Israel as state would exist.</span> <span id="s1062">It still would be probably today, Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Was your marriage ceremony performed by a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No, no, Czechoslovakia -- we got married in 1970, Czechoslovakia did not have religious ceremonies.</span> <span id="s1065">It was conducted by a judge -- peace judge, how you want to call him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Justice of the Peace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Justice of the Peace, and my marriage -- I have a rec-recording of it, of the whole ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Oh, a tape recording?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Tape recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: It’s a 78 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Record?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Vinyl record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: So when did you come back to America with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Okay, I came back -- we got married in June of ‘70, I came back -- I worked already in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.</span> <span id="s1076">It was couple months before graduation.</span> <span id="s1077">They gave me already a professional status as an accountant.</span> <span id="s1078">I came back probably end of June and October 10th, my wife came to the States.</span> <span id="s1079">We rented an apartment in Morrisstown and I think in January of 1971 -- she was a medical technician, she found a job also at Mount Sinai in New York and started working as a medical technician there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And -- And your job was an accountant at Mount Sinai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: A-And what did you -- what did you get your degree in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Accounting.</span> <span id="s1085">And what was that university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Farley Dickinson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Farley Dickinson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And so, what was that time like?</span> <span id="s1090">Your -- Your wife is -- her first experience in America and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Well, the first experience was horrible.</span> <span id="s1092">I -- I -- I -- I was desperate.</span> <span id="s1093">She started crying.</span> <span id="s1094">She cried for about a week.</span> <span id="s1095">I do not know whether she started -- yeah, she was hired at Mount Sinai, but Mount Sinai had a strange employment structure.</span> <span id="s1096">It is very heavily unionized and there are various categories.</span> <span id="s1097">There are union for nurses, union for blue collar workers.</span> <span id="s1098">Everybody’s unionized and everybody belongs to a different union, and every union has a different pay scale.</span> <span id="s1099">And my wife belonged to union of medical technicians, and the union of medical technicians has a -- has the lowest pay scale than the union of blue collar workers.</span> <span id="s1100">And she, coming from a Communist country, was extremely insulted that she, with all her medical training, is getting paid less than the janitor is paid.</span> <span id="s1101">And that was insulting to her.</span> <span id="s1102">But, looking at it in retrospect, I think -- and I will of course never, never ask her about it, that she gave me that as an excuse, but I think that she was very, very homesick and tried to cover up for it by giving me that excuse.</span> <span id="s1103">In 1971, about year after she came to the States, she went already for a visit to Czechoslovakia, to visit her mother.</span> <span id="s1104">And she tells me -- she was there about a month, that she had -- have -- had to think about it very deeply whether she wants to come back to US or not.</span> <span id="s1105">But, apparently, I don’t know whether she made the decision on her own or whether her mother talked her into it, she came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: That must have been frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes, yes it was.</span> <span id="s1108">But -- well, I -- I -- I don’t know what to tell you about it today.</span> <span id="s1109">I don’t know how my thoughts -- in what direction they went in those days, whether she will come back or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yes, we have a son.</span> <span id="s1112">Was born in 1975.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Oh, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1114">I spoke with him on the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Oh yeah, you talked to him.</span> <span id="s1116">Well, all those years, we both worked, we saved money.</span> <span id="s1117">So he finished -- he got his BS from Virginia Tech, in economics and his MBA from Texas A and M, which he finished about five months ago.</span> <span id="s1118">And three months ago he s-started to work for a consulting firm in Springfield, Virginia.</span> <span id="s1119">And he’s traveling as a consultant for that firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: And what is it -- what is his name?</span> <span id="s1121">A: Leon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Leon.</span> <span id="s1123">After your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: After my uncle in Morrisstown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Do y -- Have you talked about your Holocaust experience with him much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1127">He’s very interested in it.</span> <span id="s1128">He visited the museum here once or twice.</span> <span id="s1129">He’s half Jewish and I think that he leans much more toward Judaism than toward Christianity.</span> <span id="s1130">I explained to him several times the liabilities of -- and the assets of both and told him, “Look, you are in a position to choose.”</span> <span id="s1131">And for some reason, I -- I cannot put my finger on it, but he feels closer affinity to Judaism than to Christianity.</span> <span id="s1132">My wife stays out of it, she couldn’t care less for neither one, although she feels also s-sympathy toward Christia -- toward Judaism.</span> <span id="s1133">But she’s not trying to influence our son one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Do you remember the first time you told him about what you went through as a child during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s1136">I do not know one -- when I told him.</span> <span id="s1137">He asked me, for example, why did we named him Leon.</span> <span id="s1138">So when I started telling him that he was named after Uncle Leon, he started asking about Uncle Leon.</span> <span id="s1139">And I think that’s how it led towards -- towards the Holocaust issue.</span> <span id="s1140">Then, when I -- after I moved from mo -- New York to Morrisstown, I kept meeting with my New York uncle about once a month.</span> <span id="s1141">He was extremely angry at me that I deserted him and decided to break bread with his brother, whom he never forgave.</span> <span id="s1142">And my uncle in New York continuously kept criticizing everything I did.</span> <span id="s1143">He used always negative criticism.</span> <span id="s1144">H-He always told me, “Don’t do that,” but he never told me what to do instead.</span> <span id="s1145">And I raised couple times the issue, “What would you say if I married a Christian girl?”</span> <span id="s1146">So he was very much against it.</span> <span id="s1147">So when I did marry my wife, I simply didn’t tell him that I’m going to marry.</span> <span id="s1148">I came back and on nec -- our next meeting, I told him, “Uncle, I just came back from Czechoslovakia and I married a Christian girl.”</span> <span id="s1149">And that was the end for him.</span> <span id="s1150">We had a fight and we never saw each other again.</span> <span id="s1151">That was in 1970.</span> <span id="s1152">And in 1973, he died, natural death.</span> <span id="s1153">He got a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1154">But there comes a related and also interesting story.</span> <span id="s1155">He had a daughter, a ravishing beauty.</span> <span id="s1156">She was about 18 or 19, right out of high school, when she married her sweetheart, graduate of Columbia, engineer, who worked for Sperry Gyroscope in New York, on Long Island.</span> <span id="s1157">An extremely well paying job, very bright, good looking fellow.</span> <span id="s1158">They lived on Long Island and I saw her twice in 1959.</span> <span id="s1159">And I was unable to see her again and I had the feeling that, at that time, that because I didn’t lived up to my aunt’s and uncle’s expectations, that they ins-instigated her against me.</span> <span id="s1160">And about year or two later, in early 60’s, he quit his job with Sperry Gyroscope and moved to Palo Alto, California, got a very high position with one of the electronics firms in Palo Alto.</span> <span id="s1161">And my uncle never wanted to give me their address.</span> <span id="s1162">So, I lost complete contact with them and when my uncle died, in ‘73, I was trying to find out their address.</span> <span id="s1163">But my aunt, the one who hated me, was still alive and she didn’t wanted to speak to me.</span> <span id="s1164">And I didn’t know how to find them.</span> <span id="s1165">I looked telephone books, looked every place, I was unable to find them.</span> <span id="s1166">And about two years ago, don’t ask me how and why, I exhausted all the avenues of finding her and suddenly something occurred to me.</span> <span id="s1167">I wrote to New York City, asking for my uncle’s death certificate and they answered me that I have insufficient information, that maybe he died outside of New York City and in which case they will not have his death records.</span> <span id="s1168">And about at that time, I bought an internet and I went through the Social Security -- some organization publishes death registry by states and Social Securities on the internet and I found my uncle.</span> <span id="s1169">And I wrote to New York City again, this time giving his Social Security number and they gave me, for 15 dollars, his death certificate.</span> <span id="s1170">And on New York City’s death certificate, on the bottom, is a line for informant of the death.</span> <span id="s1171">There was my aunt -- aunt’s name and her address, which was the same like my uncle used to be.</span> <span id="s1172">Then, I discovered that my aunt died in 1983, so I sent for her death certificate.</span> <span id="s1173">And the informant’s name on her death certificate was her daughter.</span> <span id="s1174">She was not living in Palo Alto, she was living in Los Altos, which is about 10 miles from Palo Alto.</span> <span id="s1175">I wrote her a letter and three days later, she called me by telephone.</span> <span id="s1176">And I ask her, “Why haven’t you looked for me?</span> <span id="s1177">My name is in the telephone book.”</span> <span id="s1178">She had unlisted number.</span> <span id="s1179">39 years it took me to find her.</span> <span id="s1180">She said she had a very miserable childhood.</span> <span id="s1181">Her mother hated her.</span> <span id="s1182">Her -- the day she came to her mother, telling her that, “I’m getting married,” her mother said, “You are dead for me.</span> <span id="s1183">You are leaving me, your own mother.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t want to know you any more.”</span> <span id="s1185">And she told me things about her parent’s marriage which make my few hair rise.</span> <span id="s1186">That also that marriage was only in name.</span> <span id="s1187">All those high standards that they asked me to live up to, they didn’t even come close in one percent to those standards.</span> <span id="s1188">And she is divorced.</span> <span id="s1189">What is she, my cousin?</span> <span id="s1190">My niece?</span> <span id="s1191">My cousin.</span> <span id="s1192">My uncle’s daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Cousin.</span> <span id="s1195">Yeah, she lives a -- a life of a very wealthy divorcee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Do you still tee -- keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes, occasionally we exchange notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: And what is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Alice.</span> <span id="s1200">Alice Sege.</span> <span id="s1201">S-e-g-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Wh-Why was it that you wrote -- wanted the death certificate of your uncle?</span> <span id="s1203">Just curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: I -- I don’t know -- because by wanting his death certificate, I didn’t know what the end result will be.</span> <span id="s1205">I have just tried to get together pieces to a jigsaw puzzle, who died and when.</span> <span id="s1206">And maybe my son is trying and has been building our family tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: That’s a big job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: And I think for that reason, I tried to get together as many pieces as I possibly can.</span> <span id="s1209">And maybe that has led me to the original.</span> <span id="s1210">Because there were four brothers, I did not know exactly, chronologically, how they fit, who is the oldest, who is the youngest.</span> <span id="s1211">And, being an accountant, I like things in order.</span> <span id="s1212">So maybe -- maybe that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: You know, you came to America in a very interesting time, a time when there wasn’t much order, in the 60’s.</span> <span id="s1214">A lot of anti-war protests, eventually.</span> <span id="s1215">Civil rights, assassinations.</span> <span id="s1216">What -- What impact did that have on you, coming from your background?</span> <span id="s1217">What were your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: My -- My initial -- when I came to -- in ‘59, my biggest shock was Cuba, Castro.</span> <span id="s1219">That was the biggest shock.</span> <span id="s1220">Then, that was a very negative shock.</span> <span id="s1221">Then the positive event happened, when the Israelis caught Adolf Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1222">Then, New York City, I don’t remember any protests in New York City.</span> <span id="s1223">New York City was a beehive.</span> <span id="s1224">I commuted by subway station -- by subway to work as a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s1225">And evening I bought textbooks from Barnes and Nobles.</span> <span id="s1226">Used textbook, high school textbooks and after work, I locked myself in my room and I read many of the books that are required from high school kids to be read.</span> <span id="s1227">I went to Washington Irving High School, nights I think, for a course in English language.</span> <span id="s1228">And most of the time I was very tired, physically, because I don’t know, in New York City, the humidity was making havoc on my -- on my disposition in New York.</span> <span id="s1229">In Israel, I -- I had no problem, you know.</span> <span id="s1230">Tel Aviv is extremely hot and humid, too.</span> <span id="s1231">But in Israel you wear shorts and you wore sandals and tee shirt.</span> <span id="s1232">But in New York, you have to wear a suit and tie and the subway, crowded, standing on one foot.</span> <span id="s1233">So it was a different, different, different atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Little more -- little more left on this tape.</span> <span id="s1235">I wanted to get up to your employment with the US government, when did that begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Can we -- can I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Can we stop a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: I have to go… End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: You ended up working for the United States government, can you tell me about how you ended up in that position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1243">My wife and I bought a house.</span> <span id="s1244">We started -- after about -- my wife started working, I think, in January of ‘70 and -- no, that would be incorrect.</span> <span id="s1245">‘70 she came only to the States.</span> <span id="s1246">In ‘71 -- in January of ‘71, she started working and in one year we saved enough money for a down payment on a house, which we bought in community called Hopatcong, Lake Hopatcong.</span> <span id="s1247">It’s not far away from Morrisstown and we both commuted daily to New York City.</span> <span id="s1248">It was 55 miles each way.</span> <span id="s1249">And for a time, we realized that we cannot afford anything living closer to New York City, because of the expense.</span> <span id="s1250">But, at that time, I don’t think that my wife si -- she simply was not long enough in the US to be able to advise me or make up her mind just which way to go.</span> <span id="s1251">I think she was more dependent on my decisions.</span> <span id="s1252">But I began to realize a very interesting thing in Mount Sinai.</span> <span id="s1253">It probably was not affiliated with Affirmative Action, but Mount Sinai Hospital was very proud at it’s employment record, advertising -- at least among the employees, that they employ people from every nation under the sun, except Mexico.</span> <span id="s1254">But something very interesting was taking place.</span> <span id="s1255">Not only were you almost -- mor -- it was almost impossible to cross the boundaries of the various unions.</span> <span id="s1256">But, in order to maintain some sort of a equilibrium, even though it seems to me maybe I was imagining it, whenever they occurred a vacancy in the non -- in the administrative positions, they -- Mount Sinai replaced the vacancy -- filled the vacancy with exactly the same nationality it was created by.</span> <span id="s1257">So, when an Italian American left an position, exactly Italian American took that same position.</span> <span id="s1258">So, I was asking, “How do I fit as a Czech Jew?”</span> <span id="s1259">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s1260">I have absolutely no chance.</span> <span id="s1261">So I was looking at some opportunity for bettering myself.</span> <span id="s1262">And prior to Mount Sinai, I worked again for about half a year, Allied Chemicals, this time as a professional, but they had implemented an austerity program and they laid me off.</span> <span id="s1263">And prior to ma -- to Allied Chemicals, I worked for public accounting firm.</span> <span id="s1264">At that time I had a dream that I will become a CPA.</span> <span id="s1265">And in New Jersey at that time, you either had to work 10 years for the US government, or three years for a CPA firm, in order to qualify for CPA examinations.</span> <span id="s1266">And I forgot -- I decided that CPA firm is not for me.</span> <span id="s1267">That CPA’s are in demand also in industry.</span> <span id="s1268">But how do I gain the CPA examination qualifications?</span> <span id="s1269">Simply by joining US government.</span> <span id="s1270">So that led me to decision to join the US government.</span> <span id="s1271">And originally I applied for a slot with the IRS, but from OPN in New York -- Office of Personnel Management, my rating was too high for the IRS starting position.</span> <span id="s1272">And apparently, the Department of Defense had many more vacancies in that grate.</span> <span id="s1273">So I was picked up by the US Army.</span> <span id="s1274">And instead of commuting 55 miles to New York, I was commuting now seven miles to Picatinni Arsenal.</span> <span id="s1275">My wife was still working at Mount Sinai.</span> <span id="s1276">She hitched always, a ride with a coworker.</span> <span id="s1277">And Picatinni Arsenal had a layoff and I, through the layoff process -- they call it dariff -- I found another position at Potuxin Naval Air Station, here in Maryland.</span> <span id="s1278">So, we moved to Maryland.</span> <span id="s1279">My wife got a job as a technician, medical technician in LaPlata Memorial Hospital.</span> <span id="s1280">And from Potuxin Naval Air Station, I got a promotion to David Taylor Model Basin.</span> <span id="s1281">Do you know where it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: It’s on border of Maryland -- is Virginia.</span> <span id="s1284">It’s called -- there is a bridge called Legionnaire’s Bridge and behind it is hidden a great engineering -- [indecipherable] engineering installation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: For accounting, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: And from there, I got a job back with army.</span> <span id="s1289">Potuxin and Carderuck, or David Taylor Model Basin were navy.</span> <span id="s1290">I got a job back with the army in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1291">Army Material Command, which was the headquarters -- again, as an accountant.</span> <span id="s1292">And then, after about working for Army Material Command for some eight or nine years, I realized, through the Affirmative Action that I am going no place.</span> <span id="s1293">But the army paid for my Master’s degree program and I decided to go for a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1294">And the army had no interest in my Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1295">So I started paying for it from my own pocket and I selected international affairs as my project -- Ph.D program.</span> <span id="s1296">And I started going to Catholic university.</span> <span id="s1297">And, in 1988, again I had here a problem with a colonel, who was director.</span> <span id="s1298">In the meantime, I gained -- I was ob -- able to obtain a changeover from accounting to international programs division, with AMC -- with Army Material Command.</span> <span id="s1299">And the director was a colonel who was a bigot, first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: A bigot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yes, and anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1302">And he created the situation -- very unpleasant situation where I was almost forced to resign, either to be fired or forced to resign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Well, to make a long story short, as I see it -- that doesn’t mean that it necessarily was so -- he was an old bachelor who was trying to sleep with every girl he could have.</span> <span id="s1305">And many young girls took the bite.</span> <span id="s1306">In the div -- in the international programs directorate, we had couple openings.</span> <span id="s1307">Every time a girl came in for a promotion, became engaged to him.</span> <span id="s1308">Once she obtained the promotion, she disengaged and went back where she came from with a higher grade.</span> <span id="s1309">And on the third occasion, I mention it to him.</span> <span id="s1310">Not what he is doing, because I had no right, but I said, “How is it possible -- look, these girls are coming here, not only getting promotion and then transfer back, but I am here trying to get a transfer to a different director, without promotion, and I cannot do so.</span> <span id="s1311">Please help me.”</span> <span id="s1312">And he felt threatened, and he created a situation where he wrote me up for every single, every simple deficiency.</span> <span id="s1313">I handed him a project five minutes late, he wrote me up.</span> <span id="s1314">So I itkerminated to the fact that I either had to be fired or to resign.</span> <span id="s1315">So, instead of preventing being fired, three days before the deadline, I resigned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: And where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Oh, for about four months, I went -- worked on the economy.</span> <span id="s1318">I worked as a night auditor for L’enfant Plaza Hotel, here in DC.</span> <span id="s1319">I worked for a month as a shoe salesman for Bloomingdale’s.</span> <span id="s1320">The shoe salesman experience from Morrisstown came very handy.</span> <span id="s1321">Then I got a position which could have lasted 180 days for the post office, US Post Office, selling stamps over the ph-phone, to collectors.</span> <span id="s1322">And worked as an auditor for “House of Ruth”, in DC.</span> <span id="s1323">And all those weeks I had floated application as an accountant, back for federal employment.</span> <span id="s1324">And I got a call from the Library of Congress, for a position in my old grade.</span> <span id="s1325">But, Library of Congress, at that time, the chief told me that they have a huge computer in the basement, which is not utilized at all.</span> <span id="s1326">And through my experience, they would like me to activate the computer and start it providing data that the computer should be generating, if I want the position.</span> <span id="s1327">Two days earlier, I got a positive interview with military district of Washington, as an accountant, a grade lower, but asking me to do almost a very similar job that I used to do for Army Material Command, as an accountant.</span> <span id="s1328">So, I had a choice.</span> <span id="s1329">Grade higher, but working with a computer, or grade lower, but doing more or less the same accounting job I did before.</span> <span id="s1330">So I have selected the lower grade.</span> <span id="s1331">And I work for next eight or nine years for military district of Washington.</span> <span id="s1332">For -- we stayed for about seven years at Half Street, in DC.</span> <span id="s1333">Shared that building with FBI and [indecipherable] Investigating Service.</span> <span id="s1334">And then we moved to Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1335">But, you know -- from where I retired in last -- in 1997, in May.</span> <span id="s1336">Interesting thing happened now -- occurred to me that when I got the job with Army Material Command, in the international division, the Pollard case came into existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Pollard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Pollard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Ronald, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Whatever his name is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Ronald Pollard, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1342">Spike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: And I represented the Israeli desk at the time.</span> <span id="s1344">So I was investigated whether I had some connection to it.</span> <span id="s1345">But Pollard was navy, I was army and we had absolutely no connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And were they suspicious of you in any way because you had lived in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: It may have crossed their mind.</span> <span id="s1348">But I was never affected by Pollard’s mishap.</span> <span id="s1349">Then our -- one of our colonel’s -- but that affair you probably don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1350">Maybe you never knew it, Gillespie was his name.</span> <span id="s1351">They had some problem with identifying missiles in Florida.</span> <span id="s1352">He was also my boss.</span> <span id="s1353">It -- It -- Yo -- It made headlines in Time magazine and in all the papers, but it was a short -- relatively short-lived affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: How long did they investigate you in the Pollard case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Maybe two or three times, they asked me various questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: [indecipherable] You had said to me at -- at lunch that you’re very pro-American and I-I’d like for you to talk about that and also what -- what that might have been like, to have your patriotism, I guess, or your loyalty questioned in the Pollard case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Number -- No, I was -- I was little bit pissed off, frankly speaking.</span> <span id="s1358">I was insulted by it.</span> <span id="s1359">Because I -- I -- I don’t know how you can prove to somebody loyalty -- that you are loyal.</span> <span id="s1360">I -- I don’t know exactly how to prove it.</span> <span id="s1361">You know, in -- in older days, you proved your loyalty by joining the military in a uniform or going to fight for your adopted country.</span> <span id="s1362">I was little bit too old to do all that, but simply, it was -- it was insulting to me that -- that they doubted my sincerity or loyalty.</span> <span id="s1363">What else can I add to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Can you talk a little bit about your -- I mean, you’ve had citizenship as a Czech, and as an Israeli, and now as an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Okay, to clarify you that -- that issue.</span> <span id="s1366">Czech citizenship, at least I didn’t know about it in Israel.</span> <span id="s1367">Apparently all those -- those 10 years that I was in Israel, I probably was a Czech citizen.</span> <span id="s1368">Although, something goes through my mind and I cannot find evidence.</span> <span id="s1369">The Czech government, after the last transport of Jews left from Czechoslovakia to Israel, the Czech government advertised in it’s newspapers and through it’s embassies overseas, that all Czech citizens who will not return to Czechoslovakia by such and such a date, will lose their Czech citizenship.</span> <span id="s1370">So, I lived under that assumption in Israel, that because I have not returned, I have lost my citizenship.</span> <span id="s1371">Then, in Israel, upon your arrival, they ask you right in the airport or in the port of you arrival, whether you want to be an Israeli citizen.</span> <span id="s1372">And if you say yes, from that moment on, you are an Israeli citizen.</span> <span id="s1373">They don’t care whether you are citizen of another country.</span> <span id="s1374">From here on, you are an Israeli citizen and you have the right to Israeli passport.</span> <span id="s1375">One hour after you land in Israel, you are already there a citizen.</span> <span id="s1376">If you say no, then they let you live as a non-Israeli, but you still have to fulfill the obligations, like any other Israeli.</span> <span id="s1377">They just don’t trust you as much.</span> <span id="s1378">Coming to the States, nobody asked me -- I came under the Israeli passport.</span> <span id="s1379">Working for Army Material Command, there came an opportunity -- they advertised some vacancies -- under the Civil Service in Israel -- if you will remember, when Israel surrendered to Egypt, that desert.</span> <span id="s1380">What it -- it’s not the Sinai desert, it’s -- yeah, it’s the Sinai desert.</span> <span id="s1381">When Israel gave back to Egyptian -- to Egypt, Sinai desert, the Americans came that they will finance in Israel some airport which Israelis have lost in Sinai, to Egyptian.</span> <span id="s1382">And the Civil Service was looking for people who would be willing to go to Israel as servants.</span> <span id="s1383">So I put application in, but I still had Israeli citizenship and I was afraid that there will arise a conflict.</span> <span id="s1384">On the one hand, my being Amer-American employee and on the other hand being Israeli citizen.</span> <span id="s1385">So, I went to Israeli embassy and I -- I renounced in writing my Israeli citizenship.</span> <span id="s1386">And as a result, my son and I lost it.</span> <span id="s1387">We have a letter.</span> <span id="s1388">My wife never was an Israeli citizen to -- to begin with.</span> <span id="s1389">But interesting thing now happened.</span> <span id="s1390">When Czechoslovakia shed it’s Communist flavor, we Czechs here assumed that all of us who left Czechoslovakia from 1948 until today, will gain back Czech citizenship.</span> <span id="s1391">Matter of fact, gain it back I think was wrong way of phrasing it.</span> <span id="s1392">I don’t know whether I knew that we lost it.</span> <span id="s1393">But what came now to light?</span> <span id="s1394">The new democratic government of Czechoslovakia proclaimed that we are not longer Czech citizenship -- citizens.</span> <span id="s1395">Because Czechoslovakia and United States signed, in 1928, a mutual treaty whereby -- in which you gain one citizenship, but lose the other one.</span> <span id="s1396">And the Czechs began to enforce it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: When did you become a US citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: In 1964.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: In ‘64.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: And I wrote several times to the Czechs after the Communists lost the seats, “What am I now?”</span> <span id="s1401">And I send them documents.</span> <span id="s1402">And they send me back letters, telling me that based upon the treaty, the day I gained US citizenship, I lost Czech citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: What does it mean to you to be an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s1405">Czech citizenship -- I would not object if the Czechs gave me back the citizenship, but it would be purely for sentimental reasons.</span> <span id="s1406">I would not have any advantage in it.</span> <span id="s1407">It just would be a good, warm feeling that my mother country still knows that I exist and that I’m her son.</span> <span id="s1408">That I’m not like stepchild.</span> <span id="s1409">How is it called, that -- that -- that Walt Disney’s play with the girl with the golden slipper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Cinderella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Cinderella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1413">I wanted to ask you a little bit about the effect of your Holocaust experience on -- on your life and I know you started the interview before we even --</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: -- tape, by saying that it’s hard for you to sort -- sort that out and to know exactly how it affected your life.</span> <span id="s1416">But, I believe that you said in your video interview that you think as a result of your Holocaust experience, you try to be inconspicuous.</span> <span id="s1417">You always look over your shoulder and you’re easily intimidated, I believe you said.</span> <span id="s1418">Can you talk a little bit more about that and if that’s still [indecipherable] sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Well, it -- it is, you know, number one, because of my deficiency of the English language, I -- I have problems expressing feelings.</span> <span id="s1420">My vocabulary is not large enough.</span> <span id="s1421">I do not know how to phrase it exactly.</span> <span id="s1422">You know, there are -- there is a parallel in the American literature, in the book by Hawthorne, “The Scarlet Letter.”</span> <span id="s1423">That’s apparently how she must have felt and how I feel.</span> <span id="s1424">Branded.</span> <span id="s1425">You know, somebody who -- who is -- who is -- I feel like somebody who is totally unimportant, who can be disposed of.</span> <span id="s1426">Like you change shirt every day.</span> <span id="s1427">That I have absolutely no value to anybody, except of course, to my wife and my son.</span> <span id="s1428">But the rest of the society couldn’t care less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: And y -- do you have that feeling often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: It is not 24 hours with me.</span> <span id="s1431">But the older I get, I think it comes more frequently.</span> <span id="s1432">Isn’t that the saying that when you become older, you re-return to your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: And do you think that feeling is in -- is an outgrowth of -- of what you went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: -- in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1437">Very definitely, very definitely, very definitely.</span> <span id="s1438">In it -- it’s interesting, when I first came to -- to Morrisstown, in 1960, it was a almost purely white community.</span> <span id="s1439">There were blacks, but -- but they had a section of town and they were very inconspicuous.</span> <span id="s1440">I truly felt at home in Morrisstown, because people were not very inter -- not interested in my Holocaust experience, but they looked upon me as a novelty, being an immigrant.</span> <span id="s1441">Because, in those days, emigration to the US was orderly.</span> <span id="s1442">And I was one of the very few that landed in Morrisstown in those days.</span> <span id="s1443">So people wanted to know more about my experiences as an immigrant and why and how did I make decision coming to the US and how do I feel about the US.</span> <span id="s1444">But slowly, slowly, with the influx of the Cubans, and the thousands of illegal immigrants, immigrants are somehow looked upon as intruders.</span> <span id="s1445">And nobody cares particularly whether you came legally to the US or whether you came as a wetback.</span> <span id="s1446">Does it, to some extent, answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: I had forgotten my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Well, how do I feel about the Holocaust having me labeled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Oh, right.</span> <span id="s1450">And so, there was a period when you lived in Morrisstown, where it was -- people were curious, but now you feel as though it’s -- it’s still a brand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1452">Specially, specially in this area.</span> <span id="s1453">Specially in Washington, DC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: In Washington.</span> <span id="s1455">Wh-What about -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: -- yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1457">Specially, specially in this area.</span> <span id="s1458">Specially in Washington, DC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: In Washington.</span> <span id="s1460">Wh-What about the fact that you’re -- you now volunteer at the Holocaust museum?</span> <span id="s1461">Do you -- do you feel you get support or understanding for the way that you feel, or -- or do you talk to other people about the way you feel?</span> <span id="s1462">Because there are other survivors, there are other people who -- who were on the run during -- during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: You know, I -- I’m not quite certain how to answer you, because I come only twice a week here and the employees of the museum, number one, are US government employees.</span> <span id="s1464">Number two, there are many Americans here -- native Americans, who have never experienced the Holocaust first hand.</span> <span id="s1465">They read and hear about it.</span> <span id="s1466">So, for them, it is an academic curiosity, but nothing more.</span> <span id="s1467">I suspect that majority of us volunteers are survivors, original survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1468">But each one of us, so far, comes from a different countries.</span> <span id="s1469">And our individual experiences are totally different.</span> <span id="s1470">You hardly -- I don’t believe, in honesty, I can say that you will find two Holocaust survivors whose experiences will be identical.</span> <span id="s1471">We -- I -- I don’t want to associate with other Holocaust experienced coworkers, because their experiences are totally different and the only thing we have in common is the fact that probably we are Jewish and our lives were changed by Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Are you uncomfortable with -- with being labeled, or -- wi-with -- with the identity of being a Holocaust survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Not -- Not -- I’m not -- not very comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s1474">I’m not very comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s1475">Because I don’t know, well, what does it -- what does it mean?</span> <span id="s1476">Do -- Because of it, will people feel sorry for me?</span> <span id="s1477">I don’t want you to feel sorry for me.</span> <span id="s1478">Should I feel sorry for me?</span> <span id="s1479">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1480">Okay, feeling sorry for myself -- had it not been for my grandfather, I wouldn’t be here talking to you now.</span> <span id="s1481">So, isn’t that fact that, in 1942, we crossed the border and we didn’t ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1482">So everything from that point on, is a bonus.</span> <span id="s1483">Now, living a life of bonus, is it a bona fide life, or not?</span> <span id="s1484">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1485">You see, these are the issues that I am dealing with.</span> <span id="s1486">And nobody can give me answer to that and I’m not one t -- I don’t want an answer, because I don’t believe there is an answer.</span> <span id="s1487">Maybe, had I been able to talk to Plato or -- or Socrates, maybe I would get an answer from them.</span> <span id="s1488">But from a rabbi or a minister or a priest, I will not get a sat-sat-satisfactory answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Are there smells or images or music or any sounds that bring back memories of -- of th -- yours, in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1491">The sounds of Nazi songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: When do you hear those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Oh, in occupied -- before the transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: When do you hear them now, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Oh, on history channels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: For me, the second World War has not ended.</span> <span id="s1498">It never will end.</span> <span id="s1499">It never will end.</span> <span id="s1500">You cannot visualize -- you cannot imagine how much Nazi propaganda we were exposed to until the tide has changed for the Germans at Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1501">There were Nazi songs all over.</span> <span id="s1502">And the town of Ungarrishbrote, Ufwairskibrote -- and that I have never mentioned -- had loudspeakers on corners of streets and if the town had some information to convey to the population, it came over the loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s1503">There were no town’s crier’s.</span> <span id="s1504">Loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s1505">And the loudspeakers generated the Nazi songs.</span> <span id="s1506">Q: Do you still have -- do you ever have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: What are those like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Well, specially the -- that guards at the border crossings of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1510">I still see the guardhouse.</span> <span id="s1511">Or a trip in the car, in the snow.</span> <span id="s1512">I’ll walk across the border.</span> <span id="s1513">I’ll walk with the two guys to that hotel on top of the mountain.</span> <span id="s1514">Depending -- sometimes I see a movie which -- which generates a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1515">On one hand, I’m cursing myself for being a masochist, watching these movies, “Invasion of Europe” and “900 Days at Stalingrad” and “Blitzkrieg” from England.</span> <span id="s1516">Churchill’s speeches.</span> <span id="s1517">“The Longest Day,” “The Bridge Too Far.”</span> <span id="s1518">“Bridge at Remagen.”</span> <span id="s1519">On one hand I cursing myself, on the other hand, I enjoy seeing these movies.</span> <span id="s1520">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1521">It occurred to me many a times while serving in the Israeli army, we had German arms, at least in my days.</span> <span id="s1522">We had Mauser rifle, we had German machine guns.</span> <span id="s1523">Sometimes I’m wondering who had the machine gun before me.</span> <span id="s1524">Or the rifle.</span> <span id="s1525">We had German bayonets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: In -- In your piecing together your -- your life -- you’ve talked about the puzzle, you know, going back and constructing things.</span> <span id="s1527">Did you find out anything more about your mother’s suicide?</span> <span id="s1528">Cause I think you said in the interview that you thought that -- you had some suspicions about it.</span> <span id="s1529">It might not have been a suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I have tried to follow up -- I have her death certificate.</span> <span id="s1531">The death certificate is signed by a doctor whom I was unable to trace -- to find so far.</span> <span id="s1532">The death certificate uses either a Latin or a Greek phrase for cause of the death, followed by Roman numericals.</span> <span id="s1533">I had contacted NIH, the medical library.</span> <span id="s1534">The phrase says, “Fractura constratum.”</span> <span id="s1535">Nobody knows exactly -- I have asked couple medical doctors -- what it means, but using imagination, fractura is probably fracture.</span> <span id="s1536">Constratum is probably cons-construction -- physical construction.</span> <span id="s1537">And the numbers -- the Roman numbers, I went to library -- medical library and I found a relationship that that means that various parts -- various ribs and bones in the spine, they’re broken.</span> <span id="s1538">Each number means specific bone is fractured.</span> <span id="s1539">So, either they beat her to death, or she must have jumped from a window and on the sidewalk found her death.</span> <span id="s1540">Only two possibilities.</span> <span id="s1541">And when I wrote to the Czech authorities, they answered that they cannot find any supporting documents elaborating in details by the medical doctor, as to the exact cause of the death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: So there’s no way of knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: But my mother spent four months in jail and for that -- they found my -- mo-mother innocent at the end of the trial, but after the liberation of the Czech -- Czech government -- after the Communist liberation, the government awarded my sister and me, the sum of 50 dollars for the false imprisonment of my mother.</span> <span id="s1544">We each are entitled to 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1545">It would have been 60 dollars, but they -- in their letter of explanation, they deduct the laundry, the food -- they had to feed my mother for three months while she was in jail, and other miscellaneous expenses.</span> <span id="s1546">So they end on that amount, 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1547">So they -- that, I have still credit with the Czech government, should I go to Czechoslovakia, I can -- I have a letter, come to Ministry of Justice, to our cashier and you can collect 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1548">Which is about 1500 crowns by today rate of exchange.</span> <span id="s1549">1500 crowns, that would cover about dinner for two people in a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Well, that’s the quest -- all the questions I have to you.</span> <span id="s1551">Is there anything that you want to say that -- that I didn’t ask you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Right now I cannot -- I cannot think of anything.</span> <span id="s1553">You know, as it happens many a time, question leads to another question and a question triggers some different thought, but right now, I cannot think of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Well, we’ve covered a lot of ground, so I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Needless to say, I -- I would like to add, I have never received a penny of compensation from the Germans or from the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1556">And the Swiss undoubtedly have came into possession of all the gold and the valuables that we left behind after we fled.</span> <span id="s1557">The Germans have never recognized my suffering or rather, my suffering never fits into a grid which the German government has composed for those whom they want to compensate.</span> <span id="s1558">Because many people have received compensation for lost years or lost that or this.</span> <span id="s1559">I never was able to fit into any of these obligations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: That -- That theme of being out of sync, even with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: -- even with majority --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: -- a majority of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: -- of survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1566">It -- It is -- it was much easier for -- for the Germans to recognize the concentration camp survivors, because with them, they were registered.</span> <span id="s1567">They had that number, they had a-address.</span> <span id="s1568">And that is self evident, because the Germans were very meticulously record keepers.</span> <span id="s1569">But I have absolutely nothing that would be on record.</span> <span id="s1570">You see, that book that I showed you, the Theresienstadt, there are records of those that were shipped to concentration camp and records of those that survived.</span> <span id="s1571">There is documentation.</span> <span id="s1572">But, for me and my family, there is nothing.</span> <span id="s1573">The only documentation I have, that when we came back and I started school -- in Czechoslovakia, each student gets a year end certificate and on each certificate is written how many days of classes you have missed and so forth and so forth.</span> <span id="s1574">And the first school certificate I received, has written prior years of schooling, Fred Deutsch has spent living in illegality.</span> <span id="s1575">But it doesn’t say from when to when or where.</span> <span id="s1576">Furthermore, the Czech government never issued to us, any certificates attesting that we were living in hiding or anyth -- that we lost our possessions, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: So there’s really no official record recognizing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: No, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: -- what it was that you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1581">The Czech government also never issued to na -- neither the Germans have ever issued any-anybody death certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Does it -- Would it help to have some sort of record or validation o-of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1584">So far, I have applied for three articles.</span> <span id="s1585">The first one -- they -- they -- each one have -- have some numerics attached to it -- article two or article four, I -- each time the government -- the -- the German government comes with some beauty every -- every so often.</span> <span id="s1586">The first one ask, you have to prove medically that you are permanently disabled.</span> <span id="s1587">How do I on earth do it, you know?</span> <span id="s1588">Otherwise, I do qualify, but I have never lost an arm.</span> <span id="s1589">I -- my legs are frostbitten, but that is not medically sufficient.</span> <span id="s1590">The second time I qualified again, but they asked my -- my and my wife combined income.</span> <span id="s1591">And anybody’s whose combined income is over 21,000 dollars a year doesn’t qualify.</span> <span id="s1592">The third one, which is still floating -- the Swiss government wants you to keep nice and warm, so if you meet certain criteria, they will give you one time sum of 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s1593">But, from what I have read, 150,000 people applied and 50,000 were recognized.</span> <span id="s1594">Inasmuch as I didn’t get a penny, so I means I was one of the 100,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1595">Now, I have some class action, jointly pending with couple thousand other people, with an attorney in New York called Fagen and Associates.</span> <span id="s1596">He is handling several of these actions for lost property, to the Swiss banks.</span> <span id="s1597">And that should be starting to come at the end of this year, provided everything goes [indecipherable] smoothly.</span> <span id="s1598">Otherwise, absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Well, thank you very much for your time, Mr. Deutsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: My pleasure, [indecipherable] My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">End of Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span
