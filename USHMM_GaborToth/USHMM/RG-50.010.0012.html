Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s4">I am interviewing Dr. and Professor Haim Blanc at 12 Hovevei Zion, in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s5">Telephone number 632340.</span> <span id="s6">Dr. Blanc was born in Cernowitz which was at that time in Romania.</span> <span id="s7">At the present time it is in Russia.</span> <span id="s8">He was born on July 25, 1926.</span> <span id="s9">He left Cernowitz in 1930, went to Paris, spent the following nine years in Paris, and in 1939 moved to the</span></p> <p><span id="s10">U.S.A.</span> <span id="s11">At the time of liberation Dr. Blanc was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s12">He had finished Harvard and had a B.A. in Linguistics and he was hoping to make that his life’s career, as he indeed did.</span> <span id="s13">He is presently occupied in Linguistics in which he has his doctorate and he teaches.</span> <span id="s14">The military unit that Dr. Blanc was attached to was MOS, which is Military Occupation Specialty.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: No.</span> <span id="s16">MOS are initials that came to mind when you mentioned it.</span> <span id="s17">It was a specialty but not my unit.</span> <span id="s18">The unit that I was in at that time was the 9th Division, 9th Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s19">If you want more it’s the 774th Tank Battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And the rank at the time of liberation was second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s21">Dr. Blanc did not go into any of the concentration camps as a soldier and under anybody’s orders.</span> <span id="s22">He did go into Dachau after liberation, and his contact with the survivors was not in Dachau but shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s23">How did you first hear about concentration camps anyway?</span> <span id="s24">How did you first hear about the fact that there was such a thing as a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I have the sensation of always having heard of it.</span> <span id="s26">It was part of my growing up at the time.</span> <span id="s27">Somewhere in the 1940’s when they began coming out and, before that, in the 1930’s, the whole Hitler regime was part of our growing up.</span> <span id="s28">The rumors that came out about the first persecution of Jews in Germany, even before the concentration camps, was all part of our daily life.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: So you did know.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">I couldn’t point out when I really got details about it because some specific stories, some rumors were mixed up with the real thing.</span> <span id="s32">I just grew up with those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So when Dachau was liberated and you went to visit on your own, what did you expect to find there?</span> <span id="s34">What were your expectations?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: First of all, I expected to see something entirely cleaned up.</span> <span id="s36">I didn't expect to see any gory remains.</span> <span id="s37">Then I expected to see something that would give you an idea of what had been going on in these camps.</span> <span id="s38">In other words, barracks-- rows and rows of places where people were kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was the date of your arrival in Dachau?</span> <span id="s40">I mean the approximate date, month.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: It must have been around the summer of 1945.</span> <span id="s42">June, July, or August.</span> <span id="s43">Q: Was it in fact completely cleaned up already when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes, that's my recollection of it now.</span> <span id="s45">I may not have a very good mem ory, but that's my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did you come across anybody who had been there at the time before it was cleaned up?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you already had some information from the newspapers and from other people, and you found exactly what you expected.</span> <span id="s49">A cleaned-up camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: More or less.</span> <span id="s51">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How did it affect you going into the camp only a few months after it was</span></p> <p><span id="s53">cleaned up?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: It's hard to remember that.</span> <span id="s55">It's hard to keep it apart from the general impression of the Holocaust period, some kind of general blurred horror, which was then still very fresh, very much alive and to keep that apart from the day-to-day experience of walking through a place and looking around and seeing where the guardposts must have been, where the people must have been kept.</span> <span id="s56">It was hard to keep up a general diffused kind of impression, not very specific and not thinking specifically about specific people.</span> <span id="s57">There were no specific people there that I could relate to at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: You were stationed in Germany.</span> <span id="s59">Where?</span> <span id="s60">Near Munich someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Near Munich at a place called Batiblenk.</span> <span id="s62">It had been an air field.</span> <span id="s63">It's a town and next to it had been a big air base.</span> <span id="s64">We had constructed a prisoner of war camp on it.</span> <span id="s65">It was called PWE 26 -- Prisoner of War Enclosure 26 -- and it was being used by the American Army to keep German prisoners of war until they got liberated, discharged, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What were your feelings toward those German soldiers before, after, and during the time when you knew about what they were involved in?</span> <span id="s67">What were your own feelings and emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Ah, that's it.</span> <span id="s69">I did not know.</span> <span id="s70">I'm telling you there was this diffused impression of what had been going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s71">That I knew.</span> <span id="s72">But my impressions about particular prisoners which I came in contact with quite a bit were that they were mostly, I'm afraid to say, individuals.</span> <span id="s73">I have a kind of personality trait or whatever you want to call it, a character trait, which can come in handy, which can be an advantage, it can be a disadvantage.</span> <span id="s74">That’s the inability to generalize.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">In work I often must make generalizations and I can't do it.</span> <span id="s76">And here, you have a bunch of people walking around a camp.</span> <span id="s77">I can say about individuals whatever I find out about individuals, but to generalize them [is hard].</span> <span id="s78">I felt in some diffused way these were all members of the German Army, former German Army, and as such they must have been involved in one way or another both in the war and in various military activities and these things that had to do with specific murderous activities against Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q Did you have SS men there?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: That's what I was going to say.</span> <span id="s81">Now occasionally, there were some who came in specifically as SS and they were so identified.</span> <span id="s82">Because I knew German, part of my job there in PWE 26 was to censor or investigate their possessions.</span> <span id="s83">A bunch of SS people came in identified as such, and they carried with them indeed a whole terrific amount of anti-Semitic SS literature.</span> <span id="s84">I'd take it away from them, and not just the straight anti-Semitic, but the regular literature that they used to carry with them.</span> <span id="s85">I remember one or two cases when they would argue with me.</span> <span id="s86">They'd say, "No.</span> <span id="s87">There is nothing wrong with this.</span> <span id="s88">This is just a military this or that," and I'd say, "Never mind about that.</span> <span id="s89">Throw it out."</span> <span id="s90">I mean I wouldn't argue in that sense.</span> <span id="s91">But that was specific contact with some SS soldiers that we knew were going to be accorded some kind of special treatment, [unintelligible] put apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So you were warned to treat them with more care or more strictness?</span> <span id="s93">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Nobody told me.</span> <span id="s96">The idea is you go and check.</span> <span id="s97">That's part of your job.</span> <span id="s98">Now for normal prisoners, you didn't expect to find any kind of special literature.</span> <span id="s99">Here you expected it.</span> <span id="s100">But I did this on my own.</span> <span id="s101">I don't recall anybody giving me any directions on it.</span> <span id="s102">With these guys, I have to watch a little more closely because they are bound to have this stuff.</span> <span id="s103">The SS people had come in recently, but a prisoner that had been there for a while, who had been assigned to assist me in some of my work, ocassionally pointed out a German prisoner.</span> <span id="s104">He saw me picking out things and once or twice he pointed out to me things that I missed.</span> <span id="s105">Mainly because I didn't know this literature so well.</span> <span id="s106">I passed on a dictionary.</span> <span id="s107">An encyclopedic dictionary.</span> <span id="s108">I said O.K., let them keep the dictionary.</span> <span id="s109">Who wants to mess with that?</span> <span id="s110">He said, “No.</span> <span id="s111">Look at that.</span> <span id="s112">They're not simply dictionaries.”</span> <span id="s113">I said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s114">He said, “Look,” and he showed me what any idiot should have known if I had had a little more experience.</span> <span id="s115">He said any dictionary of this sort is bound to be full of German Nazi propaganda because that's part of the thing.</span> <span id="s116">For instance, he made me look at the dictionary item that gave a description of World War II.</span> <span id="s117">He said, "Go ahead, look at World War II and see what it says."</span> <span id="s118">So I looked and I couldn't find it and he smiled and said, "Where are you looking?</span> <span id="s119">Are you looking under World or War?</span> <span id="s120">No, you look under Gross because Gross Deutschland frei [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s121">Great is Germany's fight for freedom.</span> <span id="s122">That's where you find about the war.”</span> <span id="s123">I said no, but [unintelligible] he was right.</span> <span id="s124">So we removed the dictionary.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did you ever have in the prisoner of war camp, for instance, prisoners who were actually guards or people from Dachau who were actively involved in running the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No.</span> <span id="s127">Dachau was a visit.</span> <span id="s128">Q: That was not close enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: It was a visit on my own.</span> <span id="s130">The prisoners I had under my guard, under my care....</span> <span id="s131">Q: ....had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Who knows?</span> <span id="s133">Who knows?</span> <span id="s134">I didn't go through their individual records.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Did you have any personal hatred or animosity to any specific people among the prisoners whom you knew were more involved than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s137">I would have had to look very hard to discover that this particular person had been involved.</span> <span id="s138">Like I told you, there was a bunch of SS prisoners there, but I had nothing to do with them except searching their possessions.</span> <span id="s139">And the people I did have to do with, like this man I just mentioned and a few other people, were not of the kind of personnel who would have been involved.</span> <span id="s140">They were not SS people and they would not have been involved in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: So to your knowledge, you never came face-to-face with anybody who had an active part in killing innocent people?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I wouldn't say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: But, to your knowledge...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, even to my knowledge, if killing innocent people is what I understand it to mean.</span> <span id="s145">There were people who took part in the war and they killed people as part of their military duties; but if you mean killing Jews, that I didn't come across.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s147">How long were you stationed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I was stationed there the summer of 1945 to something like the end of 1945 or the beginning of 1946.</span> <span id="s149">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Some months.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes, a few months, and then I was transferred to Austria.... [Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s152">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: There were all kinds of interesting things, but no direct meeting with anybody who had anything to do... as far as I know.</span> <span id="s154">That means they weren't going to tell me and I wasn't going to look into their records.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So your trip to Dachau was something you decided to go by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, because it was near enough and because it was one of the things one should see.</span> <span id="s157">We weren't anywhere near the Polish areas and those concentration camps.</span> <span id="s158">There was some possibility of going to them, but I wasn't going to make a research job on the sites of the concentration camps where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So you remember that visit as just part of the overall shock of finding out of what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It wasn't right.</span> <span id="s161">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Do you remember any after effects after you left there?</span> <span id="s163">Did it haunt you?</span> <span id="s164">Did it bother you?</span> <span id="s165">Did you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, no, because as I told you, what haunts you and what stays with you and what [unintelligible] for a long time is the general knowledge of what had been going on, not a particular place.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s168">Now, when did you come in touch with the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Again, I don't remember exactly the first time, but there were two periods having to do with the two places I've been.</span> <span id="s170">First, this place near Munich in Batiblenk, and then the second place in Austria where survivors were somehow around as they were being transferred or after they had been transferred to these famous DP camps.</span> <span id="s171">As I now recall, near Munich, somewhere like that, people had arrived and were being classified, arranged, and taken care of by, I think, the Red Cross people.</span> <span id="s172">But, somehow it had to do with our unit being there.</span> <span id="s173">This prisoner of war camp was administered by the 774th Tank Division, which was part of the 9th Division.</span> <span id="s174">The war was actually over and we had to administer things, so I was put in charge of one of the administrations and then I somehow got wind of this thing that there were these DPs around and they are being taken care of and given food and things like that.</span> <span id="s175">Then I either simply said to myself I’ve got to go see some of these people or somehow it just turned out.</span> <span id="s176">I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">People in our unit always called on me whenever there was some talking to do in German or that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s178">They knew that I could talk and I, myself, let it be known that I could.</span> <span id="s179">We didn't have in our unit hardly any other Jews, but we had...yes, I'm remembering things from way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Why that's lovely.</span> <span id="s181">I can see that you are smiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: There was one fellow there called Sakowitz, who was a Jew.</span> <span id="s183">He never mentioned it, but that name is purely a Jewish name, isn't it?</span> <span id="s184">Sakowitz.</span> <span id="s185">He was the mortar officer, and the reason I remember him is because he got me my driving license.</span> <span id="s186">He got me a Jeep and he got me a driving license.</span> <span id="s187">Through fellows like him the word got around that these Jews were around, and so somehow I got there and talked to them.</span> <span id="s188">I forget exactly how and how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">But you’re looking for an emotional reaction or recollection?</span> <span id="s190">That I recall.</span> <span id="s191">These people had been, by that time, out for some time and had been making their way out of Poland.</span> <span id="s192">In this case, they left through Germany and, in other cases, Austria or Italy.</span> <span id="s193">In fact, eventually they got here and here were these people making their way into these DP camps, and here I could converse with them.</span> <span id="s194">They began by talking German, but then we switched to Yiddish and either they thought I might be Jewish or they didn't -- I don't know -- but at times we started talking Yiddish and leaving out the German, so that made it more...what can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Intimate.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s197">A feeling that you were talking somehow...I mean, in the beginning you were an American.</span> <span id="s198">You wore a uniform, and these people are refugees or whatever, but that somehow crumbled down.</span> <span id="s199">It wasn’t immediate, but I get the feeling that on their part it also crumbled down fairly quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So you came to the human level very quickly.</span> <span id="s201">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How did they look?</span> <span id="s203">Were they fed and dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Not dressed and not...[unintelligible] fed.</span> <span id="s205">I think they were no longer what they might have been at one time -- emaciated and skeleton-like and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s206">In fact, as you may know, some of the people tended to grow overweight, obese.</span> <span id="s207">I remember a couple of them like that, who looked like that, and who even said so.</span> <span id="s208">I said to them, "It doesn't look like you are starving."</span> <span id="s209">It was this banter, kidding around.</span> <span id="s210">And they said, "Well, you should have seen us a few months earlier; that all comes from overeating because of the conditions in the camp."</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How much did you identify with them as your people?</span> <span id="s212">How much of an affinity, how much of a relationship were you able to develop with these people?</span> <span id="s213">Was it "them" or was it....?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: You'd have to ask them what they felt about it.</span> <span id="s215">What I felt about it was that it was us!</span> <span id="s216">It was not them.</span> <span id="s217">It was me.</span> <span id="s218">I belong there.</span> <span id="s219">In fact, a little diffused guilt because how come you weren’t there.</span> <span id="s220">How come you got away.</span> <span id="s221">I mean me, talking to myself.</span> <span id="s222">I don't think anybody said that to me, but just me talking to myself.</span> <span id="s223">And that very strong feeling that it was "us."</span> <span id="s224">It was me.</span> <span id="s225">And I, just by some fluke, had gotten separated from them at some point.</span> <span id="s226">I tell myself rationally that it's not a fluke at all.</span> <span id="s227">That's how my parents worked it.</span> <span id="s228">If it hadn't been for their getting out of various places in time, I would have been them.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So there was that feeling of affinity, the feeling of kinship, the feeling of "this is my people," and the feeling of "I'm lucky it wasn't me."</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: That comes later.</span> <span id="s231">The first thing is "I'm guilty it wasn't me."</span> <span id="s232">This feeling happened in several places, not only places, but on several stages in my own personal history.</span> <span id="s233">One is here, but the one that was even more [unintelligible], even moreso, and even more involved with the guilt feelings is in Paris.The people from the DP camps were not my schoolmates because I had left by the time they got taken away.</span> <span id="s234">I had escaped already.</span> <span id="s235">But my schoolmates were in Paris, and when I met some of them 1 I had this feeling again that I should have been there.</span> <span id="s236">And, of course, that was a stronger feeling than the DP camp because it was a stronger affinity, a stronger identification.</span> <span id="s237">That's really them.</span> <span id="s238">The others are my kinsmen and my people, and so forth, but they are like one removed.</span> <span id="s239">And by the way, it has to do with the language, too.</span> <span id="s240">French is really the language I grew up with, and I talked with these people in the same language we talked in school.</span> <span id="s241">Yiddish is for me a background language.</span> <span id="s242">It's my parents' language and I don't know it as well as I know French.</span> <span id="s243">I'm not as fluent in it.</span> <span id="s244">In fact, one of the few occasions where I actually had to use Yiddish after many years was with these survivors, because there that was the normal thing to do, and it did not come so easily or smoothly to me as the French did.</span> <span id="s245">So, going back to the time when I was in Paris...before we got to Germany, we went through France and through Paris.</span> <span id="s246">So it's probably not related to what you're interested in, but because...some of my erstwhile schoolmates should be considered survivors also to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s247">Most of them weren't in camps, but they were under German occupation and stuff like that so that was life for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you ever share any of these feelings of guilt and discomfort you had about the DP people in Germany and Austria and your friends in Paris with anybody or was it just something you kept to yourself?</span> <span id="s249">Was that something you just lived with or did you share it with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: I mostly lived with it and shared it only when it was called out very specifically.</span> <span id="s251">I mean in discussions.</span> <span id="s252">For instance, there were one or two people, indeed, of the French schoolmates who would bring up the subject.</span> <span id="s253">In one case, a young fellow 1Dr.</span> <span id="s254">Blanc’s unit actually went through France and Paris before going to Germany where he visited Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">actually said, “So, where were you?”</span> <span id="s256">He actually made a little dig although not very violent.</span> <span id="s257">In most cases, there were no digs at all, but, in fact, these people would say, "Weren't you lucky?"</span> <span id="s258">And those were occasions where if I had had the gumption, I could have mentioned how I felt, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s259">I guess I tried to avoid it.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Have you ever discussed this with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s262">And, in general, the family, kids, and our close friends.</span> <span id="s263">But now, look how late...it comes up very often.</span> <span id="s264">I'll tell you one thing, by the way, that I wanted to mention to you.</span> <span id="s265">Maybe you don't need to have it mentioned, but there is a fellow here who does research in this called Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s266">He has been speaking and writing and discussing subjects for some years now and is doing a magnificent job.</span> <span id="s267">And his work is in part the thing that brings it up.</span> <span id="s268">He has now completed a series of talks on the radio, which I religiously, not only listen to, but record.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What specifically is his work about?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: The history of the Holocaust and the history of the Jews in those days.</span> <span id="s271">If you haven't seen it, it's a must, which I not recommend, but insist that you see.</span> <span id="s272">One book is called Escape and Rescue, I think.</span> <span id="s273">It is essentially about the organization which is called the B'richa, which helped these people that I am now talking about -- the survivors of the DP camps -- to escape out of the DP camps towards [unintelligible] mostly towards Palestine.</span> <span id="s274">That is why it's called the B'richa.</span> <span id="s275">That organization and that whole part is only one of the things that Yehuda Bauer has written about and talked about and he's doing a magnificent job.</span> <span id="s276">And as I said, the series on the radio was a talk not about the B'richa especially, but it was called Jewish reactions in the Holocaust period from surrender to resistance, something like that.</span> <span id="s277">That’s how it’s translated roughly, but the book is not the only thing that’s made him known.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And is that in English?</span> <span id="s279">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s280">I'm telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So that's Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s282">Escape and Rescue or Flight and Rescue.</span> <span id="s283">That's the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: That book is not only a book you must read because of its sense of value, but what concerns us here is that it's a book through which I discovered some of the people that I had met.</span> <span id="s285">Now this is in Innsbruck, Austria, when I was stationed in Austria.</span> <span id="s286">Innsbruck is in a valley, correct?</span> <span id="s287">It is on the river, but surrounded by mountains, etc.</span> <span id="s288">But the point is, it's one of the crossroads; I mean it's one of the chief points on the roads taking people out of Germany and Eastern Europe and Austria and into Italy and other places to go to the Mediterranean and, eventually, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s289">And when I was stationed there, I met both with the people who were coming across and with the people who were organizing their escape, who were Palestinian members of the British Army, who had left, and in some cases simply deserted, the British Army they were stationed with and were organizing this escape.</span> <span id="s290">So this book came out and I heard a review of it on the radio, and it mentioned the Innsbruck period and that the Innsbruck thing played an important part in it.</span> <span id="s291">It even mentioned the fellow who was in charge of the unit, who was [unintelligible], and I hadn't seen him since then.</span> <span id="s292">So I called up this Yehuda Bauer and said, "Bauer, Where is this man?</span> <span id="s293">Can you tell me where he is?</span> <span id="s294">He said yes.</span> <span id="s295">He gave me an address -- he had moved somewhere in the north -- and I wrote him a postcard.</span> <span id="s296">Boom.</span> <span id="s297">A day later, he showed up together with his wife.</span> <span id="s298">He was one of the fellows who organized this little escape business.</span> <span id="s299">My Innsbruck period was the end of 1945, the beginning of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">And I met them and I got linked up with them, and they saw that I could help in some ways, possibly.</span> <span id="s301">I was in a position.</span> <span id="s302">At that time, when I was assigned to Innsbruck, I was a liaison officer to the French Army, to the French Headquarters in Austria.</span> <span id="s303">I was to be an American who could speak French, and I was assigned to be the representative of the U.S. Forces in Austria.</span> <span id="s304">This was the French Forces in Austria, and there I was.</span> <span id="s305">And when I was there, I had an office of my own.</span> <span id="s306">I had a telephone and a rubber stamp and all kinds of things, which I could use and did use occasionally to facilitate their escape.</span> <span id="s307">They got a hold of me and got wind that I was there and I was a possible help so I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: That's marvelous.</span> <span id="s309">When you were talking to some of the survivors, did they tell you of their experiences in the concentration camps and during the war?</span> <span id="s310">Did they confide in you?</span> <span id="s311">Did they tell you their life stories or what they went through or were they just talking about the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: The present.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: And were they talking about the past at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Hardly anything and I didn't see any point in asking about the past.</span> <span id="s315">I think it was sort of taken for granted between us that “we know.”</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did your attitude to the German civilians or German prisoners or German soldiers change at all after you had been in contact with the survivors?</span> <span id="s317">I know that you said you don't generalize and you didn't hate them as a nation, but did your attitude change at all from before meeting the survivors, before going to Dachau, to after being there for quite a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I remember at some point talking to some Germans or Austrians -- later when we were in Austria -- and having a feeling that "I don't like the way this guy is talking."</span> <span id="s319">I don't think there was any difference before and after I met them.</span> <span id="s320">I don't remember, let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s321">If he is behaving as a decent human being, then he's behaving as a decent human being.</span> <span id="s322">If he's behaving as a non-decent human being, if he reminds me of the kind of things that I find objectionable in people, arrogant or whatever, then by God, he's arrogant.</span> <span id="s323">And if I have to kick him in the pants, then I kick him.</span> <span id="s324">Of course this specifically never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did you meet anybody in the Army, among your friends, who had very severe reactions to what they found in concentration camps among the survivors or heard the stories for the first time or was this not a subject that was discussed among the soldiers and among the officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I don't remember discussing these things, but the subject came up every once in a while.</span> <span id="s327">And I remember the subject mainly was what the Germans had done to the Jews during the war.</span> <span id="s328">The subject would come up some time or the other, and I can remember getting slightly involved in discussions because some people were saying that you really couldn't believe that, that it was very exaggerated and "Come on.</span> <span id="s329">Come off it."</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: That it’s not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: So I remember occasional things like that from some fellows, but not people who I respected very much; therefore, not people I had much of a discussion with.</span> <span id="s332">So I would react to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I reacted not with the intent of having an argument because an argument you can’t have on that level with people who are completely indifferent and misinformed to start with.</span> <span id="s335">They should know that it doesn't go by so easily.</span> <span id="s336">In fact, I remember a kind of thing where I really got into hot water.</span> <span id="s337">They were beginning the argument with how much more civilized the Germans are than the French, that the French are just dirty, unkempt, uncouth, you can't believe them.</span> <span id="s338">Germans are much more civilized, organized, and orderly.</span> <span id="s339">They are cleaner.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">That kind of stuff would go on.</span> <span id="s341">I don't know if you have heard such stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s343">Did that make you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yes Doubly.</span> <span id="s345">Not only was it that they were putting up the Germans, but putting down the French, which I consider myself more.</span> <span id="s346">And then from there, I would react to that by telling people they should look at the Germans a little closer.</span> <span id="s347">Don't make such generalizations.</span> <span id="s348">There are things that aren't well known.</span> <span id="s349">They should read; I even would tell them what to read although there are people who are not necessarily readers.</span> <span id="s350">In fact, I can't remember that anyone took up my suggestion to read this or that book.</span> <span id="s351">But, never mind, the point is I was reacting in this way telling them not to go along with this kind of sloppy thinking, thinking they know what the world is all about, but not knowing some fundamental things about the world.</span> <span id="s352">I remember getting really fundamental and philosophic and this is where I got into hot water.</span> <span id="s353">I said, "Some of these things, these evil things, that the Germans did are the kind of thing that you can find in any nation if they let themselves go and they let themselves be guided by certain evil forces that there are.</span> <span id="s354">I wouldn't even be surprised if you can find a bunch of American GIs who could do what the SS had done exactly, provided they were trained for it.”</span> <span id="s355">I felt strong enough with it to say it like that and it ended up I’m saying...by saying it, “You guys know damn well that some of the things that GIs did were not the greatest and the most moral and the most kindly kinds of things while this occupation.”</span> <span id="s356">Sometimes I said to them, "I'm ashamed of the uniform I wear."</span> <span id="s357">So, I don't know if you can guess the kind of reaction that they gave, but they were people that I felt friendly enough with so I knew they...but they reacted with anger, of course, and completely to my luck...and that's the reason I remember it because those are the things that not only are lucky, but they choose the things you yourself might need to know.</span> <span id="s358">I was a second lieutenant and our senior officer was probably nothing more than a first lieutenant or maybe a captain.</span> <span id="s359">I still remember his name.</span> <span id="s360">Finley.</span> <span id="s361">And when I said that, there was silence.</span> <span id="s362">Oppressive silence.</span> <span id="s363">He said, "By God, so do I." I said that sometimes I was ashamed of the uniform I wear and he said, "By God, so do I." I don't know to this day whether he said it only to get me off the hook, or because he really felt that way, or because he felt that there was something in what I said that he would agree, but the fact that he said that probably saved a couple of bones and teeth out of my head.</span> <span id="s364">But, on top of that, I do really believe that this is the kind of thing that we sometimes neglect -- that people are idiotic and stupid and stuff like that, but somewhere near them, if only given the opportunity, will come up a guy who will say the right thing at the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: It's obvious then that you feel that the teaching of the Holocaust and the teaching of what happened is one way of preventing it from happening any place else because I assume that you still feel the same way, that given the “right” set of circumstances and the “right” kind of leadership -- I'm saying "right" in quotation marks -- that any nation could evolve into a situation of such mass destruction and mass hatred and mass extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Killing is the word.</span> <span id="s367">That's another thing that I learned from Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s368">He never used the word “extermination.”</span> <span id="s369">“Extermination” is an insult.</span> <span id="s370">With people, it's “killing.”</span> <span id="s371">And that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: I don't like the word Holocaust either, but it's been used a great deal.</span> <span id="s373">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you feel that it should be taught in school, here as well as in the United States?</span> <span id="s375">We're here in Israel and I don't know how much is being taught here and I'd like to know how you feel about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Yes, I have very strong feeling about that, but not simply that it should be taught.</span> <span id="s377">We the people who are here -- the survivors, the adults, teachers -- have to learn ourselves.</span> <span id="s378">Learn, study the history of this thing, but as a subject for study.</span> <span id="s379">Not a subject for waving around moral principles.</span> <span id="s380">That is for the birds.</span> <span id="s381">By for the birds, I mean morality.</span> <span id="s382">I mean, to tell people that such things are evil... really!</span> <span id="s383">That's not the point.</span> <span id="s384">The point is to say what the things are, what actually happened, and not to say that what happened is just the broad, diffused result of a lot of people being killed.</span> <span id="s385">Because the fact that a lot of Jews were killed, that it was just us, is a fundamental thing that we start with.</span> <span id="s386">We assume.</span> <span id="s387">If some people don't know it, indeed that fundamental thing should be taught.</span> <span id="s388">[The point is to say] the other things that go with it, mainly what exactly happened, how it was built up by the Nazis, and not make it a simplistic matter.</span> <span id="s389">The Nazi's came to power and Hitler....</span></p> <p><span id="s390">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s391">Side Two begins as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: A lot of it has to do with history.</span> <span id="s393">I won't bother you with the details, but I myself have not only studied part of history that I have a particular interest in, but I have an interest in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: So you are a historian, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A I have a historical interest, shall we say.</span> <span id="s396">That’s why Yehuda Bauer’s book is so great because one of the things it shows you is that you've got to study.</span> <span id="s397">You can't make generalizations.</span> <span id="s398">People have made these broad generalizations of one kind or another which just don't hold up when you study.</span> <span id="s399">What holds up when you study?</span> <span id="s400">All the different details.</span> <span id="s401">The differences, for instance, between what happened in which country.</span> <span id="s402">They talk only about the concentration camps in this century -- Polish and East European Jewry.</span> <span id="s403">O.K. Even that had its differences and not every Polish town went through the same automatic circumstances.</span> <span id="s404">And the whole business about generalizing what is called the Judenraten, that they were all of one kind.</span> <span id="s405">They were not.</span> <span id="s406">There were all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s407">This you've got to know.</span> <span id="s408">You can't make it up.</span> <span id="s409">And to know this, you've got to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: How did you get this across to your children?</span> <span id="s411">A: You’ll have to ask them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s412">We tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Well, how did you try?</span> <span id="s414">What was your way of teaching them from what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Just talking about it when the the subjects come up, which they do every once in a while.</span> <span id="s416">We just talk about it and they ask questions.</span> <span id="s417">I tell them what I know and don't know.</span> <span id="s418">We have kids ranging from 19 to 25, and they are very different people.</span> <span id="s419">I hope that they have already absorbed and will yet absorb, but by that age they must have already absorbed and will read.</span> <span id="s420">This remains to be seen.</span> <span id="s421">The proof of the pudding will be in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: How do you feel about the American attempt at publicizing and explaining and presenting this period in a movie like the Holocaust movie?</span> <span id="s423">Do you feel that this is cheapening it or do you think it has a good way of presenting it to the general public?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s425">There's good and bad.</span> <span id="s426">I didn't see it, of course.</span> <span id="s427">I didn’t even listen to it when it was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: You did not.</span> <span id="s429">May I ask why?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I think I felt something like you just hinted at.</span> <span id="s431">That it's a movie about ... but it's a movie.</span> <span id="s432">There was a feeling.</span> <span id="s433">I don't have a valid criticism.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: If I was a non-Jewish American and I would say to you, "Dr. Blanc, I understand there is a Holocaust movie on tonight.</span> <span id="s435">I don't know much about it.</span> <span id="s436">Do you think I should watch it?"</span> <span id="s437">Would you tell me it's just a movie or would you tell me that if you don't know anything about it, maybe a movie is better than nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: To tell the truth, my own attitude I sometimes feel is probably not the most desirable, because I do want people to get better knowledge, to get more knowledge than they have.</span> <span id="s439">It’s just very often they have no knowledge.</span> <span id="s440">Just abysmal ignorance.</span> <span id="s441">So my attitude is that the only way to counter abysmal ignorance is by serious study.</span> <span id="s442">Therefore, I would tend to probably say that movies and things like that are in a category with popular or popularized literature, as opposed to the real thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: For pragmatic reasons, would you rather have a movie like Holocaust be presented to 200 million Americans or would you rather say the ones who want to study it seriously on university levels should study it and the rest of the population should know nothing about it?</span> <span id="s444">Or would you say for pragmatic reasons they should see a movie like Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: There's some truth in what you say that people are not going to study seriously except for a minority; therefore, this business of serious study is addressing a minority.</span> <span id="s446">But if you want this to really be spread so that the whole world understands, maybe it makes some sense to be less finicky about the type of study because any way things are not going to be studied in that way, like what you said, for pragmatic reasons.</span> <span id="s447">Maybe.</span> <span id="s448">But that's a question of philosophy about education and I'm afraid that my philosophy about education is no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: I think it's too good for practicality.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: My philosophy is the kind of thing that's based on a kind of a concept that you need education and the university, read books.</span> <span id="s451">Not to say it's not good.</span> <span id="s452">It's not good enough.</span> <span id="s453">But I don't know that the other thing, mass media education, is good enough.</span> <span id="s454">There must be a way in which the mass media can really, really do in education.</span> <span id="s455">I occasionally hear things.</span> <span id="s456">I'll give you an example.</span> <span id="s457">Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s458">Mass media.</span> <span id="s459">He was talking on the radio, a whole series of lectures, which were beautiful, which were very good.</span> <span id="s460">I’m sure, but it's a matter of faith only, that it's going to influence in the sense that it's going to make people sit up and realize more things than they had realized before because before the [unintelligible] knew nothing.</span> <span id="s461">They knew vague....</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Do you think it should be taught on the high school level already?</span> <span id="s463">I'm talking about America because I'm sure...</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: You should know what answer I'm going to give you.</span> <span id="s465">All the things that ought to be taught to the people in general should be done by people who know, themselves, so there has to be teachers who know and not only teachers, but programmers, people who make education.</span> <span id="s466">Who makes education?</span> <span id="s467">What makes education?</span> <span id="s468">There's a whole set of the population that has absorbed certain things and, having absorbed them thoroughly, they've also absorbed certain methods of imparting them to the population.</span> <span id="s469">I don't know that there are enough people like that yet.</span> <span id="s470">In fact, if they were good, then they should be procured.</span> <span id="s471">If not, there should be some kind of program to teach teachers, to teach people.</span> <span id="s472">And they should get certainly the more rarefied, the more elitist type of education.</span> <span id="s473">I mean they should be taught as teachers, and as teachers, they should be reminded and taught again and again certain things which are part of this world that we live in.</span> <span id="s474">You're asking me a very difficult question.</span> <span id="s475">In other words, how do you teach people the things that come out of this Holocaust period?</span> <span id="s476">How do you teach that there's evil in the world and that something ought to be done about it and one ought not to let forces get their way which are clearly forces of evil.</span> <span id="s477">Not that the Germans are like that and not that the Jews are like that.</span> <span id="s478">No, the world is constituted like that.</span> <span id="s479">How do you get this across to people, how the world is and if you can do something about it so much the better, but maybe you can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: You were very young at the time.</span> <span id="s481">You were only 19.</span> <span id="s482">Did you consider yourself a religious person at the time?</span> <span id="s483">Did you come from a religious home?</span> <span id="s484">Were you observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: [Unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did the experiences during the war change your attitude towards religion or your own practice of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I cannot see anything that has to do with religious....</span> <span id="s488">Q: No.</span> <span id="s489">Your own personal feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: My personal feelings have slightly changed over the years.</span> <span id="s491">I come from a non- religious family, non-religious background, non-religious education, but that's a different area.</span> <span id="s492">And if things have changed, it's only because I got more interested in some subjects having to do with religion, say the Jewish religion specifically, which I had in my background because as a non-religious kid I still had teachers who taught me the Bible, Talmud, [unintelligible], Hebrew language certainly.</span> <span id="s493">So I had a non-religious Jewish background, which included Hebrew and also, therefore, a little Talmud.</span> <span id="s494">So the only thing that's changed is more study in this direction, more looking into facets of Judaism or Jewish thinking which I hadn't [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What are you referring to?</span> <span id="s496">Any thoughts like "If there is a God, how did he permit that?"</span> <span id="s497">That kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: There is no God.</span> <span id="s499">That is no problem for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: That’s how you felt.</span> <span id="s501">In other words, there was no change in your feelings and attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No, not towards that.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: How about the feeling of forgiveness for the people who have committed the atrocities?</span> <span id="s504">Not as a generality to all the Germans, but specifically the ones who were the criminals.</span> <span id="s505">Did you ever feel that they should be forgiven or that you have forgiven them or the victims could forgive them?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: The notion of forgiveness doesn't come into it.</span> <span id="s507">Forgiveness sounds like a religious notion.</span> <span id="s508">I don't know.</span> <span id="s509">Forgiving is not a familiar notion to me.</span> <span id="s510">If my kids do something wrong, it's not a question of forgiving them.</span> <span id="s511">Do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s512">Does forgiving mean that before you forgive them, you attribute some particular guilt to them and then you take it off?</span> <span id="s513">I don't attribute any guilt to them.</span> <span id="s514">If he...Eichmann, when he was on trial.... “you got a hold of Eichmann, good, there's no point.</span> <span id="s515">He should be shot right away and that's it.”</span> <span id="s516">I had the feeling that they made too much of a fuss over it.</span> <span id="s517">.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: That answers my question beautifully.</span> <span id="s519">What about your political views?</span> <span id="s520">You obviously were very educated for a 19 year old already and you must have had some very firmly established political views.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I sure did.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did they change through the war experience or did they just get strengthened in the direction in which you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Coming through the war and meeting these survivors and doing a little work with them absolutely clinched what you might call Zionism.</span> <span id="s524">I had been a Zionist before in the very specific sense that I had been in favor before of the notion of Jewish statehood, Jewish independence, Jews working for, fighting for a stretch of land of their own.</span> <span id="s525">But remember before I could argue back and forth like you do when you are in your late teens at the university.</span> <span id="s526">You’d argue back and forth and think, "Well, is it really right, and what about the Arabs?</span> <span id="s527">And is there a better way?"</span> <span id="s528">For instance, there was a program which I kind of liked around here, which called itself the Binational State Idea.</span> <span id="s529">There were two groups that advocated not a Jewish state, but a binational state that could take care somehow of both the Jews and the Arabs.</span> <span id="s530">There was a group of university professors called B'rich Shalom.</span> <span id="s531">I don't know if you ever heard of it.</span> <span id="s532">Some of the oldsters are still survivors of that movement.</span> <span id="s533">And there was one political party, a political movement, which also for a while, at least, advocated the same thing, a binational state.</span> <span id="s534">And I thought that would be nice because would it be more right?</span> <span id="s535">I mean it would get you your Jewish state, but it would refrain from taking away from the local population some of the things which are their rights as much as ours.</span> <span id="s536">I thought that would be nice.</span> <span id="s537">So my Zionism was one thing that got clinched by the experiences.</span> <span id="s538">There was no more hesitation about the Jewish state and the fact that by coming into being it might cause injustice to some other people, the local Arabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You weren't worrying about the Arabs any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No.</span> <span id="s541">Let them worry about themselves.</span> <span id="s542">I can't do both.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: So you were an American citizen an d in 1946 or so you came back to the United States.</span> <span id="s544">Did you then continue your studies in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s546">In fact, now it occurs to me that I misled you.</span> <span id="s547">I didn't have my BA.</span> <span id="s548">I said I had already a BA in Linguistics.</span> <span id="s549">No, I had had two years towards it.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I thought you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, my complete misrecollection.</span> <span id="s552">What happened was at the end of 1946, I was out of the Army and I went back to Harvard.</span> <span id="s553">In 1948 I finished the B.A.</span> <span id="s554">When I came in 1948, I came with the whole thing clinched up.</span> <span id="s555">The B.A. over and done with, and my internalizing the whole Holocaust period also over and done with.</span> <span id="s556">When the war started, there was no question which way to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So in 1948, you came here?</span> <span id="s558">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: During the fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And that's why you came?</span> <span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And the Holocaust had a lot to do with it?</span> <span id="s564">And your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s566">If I had not been in the Holocaust, I might not have come or I might have hesitated or I might have come anyway, but having been there....</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So it changed your life really.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: At least, shall we say, it pushed me in one of the several directions that you have at that age.</span> <span id="s569">I got pushed into or shall I say strengthened into.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did you ever think of moving to Israel before the war?</span> <span id="s571">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: You did so you were a Zionist then.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: That's what I meant when I said I came from a Zionist upbringing where it was kind of the natural thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You fought in the 1948 War and you joined the Army right away.</span> <span id="s575">You fought here.</span> <span id="s576">Were you hurt in that war?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Sure, that's how I got blinded.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And then after that you continued your studies here.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes, but first I went back to the States to visit my parents.</span> <span id="s580">Q: You were not married?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No.</span> <span id="s582">And I went there both to be home for a while and to see about rehabilitation for myself.</span> <span id="s583">I learned Braille at home in rehabilitation, and the greatest thing was I went to get a guide dog whom I brought back with me.</span> <span id="s584">And for almost 30 years, until the last couple of years when it became impossible to walk properly because of this neuromuscular condition which I developed, I was walking with dogs.</span> <span id="s585">It's been a great part of my life experience, but that's a different subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Very different indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: I can't thank you enough because we do have interviews with American soldiers and American officers and many non-Jewish ones, but I think your story is unique in itself, and I thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I thank you and I will thank you even more if you can manage to get this book by Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s589">By the way, he's got two or three books by now.</span> <span id="s590">I just know that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: I am going to get it and I hope that Emory University has a Holocaust library.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">And they do teach Hebrew.</span> <span id="s593">There is a Chair of Judaica there, and I do hope that I will get the book and I will bring it with me and send it to them so that it will become part of the library.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A:.</span> <span id="s595">I'm not sure he's in the country now, but I think it would be extremely worthwhile if you can get hold of it.</span> <span id="s596">I never met him, but I've talked to him on the phone and I get his radio talks.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">[Interruption on tape.</span> <span id="s598">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Where did you get your lieutenancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: The actual thing was known as The Infantry School in Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span id="s601">Q: Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Atlanta, Georgia, if I’m not mistaken.</span> <span id="s603">The reason I'm hesitating is because there was another camp there, which was called Camp [unintelligible] which was in Macon, Georgia.</span> <span id="s604">That's where I spent my basic training.</span> <span id="s605">And officer training was in this TIS, The Infantry School, and that, I believe, was in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s606">If not, it must be right near.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And now the tape is going to go right back to Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">[The following comments were made by Ms. Singer after the interview.]</span> <span id="s609">This is August 21, 1980.</span> <span id="s610">I'm in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s611">I realized how much of what I saw and heard did not get across on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Dr. Blanc, as you can tell, is a very young man still.</span> <span id="s613">I mean a fairly young man.</span> <span id="s614">He looks a good 30 or more years older than he is.</span> <span id="s615">What he did not admit as freely or as positively as I could see is that, in fact, his experiences in Germany in 1945 and in Austria in 1946 did shape his life.</span> <span id="s616">Not in so far as his political orientation is concerned and not as far as his religious orientation was concerned.</span> <span id="s617">He came from a Reform home and from a non-religious, but Zionist, home so the seed was there.</span> <span id="s618">The impact of what he saw and what he felt, which he is not willing to get in touch with and therefore cannot verbalize, I saw in his face.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">The man came here in 1948 to fight.</span> <span id="s620">He was an American citizen; he came to fight and at the very beginning of his fighting, was blinded completely.</span> <span id="s621">One eye is completely hollow and empty.</span> <span id="s622">There is nothing there.</span> <span id="s623">The other eye is blind.</span> <span id="s624">There is a specific lisp and certain facial habits, such as smacking his lips and blowing in a certain way which obviously has something to do with the injury, not with nervousness or anything like that.</span> <span id="s625">He has been blind for over 30 years, has never stopped working, got his Ph.D., and he is a professor and a very highly respected member of the Israeli academic community.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">n addition to these problems, he is now completely, totally, incapacitated physically.</span> <span id="s627">I can give you that information because a man I work with, Dr. Harry Mendelson in New York, is his lifelong friend.</span> <span id="s628">As a matter of fact, they got their B.A.’s together at Harvard in the forties.</span> <span id="s629">So I can give you the medical explanation of his other incapacity, but it probably is not important.</span> <span id="s630">What is important to know is that he is completely homebound or wheelchair bound.</span> <span id="s631">He lifts himself from a chair to a wheelchair.</span> <span id="s632">He maneuvers that way.</span> <span id="s633">He wears a brace on his leg, but he is physically crippled.</span> <span id="s634">It is a neuromuscular kind of a condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">am personally convinced that if this man had not been in the American Army in Germany and in Austria in 1945, 1946, he would never have gotten here in 1948 and his life would have taken a completely different turn.</span> <span id="s636">What you may hear as lack of emotionality in his answers on the subject of atrocities, of hatred of Germans, or SS, or Nazis, of forgiveness...I wonder whether that came across on the tape.</span> <span id="s637">My own interpretation is this man has transformed these feelings into action, into a dedication, into his life's work; into what he is doing with his family, with his students, with his life in this country.</span> <span id="s638">I don't think he can afford the kind of emotionality that we have very often heard from people who have been shocked and appalled at the atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">This man cannot afford self pity, he cannot afford tears, he cannot afford this type of emotion.</span> <span id="s640">This is my personal impression and I think I am right.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">There is a marvelous gentleness about the man and a marvelous sensitivity.</span> <span id="s642">There are no tears and no sadness, just tremendous strength and dedication towards working against any such evil ever in the future.</span> <span id="s643">He is very pragmatic in his way.</span> <span id="s644">We shut off the tape deck because he was extremely tired, and I had taken a lot of his time and he wanted to talk about his friend, Dr. Mendelson, who is also my friend.</span> <span id="s645">We then went back to the subject of the movie, The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s646">As you heard on the tape, he did not watch it.</span> <span id="s647">I told him how I personally felt about it, that I agreed with many of my friends who are survivors of concentration camps, that it was, in fact, an insult to their memories of what they lived through.</span> <span id="s648">To them, in many ways, it is a mockery and an insult, but at the same time, it has reached many, many millions of people who did not know anything about it and, if they knew a little bit, they didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s649">I told him some instances of young hoodlums who had vandalized the synagogue the week before and after seeing the movie, came to their priest and returned the things, saying that they were ashamed of themselves.</span> <span id="s650">They never realized what the Jewish people had suffered.</span> <span id="s651">So after telling him of some of the side effects of this show in the United States, he did say that he had no way of knowing that, that from a pragmatic point of view, of course, if that's what it does outside of Israel, then it's a marvelous thing and he's all for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">But he is uncompromising in the educational point of view.</span> <span id="s653">He feels that it's a question of morality and teaching from the word growing up, just teaching the Holocaust -- by teaching history, teaching economics, teaching what makes for this kind of a situation; what makes this possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">One personal note: I was not as shattered as I sometimes am after an interview; not as shaken to tears, but I was certainly overwhelmed and impressed by this person -- how he manuvers, how he works.</span> <span id="s655">There are Braille books, Braille typewriters, all kinds of taping machines.</span> <span id="s656">He works with tapes with students.</span> <span id="s657">I can't tell you how impressed and how awed I am by this man, with the way he handles his legs and himself and the total lack of self-pity, the total acceptance of his blindness as well as the physical crippling.</span> <span id="s658">Also, I had seen photographs of him from his early years, from his early twenties.</span> <span id="s659">This was a six foot-two, magnificent, gorgeous young man and, as I say, he looks about 80 and he is completely deformed, facially and in his body.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">One happy note: I did meet his wife.</span> <span id="s661">She is a delightful woman.</span> <span id="s662">Very, very nice, very intelligent, and obviously handles the situation with as much aplomb as he does.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">don't know of how much value this tape will be to the Witness to the Holocaust Project.</span> <span id="s664">I do know that I met a very valuable and very special human being, and I was delighted to have done that.</span> <span id="s665">I will try to get the book by Yehuda Bauer and I will try to bring that with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">repeat that this is a very interesting situation.</span> <span id="s667">This man is a doer.</span> <span id="s668">He's not a crier; he's not a complainer; he's not an emotional dweller on things, but whatever he experienced there, he really put into action and still is doing so.</span> <span id="s669">So his life was very, very deeply affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">am almost sure that what I am going to put on tape now is not on the tape, that it is something he told me after the tape deck was shut off.</span> <span id="s671">And that is that when he was in Innsbruck, which is late 1945 and early 1946, what he was doing 90% of his time was helping refugees and survivors to escape into Italy, illegally, legally, etc.</span> <span id="s672">He was in a position where he was able to shuffle papers in the right direction.</span> <span id="s673">Until the time when he left Innsbruck, he was the second lieutenant who was helping the Israelis get the DP camp people out of Europe and into Israel and over borders.</span> <span id="s674">After I had told him about Dr. Crawford and that Dr. Crawford was the head of this project and how dedicated he is and what he had done and that he had just visited Israel, etc., he told me then that his superior officer was a non-Jew, who then after Dr. Blanc's departure and return to the United States, took over the work that Haim Blanc was doing all those years.</span> <span id="s675">And he started working with the Israelis in helping to get the displaced persons and the survivors out of Europe and into Israel.</span> <span id="s676">And I think that is a very important phase of what he made of his life as an aftermath of what he saw and what he felt and what he witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">forgot to add that Dr. Blanc was recently honored and he was the recipient of a $5,000 Rothschild award.</span> <span id="s678">I don't have further information on the specific date and the purpose or what the award was given for.</span> <span id="s679">I'll try to get that.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">This is about a day later, and I have tried to get the book or any one of the three books by Dr. Yehuda Bauer.</span> <span id="s681">And let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s682">I don't recommend to anybody to try to buy a book in Israel.</span> <span id="s683">I'm going to be here for another week and wish me luck.</span> <span id="s684">I hope I can get at least one of those books.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">This is on another subject.</span> <span id="s686">As you know, I have the name of Rabbi Judah Nadich, who lives in New York, on my list of people to contact and to interview.</span> <span id="s687">I met here in Tel Aviv his daughter and son-in-law.</span> <span id="s688">Rabbi Nadich is in New York.</span> <span id="s689">I'll get in touch with him after the holidays.</span> <span id="s690">I guess he'll be busy now during the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s691">However, I was wondering whether you do have in your library the book which describes, I understand, quite extensively Rabbi Nadich's experiences at the time of the liberation of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s692">The name of the book is Eisenhower and the Jews.</span> <span id="s693">Please let me know whether you have it and, if not, whether you want it.</span> <span id="s694">Maybe I can even get it and have Rabbi Nadich inscribe it.</span> <span id="s695">So this is just for the record, because my head isn't working so well.</span> <span id="s696">So please keep track of this.</span></p></body></html>
