"brother," and he calls me "sister."</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Tell me about how your life changed when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, at the beginning when the Germans came into our hometown, they let us for a while be in our houses, everything was like never nothing happened yet.</span> <span id="s95">Then one summer morning, early morning, they knocked on everybody's doors, and they made everybody get out of the houses, and who wouldn't leave, they shoot right there.</span> <span id="s96">So they got us all out on the streets, and they started marching us, and right next to us, the Gentile people were marching with shovels.</span> <span id="s97">Now we couldn't understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s98">Because nobody said nothing, and then we see the German soldiers walking, and make us march.</span> <span id="s99">So, our city was divided by a railroad.</span> <span id="s100">It was like a new city and an old city.</span> <span id="s101">So we marched over the bridge, and way out of the city, outskirts of the city like in a big field and there were already Germans with the machine guns all around standing and we got in the middle.</span> <span id="s102">And they told us to sit down and wait.</span> <span id="s103">And we sit there and we couldn't understand anything, nothing, and those people with the shovels, they probably went to dig ditches already to kill us or something.</span> <span id="s104">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s105">Because it was the first time.</span> <span id="s106">So, late afternoon, they told us women and children separate, men separate.</span> <span id="s107">They started separating everybody.</span> <span id="s108">And there was one nice soldier, and he walked over and he says the women with the children will live.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">That is all he said.</span> <span id="s110">And we still didn't know what he meant.</span> <span id="s111">So, by that time everybody who had three or four kids started dividing between the people who didn't have kids.</span> <span id="s112">So then they marched the men away first.</span> <span id="s113">And nobody knew where they had taken them and what they would do with them.</span> <span id="s114">Then 20 minutes later, they told all the women, "Line up and start marching towards the city."</span> <span id="s115">So we were told to separate again, as soon as we cross, we got in the middle halfway in the road, and they told us to run.</span> <span id="s116">And everybody started to run into houses.</span> <span id="s117">Whatever house they saw, they just ran.</span> <span id="s118">And right after we got into the houses, we could hear shooting and we more exactly, you know, understood that something was happening.</span> <span id="s119">And nobody knew where the men were or nothing until late evening they came back.</span> <span id="s120">They took them to armory like, a armory for soldiers.</span> <span id="s121">They took them there.</span> <span id="s122">They made them work for awhile, and then they let them go.</span> <span id="s123">And that was the first that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">And right after that, they made a Judenrat--an office, where you have to register to go work.</span> <span id="s125">They came there and they asked for people to work and everybody started working.</span> <span id="s126">And they were young, young kids.</span> <span id="s127">We had to wear first a Jewish star on our arm, like an arm band.</span> <span id="s128">That was not good enough for them because they couldn't tell if you were Jew or not because the right arm band didn't show much.</span> <span id="s129">So they told us to wear a yellow circle in the back of our back and in front.</span> <span id="s130">And I, myself, was not allowed to work, I had been going to work every day, and worked different places and once I was taken to work on a railroad station with some other girls.</span> <span id="s131">We had to carry small bombs.</span> <span id="s132">And the SS were standing with the whips, and if you didn't pick it up and take it on the train, you were whipped.</span> <span id="s133">And it was very bad.</span> <span id="s134">Then, a few months later, they organized a ghetto.</span> <span id="s135">They took one part of the section and all the Jews went to this part of the city.</span> <span id="s136">And they put in like 2 or 3 families in a house.</span> <span id="s137">And they had a gate, and you had to go in through the gate and come out through the gate.</span> <span id="s138">And then, one day they came, with a truck, to mobilize all the young people.</span> <span id="s139">They never came with the truck to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s140">They always went to the office, and then we have to come there and then go to work.</span> <span id="s141">So when I saw the truck, I said to myself, "I am not going."</span> <span id="s142">For some reason, I had a feeling that something was going to be wrong.</span> <span id="s143">So I said "No, I am not going."</span> <span id="s144">My mother didn't insist for me to go either.</span> <span id="s145">She says "You don't want to go, don't!</span> <span id="s146">."</span> <span id="s147">So they had on the front of the house, like an empty store, was bombed, you know, and they came in, and I crawled in there and I sit in there, and I watched through the broken wood pieces.</span> <span id="s148">I could see the truck, and they were loading up as many as they could.</span> <span id="s149">They put one on top of another, and I knew that something was wrong, and those people never came back.</span> <span id="s150">We later found out they were taken to the woods and shot.</span> <span id="s151">And life was going on for awhile like that, and I was working different places.</span> <span id="s152">Once they took a group of girls and three men to a school, to a gymnasium, to make ready the school for the soldiers who had to come into town.</span> <span id="s153">We had to put straw on the floors, clean it.</span> <span id="s154">The men were chopping wood to make a fire, and one German was watching us.</span> <span id="s155">One German was watching us.</span> <span id="s156">They never left us alone.</span> <span id="s157">So after we finished, we told them we finished, and we free to go?</span> <span id="s158">He said, "No, we have to stay and wait for the soldiers."</span> <span id="s159">So, I said, "No, something is going to happen when the soldiers come in."</span> <span id="s160">So I say to the girls, "We have to run."</span> <span id="s161">They say, "How can we run, the soldiers here."</span> <span id="s162">I said, "I get rid of them."</span> <span id="s163">I went outside and I told the men to come out for a minute and keep him busy.</span> <span id="s164">I told him why and we could get away.</span> <span id="s165">And while he was there, we run out and we run into the office, to the Judenrat, and we told the man what happened.</span> <span id="s166">So he put us in another room, he closed the door, and put a bookcase in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Because he was afraid, the German might come back, and sure enough he came.</span> <span id="s168">He came looking for us.</span> <span id="s169">And he says he never saw us, the building is big, and we might be wandering around in the building.</span> <span id="s170">He left, and when it got dark, we came out and went home.</span> <span id="s171">And that is how it went on for quite some time.</span> <span id="s172">And then they organized us again and they took us to a train station and they had a big barn and we had to stay there for a whole week to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Men, old men and girls, it doesn't matter what size.</span> <span id="s174">And they had a Gentile woman prepare the soup, whatever they gave us, so one day when they served us the food, she said to me, "You know when you finish working here, they are going to blow up the building with you all.</span> <span id="s175">I can help you get out if you want.</span> <span id="s176">Tell everybody what is happening."</span> <span id="s177">So that evening I told them that we had to get out because by tomorrow it might be the end of us.</span> <span id="s178">Nobody wanted to listen to me.</span> <span id="s179">They all were saying, "Ah, you just think so."</span> <span id="s180">Nobody believed that that was going to happen, something.</span> <span id="s181">So I told her that I am ready to go.</span> <span id="s182">So she brought me a long skirt for summertime, and she bought me a shawl like the people from the farmers wear.</span> <span id="s183">And I got dressed, and she got me out of there.</span> <span id="s184">And I started walking maybe 30 or 40 kilometers home.</span> <span id="s185">Took me a whole day.</span> <span id="s186">And when I got to the house and knocked on the door, my mother was shocked to see me; because she didn't expect me home yet.</span> <span id="s187">She asked me what happened, and I said that is what news we got.</span> <span id="s188">And sure enough, they finished working that Friday; and sure enough, that Friday night, that building went off.</span> <span id="s189">There is one person also escaped that day before the blow up, and he came home and told what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: The rest of them were all killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: The rest of them were killed.</span> <span id="s192">You see, before they even sent them to camps, they got rid of people, as much as they could.</span> <span id="s193">And that went on until 1942.</span> <span id="s194">And by that time, everybody got a little smarter and understood what was happening.</span> <span id="s195">So everybody made like shelters in the basements, wherever they can find a place.</span> <span id="s196">Like the house I lived, they made under the steps.</span> <span id="s197">They made an opening.</span> <span id="s198">You could not really get in too many people there, you know, just enough to get in.</span> <span id="s199">And one morning when we woke up, we saw trucks right in front of the gate along the street, a lot of Germans, and we understood that something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s200">So we crawled into the shelter.</span> <span id="s201">And we could hear stomping around in the house, looking, and it was terrible that day.</span> <span id="s202">We sit quiet.</span> <span id="s203">We didn't have food in there.</span> <span id="s204">We didn't expect, you didn't know when they could do it, so you couldn't prepare yourself.</span> <span id="s205">So then, after a couple of days sitting in there, the water pipe broke, and the water started coming up, gushing out there, and was almost to our necks, and we had to get out.</span> <span id="s206">We couldn't stay no longer.</span> <span id="s207">So we came out during the night, went into the house, we changed the clothes.</span> <span id="s208">We didn't think about nothing, just to get out.</span> <span id="s209">And right across the street from the ghetto, there was Gentile people which my mother knew and she secured, we had to run, they will keep us.</span> <span id="s210">So we ran from our house to the front house which was closer to the road, and we looked around, nobody was there, and we went across the street.</span> <span id="s211">And my mother knocked on the back door, and the man opened the door and he said if we not going to leave he is going to call the Germans.</span> <span id="s212">He no want to see us and he doesn't know us.</span> <span id="s213">So we had no place to go, so next door was another Gentile person who knew us.</span> <span id="s214">My mother went over there, and he says he can keep us overnight and during the day we will have to leave because it is right by the main road and he really don't have a place to keep us.</span> <span id="s215">So he had a big stack of hay in the middle of the yard.</span> <span id="s216">Anybody could walk over and punch the hay and find us.</span> <span id="s217">And we crawled in there.</span> <span id="s218">He brought us some food and we sat the next day, all day, and the evening he bought us some clothes so we be looking like Gentile people, and we started walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Where we were going we didn't know ourselves.</span> <span id="s220">My mother had in mind there was a woman living on the outskirts of the city, maybe she will keep us.</span> <span id="s221">So we walked over to her place, and when we got to her place we heard German voices in the house.</span> <span id="s222">So we couldn't do nothing, so she had like a little shack which she used to keep a pig in there.</span> <span id="s223">We crawled in this little shack and we sat there and waited until the Germans left.</span> <span id="s224">When the Germans left, my mother knocked on the door, and the woman said she is very sorry, she couldn't keep us.</span> <span id="s225">She has no room and her daughter is dating those Germans.</span> <span id="s226">She says "You can stay tonight if you want, and tomorrow maybe.</span> <span id="s227">You have to go."</span> <span id="s228">So we stayed overnight and the next morning, early morning, my mother got up, she got dressed, and she left us there, and she went to look for a place.</span> <span id="s229">She was gone all day, and in the evening she came, she says, "I find a place."</span> <span id="s230">She didn't know the person, the person didn't know her.</span> <span id="s231">She was a very nice Gentile woman.</span> <span id="s232">She believed in God.</span> <span id="s233">She said God sent us to her and she has to do it.</span> <span id="s234">She was a poor woman.</span> <span id="s235">And we came there, the next morning we came there.</span> <span id="s236">And the next morning she put us in the barn at first.</span> <span id="s237">She knew that we couldn't stay there because anybody who comes in the fields to work, because her husband was a forest man, and everybody had a piece of ground and worked in those fields.</span> <span id="s238">She was afraid anybody come to the field would see us.</span> <span id="s239">So we were there for awhile and in Europe, they really make a big ditch, big hole, and they put potatoes and they keep them over winter there.</span> <span id="s240">She had potatoes in there.</span> <span id="s241">So she took the potatoes out.</span> <span id="s242">She put some straw down and she put some boards over top.</span> <span id="s243">She put a pole in the middle to hold it on and on top, she put in pumpkins, a whole bunch of pumpkins.</span> <span id="s244">And she just made a small hole so we could climb in there.</span> <span id="s245">And we went in there, it was in the fall.</span> <span id="s246">We went in there, and we sit there for 16 months in that little hole, in that little place.</span> <span id="s247">You couldn't even stretch your feet out.</span> <span id="s248">And she brought us food once a day.</span> <span id="s249">We had one potato, each of us a day, and a quart of water a day.</span> <span id="s250">She, herself, didn't have much food.</span> <span id="s251">She was glad to feed us with that, and we were happy to get this so long as we are safe.</span> <span id="s252">And some days when it was quiet she used to come take the pumpkin away so we can get some air.</span> <span id="s253">One day she took the pumpkin away.</span> <span id="s254">And we were sitting and talking between each other; and all of a sudden, a car came by and threw the pumpkin on the hole.</span> <span id="s255">So I said to my father, I said, "Ah, I am going to open up.</span> <span id="s256">I will push it."</span> <span id="s257">He said, "No, leave it along."</span> <span id="s258">And right after that, two Germans passed by.</span> <span id="s259">It looked like the car knew...we...that we were there, and she has to save us.</span> <span id="s260">And we was there for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s261">And the woman knew what was going on, because if they caught people at Gentile's houses, they killed the Gentile and the Jews.</span> <span id="s262">She didn't care.</span> <span id="s263">She just want to save us.</span> <span id="s264">She had one little boy, she had three kids, and one little kid was 4 years old.</span> <span id="s265">He used to go in the field sometimes and get some carrots out of the ground and bring them down to us.</span> <span id="s266">He used to say, "The Germans will not live to long enough to kill you."</span> <span id="s267">He was very nice, the little kid.</span> <span id="s268">And we were there, and then one day, like she noticed it, she thought somebody saw us.</span> <span id="s269">It was wintertime.</span> <span id="s270">It was cold.</span> <span id="s271">She says we have to get out of there.</span> <span id="s272">And we went out of there, and we go into the forest.</span> <span id="s273">On ice!</span> <span id="s274">We laid on that, and we had hardly any clothes.</span> <span id="s275">We laid all night on that ice.</span> <span id="s276">Everybody, when I tell them, I tell them the story about this ice, they don't believe me and I didn't get pneumonia or something.</span> <span id="s277">It looks like our bodies were so strong, they took anything.</span> <span id="s278">And we stayed overnight and the next morning, we went back in, and we stayed there until 1944.</span> <span id="s279">In 1944, she, herself, used to go to the city and bring us newspapers so we could read to her because she couldn't read and write.</span> <span id="s280">So in the evenings she used to bring a candle with the paper, and my father used to read the news to her.</span> <span id="s281">And we told her if she goes into town, see what happens, if she talks to people, tell us what is happening.</span> <span id="s282">So in that year of '44, she came back and said the people were talking the Russians were coming back.</span> <span id="s283">So it was good news, already the Germans were leaving.</span> <span id="s284">So one day she came and she says, "The Germans are out.</span> <span id="s285">There was bombing and all that, and the Germans are out, and the Russians are back in."</span> <span id="s286">So my parents go out.</span> <span id="s287">And they left us still in that hole because they were not sure what was going on.</span> <span id="s288">They left to town.</span> <span id="s289">And we were sitting there; and my sisters were giving me a hard time because they were upset.</span> <span id="s290">I was upset myself.</span> <span id="s291">And we could do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s292">And she didn't know where they were either.</span> <span id="s293">So after a couple of days, there was a big snow and they came back.</span> <span id="s294">They came back, and they couldn't find us because the snow covered the ground so bad.</span> <span id="s295">They knew where the place was, it was hard to find the opening.</span> <span id="s296">And we heard inside that somebody is walking around and like working with something.</span> <span id="s297">We were afraid to say anything, because we didn't know really who it was.</span> <span id="s298">So at that time I said to my sisters, , "I think maybe they came for us.</span> <span id="s299">Just don't cry, don't make noise."</span> <span id="s300">And at that time, I heard my mother's voice in Jewish--"Kids, we are here."</span> <span id="s301">Oh, when I heard that, I was in heaven!</span> <span id="s302">And they came with a wagon, with horses, some comforters, down comforters, and clothes for us.</span> <span id="s303">They threw down the clothes, and they pulled us out of there.</span> <span id="s304">We couldn't even stand up, so weak we were.</span> <span id="s305">And the put us right on that wagon.</span> <span id="s306">And a doctor, gynecologist, a woman doctor, she took us into her house.</span> <span id="s307">And my younger sister could hardly walk at all.</span> <span id="s308">Another doctor took her in and kept her for awhile, to put her back on her feet.</span> <span id="s309">And we really had a hard time getting back on our feet because whatever food we ate didn't stay with us because we were not used to all that stuff.</span> <span id="s310">And there was a lot of nice Gentile people who came and brought us food and brought us everything.</span> <span id="s311">And then we started looking around, looked for our own house.</span> <span id="s312">Our house was gone.</span> <span id="s313">So then we find another empty house, so we moved in there.</span> <span id="s314">And we stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s315">And then, in the fall, my mother adopted a boy who was left alone.</span> <span id="s316">The way she adopted him, this gentlemen had him and had another little girl with him.</span> <span id="s317">And he came to our house.</span> <span id="s318">He knew my parents.</span> <span id="s319">He came over and asked we take him in.</span> <span id="s320">My mother right away said, "Fine.</span> <span id="s321">He is mine."</span> <span id="s322">And we had a hard time with him, because he was so used to the Gentile person he didn't really want to stay with us.</span> <span id="s323">But after a while he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s324">And then from there we left to _ód_, and we were there for awhile.</span> <span id="s325">And from there, we went to Germany to a DP camp in Berlin.</span> <span id="s326">And we were there for awhile, and from there we went to another DP camp in Eschwege.</span> <span id="s327">And from there we left for the United States; in 1949, we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Going back to the time in the hole, did you ever get to come out?</span> <span id="s329">Were you able to stand up in there?</span> <span id="s330">You actually just sat?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Sat or laid down.</span> <span id="s332">And that was it.</span> <span id="s333">Just there, and the four walls.</span> <span id="s334">Q: How many of you were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Five.</span> <span id="s336">My mother, father, and three of us, my sisters, all three kids.</span> <span id="s337">Q: And what about sanitary conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: We had a pot.</span> <span id="s339">We hardly had to go because we didn't eat much.</span> <span id="s340">Q: How old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, at '42, I was almost 17.</span> <span id="s342">Q: You were all teenage girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I was a teenage girl.</span> <span id="s344">My sisters...at that time, was one of them was 8.</span> <span id="s345">The younger one was 8; and one of them was 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: The hole was covered by snow.</span> <span id="s347">How were you able to breath?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: We had a hole, and we just put away there.</span> <span id="s349">You know where it was closed with?</span> <span id="s350">You see, at wintertime, she took the pumpkins away, because pumpkins couldn't lay there in the winter.</span> <span id="s351">So she put cow manure on the top.</span> <span id="s352">And we opened a little bit the hole, and that is how we got air.</span> <span id="s353">I was in one slip, I am sorry to remember.</span> <span id="s354">It fell apart, really.</span> <span id="s355">That is how we hardly have any clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: How did you pass the hours during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: We just laid there and talked and looked at each other and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Did you try to teach your sisters anything you remembered from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: We didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s360">We just laid there; and we were like waiting.</span> <span id="s361">Something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s362">You didn't know from one day to the next who is going to come by there, who is going to do something.</span> <span id="s363">Time was just going like nothing.</span> <span id="s364">She went once to the synagogue to see it once.</span> <span id="s365">The synagogue was bombed.</span> <span id="s366">I have a picture of that synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Will you show it to me?</span> <span id="s368">That is the main synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: That is the main synagogue.</span> <span id="s370">Being hid there before the Germans came, we heard the Russians first before the Germans.</span> <span id="s371">And then when the Germans started getting closer to our town and when they were bombing, so we had to run and we ran into this synagogue.</span> <span id="s372">And there we were for awhile.</span> <span id="s373">Then we went to another place to hid.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you remember being in the hole?</span> <span id="s375">Is it something that is sort of in your memory?</span> <span id="s376">This seems almost incredible to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: When I talk about it, this hole stays right in front of me, the picture of it, the straw and the pole.</span> <span id="s378">Because this woman used to go and beg for food, and she used to get bread.</span> <span id="s379">She used to bring their bread.</span> <span id="s380">And she used to bring us some bread.</span> <span id="s381">And so what we did, we had potatoes and some bread, so we took the bread, tied it with a rope, and hanged it on that pole for later.</span> <span id="s382">We didn't want to eat it up, in case we get hungry later.</span> <span id="s383">And I remember, like today, it standing right in front of me, we were laying and looking at that pole and that bread.</span> <span id="s384">We wanted so badly.</span> <span id="s385">We didn't want to touch it, because we didn't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s386">She might not be able to come tomorrow with food or something so we just kept it and looked at it all night and all day.</span> <span id="s387">So finally in the morning we got to it.</span> <span id="s388">(Starts Side B) And we all had to cover up with it.</span> <span id="s389">This whole thing stays right in front of me right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: The ground must have gotten frozen in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s391">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s392">Sure it was.</span> <span id="s393">It was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: What do you think kept your family going at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I don't know, I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s396">Maybe God's will was with us and just kept us there.</span> <span id="s397">Q: Did your parents talk to you about the need to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, my mother used to say, "We'll make it."</span> <span id="s399">That is all she used to say all the time to us, "Not to worry, we are going to make it.</span> <span id="s400">We make it so far, we'll make it."</span> <span id="s401">And sure enough, we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did you have a sense of passage of time?</span> <span id="s403">You say it was 16 months, but when you are in a dark hole like that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We didn't know from day to night.</span> <span id="s405">We knew day because when she opened up the hole.</span> <span id="s406">No, we didn't know what day it was.</span> <span id="s407">We didn't know if it was a holiday, if it was anything.</span> <span id="s408">Once she went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s409">I don't know why she went to the synagogue, and she found some prayer books, and she brought it to us.</span> <span id="s410">And that is how we knew when was the holiday, what was happening.</span> <span id="s411">Honest, we didn't know of nothing.</span> <span id="s412">We didn't know what month it was, we didn't know what day it was, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Were you able to bathe in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s415">We just took a little bit of water on our fingers in the morning just to like wet it and that is it, because we didn't want to use up the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did any of you ever get sick during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span> <span id="s418">It is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s419">Really, real unbelievable that we didn't get sick.</span> <span id="s420">We had been under the snow all day, all night I mean, and on ice, and nobody from us got sick.</span> <span id="s421">We were sitting there just like, I don't know, a closet.</span> <span id="s422">You are not like a person.</span> <span id="s423">You just sit there and wait for the minute something going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did the person who was taking care of you ever fail to show up?</span> <span id="s425">A: No, she never.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: She came every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Every day.</span> <span id="s428">She came early in the morning.</span> <span id="s429">Because she was afraid during the day somebody comes by there, so she would be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Was there one person that was more in charge of keeping your morale up, most in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: My mother.</span> <span id="s432">She was, really.</span> <span id="s433">We could been gone to Russia, because the Russians were first in our city.</span> <span id="s434">And everybody worked for the Russians.</span> <span id="s435">And that day, when the Germans started invading our city, the people from the office said whoever wants to go to Russia with them, to learn with them, they give a wagon, horses, and you can take belongings and go with them.</span> <span id="s436">And my mother says, "No.</span> <span id="s437">Whatever is going to happen, I am staying in my home.</span> <span id="s438">I am not leaving."</span> <span id="s439">And we stayed.</span> <span id="s440">A lot of people left.</span> <span id="s441">A lot of people went and a lot of people stayed.</span> <span id="s442">Not many survived.</span> <span id="s443">Just a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Those who went or those who stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Those who went, some of them survived.</span> <span id="s446">And these who stayed, not all of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Just a few survived.</span> <span id="s448">You could count them on your fingers.</span> <span id="s449">Whoever survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Tell us about your mother.</span> <span id="s451">What kind of person she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: She was a very good person.</span> <span id="s453">She was very open to everybody.</span> <span id="s454">She had her doors always open.</span> <span id="s455">Anybody wants to come eat and drink, she was always welcoming.</span> <span id="s456">And this brother of mine, he went through a lot.</span> <span id="s457">He was himself from Russia.</span> <span id="s458">I got the town he was born.</span> <span id="s459">He was born October 14, 1929, in _ód_, Poland.</span> <span id="s460">And he was near the grave of his parents when they took him out, the Germans.</span> <span id="s461">And he was talking to the German right where they were sitting waiting.</span> <span id="s462">And when the German turned around, he ran.</span> <span id="s463">He ran away and started wandering from city to city begging for food, go to farmers, to work.</span> <span id="s464">And finally got this one farmer; and that farmer took him in and he kept him, because he worked for him.</span> <span id="s465">And this farmer knew my parents.</span> <span id="s466">So he find out that we back, he came over one day, by himself, and said he has two Jewish children.</span> <span id="s467">One of them he would like to give away.</span> <span id="s468">So my mother told him she doesn't mind take two of them.</span> <span id="s469">He says, "How can you take two?</span> <span id="s470">You got three already."</span> <span id="s471">She says, "Never mind.</span> <span id="s472">Just bring me the kids."</span> <span id="s473">So he came the next day and brought them.</span> <span id="s474">The little girl was maybe then 4 years old, or 5.</span> <span id="s475">She was a very beautiful little girl.</span> <span id="s476">And this young man, he was about 13.</span> <span id="s477">And he says the child he is not giving away, for only one reason.</span> <span id="s478">Because he took her in and she was 6 months old, he had a lot of problems with the Germans.</span> <span id="s479">Because people told him he got a Jewish little girl, and he wanted to prove to the Germans she's not Jewish.</span> <span id="s480">They took blood tests and all that.</span> <span id="s481">He said he went through a lot, and he don't want to give her up.</span> <span id="s482">She is going to get older and understand, and he'll tell her who she was.</span> <span id="s483">And it is up to her to decide what she want to do.</span> <span id="s484">And if she wants to be Jewish, he will let her go to the United States, he said.</span> <span id="s485">So we said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s486">We couldn't force him.</span> <span id="s487">And the young man stayed with us; and he really didn't want to stay with us.</span> <span id="s488">He was so used to the farmer that he wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s489">And me and my two sisters, we had one bed we slept in.</span> <span id="s490">So we didn't have room for him.</span> <span id="s491">So [we] slept on the floor, and we put him in the bed so we could watch him.</span> <span id="s492">Because we didn't want him to run away from us.</span> <span id="s493">We liked for him to get used to us and be with us, like one of us.</span> <span id="s494">And my mother was very happy to have him, and he was very grateful to my mother.</span> <span id="s495">Because if not us, he said, he didn't know what would happen to him.</span> <span id="s496">Now later on, when we went to Germany, he find an uncle in Chicago.</span> <span id="s497">And his uncle took him out to Chicago.</span> <span id="s498">When we were leaving Germany, his uncle took him to Chicago.</span> <span id="s499">He was there for a year.</span> <span id="s500">And he used to call us .</span> <span id="s501">And I lived in Washington, and my parents went to New York with my other two sisters.</span> <span id="s502">And he wrote to me and said he would like to come for a visit.</span> <span id="s503">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s504">And when he came for a visit, he liked it.</span> <span id="s505">So he left his uncle.</span> <span id="s506">He wasn't happy there.</span> <span id="s507">And he stayed with us until he got married.</span> <span id="s508">He is married, and he got four kids.</span> <span id="s509">His kids treat me like I am his real...their real adopted aunt, you know.</span> <span id="s510">And just like a real aunt, and we are very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Was this a common thing that went on among the people that survived the war?</span> <span id="s512">Did they take in lots of people like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Well, in our city we were the only ones where we find a child.</span> <span id="s514">Maybe in other cities, you know, was a lot of left kids too, and they were taken in.</span> <span id="s515">I couldn't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Do you know the name of the woman who hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Her name was [Ropina (ph)].</span> <span id="s518">That is all I remember.</span> <span id="s519">She stays right in front of me.</span> <span id="s520">She was a very tall, heavy set woman--a very nice woman.</span> <span id="s521">So after we got to the United States, my mother helped her out a lot.</span> <span id="s522">She mailed a lot of packages.</span> <span id="s523">She kept in touch with her.</span> <span id="s524">And she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you ever see her again after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No.</span> <span id="s527">Because we went to _ód_.</span> <span id="s528">And from _ód_, we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s529">And we couldn't get so easy to the DP camps to Germany.</span> <span id="s530">You have to really like go across the border, and you had to do it most like at night, you know.</span> <span id="s531">They caught us once, and they sent us back.</span> <span id="s532">And then at that time, I was married already.</span> <span id="s533">I got married in _ód_(ph).</span> <span id="s534">And then we went again.</span> <span id="s535">And we went through, and we were first in Berlin in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s536">And there my older daughter got born, in [Schlochenzee (ph)].</span> <span id="s537">And from there we went to this Eschwege.</span> <span id="s538">Then the HIAS made arrangements and looked up some...well, to see United States my husband had relatives, in Washington.</span> <span id="s539">And that is how we came.</span> <span id="s540">We came first.</span> <span id="s541">Me and my husband and my daughter came first to the United States in 1949.</span> <span id="s542">And then my parents came later to New</span></p> <p><span id="s543">York.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Can you tell me more about how you met your husband, how that all came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well, when I lived in _ód_, my mother had a little businesslike store, something to make a living of.</span> <span id="s546">And the stores, you didn't have to pay at that time; because there were empty stores.</span> <span id="s547">You just took a store and fixed it up, and made yourself a little business.</span> <span id="s548">And he came into the store, and there was somebody else who knew him and introduced us.</span> <span id="s549">And that is how we got acquainted.</span> <span id="s550">And we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Was he a refugee of the war also?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yah, He was in Russia.</span> <span id="s553">He was from another town, and he was in Russia.</span> <span id="s554">He went through a lot in Russia, too; and then, after the war, came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s555">He came to look for his family.</span> <span id="s556">He met him...his brother was left, just two of them.</span> <span id="s557">They both ran away, and they both were left.</span> <span id="s558">And the rest of the family was all gone.</span> <span id="s559">Nobody was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: What made you head for Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Well, they were saying there was DP camps in Germany, and from there you can get the United States.</span> <span id="s562">Because it was not really Poland already.</span> <span id="s563">It was Russia, because the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s564">So, nobody wanted to stay with the Russians.</span> <span id="s565">So everybody was trying to get out of there.</span> <span id="s566">So that is how we went to DP camp first.</span> <span id="s567">And from there, the Joint was and the HIAS.</span> <span id="s568">And they find your relatives, if you have any.</span> <span id="s569">And that is how you get to the United States.</span> <span id="s570">A lot of people didn't have relatives.</span> <span id="s571">Just the HIAS was, you know, bring them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: What were conditions like at the time that the war ended?</span> <span id="s573">A: You mean when we first came out?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Well, it was very bad.</span> <span id="s576">Because everything was bombed, you know.</span> <span id="s577">A lot of places were bombed up, and the food wasn't that great.</span> <span id="s578">You couldn't get food that great.</span> <span id="s579">You had to requisition food and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s580">And later on, little by little, it got better.</span> <span id="s581">I have a picture here of my family.</span> <span id="s582">This is my brother with my sister--the boy my mother adopted.</span> <span id="s583">Here, I got my mother and father here, myself, my husband, and my two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s585">Just hold them up a little longer, and the camera can focus in on them to get a clear picture.</span> <span id="s586">And this was taken when?</span> <span id="s587">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s589">That was in _ód_ taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: First you went back to your old city.</span> <span id="s591">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Old city.</span> <span id="s593">And then from there we went to _ód_.</span> <span id="s594">And we didn't go by train.</span> <span id="s595">We went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">It was a freight train.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Would you pick up the picture with your brother, because we need another shot of that?</span> <span id="s598">A: Got that?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: They need the picture back.</span> <span id="s600">A: Of my brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: You were saying you didn't go to _ód_ by train.</span> <span id="s603">How did you go?</span> <span id="s604">A: By freight train.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: By freight train?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: We had the luggage, whatever we owned at that time, everything was laying on the

walking the street, my husband and his friends, they say, "Let's have a picture taken with this monument."</span> <span id="s637">And that is when they took the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: I would like to go back to the time you were working with the Germans, and there was a particular instance when you took a bomb in a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Oh,

city.</span> <span id="s644">And everybody was thinking that we be gone with that bomb together.</span> <span id="s645">What else they could think?</span> <span id="s646">And we got there, they took that bomb, they themselves, the men, the men took the bomb and put it in the middle and they told everybody step back and they blowed the bomb up by themselves.</span> <span id="s647">And we all were so shocked when they told us to go back on the truck, we got back to the city, that we couldn't move.</span> <span id="s648">One have to help the other to get on that truck.</span> <span id="s649">And when we ride back into the city into the ghetto, everybody was outside, like they were waiting for some kind of news, and when they saw us, everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s650">They couldn't believe, because what happened before with the truck with the people they took.</span> <span id="s651">So they couldn't believe that we came back alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Nobody ever told you anything or explained anything?</span> <span id="s653">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s654">They just put you on the truck and go.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What did you think it was all about?</span> <span id="s656">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: We thought we were going to do something.</span> <span id="s658">We didn't expect, when they take you, you don't expect they are going to kill you.</span> <span id="s659">They take you to another city or they take you to work or do something.</span> <span id="s660">Nobody expect a killing because whatever they did, they did on the spur of the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Who was in charge of you?</span> <span id="s662">Was it local people, was it Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No.</span> <span id="s664">No.</span> <span id="s665">It was Jewish people that were working in that office.</span> <span id="s666">They were in charge.</span> <span id="s667">And the Germans came to them and kept the news.</span> <span id="s668">You know, people to work and whatever.</span> <span id="s669">And they didn't say a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: What about your younger sisters?</span> <span id="s671">Did they work also?</span> <span id="s672">A: No.</span> <span id="s673">I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: They were allowed to remain in there?</span> <span id="s675">A: They were inside the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Did your mother and father work?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s678">Everybody went separate ways.</span> <span id="s679">Nobody knew who was going to come back in the evening to the house.</span> <span id="s680">Who is going to come back?</span> <span id="s681">Nobody knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What about getting food?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: The food wasn't - we couldn't get too much food, and whatever we got we made it enough.</span> <span id="s684">We made to do.</span> <span id="s685">Everybody was afraid to say something because we didn't know what was going to happen, so whatever they gave us we just made it enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Did they issue you food?</span> <span id="s687">Did you stand in line to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: We had to stand in line.</span> <span id="s689">They give you so much food for the day.</span> <span id="s690">Each day you had to get each person food, and sometime they gave you for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Tell me about when you came to this country.</span> <span id="s692">They suggested that we stop at this point because we are about to run out of tape.</span></p></body></html>
