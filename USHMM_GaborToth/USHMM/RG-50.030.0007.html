born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born July 12, 1921 in Leipzig, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about your family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s20">We were seven children, four boys, three girls, my mother, my father.</span> <span id="s21">We, I would say, upper middle class Jewish family.</span> <span id="s22">We had a good life.</span> <span id="s23">We had want for nothing.</span> <span id="s24">And uh we was just happy all around, just a happy family life.</span> <span id="s25">We had a good family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father was a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s28">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s29">Uh we all went to school and uh we had a very comfortable existence.</span> <span id="s30">It was good living in those days in in Germany.</span> <span id="s31">It was really was a good life, a good wholesome life.</span> <span id="s32">And uh we had a good social life and uh my brothers were...I'm the youngest of the boys and had three little sisters, and uh we all loved one another.</span> <span id="s33">Everything was fine, until...until uh 1938 I really did not believe...comprehend what was going on.</span> <span id="s34">I remember my mother keep saying, don't be outside too long.</span> <span id="s35">Come on home and and uh when you go to the schul (ph), the temple, come right back home and we kept the holidays and we had a all around good life and uh people were talking and uh...about the Nazis.</span> <span id="s36">We saw the brown shirts (ph) and the SS and and and uh sure we weren't allowed to go to parks, but we...I all...failed to understand the significance of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s37">Uh we weren't allowed to uh go to movies.</span> <span id="s38">We weren't' allowed to go to the zoo...Jews uh not allowed.</span> <span id="s39">We weren't allowed to uh go shopping in stores.</span> <span id="s40">We used to go to a store to buy something.</span> <span id="s41">We had to wait till everybody was served.</span> <span id="s42">We were always the last one to get what we want, if we were lucky enough to get it.</span> <span id="s43">And by by the time I was eleven, twelve years old, I was thrown out of school.</span> <span id="s44">Well, there there was a Jewish school in my uh hometown, in Leipzig (ph), but there were so many Jewish kids that they didn't have enough room for all the kids.</span> <span id="s45">So we only could go to school maybe two hours a week or three hours a week in shifts.</span> <span id="s46">And we had all this...I took stride.</span> <span id="s47">I just didn't...I really didn't understand this whole thing, and nobody else really explained anything to us.</span> <span id="s48">They would try to keep it away from us...until uh 1938.</span> <span id="s49">The week before Kristallnacht when they start to arrest all the Jews of Polish background origin, they deported them.</span> <span id="s50">Uh the children were in school and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the houses cooking and things, and just were arrested, one after another, put to...not not given time uh to pack anything.</span> <span id="s51">Took them to trains...the father in one train, the mother in the other train.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Nobody knew where anybody was and the children came home from school.</span> <span id="s53">The place was padlocked.</span> <span id="s54">They sat outside, didn't know what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s55">Then they grabbed the children, put them on another train until they they worked it out, what was happening and everybody started running for the em...consulate, the embassies, because the embassies...they couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s56">They were safe there.</span> <span id="s57">So they went to the French Embassy.</span> <span id="s58">They went to the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s59">They went to the Russian Embassy.</span> <span id="s60">They went to the Danish, Norwegian, Swiss...anything that was near.</span> <span id="s61">So our job was to bring food to these people and take messages, because if the wife was in the Danish Embassy and the husband was in the in the French Embassy, we just took messages back and forth trying to seek the families out to tell them that their loved ones were alright.</span> <span id="s62">That went on for a couple of days, and uh the night...the 8th of November...I believe it was the 9th or the 8th...8th or 9th of November I believe...I never forgot...the uh the uh Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">That is when I really really was hit with the uh with the happenings there.</span> <span id="s64">They came to our house.</span> <span id="s65">They broke everything up and like that in every other house.</span> <span id="s66">They were raping the young girls in the streets and and dragging men by their beards through the streets and burning down the temples and and and and and threw...I remember they threw all our furniture and dishes and everything out the window and and and uh beat us up.</span> <span id="s67">They came in...the Hitler youth...with their daggers, blood and honor, and punks, bands of punks and they're beating everybody up, taking people to concentration camps, arresting people and it was just a terrible, terrible night.</span> <span id="s68">It started about three o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s69">That night they arrested my brother Paul.</span> <span id="s70">My brother uh Bernie (ph), he had left.</span> <span id="s71">Of course, there was still home...I was still home, my three sisters.</span> <span id="s72">We were hiding in one of the beds but they dragged us out, beat up my mother and the next day it was quiet.</span> <span id="s73">The smoke was still coming out of the buildings of the temples and the schules and houses and there was still blood in the street.</span> <span id="s74">Now I knew...now I knew...something terrible is happening.</span> <span id="s75">But I didn't know what to do about it.</span> <span id="s76">I had my mama.</span> <span id="s77">I had my mother.</span> <span id="s78">She was always taking care of us.</span> <span id="s79">(Sigh) Well, my brother Paul to Buchenwald (ph).</span> <span id="s80">My other brother went to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s81">They were taken, and a few days later they came to our house from a Jewish organization and they said we can save one child.</span> <span id="s82">Which one is going to live and which ones are going to die?</span> <span id="s83">(Sigh) My mother had to make a choice and by the time the choice was made and everything, the other one was arrested.</span> <span id="s84">Was just left me and my three little sisters.</span> <span id="s85">That was it.</span> <span id="s86">A couple of months passed and my mother sent me out for a loaf of bread and I never came back.</span> <span id="s87">A car came screeching to a halt...are you a Jew?</span> <span id="s88">I was sixteen years old...fifteen, sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s89">I said yes.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s91">These were mean looking men.</span> <span id="s92">They put me into the car and I found myself in prison.</span> <span id="s93">No explanation was given.</span> <span id="s94">None was asked.</span> <span id="s95">I remember the cell, cell number ten.</span> <span id="s96">My mother wondered what happened to me...send me out for a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s97">I was in jail about...I would say about two months, three months...till May, approximately May.</span> <span id="s98">Suddenly they let me go free.</span> <span id="s99">I had to sign a paper that I was going to leave Germany within forty-eight hours...they will let me go, and that I was treated well.</span> <span id="s100">Again I didn't know what I was signing.</span> <span id="s101">They told me to sign.</span> <span id="s102">I signed.</span> <span id="s103">And I went home.</span> <span id="s104">I remember to this day...my mother stay...stood at the door of our apart...our house.</span> <span id="s105">She had ten marks...that was all we were allowed to take.</span> <span id="s106">Ten marks.</span> <span id="s107">She must have had this in cash laying around because all our money had been confiscated by the state, and we had nothing left and she said to me, you have to leave home.</span> <span id="s108">Don't even go into the house.</span> <span id="s109">You have to leave home right now.</span> <span id="s110">Here is ten marks.</span> <span id="s111">She says go to Italy.</span> <span id="s112">Italy was the only country that had open borders because they are friends with .</span> <span id="s113">Hitler was the leader.</span> <span id="s114">They were friends.</span> <span id="s115">They had no closed border.</span> <span id="s116">And that was the only country that had an open border for Germans.</span> <span id="s117">I had no passport.</span> <span id="s118">I had no papers.</span> <span id="s119">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s120">Here...take the train, she says.</span> <span id="s121">Here is a card, a railroad ticket I got for you.</span> <span id="s122">Take the train and go into Italy and just one by one...don't ever look back.</span> <span id="s123">So I said to her where are my other two sisters.</span> <span id="s124">I had three sisters.</span> <span id="s125">She said they're on their way to Poland.</span> <span id="s126">I sent them with some people, with some friends to Poland.</span> <span id="s127">Only Toni (ph), the little one, she had in her arm.</span> <span id="s128">Must have been about...I don't know...four, three, four years old.</span> <span id="s129">So I said goodbye...I was a good boy so I said goodbye.</span> <span id="s130">Mamma said go...I go.</span> <span id="s131">And uh that is when my life started.</span> <span id="s132">I went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s133">I took a train into Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Where was your father?</span> <span id="s135">A: Gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: When did...where did he go?</span> <span id="s137">A: He went into a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: When he was taken there...Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s140">Yeah.</span> <span id="s141">Now my mother was alone with my little sister.</span> <span id="s142">How my mother ever got me out of that jail I will never know to this day.</span> <span id="s143">I am sure she must have bribed a lot of people to get me out.</span> <span id="s144">But she saved my life.</span> <span id="s145">So where does one go?</span> <span id="s146">One goes to Milano (ph), Italy.</span> <span id="s147">In Milano, arriving in Milan...we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s148">I wasn't the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">There were hundreds...men, women, children...anyone who could themselves, they went down there.</span> <span id="s150">(Sigh) We had no food to eat.</span> <span id="s151">We had no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s152">We slept on park benches, in doorways, in parks, and we like a hole, like rats.</span> <span id="s153">So the Jews of Milan, they got together and they opened up soup kitchens and they got organized and so at least we could have one meal a day, somewhat of a meal a day.</span> <span id="s154">That was done for a while, a week, two weeks.</span> <span id="s155">Then the Germans found out that the Jews are treated to some...to a meal a day, and they they made arrangements with the Italian authorities because we told the Italians that we were tourists, otherwise you couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s156">We were tourists.</span> <span id="s157">So they let us in.</span> <span id="s158">And now they said if you're tourists, then you've got to have money and if you have money, you don't need any soup kitchens, and if you're not tourists, then we have to send you back where you came from.</span> <span id="s159">Made a lot of sense to them...didn't make any sense to us though.</span> <span id="s160">They closed up the soup kitchens.</span> <span id="s161">That was the end of food.</span> <span id="s162">more than one meal a day.</span> <span id="s163">So another few days and uh like I always was, I used to climb into the tree, some backyards, and pluck some fresh figs.</span> <span id="s164">(Laughter) I..</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">I stole some olives from trees, but there was to steal.</span> <span id="s167">It was edible and to stay alive.</span> <span id="s168">Then the word got around that France will let anybody in.</span> <span id="s169">The men have to go to the French Army, because war was eminent, and the women had to volunteer for the French Red Cross.</span> <span id="s170">We said wonderful.</span> <span id="s171">We all went to the French Embassy, and we all got that...the one day flag they call it.</span> <span id="s172">We got a visa to enter France that was good for 24 hours only.</span> <span id="s173">Well, there was only train going to the French border because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that.</span> <span id="s174">We had to get that train and they gave us a train ticket so we went for that train.</span> <span id="s175">Now what that train looked like you will never know.</span> <span id="s176">They were hanging out of the windows.</span> <span id="s177">They were laying on the roofs...inside...outside.</span> <span id="s178">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">They...they...they held children out out the windows.</span> <span id="s180">There was room for them.</span> <span id="s181">They were suffocating inside.</span> <span id="s182">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a train that is good for three hundred people.</span> <span id="s183">The train took off.</span> <span id="s184">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the roofs.</span> <span id="s185">They were hanging out windows.</span> <span id="s186">Outside...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails.</span> <span id="s187">People fell off, actually fell off the train while the train was moving so the train conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s188">By the time we got to the Italian/French border, it was too late.</span> <span id="s189">The French had closed the border and there's a little piece of land called no man's land and the Italians wouldn't let us back.</span> <span id="s190">And that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s191">So we laid on that little piece land...there was a fishing village.</span> <span id="s192">.</span> <span id="s193">St. Reno ...it's right on the border.</span> <span id="s194">.</span> <span id="s195">It's right on the border, and these old fishermen with these old boats...they saw a way to make money.</span> <span id="s196">Now these were impoverished people that never had anything except to catch a few fish now and then.</span> <span id="s197">So they said to us, we'll take you around the bent...it's a big rock...and you had to go around the bent onto the beaches of France if you give us everything you have and uh pay us whatever you can pay, and we'll load up the boats.</span> <span id="s198">We'll take you.</span> <span id="s199">But what they didn't tell people, that the boats were old and that the breakers in the ocean were very strong onto the onto the uh , unto the stone, unto the uh onto the mountain.</span> <span id="s200">The mountain came back out of the ocean.</span> <span id="s201">The waves were high and very strong and very uh uh dangerous.</span> <span id="s202">So as greedy as they were, they overloaded the boats.</span> <span id="s203">Some people had a wedding band, an engagement ring, maybe a few francs, maybe a few lire, maybe a little piece of jewelry that they saved, that they smuggled out.</span> <span id="s204">They overloaded.</span> <span id="s205">They gave them everything they owned.</span> <span id="s206">They overloaded the boats.</span> <span id="s207">They went out a little bit, and the boats broke in two.</span> <span id="s208">They capsized.</span> <span id="s209">They broke in two.</span> <span id="s210">The fishermen swam back.</span> <span id="s211">He has been fishing...he has been swimming since he was two years old, so there were people that couldn't swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Now you tell me...who do you save when you're a father and and your little girl says Daddy, save me, and your little boy says Papa, save me.</span> <span id="s213">And your wife is drowning.</span> <span id="s214">Who do you save...and you can't swim, and the waves are high.</span> <span id="s215">The next day the the bodies came washing ashore.</span> <span id="s216">And there were two boats out there, two uh gun boats.</span> <span id="s217">A French one and an Italian gunboat.</span> <span id="s218">And the the personnel on these boats, they were looking out and they saw the whole thing.</span> <span id="s219">Nobody lifted their finger to help.</span> <span id="s220">The screams of help, please help, help my children, help my wife, uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day.</span> <span id="s221">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s222">I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me, you know about your brother Paul.</span> <span id="s223">I says what.</span> <span id="s224">He got out.</span> <span id="s225">He went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s226">The word got out.</span> <span id="s227">He was married.</span> <span id="s228">He had a twenty year old wife and he had a one year old baby.</span> <span id="s229">I said you know what happened to Judy (ph).</span> <span id="s230">Have you heard and had any word.</span> <span id="s231">He says yes.</span> <span id="s232">He tried to smuggle them out into Belgium.</span> <span id="s233">He paid smugglers to bring them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">The smugglers took all their...what they owned in the middle of the woods and abandoned them.</span> <span id="s235">The baby started to cry.</span> <span id="s236">The Germans got them and hang them.</span> <span id="s237">They hang from the wife and baby next to her.</span> <span id="s238">They were found like that.</span> <span id="s239">I said anything you know about my brother Paul.</span> <span id="s240">He says yes.</span> <span id="s241">He went half crazy.</span> <span id="s242">So the word got out and he went into France.</span> <span id="s243">That's the last we heard of him.</span> <span id="s244">Because here and there, here and there, you found people that knew something about somebody.</span> <span id="s245">(Sigh) Now we're stuck there on this piece of land there, and we had to...well not much of a chance to run to...to one side you had the French with their guns looking at us, and on the other side you had the Italians with guns looking at us, and to the front you had the ocean.</span> <span id="s246">There was nothing you could do with the ocean and in the back of you, you had a mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">The highest mountain we ever saw was the garbage dump in our city.</span> <span id="s248">I never saw a mountain in my life before.</span> <span id="s249">How do you get out?</span> <span id="s250">A little boy hung on to me.</span> <span id="s251">He was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s252">His name was Heinz (ph).</span> <span id="s253">He got lost, someplace along the the running, he got lost from his family.</span> <span id="s254">He says he wants to go with me.</span> <span id="s255">I said hang on, and then a few days passed by and the only help you got was from a few monks that used to come and used to give us a little milk and a little piece of bread, a few figs, a few uh uh olives and things.</span> <span id="s256">It was a pitiful sight.</span> <span id="s257">And yet I wasn't really worried.</span> <span id="s258">I just absorbed all this like matter of fact, and then said well, I'm going to do something about this.</span> <span id="s259">And I looked around, tried to make up my mind which way to go, and uh I said wouldn't the best approach be just go right up to the French border, crawl through the barbed wire there, and get inside.</span> <span id="s260">Now wouldn't that be just just a crazy thing to do.</span> <span id="s261">Said to Heinz, look...we can't take the ocean.</span> <span id="s262">We can't go back to Italy.</span> <span id="s263">We can't officially go to France.</span> <span id="s264">We can't go the mountain.</span> <span id="s265">We'll never...never make it.</span> <span id="s266">I have an idea.</span> <span id="s267">Let's do the crazy thing that nobody expects us to do.</span> <span id="s268">He says, what?</span> <span id="s269">I said let's go right through the barbed wire into...let's go right into France.</span> <span id="s270">He said, you're crazy.</span> <span id="s271">I said yes, that's why...that's what everybody thinks...I'm crazy.</span> <span id="s272">Let's do the crazy thing.</span> <span id="s273">That's what we did.</span> <span id="s274">I said we're going to die.</span> <span id="s275">We're going to starve to death here, and there must have been about a thousand, maybe fourteen hundred people lying on this ground.</span> <span id="s276">I don't know ever what happened to them.</span> <span id="s277">I don't...never found out what happened to them.</span> <span id="s278">We went through the wire, and I said you just follow me.</span> <span id="s279">What happen will happen.</span> <span id="s280">What have we got to loose?</span> <span id="s281">And I wasn't worried really, not really.</span> <span id="s282">I was maybe too young to worry about things and too ignorant.</span> <span id="s283">(Laughter) We did that.</span> <span id="s284">Coming out on the other side I was looking up and I looked into the barrel of a gun.</span> <span id="s285">There was a French guard there and border guards there.</span> <span id="s286">He looked down at me.</span> <span id="s287">I looked up at him, and Heinz stopped crawling and I stopped crawling, and he had the gun aimed at us, so I said to him in German...shoot me but let him live.</span> <span id="s288">He's only twelve years old.</span> <span id="s289">So it was that somebody something in French.</span> <span id="s290">I could not speak it.</span> <span id="s291">He...he called something back in French, and he says...he spoke broken German...he said to me, see that train over there.</span> <span id="s292">I said yes.</span> <span id="s293">Get in it.</span> <span id="s294">It's going to go to Nice, into France.</span> <span id="s295">uncivilized person.</span> <span id="s296">We went in.</span> <span id="s297">We were very tired and we fell asleep, two of us.</span> <span id="s298">Dirty, bloody, hungry, thirsty, cold...went to sleep.</span> <span id="s299">We woke up in Nice.</span> <span id="s300">We got out in Nice and we dragged ourselves through the streets.</span> <span id="s301">I spoke no French.</span> <span id="s302">We had...we'd never been in a French country.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">We didn't know what France was all about, and we went to a doorway and went asleep, and they arrested us, the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s304">That is when I first met the gendarmes, the guard du mobile (ph), and let me assure you the gendarmes and the guard du mobile, they are not the gentlest of people.</span> <span id="s305">They really are nasty dogs.</span> <span id="s306">They grabbed us.</span> <span id="s307">They called us spies, spies there.</span> <span id="s308">I was a spy and they threw us in jail.</span> <span id="s309">Now in France if you're caught about illegally, they...that's the law.</span> <span id="s310">You'll get one month in jail, before they even talk to you.</span> <span id="s311">I learned to understand what jail is in France.</span> <span id="s312">Jail is a dirty cell with roaches and rats and and you get a drink of water a day and a piece of bread full of ants.</span> <span id="s313">In order to eat the bread full of...and you knock out the ants as best you can...you break off a piece of bread and throw it in the corner, let the rats fight over it while they let you eat...quickly eat the other piece.</span> <span id="s314">That's is jail in France.</span> <span id="s315">After one day, took me out and they put me into a open car, like they called that the commando, like with eight people could sit there, like a long open van or something...I don't know what you call it.</span> <span id="s316">Eight guard du mobile, eight of them...they put me in chains.</span> <span id="s317">My...my legs and my arm in chains, and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me, after they chased me down, after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry.</span> <span id="s318">I don't know what happened to Heinz.</span> <span id="s319">And they took me out.</span> <span id="s320">Nobody told me where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Nobody told me anything.</span> <span id="s322">We went to Entibe (ph), a place called Entibe.</span> <span id="s323">Entibe is outside Nice, a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s324">They call it internment camp, but don't you believe it.</span> <span id="s325">Don't you believe internment camps.</span> <span id="s326">Resettlement camps.</span> <span id="s327">Don't you believe it.</span> <span id="s328">These are concentration camps, in the sense of the word...concentration camps with all their pitfalls, all their filth and all their dirt and and and and and and all their...all their nastiness and brutality.</span> <span id="s329">There was no place for us to sleep.</span> <span id="s330">We slept on floors under the open sky.</span> <span id="s331">Was maybe two thousand people in there.</span> <span id="s332">They pulled up in front of the gate, opened up the gate, took off the chains, grabbed me and threw me into the camp.</span> <span id="s333">And I fell down on my face into into the dirt and that was it.</span> <span id="s334">They did this.</span> <span id="s335">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s336">I was in that camp, oh must have been well maybe six weeks, maybe two months and they took us back on transports on trucks and they put us into another camp which was called , .</span> <span id="s337">That is Marseilles (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: In in the first camp, did you have to do any labor or any work?</span> <span id="s339">A: No no.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Just hang around, nothing to do.</span> <span id="s342">Tried to stay alive.</span> <span id="s343">Tried to fight off the lice and the and the rats and the and the and stay away from the guards who would brutalize you.</span> <span id="s344">Uh some of them would uh try to get young boys and uh you know...I don't have to tell you.</span> <span id="s345">There was homosexuality there almost rampant by our own people and the guards.</span> <span id="s346">And there were always people that would uh sort of protect us.</span> <span id="s347">We were so innocent.</span> <span id="s348">I never heard the word homosexuality.</span> <span id="s349">I never knew what it was.</span> <span id="s350">I'd never had anything to do with it, but uh I met a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s351">He came from my home town.</span> <span id="s352">He was ten years older, a .</span> <span id="s353">We got to talking.</span> <span id="s354">He says uh we come from the same town and uh they had a store across the street where we lived and we sort of got together.</span> <span id="s355">He sort of kept me...you know, kept an eye on me.</span> <span id="s356">Chased people away.</span> <span id="s357">When the other camp , was all brick factory.</span> <span id="s358">They had the catacombs and they would lock us into the catacombs like little tunnels where they used to dry the bricks, like ovens.</span> <span id="s359">There was this straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s360">They would chase us in there by the hundreds and lock the door, a big iron door, and that was it.</span> <span id="s361">And we were lucky enough...was total darkness in there...when they stayed they put a few little bulbs and they are flickering in there and that is what...there we were.</span> <span id="s362">That is what we did.</span> <span id="s363">Honest to God...that is how we laid on the straw and and and and just uh tried to exist.</span> <span id="s364">After a couple of months of that kind of life...well, they took us out once a day for exercise.</span> <span id="s365">They let us walk around the yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: (Sigh) Well, food...uh I wasn't a big eater anyhow in those days.</span> <span id="s368">(Laughter) I never thought about food that much but the food was very bad there.</span> <span id="s369">They gave us a cup of coffee a day, black water, and gave us some...a a half a liter of soup at lunch time and a half a liter of soup in the evening and if you are...were lucky you found a rotten onion in it or a rotten potato or a couple roaches.</span> <span id="s370">(Laughter) There were...this was about uh...well, there was darkness in there so you didn't really see it, you know, so it didn't matter too much.</span> <span id="s371">We existed.</span> <span id="s372">They gave you a piece of bread, gave you seventy-five gram of bread.</span> <span id="s373">That .</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And sanitary facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s376">They had a hole in the ground and that is where you went and that is uh uh...before you know it there was dysentery and there was sickness and there was uh uh so they had to take us out of there.</span> <span id="s377">So after a couple of months they called all the people under twenty years of age and took us into the St. Charles (ph).</span> <span id="s378">That is in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s379">Marseilles wasn't far from there and they want us to sign up for the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s380">So they said you sign up for the Foreign Legion and we give you uniforms and you get food and and you're free.</span> <span id="s381">You can go into town.</span> <span id="s382">I said well we don't want to fight the Arabs in Africa.</span> <span id="s383">We want to fight the Nazis on the mainland.</span> <span id="s384">We have no quarrel with the Arabs.</span> <span id="s385">We don't want to sign up for the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s386">Let us...give us uniform, put us in the French Army, and we will fight for you, but we won't fight the Arabs in Africa.</span> <span id="s387">We want to fight the Nazis here.</span> <span id="s388">Well, they put us back into the trucks, back into the camp.</span> <span id="s389">That went on every other day.</span> <span id="s390">They took us into the kitchen to see the fine food you would get and you'll get money and you see the nice uniforms we give you.</span> <span id="s391">So I sort of...another guy and myself, we were sort of the spokesmen for the...we were the younger, you know...we the older ones, and I say it doesn't impress us.</span> <span id="s392">We still .</span> <span id="s393">We stay...we stay in the in the brick factory.</span> <span id="s394">They had to let us out sometime.</span> <span id="s395">We stayed till the , but we went and this went on and on.</span> <span id="s396">Finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What were your feelings...uh fear...could you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No.</span> <span id="s399">I wouldn't say fear.</span> <span id="s400">We just accepted things.</span> <span id="s401">I don't know.</span> <span id="s402">We just...whether it was our age, our young years that uh...no, we weren't really afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s403">It's just that things happen and we had to accept it and and and uh...there were times when we cried.</span> <span id="s404">There were times when we...when we were a sort of scared a little bit and and but there were other people that would tell us uh uh...I would ask the guy next to me uh what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s405">He would turn around and says, .</span> <span id="s406">That means everything passes, even life.</span> <span id="s407">This shall pass too...in German.</span> <span id="s408">So I said come on, that doesn't tell me anything.</span> <span id="s409">This is something you don't appreciate for .</span> <span id="s410">You're young.</span> <span id="s411">You'll...you'll make it.</span> <span id="s412">They have to let us out sometime, so look forward to that.</span> <span id="s413">Those guys, they were singing and the guys they told stories and and we had conversations and and we just sort of accepted things, knowing...hoping and knowing that someday we will...it will end.</span> <span id="s414">It will stop.</span> <span id="s415">We didn't have much time to think about our families anymore, and that's what scared me.</span> <span id="s416">We were so busy with things that we never thought about our our families anymore, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s417">We had what happened but nothing.</span> <span id="s418">We were so busy with our own trying to stay alive in in under those conditions that were us.</span> <span id="s419">Well, one day they put us, put people in trucks.</span> <span id="s420">Says we were over-crowded there.</span> <span id="s421">We're going...they're going to another camp.</span> <span id="s422">I said fine.</span> <span id="s423">I had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s424">And they took my friend.</span> <span id="s425">I didn't want to be separated from him.</span> <span id="s426">I jumped on the truck too.</span> <span id="s427">You had no luggage.</span> <span id="s428">You had nothing.</span> <span id="s429">You add to the confusion.</span> <span id="s430">The French had a knack of confusion, of being disorganized.</span> <span id="s431">So we got into the other camp, Monasque (ph), called Monasque.</span> <span id="s432">Now here was a..</span> <span id="s433">.</span> <span id="s434">here was a camp that was made out of an old house.</span> <span id="s435">They put barbed wire around it and made a camp out of it.</span> <span id="s436">A few days later called my name out.</span> <span id="s437">I wasn't on the list in in the mill.</span> <span id="s438">I wasn't on the list in this camp, and they were investigating what happened to me.</span> <span id="s439">And they said to me, well, you have to go back to the other camp.</span> <span id="s440">You weren't on the list.</span> <span id="s441">I said well, there was nothing much I could do.</span> <span id="s442">I said goodbye to my friend and I said somehow we'll meet again.</span> <span id="s443">We didn't like to be separated.</span> <span id="s444">Well, on the truck they had a few other people from other places that they caught up with.</span> <span id="s445">We were going.</span> <span id="s446">It was late in the day, almost night.</span> <span id="s447">It was cold.</span> <span id="s448">And they were going slowly around the bend.</span> <span id="s449">I had no idea where I was, and the back was open.</span> <span id="s450">They had no guards in the back to watch us.</span> <span id="s451">There were two guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">They didn't want to sit in the back where it was cold.</span> <span id="s453">The guard was sitting up front next to the driver.</span> <span id="s454">Went around the bend.</span> <span id="s455">There was an embankment there.</span> <span id="s456">I jumped.</span> <span id="s457">I got...I caught the opportunity.</span> <span id="s458">I went out of the , the truck.</span> <span id="s459">I jumped down, fell down the embankment, rolled down, and I was laying in the mud.</span> <span id="s460">That was it.</span> <span id="s461">I had no idea where I was.</span> <span id="s462">So I saw the the lights of the truck disappearing on the highway, so I just lay still for a little while.</span> <span id="s463">Then I got up and I was hurt, and I walked into the woods.</span> <span id="s464">I stayed the whole night, day and night.</span> <span id="s465">Early the next morning I heard voices...voices.</span> <span id="s466">I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s467">I was always so hungry.</span> <span id="s468">So I went up there.</span> <span id="s469">There was a bunch of guys, Jewish boys, all nationalities.</span> <span id="s470">Some of them had guns.</span> <span id="s471">Some of them didn't.</span> <span id="s472">Some of them had grenades.</span> <span id="s473">One of them had this uh knife, so they looked at me.</span> <span id="s474">They pointed a gun at me.</span> <span id="s475">I says, I am a Jew on the run.</span> <span id="s476">So one guy said so what else is new.</span> <span id="s477">Have you ever seen a Jew that's not on the run.</span> <span id="s478">I said no.</span> <span id="s479">He said come.</span> <span id="s480">Join us.</span> <span id="s481">So they got more guns and he said look, we do some raiding.</span> <span id="s482">We do some trouble.</span> <span id="s483">All we can do is like a big...put a sting here and a sting there to the Nazis, but that's about as far as we can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">We...we are no match for the armament of the machine guns or for the masses of those people and and their tanks and their and their carriers and whatever they have.</span> <span id="s485">We are...but we can give a sting here and there, now and then, so that's what we'll do.</span> <span id="s486">Hurt them and run.</span> <span id="s487">So that's what we did for a while.</span> <span id="s488">Then the word came out there is another group in Langlade (ph).</span> <span id="s489">We ought to join them, so we made our way to Langlade, traveling at night, hiding during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: How many were there of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: There must have been thirty, forty.</span> <span id="s492">Q: And what were the ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Young and old.</span> <span id="s494">From age...from age nine, ten years old up to forty, fifty.</span> <span id="s495">Somehow they got out.</span> <span id="s496">Somehow they are lucky enough not to get caught.</span> <span id="s497">Somehow they were on the run for God knows how long, and somehow they found themselves in that predicament.</span> <span id="s498">Nobody asked questions.</span> <span id="s499">So when you're hungry, you know you do strange things.</span> <span id="s500">We went to little villages, French villages, you know where the bakers put their long breads in baskets outside the store.</span> <span id="s501">I was a good runner, and I was a good thief.</span> <span id="s502">I learned as I went along.</span> <span id="s503">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s504">So I said to the guys, get me a few guys, good, the best runners we have.</span> <span id="s505">We nonchalantly walked through the little village there.</span> <span id="s506">We grab a few breads.</span> <span id="s507">They had these long breads, these French long breads.</span> <span id="s508">I mean long, not the ones we've got here.</span> <span id="s509">About four or five feet long.</span> <span id="s510">You grab a few breads and you run like hell, and then we shared and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s511">We went in, grabbed the bread.</span> <span id="s512">By the time that they had a chance to even see anything, we...we were running like the dickens.</span> <span id="s513">We were scared, hungry and scared.</span> <span id="s514">We were always hungry and scared.</span> <span id="s515">We shared it.</span> <span id="s516">Have you ever tried to go into a chicken house and steal a few eggs.</span> <span id="s517">Don't ever try it.</span> <span id="s518">I did.</span> <span id="s519">We went into a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s520">We said to the guys...all we could speak was German.</span> <span id="s521">We couldn't speak French.</span> <span id="s522">We couldn't speak no other language.</span> <span id="s523">Nobody talks because if you speak German, the French hate the , the Germans.</span> <span id="s524">They're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s525">Nobody talked.</span> <span id="s526">We get caught, nobody talks.</span> <span id="s527">We went into the chicken house to steal some eggs.</span> <span id="s528">The chickens carried on.</span> <span id="s529">You would not believe the noise they made.</span> <span id="s530">The farmer came out.</span> <span id="s531">Two farmers came out in fact, with pitch forks.</span> <span id="s532">They found us.</span> <span id="s533">They would have put those pitch forks right through us because food was always scarce.</span> <span id="s534">They didn't...they didn't appreciate anybody stealing their eggs or chickens for that matter.</span> <span id="s535">I tell you we never run so fast in our lives over the fields.</span> <span id="s536">After a few miles out there, we start eating some of the wine, the grapes that grow in the fields, but the farmers put a chemical on those grapes uh so the flies and things don't uh spoil them.</span> <span id="s537">They gave us diarrhea.</span> <span id="s538">We got sick from them.</span> <span id="s539">It was a bad situation, believe me.</span> <span id="s540">We finally made it to Neim (ph), and we went to Langlade two at a time.</span> <span id="s541">The others stayed in the woods.</span> <span id="s542">Only two at a time traveled.</span> <span id="s543">We went to Langlade.</span> <span id="s544">There was a small village, small French village, and...a deserted village, nobody there.</span> <span id="s545">Empty...just the houses stood there.</span> <span id="s546">We went in there.</span> <span id="s547">We saw a guard, one our people, one of the crowd, and they took us in.</span> <span id="s548">We joined them.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">They were...they already were better armed, better trained, smarter in in in the things they had to do.</span> <span id="s550">After about a week or so we were surrounded...somebody must have gotten wind of it...by the gendarmes, the French gendarmes, and they asked us to give up.</span> <span id="s551">Well, we knew we were in the south of France, and you remember well that France was occupied only half and the other one was Vichy controlled, Marshall and , you know about that.</span> <span id="s552">So at least we knew we were in the south of France.</span> <span id="s553">You always had to go south.</span> <span id="s554">So we got together, said look, all the young guys, guys like, you know, fifteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...make a run for it over the field.</span> <span id="s555">We're going to shoot out at the gendarmes on one side, and you run on the other side.</span> <span id="s556">We keep them busy on one side.</span> <span id="s557">So we said what's going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s558">They said don't worry about us.</span> <span id="s559">We are older guys.</span> <span id="s560">We expect it...we expected this anytime to happen, so it happen now.</span> <span id="s561">Maybe we'll get away too.</span> <span id="s562">But we'll fight it out.</span> <span id="s563">We...we're going to give them a run for their money.</span> <span id="s564">In the meantime you make a run for it, all the young kids, make a run for it, because you're the ones that can run.</span> <span id="s565">We can't.</span> <span id="s566">And believe me, we got good at running.</span> <span id="s567">Sure enough, they started the firing and he says go and we went, and we run over the fields while they keep the gendarmes busy.</span> <span id="s568">And the French aren't anyway.</span> <span id="s569">We found that out.</span> <span id="s570">They they're not too bright.</span> <span id="s571">They're cruel.</span> <span id="s572">They're barbaric, but they're not bright.</span> <span id="s573">And where will you go?</span> <span id="s574">You're running through the fields.</span> <span id="s575">Where will you go?</span> <span id="s576">Naturally...Nice.</span> <span id="s577">That's the answer...Nice, toward the Italian border.</span> <span id="s578">Nice is toward the Italian border.</span> <span id="s579">I end up in Nice and what the French did...they would close up a part of the town.</span> <span id="s580">Suddenly three or four trucks with gendarmes would pull up and they would close up off part of the town and and and they would arrest anyone that they can catch that had no papers.</span> <span id="s581">You had to show papers.</span> <span id="s582">You had to show passports.</span> <span id="s583">You had to show money that you are not a vagrant.</span> <span id="s584">If you can't explain your existence, to jail you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Were you by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I was by myself.</span> <span id="s587">I didn't know these things that they did there.</span> <span id="s588">And of course I was caught.</span> <span id="s589">So what they do...they put me into this .</span> <span id="s590">There is a , you know, the , a park, an army park, in in in Nice and they had a jail.</span> <span id="s591">And they put me in this and took me there.</span> <span id="s592">The others they put in other jails that they caught.</span> <span id="s593">To...to me no papers, no money, no past, no present, no future.</span> <span id="s594">I couldn't speak a word of French and I was hungry.</span> <span id="s595">I said what more can happen to me.</span> <span id="s596">They put into into a cell by myself...one day, two days, three days, and the jail was right...it was a jail and a little courtyard and the wall and the street.</span> <span id="s597">The street was like this.</span> <span id="s598">So I was watching.</span> <span id="s599">I I I became observant.</span> <span id="s600">I could shop (ph).</span> <span id="s601">When they put me into that jail, I kept walking slower, I kept sizing up the place.</span> <span id="s602">I was looking around to see how many cells there, see what...where the wall is, see what's behind the wall, uh see how the cell closes...I became very, very observant.</span> <span id="s603">One day the guard came around.</span> <span id="s604">He says, well, he says, one morning, tomorrow you're going to be handed over to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s605">They're going to pick all you Jews up.</span> <span id="s606">Well that night I counted the time the guard would make the rounds.</span> <span id="s607">It was about ten minutes.</span> <span id="s608">I counted...one, two, three, four, five minute passed...one minute, two minute, three minute, four minute.</span> <span id="s609">About ten minutes.</span> <span id="s610">There was a hole in the cell with a little trap door where they put that thing in where you urinate in, and that was closed with a piece of wire.</span> <span id="s611">They just place...put a piece of wire through it and wrap it around.</span> <span id="s612">They say you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s613">I noticed that.</span> <span id="s614">He left.</span> <span id="s615">I went up, pulled that thing out and I worked the wire back and forth till it broke.</span> <span id="s616">I worked it up.</span> <span id="s617">Every time they came by, I stopped.</span> <span id="s618">He went.</span> <span id="s619">The moment he left I had the door opened.</span> <span id="s620">I'm a little skinny thing.</span> <span id="s621">I went through.</span> <span id="s622">There were five more cells, and they had a bolt that you could open from the outside.</span> <span id="s623">I opened all five cells and I looked in.</span> <span id="s624">It was a pathetic view.</span> <span id="s625">When I tell you it was pitiful...they were loaded with people that they caught here and there, that they arrested, waiting, so I said you know, you got eight minutes to go over the wall.</span> <span id="s626">Eight minutes.</span> <span id="s627">Now it's seven minutes.</span> <span id="s628">Get the hell out.</span> <span id="s629">Move.</span> <span id="s630">Get over the wall.</span> <span id="s631">I got them all out to the courtyard.</span> <span id="s632">I said get out, get out.</span> <span id="s633">I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s634">They all came out.</span> <span id="s635">I said come on.</span> <span id="s636">See that wall...make it...make a go for it.</span> <span id="s637">Go, go.</span> <span id="s638">You had to...if you have to die, die fighting.</span> <span id="s639">At least try.</span> <span id="s640">They looked at me and they said where are we going to go.</span> <span id="s641">Nobody wants us.</span> <span id="s642">Nobody's going to help us.</span> <span id="s643">Where do you want us to go?</span> <span id="s644">Well, I knew I only had a few minutes left and I said look, I don't know about you but I'm going over the wall.</span> <span id="s645">I climbed...I went to the wall which was no big deal, but they had this little piece of glass on the wall like like like to cut yourself on, you know, was over every half an inch of glass.</span> <span id="s646">I took what shoes I had on, if you could call it shoes.</span> <span id="s647">I went in between but I cut myself anyway.</span> <span id="s648">Outside the wall was a lamp post and outside there was a car going back and forth.</span> <span id="s649">I looked right on top of them.</span> <span id="s650">I waited until the walked the other way.</span> <span id="s651">I jumped onto the lamp post, went down and start walking immediately.</span> <span id="s652">I didn't even stay...I didn't give him a chance that he would...where this guy come.</span> <span id="s653">I just...I never saw him...I just a minute ago...where'd he come from.</span> <span id="s654">I walked.</span> <span id="s655">He didn't say a word to me.</span> <span id="s656">I nodded to him.</span> <span id="s657">He smiled at me and I kept on going.</span> <span id="s658">The moment I was a few hundred feet away, I started running like the dickens just to get away from that place.</span> <span id="s659">Two guys stopped me.</span> <span id="s660">One guy said to me if you're on the run, if you're a Jew and you're on the run, three blocks down is a school, a school.</span> <span id="s661">They have three basements.</span> <span id="s662">Go to the third basement.</span> <span id="s663">You can collect your breath for a day or two.</span> <span id="s664">Get something to eat.</span> <span id="s665">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s666">I went into the basement.</span> <span id="s667">They took me in.</span> <span id="s668">There must have been a hundred guys there, hiding in this school in the basement.</span> <span id="s669">And he said to me you can stay maybe two days, maybe three.</span> <span id="s670">Then you have to make room for somebody else that needs a piece of bread or that needs to get a night's sleep.</span> <span id="s671">So somehow we started to get organized a little.</span> <span id="s672">Somebody...you see, it was a big thing when...if you could get a night's sleep without having to worry or if you get a piece of bread without having to sleep with your with your stomach empty.</span> <span id="s673">That was a big thing.</span> <span id="s674">Or or if somebody gave you piece of blanket and you got warm for a change.</span> <span id="s675">That was a big thing.</span> <span id="s676">You could let go of fear and of and of of nerves and of and and of being so frightened, and and this so cold all the time and so hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s677">You could let go of it a little bit.</span> <span id="s678">You could lay down, say ah...I just want to sleep a few hours without having to worry somebody putting a bayonet in my back or a gun to my head.</span> <span id="s679">It lasted a few days and said look, I have to make room.</span> <span id="s680">I got out.</span> <span id="s681">I got caught again.</span> <span id="s682">Got no place to go.</span> <span id="s683">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s684">This time they took me to a Ausglis Sur Mer (ph).</span> <span id="s685">Well Ausglis...naturally in chains with dozens of others.</span> <span id="s686">Ausglis Sur Mer.</span> <span id="s687">They put us into, into the camp and inside the camp was another tent with barbed wire around it.</span> <span id="s688">They threw us in there with maybe uh twenty, thirty kids...all kids.</span> <span id="s689">Ten, twelve, fourteen, eighteen, fifteen, thirteen.</span> <span id="s690">Look .</span> <span id="s691">There's two boys going to be shot.</span> <span id="s692">That's your life there.</span> <span id="s693">Make the most of it.</span> <span id="s694">Nobody really understood the significance of being shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Somehow we didn't even...we couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s696">Only the fewest mentally could comprehend it.</span> <span id="s697">(Pause) Next day came...nothing.</span> <span id="s698">Night came...nothing.</span> <span id="s699">Day came...nothing.</span> <span id="s700">They threw in one bread like this was food was in for the day, and the others break a piece for this one and a piece for that one.</span> <span id="s701">Threw some water in, and we waited and one morning they took us out and amongst another three, four hundred they put us onto a unto a cattle boat that was docked nearby and uh the guard du mobile was on each side and we had to go through the line, you know what I'm trying to say, through the line between the guard du mobile, be...between the gendarmes, and as we went through all chained together, they would beat us and kick us and spit at us.</span> <span id="s702">Some fell down and we had to drag them with us because they're chained together, to get onto the boat.</span> <span id="s703">It was pitiful.</span> <span id="s704">It was really pathetic.</span> <span id="s705">We had never seen...we had never harmed these people.</span> <span id="s706">We never saw these people.</span> <span id="s707">Finally the captain of the boat came out and he told them to stop.</span> <span id="s708">He said as long as I'm the captain, as long as these people come on my boat, they are not going to be beaten anymore, not by you, not by anyone.</span> <span id="s709">They're under my jurisdiction now.</span> <span id="s710">Now let these people go.</span> <span id="s711">He was a nice man, the captain.</span> <span id="s712">We went on the boat and there was a hole on the deck.</span> <span id="s713">We went into this hole, and on the top they put some heavy machine gun onto the hole.</span> <span id="s714">That was the only way you could get out.</span> <span id="s715">And the the boat took off.</span> <span id="s716">We had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s717">Some people, the older guys told us...they looked through the, you know, uh openings in the in the belly of the boat there was little openings that you could look through...say I see the coast of Spain.</span> <span id="s718">Now if you see the coast of Spain, they're going to take us to Africa.</span> <span id="s719">The coast of Africa is not far from there.</span> <span id="s720">So they took us to Africa...not Africa...Algiers.</span> <span id="s721">They unloaded us in Algiers in prison.</span> <span id="s722">They were waiting for other transports to come.</span> <span id="s723">We went to jail.</span> <span id="s724">We stayed in jail...must have been maybe six, seven weeks, in solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s725">One was not allowed to talk to the other.</span> <span id="s726">Let me assure you, the only way we kept our sanity was we knocked on the wall and the other guy knocked back.</span> <span id="s727">That was the only outside contact we had.</span> <span id="s728">It was a little cell that you could hardly lay down your blankets.</span> <span id="s729">No bed, no nothing.</span> <span id="s730">We had to lay on stone.</span> <span id="s731">We had very little water.</span> <span id="s732">We had very little food, and there was just no way that we ever found out what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s733">We lost...we lost uh uh track of time.</span> <span id="s734">We didn't know what day of the week, what month we be...we just didn't any more uh uh mentally uh whether it was day or whether it was night or what.</span> <span id="s735">It was dark in there with a little tiny window where they pushed the stuff going and and a little pot to uh uh urinate in and and they didn't clean that out for about a month and uh that was just...there were times when you wished you just gave up.</span> <span id="s736">You just...let them kill me...I don't...you didn't care anymore.</span> <span id="s737">There was just so much you could absorb.</span> <span id="s738">There was just so much abuse and beatings and and and starvation and and thirst and cold and heat that you could ab...that you could take.</span> <span id="s739">And this was just enough.</span> <span id="s740">You just...many times you thought I wished I don't get up tomorrow.</span> <span id="s741">The hell with it.</span> <span id="s742">I don't care anymore.</span> <span id="s743">You didn't give a damn any more, but finally one day they took us out and they put us...took us to the railroad station and put us into a cattle train where they transported camels and donkeys, and they packed us in there.</span> <span id="s744">We had no idea where we're going.</span> <span id="s745">And they said well, you'll never make it.</span> <span id="s746">By the time we get through with you, there won't be much left of you.</span> <span id="s747">Nobody answered.</span> <span id="s748">Nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s749">There was nothing...there was nothing to be said.</span> <span id="s750">And the train started going.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Let's let's stop here and then we'll continue on the next tape.</span> <span id="s752">A: Right.</span> <span id="s753">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s756">Can you continue your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s758">The train started to move and we traveled...we must have traveled about three days.</span> <span id="s759">They packed us in like sardines.</span> <span id="s760">Some people died standing up.</span> <span id="s761">They wouldn't let us out to use the bathroom facilities or anything like that for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was this all men?</span> <span id="s763">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: All men?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s766">Of course.</span> <span id="s767">All different nationalities.</span> <span id="s768">Jews from Romania, from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from Germany, from Austria, from Hungary...you name it...they were all there.</span> <span id="s769">This was the remnants of people that escaped the persecution of their countries and and escaped through through woods and and swamp land and and borders, and smuggled borders who tried to save themselves uh uh and ended up being being uh in that...being caught and put in that predicament.</span> <span id="s770">And uh once a day they threw one bread into the car, to the cattle car, and a few bottles of water and that was for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did people share?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s773">We all kind of...you know, if you're so hungered and so thirsty that you that your tongue swells on, you know, when you're very, very thirsty.</span> <span id="s774">I mean very thirsty.</span> <span id="s775">Your tongue has a tendency to swell out and you choke on your own tongue.</span> <span id="s776">It happened to people.</span> <span id="s777">And when you see a drink of water, believe me, you go for it.</span> <span id="s778">When you see a piece of bread, you go for it.</span> <span id="s779">Well, after about three days in that...it's about two hundred miles into the Sahara, through the desert...the desert as well as swamp land and nothings...I would call it a barren desert...so finally the train stopped and everybody out.</span> <span id="s780">They had the Spahice (ph) watching us now.</span> <span id="s781">The Spahice is an elite Arab police force, called the Spahice.</span> <span id="s782">They have sabers and they are on horseback and they are vicious.</span> <span id="s783">I mean vicious.</span> <span id="s784">They were guarding us.</span> <span id="s785">When we were dragging ourselves, we saw a few miles down the road we saw a few tents, tents and barbed wire around it in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s786">That was Camp Djelfa (ph).</span> <span id="s787">Little did we know...we dragged ourselves through the sand to get into the camp, all chained together.</span> <span id="s788">Oh the the French are famous for chaining you up.</span> <span id="s789">We were real dangerous people...half-dead, half-starved...I mean half- sick...all kinds of dangerous people...so we dragged ourselves and we dragged the ones that couldn't even walk anymore.</span> <span id="s790">We dragged dead ones with us that were chained to us.</span> <span id="s791">They were dead.</span> <span id="s792">We had to drag them along the sand, and we could hardly ourselves walk.</span> <span id="s793">We got into Djelfa very slowly.</span> <span id="s794">They were beating us all the way down, with whips, with horse whips.</span> <span id="s795">Uh on their horseback they had these long whips.</span> <span id="s796">They were whipping us all the way down and if you fell down, they would beat you till you got up, and it hurt.</span> <span id="s797">It really hurt.</span> <span id="s798">We got there into the camp and we had to stand at attention for the camp commander to come to address us, so we stood there for hours till he finally showed up.</span> <span id="s799">He showed up with his German Shepherd and uh he had somebody with him and they pulled out a great big steak and they gave it to the dog and we had to watch how the dog ate that great big steak, and then you heard a speech, and I will never forget if I were to get a thousand years old which will never happen but that's just ...he says...alright, he says.</span> <span id="s800">I am your camp commander.</span> <span id="s801">You all came here to die.</span> <span id="s802">It's just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s803">If you do what you're told, you live a little longer.</span> <span id="s804">If not, you die sooner.</span> <span id="s805">(Cough) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s806">He said but you all came here to die.</span> <span id="s807">Sooner or later, you all die.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">None of you will come out alive.</span> <span id="s809">That is my job, to see to that, and I'm very good at my job.</span> <span id="s810">Now get into the tents.</span> <span id="s811">So they unchained us.</span> <span id="s812">He had an adjutant with him.</span> <span id="s813">Now the camp commander...let me explain this to you...he was a..</span> <span id="s814">.</span> <span id="s815">the book will tell you that...the guy that wrote that book...he was a sadist and a drunk.</span> <span id="s816">And the adjutant...he had an adjutant with him, his right hand...he was also a sadist.</span> <span id="s817">They would put people up for no reason.</span> <span id="s818">So we didn't know how bad it was.</span> <span id="s819">We found out later that Djelfa was the the worst camp...there were many other camps, , , Djelfa...there were many other camps there, but Djelfa was the worst concentration camp in all of Africa.</span> <span id="s820">The only people that were sent to Djelfa were the ones they rounded up in France and anywheres they could find them, the most dangerous people to France, the most dangerous.</span> <span id="s821">That's the ones they sent like a .</span> <span id="s822">That's the ones they sent to Djelfa, to Africa, to isolate them from the rest of the world and eventually kill them.</span> <span id="s823">We found out later.</span> <span id="s824">We went into the tents and we waited, and the next day, the next day we had to work.</span> <span id="s825">Now they were trying to build a trans-Saharian (ph).</span> <span id="s826">They were trying to build a railroad through the desert.</span> <span id="s827">The location of the camp was at the foot of the Atlas (ph) Mountain.</span> <span id="s828">That means that at night, the nights were so cold that your teeth would chatter, and the days were so hot that you almost died from the heat.</span> <span id="s829">It must have been a hundred and forty degree heat in the day, a hundred and fifty, in the shade.</span> <span id="s830">There was no shade.</span> <span id="s831">And during the night you were so cold that you couldn't sleep because you had...you had no control of your teeth that would...that that would...you know, uh uh make such noise.</span> <span id="s832">We had nothing to cover us ourselves with except the rags that we wore.</span> <span id="s833">They gave us one bread a day for a tent, and a cup of coffee in the morning which was black water and a half a liter of soup and a half a liter of soup at night.</span> <span id="s834">soup.</span> <span id="s835">We were full of lice, bugs, and then you started dysentery.</span> <span id="s836">All your blood came out.</span> <span id="s837">There were vipers that would bite you... in one hour, you're dead.</span> <span id="s838">We were full of scorpions.</span> <span id="s839">You know, there are bad things in the sand there.</span> <span id="s840">And we were laying in the sand.</span> <span id="s841">There were forty, fifty people in a tent made for eight and uh you had only lay on your side, and if one had to turn around, the whole tent had to turn around, and uh turn around...if something...something bite you, there was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s842">You you couldn't do a thing.</span> <span id="s843">Even if it was a scorpion or a viper or a snake, there...then you die.</span> <span id="s844">That's it, and they were building that front area into the desert and you had to work on it ten hours a day.</span> <span id="s845">We had to drag sand from two miles down the road, uh down...two miles down the other road to clear the dunes.</span> <span id="s846">And the Spahice would keep whipping you.</span> <span id="s847">You must have read about the Egyptians (ph) transferring the Jews in slavery.</span> <span id="s848">That was much better.</span> <span id="s849">It was the same thing...the beatings, the hunger, the thirst, the heat, the cold.</span> <span id="s850">(Pause) And the beatings.</span> <span id="s851">He would come in the morning and he would have a dozen people striped naked and and whip them in front of the rest of them just because he likes it and he would stand there smiling.</span> <span id="s852">The slightest infraction of the rules...they would bury you in the sand, just your head sticking out and the Arabs would urinate on you, and if you moved your head, they would open your skull.</span> <span id="s853">They had little tricks like that.</span> <span id="s854">The adjutant would come in and just pick anyone he wanted, tie them up and beat them up and whip them.</span> <span id="s855">At just...just at will...there was no intelligent reason for any of these things to happen, because people didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s856">If you made a fire, the fire...we had no firewood but we used alfa (ph)...that is a desert grass and that burned, so we used to always keep bushels of alfa that we could get a hold of and uh make a fire with it to make coffee.</span> <span id="s857">How did we make coffee?</span> <span id="s858">We made coffee on dates...uh the the pits of dates.</span> <span id="s859">We would brown them...makes good coffee too.</span> <span id="s860">The pits of dates...brown them, then with salt we would uh uh and and then we put them in in in hot water.</span> <span id="s861">Makes good coffee.</span> <span id="s862">The camp commander comes.</span> <span id="s863">He sees smoke, and the first thing you would hear, .</span> <span id="s864">That means take...you know, we used to eat out of of cans like what you have here, uh vegetable cans that you buy in a supermarket...we had a can.</span> <span id="s865">That was our...the extent of our...so he would say get your can and get your things together, whatever you have.</span> <span id="s866">You go fifteen days.</span> <span id="s867">was a a fortress of the French Foreign Legion, the last outpost of the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s868">There was no longer a French Foreign Legion there, but the camp commander lived there and the adjutant lived there.</span> <span id="s869">They had their quarters there.</span> <span id="s870">He kept his horse there and there was the jail there.</span> <span id="s871">To go to Fort for fifteen days meant water and bread, fifteen days.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Seventy-five gram of bread a day and a cup of water.</span> <span id="s873">They would tie your arms behind your back and hang you on your wrists, like this and they would hang you on your arms, oh for a night, a day, two days, till finally your arms would hang out of the sockets, and then they would come in, strip you down in the middle of the night, strip you naked and put the hose on you.</span> <span id="s874">And I took the cold that was at night, we got more cold.</span> <span id="s875">The hose didn't do just an easy job on you.</span> <span id="s876">If we were lucky...if you were lucky, they didn't turn you around and smack the back of the rifle in in to the small of your back.</span> <span id="s877">That was...that was fun.</span> <span id="s878">To hear you scream was music to their ears.</span> <span id="s879">That was classical music to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">We didn't give them that...no...we didn't do that favor.</span> <span id="s881">Not a sound came out of us.</span> <span id="s882">They were beating us and beating us and not a sound.</span> <span id="s883">We would go...get unconscious, but we would not scream.</span> <span id="s884">We became very hard by that time.</span> <span id="s885">We became very bitter and very hard and and very unforgiving.</span> <span id="s886">We would not forgive ourselves...if we would have put out a scream, we would not forgive ourselves for that, because it gave them satisfaction.</span> <span id="s887">We wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s888">After fifteen days...there wasn't much left of you to begin with...after fifteen days, they had to get people to drag you back in, because you could no longer walk.</span> <span id="s889">The next day, you had to go back, back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you have any communication with the other men while you were in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s892">We were maybe five, six, or seven on the hook, most of them unconscious from the beatings.</span> <span id="s893">Most of them didn't feel like talking.</span> <span id="s894">Most of them gave up on life.</span> <span id="s895">THey didn't...there was...there was just no communication...what...what was there to say.</span> <span id="s896">What could anyone say?</span> <span id="s897">It hurts.</span> <span id="s898">I'm in pain.</span> <span id="s899">I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s900">I'm thirsty.</span> <span id="s901">I'm tired.</span> <span id="s902">I want to get out.</span> <span id="s903">I don't deserve this.</span> <span id="s904">Why are you doing this?</span> <span id="s905">Where is the world?</span> <span id="s906">Where is everybody?</span> <span id="s907">Where is God?</span> <span id="s908">there was no God.</span> <span id="s909">There was no world.</span> <span id="s910">There was no Pope.</span> <span id="s911">There was no priests.</span> <span id="s912">There was nobody.</span> <span id="s913">And by that time, we came to the realization that we are on our own, not to look out for help.</span> <span id="s914">There was not no help coming.</span> <span id="s915">We were there and unless we kept ourselves alive, we're going to die there, just like he said.</span> <span id="s916">So we made ourselves a promise.</span> <span id="s917">We won't do him that favor.</span> <span id="s918">We'll survive, and we worked on the trans-Saharian and two years later a dune came...a wind came and the same dune was over the tracks again.</span> <span id="s919">The wind just put sand back on the tracks.</span> <span id="s920">We went back.</span> <span id="s921">We had these sacks we put the sand in and that wasn't good enough.</span> <span id="s922">They gave the sack that was in the front and in the back...one sack to carry was not enough yet for them.</span> <span id="s923">We had to get a double sack full of sand and sand is heavy.</span> <span id="s924">And when you drag yourself through the sand with your feet, when you have no...you're barefooted and the sand is hot and you sink in...in to the sand, it's hard to walk and you carry that weight which it just pushes you down and you have no strength left and you see, you look up and you see this Spahice from the horses looking at you.</span> <span id="s925">He's...he's just waiting for a reason to to beat on you.</span> <span id="s926">You'll move.</span> <span id="s927">You get your last bit of strength together and you'll move.</span> <span id="s928">And you hope and look forward for the end of the day when you can go back into the camp and just fall down on your face and get a drink of water.</span> <span id="s929">Anyone who could no longer work, was at the end.</span> <span id="s930">There were guys...people that just could no longer work, the older people that could no longer absorb that punishment...they just laid down.</span> <span id="s931">They would get no ration, no bread ration and no water ration.</span> <span id="s932">That was forbode.</span> <span id="s933">That was...you know...a strict rule...unless they get up and work, they could get no nourishment.</span> <span id="s934">So what we had to do is from the piece of bread that we got, we broke up a little piece into...well, a bowl, whatever you had there, and we collected and we gave it to them...a few pieces, just from a few pieces from the little that we had and gave them a drink of water from mine, a drink of water from the other guy's, and we we made another cup full like from the little bit that we could afford to...you know, that we gave.</span> <span id="s935">And our...I remember our hands would shake when when we gave that bit of water and we looked at their faces...how they would be looking at us...thank you, thank you, just wet my lips.</span> <span id="s936">Then the order came down.</span> <span id="s937">Anybody who can't get up, they're going to come around and cut their vein.</span> <span id="s938">So they came around and with their knife...they couldn't get up anymore, and cut their vein and bled them to death.</span> <span id="s939">And they were...they were looking and says we know.</span> <span id="s940">We know what's happening.</span> <span id="s941">We know.</span> <span id="s942">come to me.</span> <span id="s943">We know.</span> <span id="s944">And then all the sickness came.</span> <span id="s945">By the time...the first thing you did in the morning, you deloused yourself.</span> <span id="s946">I got real good at it.</span> <span id="s947">We had rags.</span> <span id="s948">Mostly we were naked.</span> <span id="s949">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s950">We deloused ourselves.</span> <span id="s951">We had guys with dysentery, the other guys with malaria, with fevers, snake bites, scorpion bites...so what we did, we caught...there are the wandering Bedouins (ph)...they they wander through the desert ...we would get a female dog, catch a female dog, keep him at the bonfire.</span> <span id="s952">The female dog would attract...they always have dogs with them...would come over to the female dog.</span> <span id="s953">We would catch them, hit them on the head with a rock.</span> <span id="s954">We had butchers in the camp...and butcher the the dogs.</span> <span id="s955">Like Mr. Sadowsky (ph) that wrote that book, he says we lived mostly on rats, snakes and dog.</span> <span id="s956">That is...that's what kept us alive.</span> <span id="s957">That's the desert rats.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">They jump like kangaroos.</span> <span id="s959">You've never seen one?</span> <span id="s960">Yeah.</span> <span id="s961">We learned to live with it...and dog.</span> <span id="s962">The first time I ate dog, the guys called me in, said here, eat this.</span> <span id="s963">I ate it.</span> <span id="s964">It was good.</span> <span id="s965">I was hungry, and I said what is it.</span> <span id="s966">They said don't tell him.</span> <span id="s967">You got use to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">That's what kept us alive in there.</span> <span id="s969">They would...they would just beat you up for the hell of it, just to have fun.</span> <span id="s970">This camp was about the worst bit of hell on this God's earth.</span> <span id="s971">In the rainy season, the tents would fall apart.</span> <span id="s972">They would sink into the ground and tip over.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">And the rain wouldn't stop for six weeks.</span> <span id="s974">There was a flood out there, and we would lay in the mud for six weeks.</span> <span id="s975">Just lay in the mud.</span> <span id="s976">Just no place to go.</span> <span id="s977">You couldn't put a tent back up again.</span> <span id="s978">It would sink right back in again.</span> <span id="s979">And we had no way to take a bath.</span> <span id="s980">We didn't take a bath in two years.</span> <span id="s981">We didn't get a haircut in two years.</span> <span id="s982">We didn't get...we didn't brush our teeth in two years.</span> <span id="s983">Just try to stay alive.</span> <span id="s984">Some of...who worried about brushing their teeth.</span> <span id="s985">It was just about like this, like he said in the book, the worst camp in all of Africa.</span> <span id="s986">That's where they put the most dangerous people.</span> <span id="s987">I stayed two years in that camp, from 1941 till 1943.</span> <span id="s988">How I survived that camp, I will never know.</span> <span id="s989">What frightens me the most during those two years, and what I feel guilty about (coughing)...I never thought about my family.</span> <span id="s990">I was so busy worrying about myself, I never worried about any of my family.</span> <span id="s991">That scared me the most.</span> <span id="s992">I was so detached from my family, from life, from the outside world, from life itself, that I never thought about them.</span> <span id="s993">I never thought about my home, until I finally got out and I took my mother's picture, and I I wrote down, .</span> <span id="s994">I escaped death.</span> <span id="s995">We will meet again.</span> <span id="s996">I wrote that down on that picture in 1943.</span> <span id="s997">On the other side was a little space and I wrote down there, luck doesn't seem to like me very much, but I'll make do.</span> <span id="s998">In 1943, in 1942, if you remember well, the Americans had landed in North Africa, and they took over the Hotel which was the biggest hotel in Algiers and they were having a good time already.</span> <span id="s999">They were dancing in the streets.</span> <span id="s1000">They were eating and drinking and having...smoking cigars, and we were still in the camp.</span> <span id="s1001">When the message got...finally got through...there's a camp over there.</span> <span id="s1002">Why don't you let these people out?</span> <span id="s1003">They're dying there everyday.</span> <span id="s1004">They're on their last leg, on their last bit of breathe.</span> <span id="s1005">The answer came from the high command...we have our own problems.</span> <span id="s1006">What are we going to do with these people?</span> <span id="s1007">Where are we going to put them?</span> <span id="s1008">How are we going to take care of them?</span> <span id="s1009">We have our own uh headaches?</span> <span id="s1010">We'll figure out what to do with them.</span> <span id="s1011">Leave them there for the time being.</span> <span id="s1012">(Pause) Now...we stayed there another five months after Algiers was liberated.</span> <span id="s1013">Five more months in the camp, and died more and more and more in these five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Finally the British came and got us out.</span> <span id="s1015">They came down the dunes with their their tanks and half-trucks and they saw a bunch of sick people, dragging them...themselves around, naked and half-naked with long hair, unshaven, dirty, filthy, sick, weak.</span> <span id="s1016">Who are they?</span> <span id="s1017">Who are you people?</span> <span id="s1018">And we had a man in the camp...he was a professor of at the Vienna University...Professor Dr. Pick (ph)...and he spoke oh something like ten languages, and he went forward and he told them who we are.</span> <span id="s1019">So...but they had their guns pointed at us and all sides surrounded the camp and the machine guns pointed at us, and the big guns pointed at us and with their hand guns pointed at us.</span> <span id="s1020">They're not...why are you pointing guns at us?</span> <span id="s1021">We are still dangerous people?</span> <span id="s1022">Look at us.</span> <span id="s1023">Look at us.</span> <span id="s1024">We are the one end of a of a persecuted people that just tried to stay alive, abused and beaten and persecuted and hunted people.</span> <span id="s1025">Have you no pity?</span> <span id="s1026">You too.</span> <span id="s1027">And so they said alright.</span> <span id="s1028">By tomorrow you'll all be out, and they got the trucks down through the desert and they picked us all up, on stretchers, carrying us.</span> <span id="s1029">There were still people dying.</span> <span id="s1030">In the truck there were people dying and we went into Algiers...outside Algiers, a place called which was the 96th General Hospital.</span> <span id="s1031">Never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1032">They put us into the hospital.</span> <span id="s1033">At the hospital they tried to get to us to take blood or give us blood or something.</span> <span id="s1034">They couldn't get needles through.</span> <span id="s1035">Our skin was like leather, so dried out and and thick, so hard from lack of food and lack of uh whatever you normally would have had to stay healthy, so they had to take knives and cut through with knives to give us blood.</span> <span id="s1036">And after a month at the hospital, they said now what are we going to do with you people.</span> <span id="s1037">They had some intelligence officers talk to us.</span> <span id="s1038">Are you going...what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1039">And they called me in.</span> <span id="s1040">They said I'll tell you what...you can go anywhere in the free world and you want to go.</span> <span id="s1041">We'll give you transportation.</span> <span id="s1042">We take care of it.</span> <span id="s1043">If you want to go to school, we'll send you to school.</span> <span id="s1044">If you want to go to England, go to England.</span> <span id="s1045">If you want to go to Israel, go to Israel, anywhere you want to go, go.</span> <span id="s1046">And we kept looking behind us because we were looking for the guards to be there.</span> <span id="s1047">We were so used to looking behind us because everytime in the camp we had to go to the latrine, we had to call out, latrine.</span> <span id="s1048">And the guards would come with this cocked gun...go.</span> <span id="s1049">You went to the latrine.</span> <span id="s1050">They would stay behind you with a cocked gun, wouldn't know whether he's going to shot you in the back or whether you fall into the you know what.</span> <span id="s1051">And we were so used to this, that we couldn't believe there was no one behind us.</span> <span id="s1052">So I said to ...I couldn't speak a word of English...I said tell you what, I said I feel better now.</span> <span id="s1053">You give me a gun.</span> <span id="s1054">Now it's my turn to fight.</span> <span id="s1055">Now this is my time to fight.</span> <span id="s1056">They had...they had their fun.</span> <span id="s1057">Now it's my turn to have fun.</span> <span id="s1058">They looked at me.</span> <span id="s1059">After all this, you want to fight.</span> <span id="s1060">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1061">I said look, I left home.</span> <span id="s1062">I lost my family.</span> <span id="s1063">I lost my country.</span> <span id="s1064">I lost my home.</span> <span id="s1065">I lost everything that was dear and close to me, everything I loved.</span> <span id="s1066">I was hunted like an animal.</span> <span id="s1067">I was persecuted.</span> <span id="s1068">I was beaten.</span> <span id="s1069">I was shot at.</span> <span id="s1070">I was...I was abused.</span> <span id="s1071">I was starved.</span> <span id="s1072">I was beaten half to death.</span> <span id="s1073">I was worked half to death.</span> <span id="s1074">I was hanged by my arms until they was out of their sockets.</span> <span id="s1075">I was hosed down with ice water in the cold of night.</span> <span id="s1076">I..</span> <span id="s1077">.</span> <span id="s1078">I..</span> <span id="s1079">.</span> <span id="s1080">I have seen just about everything.</span> <span id="s1081">I have absorbed just what everything that this world threw at me.</span> <span id="s1082">There was no help from anyone.</span> <span id="s1083">No help came.</span> <span id="s1084">Though I begged for help, no help came.</span> <span id="s1085">We licked the walls of the prisons for a little bit of moisture.</span> <span id="s1086">We knocked on the walls to get the answer to keep our sanity.</span> <span id="s1087">They have thrown just about everything at us but the kitchen sink.</span> <span id="s1088">They have taken everything from us including our dignity.</span> <span id="s1089">What more is there?</span> <span id="s1090">What more is there left to live for except having a little fun with them now?</span> <span id="s1091">I said can you understand that, sir?</span> <span id="s1092">And he just looked at me.</span> <span id="s1093">He says but you don't speak English.</span> <span id="s1094">I said I'll learn.</span> <span id="s1095">But you don't know how to shoot.</span> <span id="s1096">I'll learn.</span> <span id="s1097">And after I learn, not just how to use it but to use, that's all I want to do.</span> <span id="s1098">I want to back to Europe and I want to do my job and I want to see if any of my family has returned or is left alive.</span> <span id="s1099">Now that is my God...I have earned that right.</span> <span id="s1100">Don't you think so?</span> <span id="s1101">He called in the other sergeant.</span> <span id="s1102">He says give this man a uniform and give him the regular gun.</span> <span id="s1103">I says no.</span> <span id="s1104">I want a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1105">He says why.</span> <span id="s1106">It kills more people in a shorter period of time.</span> <span id="s1107">Just give him the plain gun and teach him how to use it.</span> <span id="s1108">They gave me a uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">You saw the uniform.</span> <span id="s1110">I had a little training.</span> <span id="s1111">I started learning English, the most important words, and I went into battle.</span> <span id="s1112">That time we battled the German army in North Africa.</span> <span id="s1113">We .</span> <span id="s1114">I joined the 8th Army, Montgomery's army.</span> <span id="s1115">They put me into an outfit all foreigners, the whole outfit, and we did the jobs that they couldn't do.</span> <span id="s1116">When something had to be done, they called us in because we had...by this time we had nothing but hate.</span> <span id="s1117">We had so much hate in us and so much resentment and so much, and so much bitterness in us by this time that we didn't care about nothing.</span> <span id="s1118">We didn't care to be shot at.</span> <span id="s1119">We didn't care whether we get .</span> <span id="s1120">We didn't care whether we fired at them or shoot them.</span> <span id="s1121">We had no pity.</span> <span id="s1122">We had...we just had no pity left in us, because there was no pity for us.</span> <span id="s1123">Nobody gave us an ounce of pity when we needed it most.</span> <span id="s1124">So they called us in for big jobs and bad jobs and we did it.</span> <span id="s1125">After about a year or so, a year and a half, they called me out and said we're going to send you to the office in London.</span> <span id="s1126">That is fine.</span> <span id="s1127">Sent me there and I went through a course of intelligence, army intelligence.</span> <span id="s1128">So I said what am I to do?</span> <span id="s1129">He says well, we don't need you so much shooting up the Germans in Africa.</span> <span id="s1130">We need you going after war criminals.</span> <span id="s1131">That's more your speed isn't it?</span> <span id="s1132">I said is it ever.</span> <span id="s1133">Is it ever.</span> <span id="s1134">Sure enough.</span> <span id="s1135">They educated me in intelligence work.</span> <span id="s1136">They attached me to the FSS which is the Field Security Service, branch of the Intelligence, un Investigations, and uh they said...they had a big map on the wall and said to me where do you want to go in British occupied Germany.</span> <span id="s1137">I said well, pick the...pick the city.</span> <span id="s1138">Well, my home town was occupied by the Russians, so I couldn't go there, so I said well, give me Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s1139">They said you've got it.</span> <span id="s1140">You got the city.</span> <span id="s1141">Do a good job now.</span> <span id="s1142">Here are your papers.</span> <span id="s1143">Report to headquarters.</span> <span id="s1144">I went to Dusseldorf, report to headquarters, and they said go out to , outside Dusseldorf and there's an office waiting for you, and do what you have to do.</span> <span id="s1145">Get those Nazis.</span> <span id="s1146">I said you bet.</span> <span id="s1147">And we traveled in crews of three, a German Jew, a Polish Jew and a Hungarian Jew or Romanian Jew, whatever.</span> <span id="s1148">Between us we spoke ten languages.</span> <span id="s1149">By that time I spoke French.</span> <span id="s1150">By that time I spoke English.</span> <span id="s1151">By the time, you know, I picked this up from the .</span> <span id="s1152">We're not all that stupid.</span> <span id="s1153">And we went, we traveled.</span> <span id="s1154">And did we ever do a job.</span> <span id="s1155">Did we ever do a job.</span> <span id="s1156">We started investigating the mayor and the chief of the police.</span> <span id="s1157">We started way, way on top.</span> <span id="s1158">Said never mind the little fish.</span> <span id="s1159">Get the big fish.</span> <span id="s1160">And we got a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1161">And then they called us in and said look, you are too tough.</span> <span id="s1162">They said if we are as the Nazis then we are no better.</span> <span id="s1163">That's what he said to me, my major said that to me.</span> <span id="s1164">Then we are no better than they were.</span> <span id="s1165">We have to stop hating and we have to stop being bitter and learn to forget.</span> <span id="s1166">I said Major, how do you do that?</span> <span id="s1167">You have to .</span> <span id="s1168">How do you forget?</span> <span id="s1169">He said, I know it's hard.</span> <span id="s1170">It'll take a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1171">He said so what.</span> <span id="s1172">What are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1173">We used to do bad things.</span> <span id="s1174">I mean, you know, we used to get them and used to blow their brains out and tried...they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1175">We used to put them and they beg us to...I I remember in Holland we caught one.</span> <span id="s1176">He was hiding in a baker's oven.</span> <span id="s1177">(cough) We caught him and we gave him a choice...you stay there.</span> <span id="s1178">We put the oven on.</span> <span id="s1179">If you come out, I'll blow your brains out.</span> <span id="s1180">He said that's no choice.</span> <span id="s1181">I said that's more the choice you gave our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Our people didn't even have a choice.</span> <span id="s1183">You threw two hundred thousand children in open fires then burned them alive.</span> <span id="s1184">They had no choice.</span> <span id="s1185">You gassed our people.</span> <span id="s1186">Did you give them a choice?</span> <span id="s1187">They had no...not even a choice how to die, just make them die.</span> <span id="s1188">You murdered them in cold blood.</span> <span id="s1189">Did you give them a choice?</span> <span id="s1190">No.</span> <span id="s1191">We are good to you.</span> <span id="s1192">We let you say your prayers.</span> <span id="s1193">He came out.</span> <span id="s1194">I said we give you five minutes.</span> <span id="s1195">Talk to your God.</span> <span id="s1196">(cough) That's more than you give our people.</span> <span id="s1197">And that's the kind of things we did.</span> <span id="s1198">I mean we pulled in very few, and they found out.</span> <span id="s1199">And they said...the Major said look, I think you've had enough.</span> <span id="s1200">I think...I think this is enough for you...no more.</span> <span id="s1201">Go home.</span> <span id="s1202">I said where's that?</span> <span id="s1203">Go to England.</span> <span id="s1204">Go to school.</span> <span id="s1205">You're being discharged.</span> <span id="s1206">After four years and three months, I lost my usefulness.</span> <span id="s1207">He said no, we could use you.</span> <span id="s1208">You speak German, but you're too brutal.</span> <span id="s1209">I says brutality is something that they taught me.</span> <span id="s1210">I wasn't born with that.</span> <span id="s1211">OK.</span> <span id="s1212">I go.</span> <span id="s1213">Perhaps you're right.</span> <span id="s1214">And just gave me my discharge and uh I went to England and after a year I couldn't just found myself...I had nothing and I went to the American Counselor.</span> <span id="s1215">I said I'd like to go to America, start a new life.</span> <span id="s1216">So the American Ambassador just looked at me.</span> <span id="s1217">Come back tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1218">The next day he had all my life in front of him.</span> <span id="s1219">He told me everything that...that he could possibly know, from the day I left home.</span> <span id="s1220">He said is that you.</span> <span id="s1221">I said to the teeth.</span> <span id="s1222">And he said, alright, he says.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Here is your papers.</span> <span id="s1224">Take your papers.</span> <span id="s1225">Go to America.</span> <span id="s1226">Good luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Do you know about your family now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Never found out.</span> <span id="s1229">I found out one thing.</span> <span id="s1230">During the occupation with Intelligence, I found out that my brother Paul was gassed in Auschwitz, that my mother and three sisters lost their lives in Wiegar (ph) concentration camp in the ovens.</span> <span id="s1231">Some say they hang them...some say they put them in ovens, and that's all I ever found out.</span> <span id="s1232">Well, I say, it's I I did things and I tried to put that in the back of my mind, but let me tell you...to describe the cruelty and the barbaric cruelty of the...of the French people, of the French gendarmes and the French guard du mobiles, believe me when I tell you, when I tell you that the French, they're eager to please their German masters.</span> <span id="s1233">They were...they were brutal.</span> <span id="s1234">They treated us poorly.</span> <span id="s1235">When they made their rounds, they beat up children.</span> <span id="s1236">They beat up women.</span> <span id="s1237">They beat...they were thrown onto the trucks like garbage and and and and it was just so sad.</span> <span id="s1238">I was on top of the truck and I helped them pull them in.</span> <span id="s1239">They beat up little boys and girls and the mothers and that they arrested in the streets.</span> <span id="s1240">The cruelty displayed by these people, by the gendarmes and the guard du mobile is next to none.</span> <span id="s1241">I mean they really pleased their German masters, let me tell you, and very little was said about that, the brutality of these people.</span> <span id="s1242">And I went back to my home town once hoping to find someone...nothing.</span> <span id="s1243">So I retraced my steps and I put all these years in the back of my head, but let me tell you something...this comes straight from my inside...there isn't a day in the last fifty years, a day of my life...there is not one day, even in America, that I don't think back.</span> <span id="s1244">Not just my family.</span> <span id="s1245">Look what happened to me, and there is more and more details are coming out, more and more heroics is coming out and more and more suffering is coming out, and I ask myself...I keep asking myself, how did I ever survive this brutality, this sickness, these sick people?</span> <span id="s1246">How...how could I ever absorb this punishment, so much for so long and how I will ever understand the indifference of the world?</span> <span id="s1247">They say...they say that the biggest tragedy (clearing throat) of the 20th century was the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1248">I don't say that.</span> <span id="s1249">I say the biggest tragedy of the 20th century was the indifference of the world.</span> <span id="s1250">That is what I say, and nobody came to our aid.</span> <span id="s1251">Nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s1252">Nobody raised a word of protest, not the Pope, not the kings, not the presidents, not governments.</span> <span id="s1253">In this whole world...Hitler held a speech in 1938.</span> <span id="s1254">I heard the speech.</span> <span id="s1255">He said take the Jews as he spoke to the world...or we will kill them.</span> <span id="s1256">That's what he said.</span> <span id="s1257">Not only did they not help us, not only did they not give us a hand, but they closed the borders.</span> <span id="s1258">They rejected us.</span> <span id="s1259">They didn't want us.</span> <span id="s1260">They pushed us back.</span> <span id="s1261">In other words, they said to Adolph Hitler, kill them.</span> <span id="s1262">We don't want them.</span> <span id="s1263">We don't want to help them.</span> <span id="s1264">We have other things to do.</span> <span id="s1265">Do with them what you want.</span> <span id="s1266">When they asked the Allies to bomb the tracks, the railroad tracks that go to to Auschwitz, the answer came back...we have no planes to spare.</span> <span id="s1267">When they said they're throwing two hundred thousand children in the open fires and burn them alive, the answer came back...it is an internal matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">When the ship with eight hundred people, the St. Louis I believe it was, when that uh got in into the United States to Cuba, from the United States, they would not allow them to land.</span> <span id="s1269">They were eight hundred people, and they would not allow them to come into the country and they went back to die.</span> <span id="s1270">That is the biggest tragedy of the 20th century, and that is something I will never forgive them for.</span> <span id="s1271">Not anyone, any of the countries, any of the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s1272">There are people that...in Mexico there was an earthquake.</span> <span id="s1273">Millions of people were ...help, help, help, help, help everybody.</span> <span id="s1274">When the Shiites had a problem, millions of dollars, planes...they don't know what to do for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Uh you you...can we just talk a little bit...you came to the United States...and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1277">I came to the United States with three cents, and an old army uniform, fatigues...that's all I had between me and nothing.</span> <span id="s1278">So I stood on the dock and I went to a bus that was standing there, and I said to the bus driver, you go?</span> <span id="s1279">And he said to Newark.</span> <span id="s1280">I said what's Newark?</span> <span id="s1281">He said outside New York.</span> <span id="s1282">I said I go there too.</span> <span id="s1283">I can't stay here.</span> <span id="s1284">And he says what's...where were you?</span> <span id="s1285">He said do you have money?</span> <span id="s1286">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1287">I pulled out three cents, English pennies.</span> <span id="s1288">get in the back.</span> <span id="s1289">Took me to Newark.</span> <span id="s1290">I said where do you want me to get off.</span> <span id="s1291">They had a lot of gas stations.</span> <span id="s1292">Let me off where there are a lot of gas stations.</span> <span id="s1293">I walked into this...I walked into the second station, two Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s1294">I said...I said I need a job.</span> <span id="s1295">They said to me, so do a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1296">I said no, but I I need a job now and you've got to give me a job because I can do anything better than you in fact.</span> <span id="s1297">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s1298">He said you have a loud...you have a big mouth.</span> <span id="s1299">I said but I can back it up.</span> <span id="s1300">He said where are you from.</span> <span id="s1301">I told him off the boat.</span> <span id="s1302">You have money?</span> <span id="s1303">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1304">Three cents.</span> <span id="s1305">The bus driver never took the money.</span> <span id="s1306">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s1307">He says alright, I give you a job.</span> <span id="s1308">Thirty dollars a week, six days.</span> <span id="s1309">I says fine.</span> <span id="s1310">He gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s1311">He gave me...got me a room, and I worked with him in the gas station...washing cars, greasing cars, towing cars.</span> <span id="s1312">And after a while I said to myself, there's nothing I want to do with my life.</span> <span id="s1313">And I saw an ad in the paper...school...uh .</span> <span id="s1314">I wanted to do that.</span> <span id="s1315">I mean that takes ten years to learn, thousands of dollars in tuition.</span> <span id="s1316">I can't afford that...no money.</span> <span id="s1317">I saw another ad...watchmaking.</span> <span id="s1318">Well, doesn't sound bad.</span> <span id="s1319">I have good hands.</span> <span id="s1320">I have a good mind.</span> <span id="s1321">I went up there and I saw the blueprints on the wall.</span> <span id="s1322">I was running out.</span> <span id="s1323">The instructor grabbed me by the neck and pulled me back.</span> <span id="s1324">Stay.</span> <span id="s1325">I stayed.</span> <span id="s1326">The course was something like I believe twenty-four months.</span> <span id="s1327">Seventy-five dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1328">I stayed.</span> <span id="s1329">I got myself a job with Cable and Wire in , New Jersey...a factory, loading trucks on a platform, from seven to four.</span> <span id="s1330">At five o'clock I was in school, five days a week.</span> <span id="s1331">I couldn't pay seventy-five dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1332">I said tell you what...give me half the tuition off and I'll wash your floors for you.</span> <span id="s1333">He says you've got a deal.</span> <span id="s1334">I paid him whenever I could.</span> <span id="s1335">There were months I couldn't pay him.</span> <span id="s1336">So I cleaned the place.</span> <span id="s1337">I took care of the place.</span> <span id="s1338">I took care of the tools and the land.</span> <span id="s1339">After twelve months he called me into his office.</span> <span id="s1340">He says, here's your diploma.</span> <span id="s1341">There's nothing more we can teach you.</span> <span id="s1342">I said I have another twelve months to go.</span> <span id="s1343">He says no, you go out.</span> <span id="s1344">Go out in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">You've learned all we can teach you.</span> <span id="s1346">I went out in the field and I learned and I worked and I learned and I worked and I got better and better and better and I spent nights studying books, uh mathematics, algebra, ratios.</span> <span id="s1347">I practiced uh on the lathe.</span> <span id="s1348">I made parts by hand and I wanted to know why this is round and that is square and this is thick and this is thin and why and how...why couldn't it be improved upon and how many ways are there to do a repair job and I learned from masters.</span> <span id="s1349">I knocked on their doors.</span> <span id="s1350">I said teach me.</span> <span id="s1351">Teach me all you know.</span> <span id="s1352">They did.</span> <span id="s1353">I became good.</span> <span id="s1354">I've been doing this for forty-five years.</span> <span id="s1355">I've had my own business for the last twenty-five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Before we finish is there anything that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: No.</span> <span id="s1358">I think I covered it.</span> <span id="s1359">(Sigh) It is just...I tell you before I finish up...this is a hurt that will stay with you the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s1360">This is...this is a feeling of guilt that will stay with you the rest of your life, the guilt being that you are left alive and they didn't make it and you feel guilty about that.</span> <span id="s1361">And that will all stay with you and you will suffer the rest of your life with all this.</span> <span id="s1362">This is not something that will go away ever, and you look at the world and you say, why didn't you help me?</span> <span id="s1363">You could have done something.</span> <span id="s1364">You helped other people.</span> <span id="s1365">Why not us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: You had mentioned uh something about heroics...some heroic stories.</span> <span id="s1367">Is there one particular one you'd like to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: My God...there are so many.</span> <span id="s1369">They are .</span> <span id="s1370">Yes I do.</span> <span id="s1371">Twice I spent time in Fort hanging on the hook for stupid reasons.</span> <span id="s1372">The third time would have killed me.</span> <span id="s1373">I had made a fire.</span> <span id="s1374">We had lookouts.</span> <span id="s1375">They didn't watch out good.</span> <span id="s1376">They caught me and I was supposed to go another fifteen days at Fort .</span> <span id="s1377">They knew if I would go another fifteen days it would be the end of me.</span> <span id="s1378">There was nothing left of me after two to start with.</span> <span id="s1379">Before I knew it, all the remain camp guys, they assembled in front of the gate and they had me inside and they said no, he's not going.</span> <span id="s1380">It came out sudden.</span> <span id="s1381">He is not going to Fort .</span> <span id="s1382">Neither is anybody else.</span> <span id="s1383">We've had enough.</span> <span id="s1384">Nobody is going out of this camp.</span> <span id="s1385">Nobody is going to be hanging up their arms.</span> <span id="s1386">Nobody is going to get beat up again.</span> <span id="s1387">Nobody's going to die anymore.</span> <span id="s1388">We've had it.</span> <span id="s1389">The guards could do nothing.</span> <span id="s1390">We were a thousand, two thousand guys there.</span> <span id="s1391">So they told me you stay where you are.</span> <span id="s1392">You're not going anyplace.</span> <span id="s1393">Everybody picked up rocks.</span> <span id="s1394">That's it.</span> <span id="s1395">So they called in the Spahice.</span> <span id="s1396">We saw them arrive with their horses.</span> <span id="s1397">He called them in.</span> <span id="s1398">They came through the gate and that was the only uprising we ever had...could do in the camp.</span> <span id="s1399">There was two-fold...the reason was two- fold.</span> <span id="s1400">No...nobody ever again would go to Fort , and maybe this will go on to the outside world to let people know what's going on here, make people find us, make people investigate.</span> <span id="s1401">Perhaps somehow, somebody will bring it into the outside world that other people died.</span> <span id="s1402">They came with their sabers.</span> <span id="s1403">We threw rocks at them.</span> <span id="s1404">We trampled them to death.</span> <span id="s1405">We took their sabers and we fought.</span> <span id="s1406">It was a bloody battle in the camp, but there wasn't much we had to fight with.</span> <span id="s1407">And I didn't go to Fort that day.</span> <span id="s1408">It was spared me, but people actually gave their lives to save mine.</span> <span id="s1409">I think that's heroic.</span> <span id="s1410">Some how or other incidents...guys that tried to commit suicide uh and went into the barbed...we weren't allowed to go within ten feet of the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1411">They would shoot you.</span> <span id="s1412">And guys started running into the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1413">We pulled them back and they were shooting at us and yet still they pulled them in, in spite of the bullets.</span> <span id="s1414">You did so many things...there was so much going on with so little we we could do about these situations, but yet every little thing was a heroic act.</span> <span id="s1415">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s1416">Everything was a heroic act and and and finally we got out and we said well...Max came to me and says I told you you'll make it, because many days we stood on the barbed wires and says Max, we'll never get out of here.</span> <span id="s1417">Max was ten years older.</span> <span id="s1418">Max, we'll never make it.</span> <span id="s1419">It's already two years.</span> <span id="s1420">We'll never get out of here, and Max said, you'll see...tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">You'll see...tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1422">That little...you'll see tomorrow...gave me hope for another twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s1423">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s1424">Although I didn't...I didn't believe him...thought he was lying and I knew he was lying...but he said it anyway and and I could make myself believe it.</span> <span id="s1425">These are the little things that kept us going, little things, little supports, supporting each other.</span> <span id="s1426">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s1427">We had so little to support ourselves with and so little hope.</span> <span id="s1428">How I survived I never know.</span> <span id="s1429">I tell you to this day it's a miracle how I got out of it, how I survived all these nonsense, all these cruelties, all these beatings, all this brutality.</span> <span id="s1430">I don't know how, to this day, but I'm here to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Well, thank you very much for telling about it.</span> <span id="s1432">A: It's not a hell of a lot, but what can I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Thank you for having me to tell my story.</span> <span id="s1435">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: It's a sad story, but nevertheless, it's my story.</span> <span id="s1437">Q: It's your story and you expressed it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: It's my story.</span> <span id="s1439">How can you put years and years of these things...how can you tell about the nights, the lonely nights and the lonely, the hard days?</span> <span id="s1440">How...how can you put that into words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
