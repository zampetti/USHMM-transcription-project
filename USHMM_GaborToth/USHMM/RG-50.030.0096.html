HERBST May 15, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Could you please tell us your full name.</span> <span id="s13">A: My name is Harold B. Herbst.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: When and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in New York City on February the 19th, 1912.</span> <span id="s16">Q: Tell us a little bit about your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My father at that time had these vending machines that were in the subways and elevators.</span> <span id="s18">It was quite a nice business.</span> <span id="s19">But when World War II came along, they couldn't get sugar.</span> <span id="s20">So he had to let the business go, and we moved to Detroit.</span> <span id="s21">In Detroit my dad became a businessman and opened up a laundry.</span> <span id="s22">From there on I spent the rest of my life so far in that particular Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s23">Now, during the childhood the things I can remember, the things that stick out, is that as a child my mother had my brother and I sitting on her lap on a windowsill on Fifth Avenue watching the parade coming back from the first world war.</span> <span id="s24">I also had the pleasure of riding in one of the last horse-and-buggy street cars of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Then the next thing of memory is when I was 12 years old I started taking piano lessons, and when I was 14 I started playing square dances professionally with a fiddle player, violin player.</span> <span id="s26">Square dance people prefer to call themselves fiddle players.</span> <span id="s27">Then I went to the public school system in Detroit and graduated from high school after I dropped out of school when I was in eleventh grade.</span> <span id="s28">When I dropped out, I got interested in music again and went into Vaudeville for a period of about three, four months.</span> <span id="s29">And when I came back, I had a good friend who talked me into going back to school, which I did.</span> <span id="s30">And he enrolled me into the Castech (phonetic), which is one of the schools that was set aside for advanced students.</span> <span id="s31">I was fortunate because my friend happened to be the director of the Board of Education at that time.</span> <span id="s32">And I went through the school system of Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s33">Went to Castech.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Then went to Wayne University in Detroit and continued my education into the medical field.</span> <span id="s35">Premedics was at Wayne University.</span> <span id="s36">Medics was at Wayne University.</span> <span id="s37">I graduated from Wayne as a doctor and immediately after spending a short period of internship became a member in the United States Army as a first lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What year did you graduate from medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: 1942.</span> <span id="s40">And then I had my internship, and I started residency.</span> <span id="s41">And from the residency I was drafted and ended up in the Army.</span> <span id="s42">Went in training at a field hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: That was in '43.</span> <span id="s45">And for the purpose of training for a majority of -- for a major.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did you specialize in anything at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: At that time I was in surgery.</span> <span id="s48">I was a resident in surgery, and I continued that.</span> <span id="s49">When I was in the Army, I was placed in the hospital as a surgeon for the 170 VAC hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: At that time it was just being organized.</span> <span id="s52">We were the youngest group of enlisted men.</span> <span id="s53">The doctors were quite young.</span> <span id="s54">It was more like an experimental hospital for the Army because they used to always hire -- not hire -- but place people of 35 or older in hospitals and save the young fellows for the infantry and so forth.</span> <span id="s55">So we were quite a young group in general.</span> <span id="s56">From there we went overseas in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: March of '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Of 1943.</span> <span id="s59">And ended up in Belfast, Ireland, our first stop.</span> <span id="s60">We were training our enlisted men for hospital duty in the hospital and were getting acquainted with the materials that we had to use when we were on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s61">The training would be every day.</span> <span id="s62">The enlisted men would have classes and would actually practice on each other to develop their techniques.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">From there we moved to Denby (phonetic), which was in North Ireland -- North England.</span> <span id="s64">And Denby, England -- we were there again training waiting for the invasion to occur.</span> <span id="s65">The invasion came, of course, on the 4th of June I think it is.</span> <span id="s66">The exact date I don't remember.</span> <span id="s67">But we were scheduled to go behind the Army and over to France in July, the first of July.</span> <span id="s68">And that's when we went across the English Channel and into the French territory.</span> <span id="s69">From there we were placed at first with the first Army, who was at the beachhead wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind.</span> <span id="s70">It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as it can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started.</span> <span id="s71">That's when we first started seeing patients in the hospital.</span> <span id="s72">From there we followed to the third Army with Patton, and this was in France.</span> <span id="s73">The first place was a beachhead.</span> <span id="s74">The second place was the base of the Brest peninsula, and the third place we went to -- and this was in a matter of less than a month or so -- was Crosan (ph.), which was a little bit north of Brest.</span> <span id="s75">As I said, we were with Patton, and we were transferred to the 9th Army at that time.</span> <span id="s76">And then we finally came back and went back to Patton, and we followed them clear -- one of the hospital units that followed him clear across Europe until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s77">We were in all the major battles at Brest and Grodan (ph.).</span> <span id="s78">And then we got involved in the Bastogne, which was where the battle of the Bulge was.</span> <span id="s79">We were the only hospital functioning in the Bulge proper at the time, to our knowledge.</span> <span id="s80">We didn't know of any other hospital at that time.</span> <span id="s81">In fact, our hospital was listed as being missing because the communication was so bad during the Bulge.</span> <span id="s82">During that time we worked as much as 12 hours every day anyway, but I can remember that I saw 28 -- did 28 operations in those 12 hours we were so busy.</span> <span id="s83">As for the surgeons in the unit, we spent most of the time in the hospital doing surgery.</span> <span id="s84">Very little time to explore too much around the area.</span> <span id="s85">And we were always kept busy because we were behind Mr. Blood and Guts, Patton, and he moved fast.</span> <span id="s86">From there we went on and ended up in Regensburg when the peace came, when it was declared, armistice was declared.</span> <span id="s87">And it moved back to Wurzburg where we at that time started to disband the hospital.</span> <span id="s88">I came back to the States in 19 -- in fact, I arrived back in the States New Year's of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Let's just back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s90">Let's trace some of the things that you commented on.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s92">During that trip across the continent of Europe, we came very close to a city called Weimar (phonetic) I think was the name.</span> <span id="s93">And I was sent on a mission by the colonel to Weimar.</span> <span id="s94">And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a police station, he told me that the Germans had just left Buchenwald, a concentration camp that was based in Germany in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life.</span> <span id="s95">He gave me directions as to how to go to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s96">He told me it was a five-mile route, and he showed me the road.</span> <span id="s97">I got in a Jeep with my driver.</span> <span id="s98">We went out to see what we could see.</span> <span id="s99">I'll tell you the story of that.</span> <span id="s100">It was riding through a countryside which was green and very interesting in itself, and we came upon the gates of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: How long a ride was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: It was five miles.</span> <span id="s103">So I would say probably about 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s104">Not too much of a ride from Weimar.</span> <span id="s105">In fact, it couldn't be too much of a ride because part of the story -- the prisoners would be paraded down the same road into Weimar on weekends and paraded through the city where people would throw garbage and everything else on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did you have any particular thoughts on that ride out?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: At the time riding out I didn't know what I was going to see.</span> <span id="s108">We had heard all sort of rumors of the various concentration camps.</span> <span id="s109">We had taken care of our own soldiers who happened to be captured at the Bulge and came back to the unit after we overran the Germans, and the average -- of our own soldiers -- the average weight they would lose would be 38 pounds in a matter of two and a half months.</span> <span id="s110">And they would tell us the stories that they had, and we thought that was terrible.</span> <span id="s111">But we found out that it wasn't nearly as bad as what happened in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s112">When I walked into the gates of Buchenwald, there weren't any other soldiers in Buchenwald at that time, and I felt that I was probably the first one through the gates.</span> <span id="s113">The odd part about it -- the prisoners were walking around.</span> <span id="s114">The gates were wide open.</span> <span id="s115">The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking, but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the gates or anything.</span> <span id="s116">They were wide open.</span> <span id="s117">Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the camp fled from the camp on April 11th, and the underground which was in existence in Buchenwald, in and about Buchenwald, took over the camp with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the camp before the American soldiers even arrived, which was a day or two later.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What did you see at the gates when you pulled up?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: When we pulled up, there was a big emblem on the top of the gate which stated -- and the words might be not exactly right -- but it said, "You enter through the gates, and you leave by the way of the furnace" or chimney.</span> <span id="s120">"Chimney" is the word they used.</span> <span id="s121">That was there in German in a great big emblem.</span> <span id="s122">It was very prominently in a spot where you couldn't help from seeing the emblem.</span> <span id="s123">Then when you walked into the gate in front of me --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: The gate was open?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: The gate was open, and prisoners were walking in and out freely.</span> <span id="s126">No resistance.</span> <span id="s127">Nobody checking them or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Now, how long was that after the liberation of the camp?</span> <span id="s129">A: How long after the --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Liberation of the camp did you go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: The SS troopers left on April 11th.</span> <span id="s132">This must have been either the 13th or the 12th -- the 13th -- that I was there.</span> <span id="s133">I can't remember the exact date because when we were working like we did, we didn't even know what date it was sometimes.</span> <span id="s134">In the hospital we didn't keep track.</span> <span id="s135">But it was that time.</span> <span id="s136">I have it on the chart.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did your driver stay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: The driver was with me.</span> <span id="s139">It's customary that -- I was a captain at that time, and it's customary that officers didn't drive a vehicle.</span> <span id="s140">We had always a driver to drive us, and he also entered the camp with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You walked in on foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: We drove up there in the Jeep and left it outside of the first gate or right inside of the first gate and walked from there on.</span> <span id="s143">Right in front of us was three barracks.</span> <span id="s144">Quite large.</span> <span id="s145">Went up about three to four floors in height.</span> <span id="s146">And they were stationed one next to each other.</span> <span id="s147">And I remember walking up to the -- the first two you couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s148">They were locked.</span> <span id="s149">The doors were locked.</span> <span id="s150">There was nobody walking with me.</span> <span id="s151">Nobody to stop me or prevent me from doing anything I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s152">And my purpose was to see as much as I could and try to see what this was all about.</span> <span id="s153">But the third barracks was open, and I have taken pictures of that, which we'll probably show later on.</span> <span id="s154">And I had the opportunity to talk to the prisoners in the barracks, and some of the stories that I'll tell you are from what the prisoners have told me.</span> <span id="s155">We had a pretty good idea before I went in there from our stories that we got out of our own soldiers and the prisoners that we took about things that were happening in these camps, but until you actually see them, it's hard to believe.</span> <span id="s156">In fact, when I came out of the Army, I didn't talk to anybody or even take all the things I had put in my locker and so forth that I'd brought back with me for over 46 years until now because it's nothing that you like to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Besides that when you start telling the story, the people -- they look at you, and they say, oh -- they have the look that we really can't believe that.</span> <span id="s158">Well, the same ideas went through our head when we were looking at it.</span> <span id="s159">How can you believe this?</span> <span id="s160">After I got through visiting the first camp and talking to the men, they would -- when the camp became crowded --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Let's back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s162">You were looking into the barracks, and what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, there were these little bunks that they had.</span> <span id="s164">They were about six-by-four's.</span> <span id="s165">And they were originally made -- and part of this comes from the prisoners themselves -- they were originally made for four people to sleep in.</span> <span id="s166">And there were three decks going up of these bunks the length of the barracks on both sides of the barracks.</span> <span id="s167">And when the camp got crowded, they'd double up.</span> <span id="s168">And sometimes they had as many as twelve men in a place that would sleep three.</span> <span id="s169">And the sanitary conditions were terrible, and the stories that the prisoners told is how these people would get sick and have dysentery or so and would not be able even to go to the corner of the building or so -- wherever they could go -- and they couldn't even get out of bed.</span> <span id="s170">So whatever they had to do they did, and from the top it just drained right down to the prisoners below.</span> <span id="s171">My impression at that time after I left that was that these barracks were probably the very last barracks the prisoner would be put in before they would be put to death in the furnaces or other means.</span> <span id="s172">Many of them died from disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Were there people in the barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: There were many people in the barracks that I spoke to.</span> <span id="s175">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: There were at least five or six in one of my camera shots.</span> <span id="s177">Q: How did you speak to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: The prisoners that were in the barracks wouldn't give you an idea of what happened to the other two barracks because they were the most recent prisoners, and they looked like they were still well fed.</span> <span id="s179">They were entirely different than what was remaining in the other two barracks, which we couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s180">But we know about them because we got the story back that they had to close those doors because they couldn't leave these people walk around.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">They were infected with all sort of diseases, dysentery, and many of them were in the last stages.</span> <span id="s182">You couldn't do anything for them anyway.</span> <span id="s183">So they locked the doors on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: How did you communicate to the prisoners you talked to?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well, that's the interesting part.</span> <span id="s186">It's amazing how many Germans were able to speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Then you find out that in Germany part of the school system teaches the children when they're in the third, fourth grade -- they start them on three languages -- German, French and English.</span> <span id="s188">And this is part of their educational system.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: How large was the barracks when you went in?</span> <span id="s190">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: How large was the barracks when you went into them?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Let me see if I can estimate.</span> <span id="s193">32 by -- they were much larger than 60 -- I'm thinking of a telephone pole, which are usually 32 feet.</span> <span id="s194">They were much larger than 60 or 75 feet in length, and in width I would say about 40 feet or so, each barrack.</span> <span id="s195">I didn't have an opportunity to count the amount of cubes that were in there, but that would be my estimate -- what I would estimate them to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: What was the response of the prisoners to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: It seemed they were unusually quiet.</span> <span id="s198">They didn't react in a normal way, and I got the feeling they were afraid that tomorrow the Americans would be driven out and the Germans would be coming back.</span> <span id="s199">So they sort of didn't speak too much.</span> <span id="s200">You practically had to force them to give you answers sometimes by talking to them and sort of getting answers from them.</span> <span id="s201">But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the camp, they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming.</span> <span id="s202">So that the feeling I had is that they all had -- frankly, one of them said that, "We don't know how long you're going to be here."</span> <span id="s203">They were afraid that the Germans might return, and that was the impression I received.</span> <span id="s204">But the funniest thing -- not the funniest but one of the most memorable parts of that particular time that I walked through these barracks, walked around the barracks -- I was walking in back of the barracks just to see what was back there.</span> <span id="s205">And as I walked by, a little window that probably was about one foot square or thereabouts -- I heard a voice, and I turned around and I saw a living skeleton talk to me, was talking to me, and he said, "Thank God the Americans have come."</span> <span id="s206">And that was a funny feeling.</span> <span id="s207">Did you ever talk to a skeleton that talked back?</span> <span id="s208">And that's what I was doing.</span> <span id="s209">Later on I saw mounds of these living -- I mean these skeletons that the Germans left behind them.</span> <span id="s210">That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left, the underground took over, as I said, and they cleaned up a lot of the things.</span> <span id="s211">So that didn't exist very long.</span> <span id="s212">When I left those barracks, I went up to the administration building, which was closer to the front of the camp itself, Buchenwald, and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a specimen bowl that we usually use in labs -- glass specimen bowl that was about -- oh, I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide.</span> <span id="s213">And in there was three sections of skin that had tattoos on them in this vase which was saturated in a liquid of preservative.</span> <span id="s214">And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the camp, they would be lined up.</span> <span id="s215">And the Commander's wife would walk down the line, and wherever she saw anybody with a tattoo she would point to them, and that was the last they saw of the prisoner.</span> <span id="s216">And this is the stories from the prisoners.</span> <span id="s217">And it just happens that what they were doing -- they would get the skin off the people, and they were making lampshades out of them.</span> <span id="s218">These lampshades were in the building there.</span> <span id="s219">I didn't have a chance to get into the building at the time, but my nurse did with other nurses.</span> <span id="s220">And they had witnessed about four or five lampshades that were made out of -- the top of it was made out of the skin of men with tattoos on them for them to give.</span> <span id="s221">One in particular was made for Goehring -- and this is from my nurse that she had seen.</span> <span id="s222">It was made for Goehring, and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from.</span> <span id="s223">That was one of the things that sort of makes you feel very empty inside to think that people would be that barbaric.</span> <span id="s224">The Jews in the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: One moment.</span> <span id="s226">When you came into the camp, you were by yourself with your driver.</span> <span id="s227">A: I was with myself and a driver all the way through it except when I -- pardon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did the rest of your unit join you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No.</span> <span id="s230">Just the two of us.</span> <span id="s231">We walked around ourselves.</span> <span id="s232">There were many people, as you will see, in the camp, but they never came over and tried to start a conversation or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">They'd walk through -- just like I said, I think they were afraid --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: You had said your nurse had seen evidence of skin that was made into a lampshade, and I was wondering --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Oh, she had been in -- she actually got into the building at the time.</span> <span id="s236">That was a week or so later.</span> <span id="s237">So that they had different -- incidentally, Eisenhower dictated an order that every person in Weimar would be taken to the camp to see what the Germans had done there because they denied that they knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s238">In talking to the prisoners, they would tell -- they told me that on weekends they would be paraded through the city, like I mentioned before, and these people would be lined up throwing the tomatoes and garbage and everything else on it.</span> <span id="s239">That was so ridiculous to think that they would deny that they didn't know what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Let's go back.</span> <span id="s241">You left the barracks, and then you said you walked over to the administration building?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Will you repeat that, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s244">You had left the barracks, and then you started to walk.</span> <span id="s245">And you saw a man holding the --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s247">That was at the administration building.</span> <span id="s248">On the right was the barracks for the SS troopers, and on the left was the administrating building itself.</span> <span id="s249">And down on the right there was a wired-off place with irregular -- the wire they use for entrapment.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Barbed wire where they used to put the prisoners in when they first came off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">They'd march them in there, and then they'd pass them in through the building and give them their clothes they were supposed to where and orient them.</span> <span id="s253">And that was right across the street.</span> <span id="s254">Then down from there the road continued on, and there was another section that led to another area which probably was the barracks for doctors or the officers and so forth.</span> <span id="s255">At least that's what I interpreted that to be.</span> <span id="s256">We had nobody to guide us.</span> <span id="s257">We just went through there, as I said.</span> <span id="s258">And on the other side of that was barbed wires, and then the entrance from the back was guarded by two guardhouses on each side of the road so that -- separating it from the camp proper.</span> <span id="s259">Later I found out that the camp was sectioned into three different sections.</span> <span id="s260">They had the small camp, the large camp, and then they had the tent camp they called it.</span> <span id="s261">And that was put up later on for the Polish people when Germany started sending the Polish people into the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s262">Then the administrating building, as I said, was the one we went through.</span> <span id="s263">And the SS troopers had their barracks there on the right side.</span> <span id="s264">And they had the ammunition factories, which I didn't see.</span> <span id="s265">I think they were back in the woods somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What were your thoughts as you were walking through?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Like walking through a different world.</span> <span id="s268">Not used to the tragedies that occurred there.</span> <span id="s269">The pictures of the -- they had these dummies at the entrance showing how they were whipped or clubbed -- actually, it was a club.</span> <span id="s270">They had another one hanging from a limb, which represented hanging from the trees.</span> <span id="s271">And then they had, of course, the furnaces.</span> <span id="s272">You could see those.</span> <span id="s273">Great big stacks, white stacks, back there that you could see the furnaces.</span> <span id="s274">Now I'm trying just to think if there's anything that I can think of --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Well, then you were moving along --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Then we saw the piles of bodies next to the buildings, some of the buildings, of these skeletons of the bodies.</span> <span id="s277">And the expressions on their faces -- what were faces -- were that of horror.</span> <span id="s278">You could just read probably the pain and agony they must have gone in before they died.</span> <span id="s279">The stories that go along with that is that they would be told to go into this building.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">And as they would turn the corner to the stairs leading down to the basement where the furnaces were, they would be clubbed on the head until they were supposed to be unconscious.</span> <span id="s281">And then they'd roll down the stairs and eventually be put into the furnaces.</span> <span id="s282">If I remember right, there's about maybe 10 or 12 furnaces in a row lined up in the basement with each door in the front.</span> <span id="s283">That was at that time I went in they were still warm.</span> <span id="s284">And some of the doors were open, and you could see the remains of the body.</span> <span id="s285">What had happened is on April the 5th the order came down to the SS troopers that they were to evacuate all Jews to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s286">They were trying to clean up the evidence that might be left behind when the Americans came through.</span> <span id="s287">That was the impression I had, and I think that was probably a fact.</span> <span id="s288">So that the next day they started evacuating all the Jews from all the camps.</span> <span id="s289">And then later on when I got back to the States, I was interested enough to look up some of the history that was in the books.</span> <span id="s290">In fact, just more recent than that.</span> <span id="s291">And I found out the reason for what was happening and how it happened.</span> <span id="s292">The underground was sabotaging the orders so that slowing down the evacuation of the people that were to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s293">And it figures in one of the write-ups, recent write-ups, there was about 25,150 people evacuated in that time that met the death penalty.</span> <span id="s294">If they were evacuated to Auschwitz, that was noted to be the entry for the termination which Hitler called the final answer to their problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Can you describe the crematorium in more detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">As I said, the doors of -- several of them were still open, and the crematorium if you call it a crematorium -- I think it was just a murder box -- the entrance would be large enough to take a body and slide it all the way into the flames.</span> <span id="s298">The heat was generated by coal or so below.</span> <span id="s299">That was my impression.</span> <span id="s300">And the remains that were still in there were those that they didn't have a chance to finish.</span> <span id="s301">In fact, the bodies we saw outside were left there only because time did not permit them to put them in the furnaces.</span> <span id="s302">One of the prisoners said that the furnaces were running day and night for almost a week before I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: When you went down into the crematorium, did you go with some prisoners who explained anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Only the question of how they would lead these men into the crematorium.</span> <span id="s305">And that was -- really that was gotten out -- down in the crematorium there was nobody there but myself and my driver.</span> <span id="s306">We were alone down there, and I took these pictures, which we may show, showing the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s307">When we were down there, there was nobody there with us.</span> <span id="s308">So the conversation about what was happening I got after I left the crematorium and was back on the road and talked to some of the prisoners about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What did the crematorium look like from the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: My impression, if I can recall in going back years, was a white building.</span> <span id="s311">It looked like a house really.</span> <span id="s312">A white building.</span> <span id="s313">And all I could see in my mind is the one side of it because I took the picture that I did at that time from that side.</span> <span id="s314">It was well painted.</span> <span id="s315">It looked like a very pleasant house.</span> <span id="s316">I understand the first floor also had the furnace -- not the furnaces -- but the boxes to put them in.</span> <span id="s317">The crematorium.</span> <span id="s318">Both floors were crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: When you went in, did you know what you'd be seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I didn't know what I was going to see, no.</span> <span id="s321">I just followed the course of -- the man told you, "Go in there, and go right down the stairs."</span> <span id="s322">I don't even know who told me that, but it was obvious that's what I did.</span> <span id="s323">The stair was at the end.</span> <span id="s324">Then you'd walk down.</span> <span id="s325">Then the crematorium was immediately -- if you turned right, it was right in front of you.</span> <span id="s326">The face of the opening were toward the side that you came down.</span> <span id="s327">The back was that way.</span> <span id="s328">At the time we went down there, the floors were clean and everything.</span> <span id="s329">They had cleaned up a lot, but I understand it was quite a messy place before.</span> <span id="s330">That's all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: When you came out of the crematorium, then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: When I came out of the crematorium, I continued my walk, which took us down toward the place where the better homes were.</span> <span id="s333">We didn't go in any of them, but we saw them from the outside where probably the doctors or the officers would stay.</span> <span id="s334">And that took in the whole camp.</span> <span id="s335">The administrating compound is what I -- two or three streets down and blocked off by another street going to the left with the barracks with the SS troopers on this side and the barracks on the other side and the wired fences where they put the prisoners when they first came in for registration to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Did you talk to any of the prisoners while you were walking around?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Not while walking.</span> <span id="s338">But I would stop and start a conversation at the time, and during that time they would mention some of the things that happened to the prisoners such as that when they were strapped, there wasn't only -- not strapped but when they were hit with these blows with this -- it was about a two-inch round bat if you'd call it.</span> <span id="s339">And it looked like it was displaying from a tree limb or so because you could still see where places from the limbs of the tree would come out.</span> <span id="s340">It would be jagged.</span> <span id="s341">It wouldn't be smooth.</span> <span id="s342">They would say they would hit those people and sometimes let them stay there for a day or so just so other prisoners would see them.</span> <span id="s343">And by the end of the day that person was swollen up and disfigured tremendously, and many of them wouldn't even get off there alive.</span> <span id="s344">Stringing up was done the same way.</span> <span id="s345">They strung them up in a fashion where their hands were tied up behind them and their head was dropped down so that as a medical man you wondered how the person could survive just in breathing with the weight of the head down.</span> <span id="s346">Again, they would be swollen up laying in the sun for a day or so before they took them down.</span> <span id="s347">And those are the stories that fed back.</span> <span id="s348">The impression was my own as to medically what would happen with the person in that position.</span> <span id="s349">It was a very uncomfortable position to be in.</span> <span id="s350">It in itself would eventually lend itself to death instead of just hanging by the neck, which is quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Did you feel the need to render any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s353">We -- at the time absolutely not.</span> <span id="s354">We couldn't interfere into that.</span> <span id="s355">What we did do is we came -- we -- when I say "we," what I did and probably other doctors -- before I left the camp, the camp started filling up with other doctors or GI's coming into the camp, and the MP's were at the gates, started to be at the gates.</span> <span id="s356">So I got in just ahead of that.</span> <span id="s357">At that time they were instructing the soldiers not to give them any of our K-ration -- which is that sweet candy bar that the soldiers would carry around in case they were on the battlefront and they needed some food.</span> <span id="s358">It was 100 percent energy -- with the idea that if you gave them that, they probably would die because it was too rich.</span> <span id="s359">And this is something we found out in the hospital when the post was done on some of these prisoners that we even received back from our own men that were captured only for two and a half months.</span> <span id="s360">Their stomachs started to shrink down.</span> <span id="s361">And instead of being a typical stomach, it shrunk down to a small -- almost to a tube-like effect, which is interesting to know because I never knew it before I saw it there that the stomach will shrink down.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Besides not giving them food, did you have the urge to help any of them medically?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: That was done by another group.</span> <span id="s364">We were behind the Army, third Army, and our job was to follow the third Army.</span> <span id="s365">We were the hospital that took care of all the casualties behind Blood and Guts, which you know as General Patton.</span> <span id="s366">And our job -- we had to move with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">And General Patton stopped for nothing.</span> <span id="s368">His idea was to go across the continent and get the Germans off into little pockets and let the infantry come back and clean them up.</span> <span id="s369">And that's what we were.</span> <span id="s370">We only saw very little of anybody from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s371">We saw more from the people of Weidar who were unfortunate enough to get involved with some of the prisoners when they were let free and were beaten up.</span> <span id="s372">In some cases a couple of them were hung by trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Towards the end of the time you were in the camp, did the U.S. Army medical personnel come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: They came in.</span> <span id="s375">There was another unit that took care of it.</span> <span id="s376">It wasn't us.</span> <span id="s377">That's all I know about that because we had to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What else did you see that first time in the camp?</span> <span id="s379">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s381">I'm trying to think of -- I saw -- in one case I saw -- one of the prisoners was digging on the ground with a little tiny ax or so, and I couldn't understand what he was digging a hole for.</span> <span id="s382">And I asked -- the prisoner came by, and he said, oh, he's burying his food.</span> <span id="s383">He said they bury the food, and then they felt that we wouldn't be there long.</span> <span id="s384">They wanted to have some food after we left.</span> <span id="s385">And this came right from the soldier.</span> <span id="s386">So he must have had a fact because I couldn't understand why he was doing it at the time.</span> <span id="s387">But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition, and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months, which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the factories to work or to the -- they had a stone mine there that they were digging from.</span> <span id="s388">Stones and so forth.</span> <span id="s389">They were getting labor done cheap by putting these Jews and prisoners to work in their ammunition factories and so forth.</span> <span id="s390">But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet, which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work, and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the camp -- they were eventually put into one of these three buildings there just to be there and die and be burned through the furnaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What were some of the other conversations you had with the prisoners while you were there?</span> <span id="s392">A: That's about all.</span> <span id="s393">They wouldn't talk, most of them.</span> <span id="s394">They didn't go out of their way to talk.</span> <span id="s395">If you talked to them, they would respond.</span> <span id="s396">That's how I got the answers I did.</span> <span id="s397">One other thing is they mentioned that when they would beat these soldiers -- or these prisoners -- or hung them up, they would strip them down nude.</span> <span id="s398">If you look at the bodies that you'll see in these piles, you would see the black and blue marks of bruises on what was left of the skin and so forth.</span> <span id="s399">And I mentioned about the expressions.</span> <span id="s400">And also that the bodies -- if you look at them, you think they all reached the same stage before they died because they all looked so similar in the amount of malnutrition that you see.</span> <span id="s401">And I've seen many people in the hospital that would take them quite a while to reach that stage of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s402">So they weren't killed instantly.</span> <span id="s403">They were dragged on until they were weak enough that they couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s404">And then they'd get diseases, and many of them would commit suicide by themselves, and many of them would die from diseases and malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you know anything about any of the medical experiments that were performed in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s407">They were using medical experiments, and the medical experiments they were using was, one, to study the effect of amputations and how to handle them.</span> <span id="s408">And I'll tell you a little bit about that in a minute.</span> <span id="s409">The other thing was giving them poisons in trying the strengths of the different poisons on people.</span> <span id="s410">And the other thing was using toxins that would irritate the skin like some of our gases do that we were using -- not we were using but the armies use sometimes in wars.</span> <span id="s411">Those are the three or four elements that they were -- some of them.</span> <span id="s412">And I also understand they were experimenting a lot on birth control.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: What's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Sterilization.</span> <span id="s415">You see, the impression I received -- and this, again, was borne out later on -- they at first wanted the Jews to leave Germany, and they did everything to encourage them to leave.</span> <span id="s416">And then eventually in '41 I think -- 11th of '41 or thereabouts -- Hitler decided to kill -- take the final solution.</span> <span id="s417">And that was his order.</span> <span id="s418">And then Auschwitz was one of the places that used gas.</span> <span id="s419">They used cianide gas or carbon monoxide.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: You said they were doing experiments on amputation?</span> <span id="s421">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, I could see why.</span> <span id="s423">I'm just associating what I saw and what I'm putting together.</span> <span id="s424">When we came across Brest and we emptied their hospitals -- which as we took over, we took over hospitals.</span> <span id="s425">And then the responsibility was ours to take care of their people.</span> <span id="s426">And we had probably a football field full with many of the people -- most of the people had amputations.</span> <span id="s427">And we stacked it up at that time to the fact that we had Penicillin, and the Germans only had Sulpha at that time as a drug.</span> <span id="s428">Sulfanilamide.</span> <span id="s429">And Sulfanilamide, of course, wasn't as effective as Penicillin was.</span> <span id="s430">At the time of war you've got to get these people off the battlefield as fast as you can because infection sets in almost immediate when they hit the ground.</span> <span id="s431">In Europe the people used the ground to defecate on and everything else.</span> <span id="s432">They called this fertilizing it.</span> <span id="s433">So you couldn't trust the ground of being clean of bacteria and so forth so that it was necessary to do something.</span> <span id="s434">And the quickest way to prevent infection is to cut off the arm, cut off the leg to prevent it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Let's go back to your visit.</span> <span id="s436">Towards the end of your visit, you said more American soldiers and doctors came in.</span> <span id="s437">What did you say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: We didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s439">They were just as much surprised at what they saw as I was when I came in.</span> <span id="s440">There was nothing to say.</span> <span id="s441">It was so terrible a thing to see masses of people with expressions of agony.</span> <span id="s442">You just got the impression of what it was just by looking.</span> <span id="s443">There was nothing to say.</span> <span id="s444">What can you say?</span> <span id="s445">You feel depressed.</span> <span id="s446">You walk away, and you are convinced -- in fact, you go away with the idea it can't be so.</span> <span id="s447">It's hard to believe and realize what you have seen.</span> <span id="s448">And this is my impression.</span> <span id="s449">In fact, even when I came back to the States, I wouldn't talk of it for the same reason.</span> <span id="s450">I couldn't think that -- maybe I had a dream because the things that you see is so different than human beings are supposed to behave.</span> <span id="s451">And people -- you look at them and say they wouldn't believe it anyway.</span> <span id="s452">And I think a lot of our soldiers did that.</span> <span id="s453">They wanted to forget the horrors of war.</span> <span id="s454">And they'll tell you more about the comedy of war, what happens that's a little bit amusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How long were you in the camp at that visit?</span> <span id="s456">A: The camp Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: How many hours were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: About three hours.</span> <span id="s459">Three to four hours.</span> <span id="s460">Q: And then you left with your driver?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I left and went back to the unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Did you report what you saw to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I told the officers where we stayed what I saw.</span> <span id="s464">And within the next day or so, the colonel gave permission for the nurses and so forth to have a vehicle so they could go and see it too.</span> <span id="s465">And the girls would go off five at a time or so and go down in there and go through the camp too.</span> <span id="s466">As I said, Eisenhower dictated that the people of the city will be taken in there, and they made everybody in the city go through the camp to see what the Germans were doing because they kept on saying they didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s467">And that's about all of the things that I can remember.</span> <span id="s468">And, as I say, a lot of things probably I saw I don't remember because I blocked them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: As you say, when you left, you saw other American soldiers coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: When I left, there were other soldiers in the camp that weren't there when I first went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: But you did not speak to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No.</span> <span id="s473">I mean, it's like going out of the funeral home.</span> <span id="s474">You didn't look for conversation yourself.</span> <span id="s475">You're depressed and feeling alone.</span> <span id="s476">You just want to -- you're lost in your own feelings.</span> <span id="s477">You don't feel like talking.</span> <span id="s478">If anything, you get a lump in your throat.</span> <span id="s479">You're very depressed.</span> <span id="s480">It leaves you not only depressed, but you have nightmares for a few days after about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Especially the one where I told you where I turned around and here was a skeleton talking to me.</span> <span id="s482">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s483">The skeleton that talked to me was exactly the same as the ones -- the piles of them.</span> <span id="s484">So what can you say?</span> <span id="s485">There are no words to express the tragedies of war.</span> <span id="s486">There are absolutely no words.</span> <span id="s487">I saw a lot of it right on the battlefield for that matter with dead soldiers all over the field and crazy things.</span> <span id="s488">You don't try to remember those things.</span> <span id="s489">It's not anything pleasant to see especially as a doctor where you'd like to give help and so forth, and there's nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s490">This is the after effect.</span> <span id="s491">And you walk away the same as any person.</span> <span id="s492">You walk away and say, "What's going to become of these people?"</span> <span id="s493">As it turned out, the people that were in the last two barracks that I mentioned probably died right there without going any further.</span> <span id="s494">Even though we'd do what we could for them, we couldn't do enough.</span> <span id="s495">When I say "we," I'm talking about the medical part of the Army.</span> <span id="s496">Not our unit but whoever took care of them.</span> <span id="s497">We got papers over there, newspapers, from the different units which would communicate back and forth and give us an idea of what we would be seeing so that we knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: We're going to have to stop the tape right at this moment.</span> <span id="s499">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: They're just going to change the tape.</span> <span id="s503">Did you say you remembered another experience in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s505">I started to say something about that.</span> <span id="s506">One of the pictures I've taken -- Do you want me to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: -- where these prisoners were lying in this room on big mattresses and also sleeping bags which we know weren't theirs and they probably got it from the SS troopers.</span> <span id="s509">But to them it was not like lying on the dirt and stuff in their own camp.</span> <span id="s510">They told us their places were terrible.</span> <span id="s511">Especially some of the prisoners got into very dirty areas where they would be sleeping and so forth.</span> <span id="s512">The sanitation of the camp was terrible back in the camps themselves, and that might not have been just at the very end stages.</span> <span id="s513">I don't know what it was when they were functioning.</span> <span id="s514">I don't think they could function in such a dirty place.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: You said you went back to your headquarters, and then how long did you stay there at that location?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Probably at the most a day or two.</span> <span id="s517">I think we moved.</span> <span id="s518">On the 14th or 15th I think we moved out of that place and then on to the next place, which was a city Wieden (phonetic) I think.</span> <span id="s519">Wieden or something like that.</span> <span id="s520">It was barracks there.</span> <span id="s521">There we stayed only three or four days and then went forward again.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did you encounter any other camps or detention places?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No.</span> <span id="s524">From there on we were too busy taking care of -- we didn't get anywhere.</span> <span id="s525">I mean I don't think we came near camps.</span> <span id="s526">We might have.</span> <span id="s527">It just happened that this one we happened to be the first group that was probably close enough to the camp to be affected by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So then you just continued to move?</span> <span id="s529">What were your duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: From there on we were just taking care of our soldiers and prisoners and so forth.</span> <span id="s531">But we were busy 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s532">At least 12.</span> <span id="s533">And even then after that during the Bulge, most of us worked on 14, 15 hours.</span> <span id="s534">Incidentally, one of the prisoners mentioned that the Jews were given unusual cruelty -- they were very cruel treating the Jewish people there and that they would make them work in these quarries 15 and 16 and 20 hours.</span> <span id="s535">I don't know.</span> <span id="s536">They would make them work a long time.</span> <span id="s537">This was just mentioned.</span> <span id="s538">That's all.</span> <span id="s539">How it came up I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: This was told to you when you were in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: This was told to you when you were in Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s543">What you just said about the treatment of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, we -- I'm trying to figure out where I heard of that in general.</span> <span id="s545">I think we even got that before we got into the war.</span> <span id="s546">I think we got it in our own papers probably.</span> <span id="s547">And that might influence the impression and probably stimulated the question and probably all they were confirming what we probably already suspected.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: What was your itinerary for the rest of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well, we followed the German Army -- I mean the -- chasing the German Army across Europe.</span> <span id="s550">And then at Bastogne the Germ -- the counterattack and the Bulge -- you probably read about the Bulge.</span> <span id="s551">And we survived that.</span> <span id="s552">And then went on to Regensburg where the war ended, and that's where armistice was.</span> <span id="s553">From Regensburg we moved back into Wurzburg where we for the first time were able to get into a hospital and use the hospital of the Germans, which was well taken care of.</span> <span id="s554">It was a hospital with clean beds and everything else, and the instruments we used were most modern and everything.</span> <span id="s555">But that was after the war.</span> <span id="s556">Then from there on, of course, we waited for the time when we were to go out -- go back -- and many of us were scheduled to go to Japan at that time, and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s557">I was one of the younger officers.</span> <span id="s558">I'm not young now, but then I was.</span> <span id="s559">And finally Japan gave up before we were moved.</span> <span id="s560">So I got back into the States on New Year's 1946 and went back and continued my residency at the hospital that I was working before, Mount Carmen Mercy Hospital, (phonetic) and then got involved in industrial medicine and became the medical director of American Motors for 38 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Let's talk a little bit about how the war, your experiences, affected you, your experience at Buchenwald affected you.</span> <span id="s562">Your thoughts as a medical professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: You never used it.</span> <span id="s564">I never used it.</span> <span id="s565">In my experience that I had in the war doing almost around 3,000 operations, which many surgeons never see in a lifetime, the experience I obtained there was not recognized by the surgical specialty group.</span> <span id="s566">So we never used it.</span> <span id="s567">We just -- it's something you put aside.</span> <span id="s568">It worked out you learned a lot of things doing that type of surgery.</span> <span id="s569">It's traumatic surgery, and it came in useful when I got into industrial medicine.</span> <span id="s570">The knowledge that you obtain by experience is something greater than any book can learn you -- teach you.</span> <span id="s571">So that it was there, but you didn't recall it yourself.</span> <span id="s572">It just would pop up every now and then, something that you did before.</span> <span id="s573">But you never talked about the war.</span> <span id="s574">I never did.</span> <span id="s575">I'd be the last one to sit in a group -- and they'd be talking about different things -- to say anything about the war.</span> <span id="s576">To me it's like you pull a shade down and say that's part of the life you -- it isn't pleasant to remember.</span> <span id="s577">None of it.</span> <span id="s578">The tragedies in war are something you don't talk about.</span> <span id="s579">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s580">I wouldn't be talking here now if it wasn't for my darling daughter who insisted I -- and my nephew.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: What lasting effects do you think your experience at Buchenwald had on you emotionally, intellectually?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Well, did you ever see a movie that was very impressive and many years later you recall different incidents of what you've seen?</span> <span id="s583">That's the thing of it.</span> <span id="s584">You never forget about them.</span> <span id="s585">They're always in the back of your mind.</span> <span id="s586">The only thing is sometimes they're stimulated by something that happens.</span> <span id="s587">And you say, "Gee, I could remember this."</span> <span id="s588">But you don't dwell on it or go out and say, "Well, I think I'll talk to this and that party about the war and tell them all the things I did" because you can't believe half the stuff yourself.</span> <span id="s589">It's such an unreal experience to a person who goes through the war.</span> <span id="s590">People that talk the most are the ones who see the least because many of my doctor friends who were with me in the same unit -- we never discussed the war.</span> <span id="s591">We will discuss the comedy like you run into situations that you experienced during the war when you're visiting Paris or something like that, but you don't talk about death and murder and torture and the pain that -- it's amazing.</span> <span id="s592">I saw people walk into the hospital with both legs shot out from under them, but they were walking on the legs, and both the femurs were broken.</span> <span id="s593">I've seen fellows come in with a shell hole that went up the back, went through the tin and went around the protecting helmet and out.</span> <span id="s594">Miracles.</span> <span id="s595">You don't know -- the craziest things happen.</span> <span id="s596">So it becomes a world of thinking of reality and what doesn't seem so real.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Did your experience at Buchenwald have a particular message to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s599">I sit down, and sometimes I get very, very mad of some person who tries to say that, oh, that didn't exist.</span> <span id="s600">But you don't try to correct them because they're too dumb to realize it.</span> <span id="s601">And besides it's hard for you to appreciate what you saw.</span> <span id="s602">It isn't appreciation, anyway, but it's just a feeling.</span> <span id="s603">There's no sense of talking about something that isn't pleasant to talk about.</span> <span id="s604">I think even talking here is not a -- I shouldn't say this, but I'll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s605">It isn't anything pleasing to me.</span> <span id="s606">It's against what I usually do.</span> <span id="s607">I don't talk about it.</span> <span id="s608">In fact, I've had many people ask me about it, and I don't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s609">And that's my attitude.</span> <span id="s610">And as a corporate medical director of a large corporation, I don't think even half of them even knew I was in the war.</span> <span id="s611">Not half.</span> <span id="s612">I don't think any of them knew I was in the war.</span> <span id="s613">That's how much I talked about it.</span> <span id="s614">Even today I'm on the staff -- I was on the staff and still am on the staff -- but as an old man you have to retire a little bit.</span> <span id="s615">I don't think many of the doctors I associated with know my experiences because you don't talk about unpleasant things.</span> <span id="s616">You try to -- the mind blocks out.</span> <span id="s617">Thank God for that.</span> <span id="s618">And that's in real life too.</span> <span id="s619">The same way with people that have miserable deaths and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No.</span> <span id="s622">But I'd like to add I think I've about out-talked myself.</span> <span id="s623">I appreciate your patience.</span> <span id="s624">Q: Thank you very much on behalf of the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: When I leave, I have a choking feeling sometimes like now because it just leaves you that way, depressed.</span> <span id="s626">That's it.</span> <span id="s627">( Commenting on the pictures )</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: This was inside of one of the three barracks that I first saw and explained when I came into the camp.</span> <span id="s629">And what you see here is the loose squares that were made for three, four people to sleep in and ended up sometimes sleeping as many as twelve.</span> <span id="s630">And the fellows that are sitting on it are probably very new prisoners because they haven't lost any weight or they don't even look ragged.</span> <span id="s631">And you can see that's about what it shows.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Now they're going to put up another picture.</span> <span id="s633">Then when I tell you, just where it is, what it is.</span> <span id="s634">A: And keep it brief.</span> <span id="s635">Just to the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Can you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Will you describe to me -- A: Is that a bunch of --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: It's like an open area --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: And a bunch of men walking out in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s641">Q: Just where it is, what it is.</span> <span id="s642">But wait until I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: That's a picture walking down the street in front of the administration compound.</span> <span id="s644">On the right side you see the barracks of the SS troopers.</span> <span id="s645">On the left is part of the administration building where the camp officials would stay.</span> <span id="s646">And people are just walking around there freely with no worry about being stopped.</span> <span id="s647">So they're all prisoners of war -- I mean prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Are their clothes hanging on a clothesline?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s650">That must have been quite a novelty for them to get some clean clothes.</span> <span id="s651">We don't know where they got it, but they got it in the picture there.</span> <span id="s652">I can't tell you how they got it except that I think what they did is get it out of the SS troopers' barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Now they're going to put up another picture.</span> <span id="s654">Can you see that?</span> <span id="s655">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s656">You can look at this picture, and you'll see --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s658">You're able to see that?</span> <span id="s659">A: It's okay.</span> <span id="s660">I can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Where it is, what it is -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s662">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: This is a picture of a man, one of the prisoners, holding up a specimen bottle that has three strips of tattoo, the skin that was cut off the bodies of the prisoners that gave their life for that practically.</span> <span id="s664">And these are the type things that they would sew into the lamps that they were making as part of the lamp, the top part.</span> <span id="s665">There were many lamps made.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: They're going to change.</span> <span id="s667">Do you recognize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s669">If you look closely here, you'll see a man digging on the right -- is that right?</span> <span id="s670">Do you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: -- with an ax.</span> <span id="s673">And on the left is a barbed-wire fence where the people when they were brought in from the trains and the train tracks and everything were back in the camp, they were put in these cages for a while until they were given where they're supposed to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Questioning why that man was digging, the answer I got was that he was just burying food because they didn't believe that the Americans were going to be there very long and the Germans would be back.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: We're going to put a fresh picture there.</span> <span id="s676">Can you see that?</span> <span id="s677">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s678">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Wait, wait, wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Oh, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You're able to see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s683">This is a picture of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s684">And if you look closely, you'll notice that there are bones within the opening of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s685">I estimated that there were 12 of these crematoriums right next to each other, and three or four of them had their doors open, and each one of them showed a similar picture that you're seeing here.</span> <span id="s686">These are the remains of people who have been cremated.</span> <span id="s687">( New picture )</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: That's a picture of the same thing?</span> <span id="s689">Q: It's another angle.</span> <span id="s690">It's open doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: This is another view of several other crematoriums.</span> <span id="s692">If you look back down if you can, it fades out, but you could see the doors open and two or three of them behind that.</span> <span id="s693">When I was down there, it was still warm, and they were open to cool off.</span> <span id="s694">And there's bones in every one of those representing the remains.</span> <span id="s695">( New picture )</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Can you tell me what I'm looking at?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Well, he's going to enlarge it.</span> <span id="s698">I'm not quite sure yet.</span> <span id="s699">A: Can I talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: If you'd just give me a little of a hint of what I'm looking at.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: You won't be asked to go until you're sure of what it is.</span> <span id="s703">He's trying to adjust.</span> <span id="s704">A: I studied these, but I have to recall what I saw under the magnification I used.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: This is one of these smaller photographs that you brought in, and he's going to try and focus it.</span> <span id="s706">You won't have to explain it until --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: You give me a little hint as to what you see.</span> <span id="s708">Q: I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s709">I think I see a Jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: A front door where a bunch of people are coming in and a Jeep on the right side?</span> <span id="s711">Q: There's a Jeep on the right.</span> <span id="s712">Do you know what this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s714">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: This is a picture of the entrance to the camp from the front to the back.</span> <span id="s717">If the prisoners were coming back in the camp later in the afternoon, most of them would go out of the camp, walk around and come back.</span> <span id="s718">I just happened to come in and see this when they were coming back into the camp.</span> <span id="s719">I think they were all facing this way.</span> <span id="s720">And if you look in the picture, you'll see that one of them showed an MP in there.</span> <span id="s721">So it was later in the day when the MP started to take over, "MP" being a military policeman of the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: They're going to put in another picture.</span> <span id="s723">Okay.</span> <span id="s724">This is another one of the smaller pictures.</span> <span id="s725">A: A bunch of men together walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: They're pushing like a wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Do you remember what this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: This is a picture of a group of men pushing a cart, and on the cart, if you could see, there is -- it looks like a large garbage pail, five-gallon garbage pail, but that's what they used to make their soup in.</span> <span id="s730">And this is lunchtime, and they were pushing it down by the administration compound buildings where the prisoners would come up and got a bowl of soup or so.</span> <span id="s731">Could I talk to you?</span> <span id="s732">Actually, it's not a garbage pail.</span> <span id="s733">It's a 25- or 50-gallon -- it looks like a big garbage pail, but they used it to put the soup in.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: We just wanted to thank you again for coming and doing this and tell you how much we appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span
