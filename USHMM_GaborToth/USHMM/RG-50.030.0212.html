Poland up till '39, in 19...Sarny as I mentioned, in 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: tell us a little bit about your life before '39 when the trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: When the trouble start...before the trouble started, I went to school.</span> <span id="s23">I was a student with my plans.</span> <span id="s24">I went to school with my plans and I was toying with the idea of being some professional, a teacher or a doctor or lawyer, but this was out of my reach because you had to go to the University at that time, but this, is far-fetched, and I uh...but this was my plans at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And you were the oldest of a family of three?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was...yes.</span> <span id="s27">We...I was the oldest of a family of four.</span> <span id="s28">Q: Four?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes, two survived, my sister and myself survived.</span> <span id="s30">My little brother who was at that time six, my

began to happen after '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: After '39, still life proceeded as, as normal, because the Soviets came in and my country was divided, so my -- Sarny fell in into the Soviets, and so I proceeded.</span> <span id="s33">I went to school.</span> <span id="s34">You know, there were different unpleasantry happened and let's say, for instance, they took a lot of people avek-- away to Siberia, because they were rich, they were anti- Communist, were afraid, and it's a funny situation because...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">1 away (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: They took a lot of Jews, deport them to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: A lot...to Siberia...Jews, Poles, because they said they are not you know, nenadezhnye not sympathetic to the government or they were afraid they will do some damage.</span> <span id="s38">Yes.</span> <span id="s39">And the funny part and everybody...it was a disaster at that time.</span> <span id="s40">Everybody thought, you know, it's terrible, and it happened that those people...</span></p> <p><span id="s41">01:03:35</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Didn't realize that it saved them.</span> <span id="s43">A: That saved their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So then life went on the same, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: And then I went to school and life proceeded as usual, and then all of a sudden we knew that they had a pact with Germany.</span> <span id="s46">The Russians, at that time in 1941, we know it from history, and all of a sudden in 1941, with no warning at all, I found out in the morning that the war started, that Germany not attacked, attacked with no warning, with nothing.</span> <span id="s47">In my coun-- my, my city, my region, Poland was over-run within a week, and the nightmare started.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: The nightmare?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s50">They – the first decree came out that told the Jews must come into the...must come in one...in one assigned... assigned place in the city.</span> <span id="s51">We were living at that time about fifteen kilometers from town.</span> <span id="s52">We had a grocery down there, that little town called Rudnya.</span> <span id="s53">There was three kilometers from that little place was a, a, a railroad station where I used to come to town and from town, and they asked all of us to come into town, and we predicted unpleasantry right then and then, because we heard already news that the Germans are killing and doing things and my father didn't want it to believe at that time.</span> <span id="s54">He spoke a fluent German.</span> <span id="s55">He was an interpreter assigned during the first World War.</span> <span id="s56">A German...he's fluent in.</span> <span id="s57">He said it couldn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What do you mean with the German?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: It couldn't believe...he said they are cultured people that couldn't believe this propaganda, but it happened.</span> <span id="s60">We...they hoarded in, in together and this was my first experience.</span> <span id="s61">I didn't know what a ghetto was.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: You came there with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">2 unreliable (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes, with the family and I'll describe you the house we lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s65">We were...we weren't...we...</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: You were now asked to go into a ghetto?</span> <span id="s67">A: Into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s70">This assigned was not yet a ghetto.</span> <span id="s71">It was not yet fenced in but they said “This, this and this street you can occupy.</span> <span id="s72">You can go in.”</span> <span id="s73">We find our uh...we find a place down there with our relatives and there were three rooms and a kitchen and a fourth room like to walk in from the street.</span> <span id="s74">And I'll describe you how many people lived down there.</span> <span id="s75">There was the...the...the man and the lady of the house.</span> <span id="s76">They were Burko, also, and they have two children and they were four.</span> <span id="s77">Now we were mother and father and us four, so we were six, all in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:06:39</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: A lot of people were, were pushed into this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s81">Were pushed into this place, and it was not the worst of, of things.</span> <span id="s82">Q: No.</span> <span id="s83">So then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Then at night we used to heard uh, you know, it was...we were right...right close to the entrance to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s85">It was an entrance, a gate and by the gate we used to hear at night, we used to hear trucks coming in or out.</span> <span id="s86">We had a curfew.</span> <span id="s87">The Jews had a curfew, by eight o'clock, nobody was allowed, but the...you know, there was a death sentence.</span> <span id="s88">If somebody was caught outside strolling around or wandering around, he was shot.</span> <span id="s89">There was no less punishment than that, but the non-Jews, the Christian population, had a right to go in and out from the ghetto at will.</span> <span id="s90">And we used to hear at night a truck coming in, and our heart used to pound and scared.</span> <span id="s91">And I remember this was a girl with me, a girl by the name of Zelda.</span> <span id="s92">She was a very talented girl.</span> <span id="s93">She wrote poetry at that time, and she used...she wore a cast.</span> <span id="s94">She had a cast on her leg.</span> <span id="s95">You know what she used to tell me...”Brenda, you are...you are so agile.</span> <span id="s96">You are – you, you know.</span> <span id="s97">And something’s...” yes...yes...living with me in the same house, in the same house.</span> <span id="s98">She said “You know, when something will happen,” because we didn't know the truck will come to pick up some people or the truck came in just to go home, whatever this Christian this...this man was living.</span> <span id="s99">She said “you will be able to run, but not me.”</span> <span id="s100">She said “I have a cast and I'll be left behind.”</span> <span id="s101">And life got...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: I don’t hear you right.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s104">Life was tighter and tighter every day.</span> <span id="s105">Decree after decree used to come out, and for instance, they all of a sudden decided they wanted fifteen kilogram of gold.</span> <span id="s106">They decided we had to wear...to bring it to the Judenrat, to the Judenrat is our own govern...govern...thing.</span> <span id="s107">It was like a puppet government for ourselves, just for the for the Germans to come and to ask them what they wanted, or for instance, furs were...they decided that we, we have to give and everybody has to bring their furs up to the...any warm clothing.</span> <span id="s108">We did not at the time, but now we understand that everything went to the front because it was very cold, till the day...and every day was terrible news coming into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s109">Nobody wanted to believe.</span> <span id="s110">We said “We are...we are good people.</span> <span id="s111">Why would they do it?”</span> <span id="s112">And I remember there was one man who was sitting down there on the side and he said, “Our time didn't come yet.”</span> <span id="s113">I didn't like it at that time, whatever he said...yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">01:09:34 And, and the day came.</span> <span id="s115">The day came.</span> <span id="s116">They surrounded our ghetto and it wasn't over.</span> <span id="s117">It was two weeks I remember before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s118">They surrounded our ghetto, police, because...police and Germans and the terrible news came in.</span> <span id="s119">We saw it right away that something horrible is happening.</span> <span id="s120">People start running.</span> <span id="s121">Bunches of people start running from one street to the other one.</span> <span id="s122">And...and the Ukrainian police, the collaborators of the Germans and the Germans used to fire at us like they were too smart and, and laugh like it would be some kind some kind of game, some kind of joke, some not real.</span> <span id="s123">My mother at that time in the...in the late afternoon, my mother came up to me.</span> <span id="s124">She said, “Brenda, you must go into hiding.”</span> <span id="s125">I said “Why?”</span> <span id="s126">I said.</span> <span id="s127">“You must go into hiding.</span> <span id="s128">There is a place at my uncle's house and, and at least one of us...we don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s129">You have to go down there.”</span> <span id="s130">I didn't want to in the beginning, but then she persisted and I went along with her plan.</span> <span id="s131">I went down there and if you want it I'll describe this the, the hiding place.</span> <span id="s132">Overnight I stayed down there and what did I find.</span> <span id="s133">It was in a barn.</span> <span id="s134">They lived right by the gate of the...by the...not by the gate but by the fence of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s135">A few jumped over the fence.</span> <span id="s136">You were over...over...out of the ghetto, out of the peri— the, the...whatever the ghetto was...was...the border.</span> <span id="s137">In this in this barn where they had a cow, there was a double...a double wall was erected and down there was underneath was a little opening.</span> <span id="s138">You just opened this thing.</span> <span id="s139">You went in and if you walked into the barn, you didn't know nothing, because people crawled in down there, and what did I find down there behind...behind.</span> <span id="s140">I find down there may be about eight to ten people was sitting, one next to the other.</span> <span id="s141">And especially I remember this old lady, this eighty year old lady, but she did not...maybe she was older...an old...a, a really old...and she...Mr. Lurja, Mrs. Lurja was her name.</span> <span id="s142">She was a very nice lady, and she didn't understand what it's all about.</span> <span id="s143">She was asking us questions.</span> <span id="s144">We didn't know no answers for her to give.</span> <span id="s145">“What's going on?</span> <span id="s146">What's happening?”</span> <span id="s147">And we lived through the night when we heard that the youth of the ghetto wanted to actually to burn the ghetto.</span> <span id="s148">If somebody tipped of the Germans that the ghetto, that, that that's the plan of some of the youth of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s149">Right away they surrounded with, with fire, with the fire, with, with fire, with the fire, with fire department, with the...yes...and they surrounded the...in case of the ghetto will start burning, they will be able to...they will be able to...the fire...</span></p> <p><span id="s150">01:12:39</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Put it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Put it out, the fire.</span> <span id="s153">And in the morning, we heard shots in the morning, and at night, during the night, we wanted actually to escape, but the plan didn't materialize.</span> <span id="s154">We went back into hiding and in the morning we send out the son of this old lady, Mr. Lurja.</span> <span id="s155">He was a very respectable, nice man.</span> <span id="s156">He was a business man.</span> <span id="s157">We sent him out to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s158">When he went in into the town, into town, into the whatever, into the, the town the whatever everybody has been gathered.</span> <span id="s159">He came back running.</span> <span id="s160">He said, “Everybody must go out from that from, from hiding.</span> <span id="s161">If anybody will be caught, they will be shot on the spot.”</span> <span id="s162">At that time we didn't know the verdict was the same for the people who were hiding or the people who went down there.</span> <span id="s163">I for my part, I decided to leave and to go and meet up with my parents.</span> <span id="s164">I went.</span> <span id="s165">I met up with my parents, and I remember when we walked out from the house, and this is...this, is something that stands out in my mind, and there's the lady who closed the shutters across from us, from our house, and she said “I hope my hands don't come back and open the shutters again.”</span> <span id="s166">And we came to the...to the clearing...it was like a clearing, where everybody gathered up there.</span> <span id="s167">It was a big...right by the gate of the ghetto, and what did I find down then there?</span> <span id="s168">I find all, all the people, a lot of people gathered down there.</span> <span id="s169">My mother with our family.</span> <span id="s170">She had something in her hand, a little...some food, whatever not, and there was this German standing down there with a red face.</span> <span id="s171">He must have been drunk.</span> <span id="s172">It was early in the morning, about ten o'clock, and he had a list of names and calling them out alphabetically, and then putting them in groups, taking them behind the, the, the gate and there surrounded, they were surrounded right away by police, by Ukrainian police who were collaborators with the Germans and the Germans and they were taken away.</span> <span id="s173">If my name was Szyr, I was almost to the end to leave the ghetto, and then he, he called out names and who was not present he, he, he, he marked it off with a pencil.</span> <span id="s174">We didn't know at that time what, what, what was the reason, but then we find out.</span> <span id="s175">He wanted to find out how many Jews still remained and how many they have to still go after them.</span> <span id="s176">And there was this little boy.</span> <span id="s177">He was sitting...his parents are already taken.</span> <span id="s178">He was sitting and crying and the German was ready for him.</span> <span id="s179">He was ready with his pistol.</span> <span id="s180">We grabbed this little kid and we dragged him along with us, and we dragged him along in our group when we went and I remember this German with this arm band, and he had a white skeleton.</span> <span id="s181">They were the Sonderkommando</span></p> <p><span id="s182">01:15:46 3 special commando (German); Nazi units assigned to liquidate targeted populations, such as Jews, within the territory of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: You went where, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: At this point they took our group and they were taking us, and we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s185">We didn't know where.</span> <span id="s186">And then one brave lady, she came up to this German.</span> <span id="s187">She asked him, “Where are you taking us?”</span> <span id="s188">He said, “We are taking you a working camp.”</span> <span id="s189">Just so not to scare us at that moment, and she came with this news, and they took us in the outskirts of our town, and there they pushed in, in a camp.</span> <span id="s190">That was...when I came it was during in the day time.</span> <span id="s191">It was double barbed wired.</span> <span id="s192">It was in a valley not far from the school where I went to school, near, I remember, the church.</span> <span id="s193">The Catholic church was right on the hill standing, and in this valley, this was erected with three barracks, a toilet for men and for women in the middle, and there were Germans and Ukrainian, a German-Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">When we came down there, we saw already people were killed, laying by the...by the barbed wire, and we didn't know what it's all about, but then we find out first that they brought in all the people from the small towns, all surrounding Sarny.</span> <span id="s195">Now I'm speaking now first between 16, between close to 17,000 people were hoarded in, down there in this enclosure, and also a group of gypsies afterwards came.</span> <span id="s196">In this enclosure when they...we came in, and we find out what's going on, I start running around.</span> <span id="s197">We saw the disaster is already happening.</span> <span id="s198">We saw the Germans on the hill, sitting with the machine guns, and then all of a sudden came through all the camp that we are going to cut the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s199">We'll try to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Who's going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: One guy who had electric...electric...he was an electrician.</span> <span id="s202">He was working...one of the Jewish guys who smuggled in a elect-- electric clipper, electric barbed wire clipper.</span> <span id="s203">He smuggled them with him, and then what this Migdal and I will never forget him.</span> <span id="s204">This Migdal was tall and handsome and blond.</span> <span id="s205">He looked more German than any of the Germans I saw around down there standing with the machine guns, but the only...his crime was because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s206">So I knew that.</span> <span id="s207">I went up to my mother.</span> <span id="s208">My mother stood on the hill down there looking at the machine guns and she says, “came up.”</span> <span id="s209">I said, “Mother, I'll run.”</span> <span id="s210">She said -- oh, God, I'm sorry – “Where,” she said, “is the decency of the world.”</span></p> <p><span id="s211">01:18:45</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: In the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: “Where is the decency of the world?”</span> <span id="s214">that was Mom.</span> <span id="s215">And she said, “When you remain alive, remember, never, never forget.”</span> <span id="s216">I’m sorry -- and that's why -- I'm a tough lady, so I’m okay.</span> <span id="s217">I – and, and she said, “Never, never forget.”</span> <span id="s218">And that's maybe I'm here today to tell my story.</span> <span id="s219">And then and there I made my pledge, “If I'll survive, I can go from this hell, I'll fight.</span> <span id="s220">I'll fight, and if I'll have to die, I'll die with a gun in my hands.”</span> <span id="s221">I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">The barbed wire was cut.</span> <span id="s223">I went up to, to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s224">He put his hands on my head and he blessed me.</span> <span id="s225">He said, “God should help you.”</span> <span id="s226">They perished, of course.</span> <span id="s227">I'm speaking from my immediate family of 80 plus all the people I already mentioned before.</span> <span id="s228">From the big fire we run out.</span> <span id="s229">I ran to the first...my first instinct told me...and there was this, this nice German, and I must mention about him.</span> <span id="s230">There was one German who was standing with this gun against us and in this sea of hate, this was still a nice human being.</span> <span id="s231">He was not from the from, the from their party.</span> <span id="s232">He was one of the guys who they asked him to stand with the gun, and, and he stood down there.</span> <span id="s233">He was in his 50s, my father's age at that time, and I remember my friend, my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s234">I saw her at that time just for the first time.</span> <span id="s235">She went up close to him.</span> <span id="s236">He had the right...he had the right at that time to kill her, and I stood right behind her, and he grabbed his head.</span> <span id="s237">He said, “Oh my God, I have a daughter your age.</span> <span id="s238">What they are doing to you?”</span> <span id="s239">And he yelled to us and he said, “You dummy JudenYou dummy, run from here.</span> <span id="s240">They are going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s241">But we knew already and that's why the plan when the barbed wire was cut, cut by that and then we ran out.</span> <span id="s242">We went...the first instant my mother saw me going behind the barbed wire, she threw my sister over, and she ran behind me.</span> <span id="s243">My first instinct was to go to a Christian family we knew over there.</span> <span id="s244">We were friends with them.</span> <span id="s245">And I remember, and this, is also a standout in my mind forever...I went up from there to their house...it was not far.</span> <span id="s246">They could hear the shots.</span> <span id="s247">They could hear the yells even.</span> <span id="s248">I went up to them and I said, “Hide me.”</span> <span id="s249">She said, “No, I don't have -- I'm afraid.”</span> <span id="s250">I could understand that.</span> <span id="s251">And then was a fenced in little yard.</span> <span id="s252">I opened this fenced in...the, the, the gate, and there was her husband with a whole bunch of Poles standing and telling jokes, and this is...I wanted to make it a parallel.</span> <span id="s253">Their friends have been murdered.</span> <span id="s254">They are telling jokes and when they saw me and my sister standing down there, they covered, they stood, they, they got white in their faces and they saw the reality of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:21:46 We went from there...we joined...we went over and it was easier now to, to explain than it was.</span> <span id="s256">I'm...I..</span> <span id="s257">.</span> <span id="s258">I lost my sister.</span> <span id="s259">In the meantime I went over myself.</span> <span id="s260">I went to the village where my grandparents lived and I knew some of the peasant people who were very nice.</span> <span id="s261">My first thing was to go this neighbor.</span> <span id="s262">I went to the neighbor, and when I walked into this house of that neighbor, this Ukrainian neighbor, I find my sister in there, and I find my uncle.</span> <span id="s263">And this, is like a..</span> <span id="s264">.</span> <span id="s265">like, you know, like fantasy, like, like, like a..</span> <span

met.</span> <span id="s270">From that point...yes...from that point we went and we met up with Szymon'sgroup.</span> <span id="s271">We were down there for a little while when we stayed with this guy.</span> <span id="s272">Then I wore...I..</span> <span id="s273">.</span> <span id="s274">he gave me some clothing of a Ukrainian...yeah, looked like a peasant girl, yes, and from there we went

leaving Szymon – yes?</span> <span id="s281">Can you tell us who Szymon was and what happened then after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: After that.</span> <span id="s283">Now Szymon -- yes, Szymon was a friend of our family.</span> <span id="s284">He was a business man before the war and he used to come once in a while and sell parents and I found out through some other village people that this Szymon escaped.</span> <span id="s285">He actually escaped from the grave where they killed -- almost without clothes, and they gave him clothes in one of the villages when he escaped, and he went into the deep woods down there, into White Russia, so I went down there and I met up and it was not an easy task, you know.</span> <span id="s286">They didn't wanted to take me and they said a bigger group is, is dan-- more danger and but anyway I, Insisted and I said, “I'm going to wait for Szymon and if Szymon will tell me I should go, Szymon will decide my fate.”</span> <span id="s287">I stayed.</span> <span id="s288">Szymon came in the evening.</span> <span id="s289">When he saw us, I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s290">He cried and he said, “They are like my kids and they are going to stay here and whatever will be us will be with them,” and he was like the law, and this was...he start organizing like ammunition.</span> <span id="s291">He knew the peasant people down there.</span> <span id="s292">They start bringing us news what's going on in the front and whatever he and another guy by that name of Olszanski--</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: You were now living in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Living in the woods.</span> <span id="s295">He used to take us from place...for instance, we never stayed in one place because he knew there's some danger to stay in one place because they can get us, so he used to transfer us from, from one from one destination to another one...they should...we shouldn't be, be caught on the same spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: And we...at that time, we didn't do nothing special, but then this, this...if I may mention this teacher came into town, and the teacher was sent by the Germans and all of a sudden the Germans were preoccupied to make to make a school in the deep woods, from the...far away from town.</span> <span id="s298">To us it was right away suspicious because they were not preoccupied, the Germans with that.</span> <span id="s299">They were preoccupied with the war and killing as many people as many they could, and all of a sudden we saw this stranger came to the town and start asking questions and start looking around and then disappearing, going back to this, to this, to this Karasin.</span> <span id="s300">We are now in the woods, deep in the woods, deep in the woods, and he...not to our camp but he came to the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">01:26:26</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Near the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Near the camp.</span> <span id="s304">It was not exactly a camp, but it was a..</span> <span id="s305">.</span> <span id="s306">where a gathering of people...where we used to stay in the woods like the Boy Scouts, whatever, when they go.</span> <span id="s307">And we find out that this, this man is a dangerous man.</span> <span id="s308">He went to...back to town.</span> <span id="s309">He came back at will and he was unheard at that time.</span> <span id="s310">So, Szymon and this friend decided that he was a spy.</span> <span id="s311">He came not to organize a school but he came to find out and to bring news to the Germans that Jews and their partisans of Jews and they are started already to organize at that time the partisans, we heard, but they were just rumors at that time, some groups, some POW's, some groups are organizing but they were rumors at that time yet, so Szymon decided that this, this teacher has to be eliminated, and one night he and some more people, they came, came in down there to that barn when he was asleep.</span> <span id="s312">They knew exactly where and he was no more alive.</span> <span id="s313">From that point, I..</span> <span id="s314">.</span> <span id="s315">there was a big group.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">How...did you ask me how did I wind up with this big group of partisans.</span> <span id="s317">There was...I heard, I heard that a big partisan group is start already organizing.</span> <span id="s318">I heard partisan group is going to pass by this village, and for curiosity I went with my girlfriend, I ready...I wanted...I wanted to go inside, but I was not sure they wanted to accept me, they will take me in, and I went up and I was stirring...stood down there and then this commissar came on his horse and he start exchanging niceties.</span> <span id="s319">We told him right away, my girlfriend and myself who was down there also of Jewish faith, and we said we wanted to join the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Are these partisans, were they Poles, Russian...?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: They were...they were Russians.</span> <span id="s322">They were Poles.</span> <span id="s323">They were POW's, and they were people like myself who escaped—</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, who escaped from the ghetto, who escaped from the – of the sheer -- to just to save their lives.</span> <span id="s326">And he said, “I'm not in authority.”</span> <span id="s327">He was the commissar of this soedinenie It was...he said, “I'm going to the general and I'll come right back.”</span> <span id="s328">When he came back, he said, “You must go right away or I..</span> <span id="s329">.</span> <span id="s330">you can go with us, but you must leave right away.”</span> <span id="s331">I said, “But I have a sister in here, and I have to let words -- I have to tell her that I'm leaving.”</span> <span id="s332">But he said, “Now or not -- or none.”</span> <span id="s333">I said, “Okay, I'm going.”</span> <span id="s334">I sent a messenger.</span> <span id="s335">I let my sister know that I went and I joined the partisans.</span> <span id="s336">And then we stopped in the next village.</span> <span id="s337">I was assigned to a group and there was my immediate officer.</span> <span id="s338">I came up to him and I said, “you know,” I told him the story, “I left my sister.”</span> <span id="s339">He said, “Okay, I'll give you my adjutant and I'll tell you how to mount the horse, and you'll go with him and tell your sister.”</span> <span id="s340">He gave me this guy who was a partisan already 6 military formation (Russian) for quite a while.</span> <span id="s341">He asked me...he taught me how to mount the horse.</span> <span id="s342">I went up and we went to my sister's place where she was and that took us three or four hours, and I went in, I told the landlady, “You must take care of my sister.</span> <span id="s343">If something will happen, your life is danger.”</span> <span id="s344">She saw it -- she saw me.</span> <span id="s345">I didn't have a gun yet at that time, but she say my, my friend, this partisan, and he had a gun and she knew that I meant business.</span> <span id="s346">I said, “If something happened to her, remember this, we’ll come and we'll burn your house and we'll will kill you,” and we left.</span> <span id="s347">Now our fights were daily, constant, constant.</span> <span id="s348">We started with a group of 500.</span> <span id="s349">We wind up between I would 17, 1,800, maybe more.</span> <span id="s350">I don't know exactly the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: By size you mean what?</span> <span id="s352">You would attack where?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Attack.</span> <span id="s354">Attack.</span> <span id="s355">Ambush Germans, and put TNT under the railroads, on this uh, you know, the rail, the rail.</span> <span id="s356">Trains who used to come to the front, coming from front, they didn't have no, no peace, no day or night.</span> <span id="s357">And we did the job very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: And how long did you stay with them?</span> <span id="s359">A: We -- I stayed with them till 1944-- 01:31:09</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you stay in the same area or did you--?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No.</span> <span id="s362">We traveled constantly.</span> <span id="s363">We had our radio operator who transmitted, received and transmitted telegrams from -- to Moscow and from Moscow.</span> <span id="s364">We used to have even planes coming sometimes to us by assigned, by assigned parole -- by assigned, like you say when in, in the military, by assigned, by assigned, you know, when for instance your on patrol, your on assigned--</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: On assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No.</span> <span id="s367">The planes came a few times later, let off medication.</span> <span id="s368">Let off medication and sometimes they used to land, and they used to tell them that it will be like five, five fires on the, on the radio.</span> <span id="s369">You see, on the transmitter they used to transmit a telegram to Moscow and tell them that's all.</span> <span id="s370">We'll have like five fires in a circle, and this will be our people, and then they used to land, bring us -- sometimes used to take some of our wounded people, but it was once in a while.</span> <span id="s371">Then this was one, one thing.</span> <span id="s372">Then stands out very much in my mind and I call it returning for the bullets.</span> <span id="s373">I was in this group who took care was, it was like assigned, assigned group to take of the general and at night we had an order to go from that village -- we were stationed in that village -- to go from that village to another one.</span> <span id="s374">I took my gun and I left my bullet belt right there, and with my group, with the other, with the -- who was immediate commanding officer, and the -- and some of the partisans left.</span> <span id="s375">I was going in another partisans from my group, and I thought nothing – not thinking too much -- I thought, “In the morning I'll come back and I'll get my bullet belt.”</span> <span id="s376">But you are not do -- you are not allowed to do this during the war.</span> <span id="s377">When we start -- when we, we slept over night down there and in the morning when we came back to the village, back to our destination where we left our, our unit, our partisans -- when we came back, the, the, the Germans were already fighting us.</span> <span id="s378">The village was on fire.</span> <span id="s379">Our partisans were retreating.</span> <span id="s380">My unit was coming out.</span> <span id="s381">My house where I was stationed in that village, was right -- I could see it from there when we came out from the woods from far away.</span> <span id="s382">When my immediate officer came across to me, I asked him, “Where is my bullet belt.”</span> <span id="s383">He said, “I left it under the log.</span> <span id="s384">Well, you better get it.</span> <span id="s385">If not, we are going to court martial you.”</span> <span id="s386">The village was burning.</span> <span id="s387">The screams and the yells were terrible, and I had to go, there was no choice for me.</span> <span id="s388">I ran and there was this guy Andrej and there was like, you know, like razvedkawe call it in Russian.</span> <span id="s389">There was like the intelligence.</span> <span id="s390">They were like the scout boys.</span> <span id="s391">They used to come, for instance, if you had to occupy a village, they were the first ones to scout out and to see if nobody's down there from enemy, from enemies, or when we retreated, they used to look to if none of our partisans were left, mop out -- take out all of them.</span> <span id="s392">When he saw, saw me running up to the village and thought that I got crazy.</span> <span id="s393">And he ran up to me.</span> <span id="s394">He said, “I'll kill you.”</span> <span id="s395">He thought that I'm running to the Germans.</span> <span id="s396">I said, “my patrontazh,” I yelled to him, “my bullet belt.”</span> <span id="s397">And I went up and believe me, I get bubbles still in my stomach when I remember this.</span> <span id="s398">I went up the log where he said.</span> <span id="s399">I held my horse as tight as I could.</span> <span id="s400">With all my might I run up.</span> <span id="s401">I grabbed my, my, my bullet belt, I put over my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">01:34:59 I remember, and I went over the, over the clearing.</span> <span id="s403">It was a clearing there, and I went up into the woods.</span> <span id="s404">I pinched myself to see if I'm alive or it's just something -- if it's not real.</span> <span id="s405">When I came back to my unit and I met up with my with my general, with my group, they said, “Oh my God, you live a long life Brenda.”</span> <span id="s406">You know, they could not believe it.</span> <span id="s407">My only explanation -- I could not figure out.</span> <span id="s408">They could see me.</span> <span id="s409">They saw me.</span> <span id="s410">They should sniper me down.</span> <span id="s411">My only explanation was at that time that I wore a uniform from a German pilot.</span> <span id="s412">I was on the horse.</span> <span id="s413">I had his -- even his, his, his little hat, cap, and I had a poncho.</span> <span id="s414">That's like for the weather, for rain, like you put -- the, the army people put them on and you tie up to here, during the Second World War.</span> <span id="s415">The kids now wearing it.</span> <span id="s416">It was in style but in different colors.</span> <span id="s417">When you -- when you lay down on the ground, you're camouflaged.</span> <span id="s418">You're a part of the ground.</span> <span id="s419">My only explanation was that maybe they thought that I was one of them strolled away and that's why they didn't kill me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So this, is now 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: In 1943-44.</span> <span id="s422">I don't -- I, I cannot remember, because it was in the late summer I 7 intelligence service (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s423">8 bandolier (Russian) remember, because in '44, at the end of April, the beginning of May, we already were discharged from the from the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: You were discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Discharged.</span> <span id="s426">Yeah.</span> <span id="s427">We were discharged from the partisans.</span> <span id="s428">The war was over.</span> <span id="s429">Berlin was already it was almost to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s430">So in 1944 -- so in and then what else -- there was many, many things that everyday were different and especially when we -- I remember going into Carpathian mountains and being raided on base, a German base, and they put grenades and we burned and it's like an atom bomb exploded and for us it was a victory.</span> <span id="s431">They were sitting and singing I remember, and there was even a poem was composed at that time by one of the partisans.</span> <span id="s432">I was, I was sitting I remember in the corner with my gun and we were singing and didn't know what the next minutes will bring, but at that minute it was okay.</span> <span id="s433">And then a German, a German train got close to the base, went to the--</span></p> <p><span id="s434">01:37:50</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: A German train?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: A train.</span> <span id="s437">It was coming from Germany.</span> <span id="s438">It was in the Carpathian mountains, because we went as far with the partisans from Poland up almost to the Carpathian mountains, by the woods, by the, by the -- not by the main roads.</span> <span id="s439">That's what -- how we went.</span> <span id="s440">And this train was going to the, to the front and singing away songs.</span> <span id="s441">They were victorious in their singing.</span> <span id="s442">They were going to conquer the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Germans.</span> <span id="s445">We were waiting for them.</span> <span id="s446">We derailed this, this train in three places.</span> <span id="s447">And when they start running out -- they stopped singing very fast.</span> <span id="s448">They start running out and they machine gunned them.</span> <span id="s449">And then we retreated into the deep woods.</span> <span id="s450">We couldn't stay down there any longer because the Germans with the planes, with the planes right away they knew that the partisan groups are down there congregating.</span> <span id="s451">They would come and they would cut us to bits, to, to bits.</span> <span id="s452">So, we left that destination, we went out into the deep, deep woods.</span> <span id="s453">And there was another episode.</span> <span id="s454">If you want it -- if you still have the time, I can explain to you.</span> <span id="s455">And I call it also -- we were stationed in our, in our -- in a village and this village also was like in a, in a valley.</span> <span id="s456">It was on one side, I remember, mount...like hills, not mountains exactly but hills and I was in the group what when you occupy a village or whatever a point, you put in a machine gun, some people with guns for people who are watching, coming into the village or going out from the village, actually you can come into the village but not go out.</span> <span id="s457">You understand...if somebody...or he can go with a patrol.</span> <span id="s458">Let's say for instance, if the patrol at night was “seven,” and I would stand watch with my gun and I would tell him “four.”</span> <span id="s459">He would have to come up with the number three to equal seven, and there was on top of this, we used to have like “Warsaw” and “Kraków” or “Warsaw” and “Kiev,” so if I would say “Warsaw,” he would have to say “Kiev.”</span> <span id="s460">I knew it's one of us.</span> <span id="s461">If he didn't know the parole, even the general, he had to lay down.</span> <span id="s462">If not he would be killed at the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">01:40:43 I was in that group and in the morning the Germans must find out that there are partisans stationed in that...in that village.</span> <span id="s464">They occupied this hill and we were left without...without bullets.</span> <span id="s465">We had the machine guns.</span> <span id="s466">They had – with everything-- little bit of surplus, little bit of, of, of, of bullet but not enough, so my immediate officer said we have to get the bullets from our horse...from the...from the horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s467">And the horse and the buggy was about three, four houses away from that place where we...it was on the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s468">I said, “Okay, I'm going.”</span> <span id="s469">I knew exactly from the back, through the back how to go around there.</span> <span id="s470">I went.</span> <span id="s471">I got my bullets and when I came back the houses and everything was burning.</span> <span id="s472">The Germans occupied this, this the, the hill, and they were coming at us with bullets.</span> <span id="s473">In our house...in our home stand there in the Ukraine, they are from wood and straw roofs, so if you put it in a burning bullets, it's right exploding, right start burning, and I remember with my big like this scarf...a big...I had a big thing with these bullets, and I grabbed on my...on one of my of my thing to bring it back to my officer, to my...to the...to the...to the man where he send me, and I remember under this...under this house when I lay down...I lay down.</span> <span id="s474">I tumbled and then I had a little clearing and I tumbled to the other house, and the other house was burning, and then I saw a guy what I, I, I remember I knew him by his by his dress, by his by his by his jacket.</span> <span id="s475">Ivan was his name, Ivanya.</span> <span id="s476">And I yelled to him, “Ivanya, cover me.”</span> <span id="s477">He was laying down there in front and I see...I said, “Cover me, because I have to run.”</span> <span id="s478">If he would cover me, they wouldn't have the...I had time to go over it.</span> <span id="s479">If not, they would snipe me down or they would kill me, and I hear he didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s480">I said – he, he, he, he got scared -- I said “you chickened out,” and I got so mad at him, and I yelled again, but he was not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s481">He was a snip-- a, a bullet straight to his head because the funeral was the next day.</span> <span id="s482">I tumbled.</span> <span id="s483">I went, I remember, under a well and it was like in old time, we had the wells, you know, wooden well.</span> <span id="s484">And then I came to my officer and I gave him the bullets.</span> <span id="s485">And then we retreated.</span> <span id="s486">And that was another game.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">01:43:18</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Well, what happened to your sister now, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: At this point my sister were left and I was still fighting with the partisans.</span> <span id="s490">It's now 1944, and after we came out from the partisans, I went back to my town, Sarny, and she was living with this lady...</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: That you left her with?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Not I left her with.</span> <span id="s493">The lady in my city Sarny...when I went from the bullets, when I went from the execution, I went up to the house with her husband.</span> <span id="s494">Her husband was standing and telling jokes to the other Poles.</span> <span id="s495">I..</span> <span id="s496">.</span> <span id="s497">she was in her house.</span> <span id="s498">They were good friends of ours, very good friends before the war.</span> <span id="s499">And they used to call my mother “our daughter” because she did some special things for them.</span> <span id="s500">They would have wind up at that time in Siberia, and because of my mother they were left by the Soviets at that time, so she was staying with them, but only...yes.</span> <span id="s501">A grievance I had against her, she made like a maid out of her.</span> <span id="s502">She didn't fed her with the family and whatever.</span> <span id="s503">That's a little bit of a hurt, but she survived and this, is the main...the main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: When did you discover the rest of your family, their fate?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I..</span> <span id="s506">.</span> <span id="s507">their fate I already find out right away, after three days.</span> <span id="s508">My father was a forester.</span> <span id="s509">He knew the, the surrounding...he knew very, very, very well.</span> <span id="s510">If I said if my father would live, would be alive, he would survive, he would be in the woods and he would be a big help.</span> <span id="s511">He could...he could organize himself partisan...a partisan group, a fighter unit, but when I saw after three...after a week, nobody survived, I knew it's nobody survived.</span> <span id="s512">And I find out the fate.</span> <span id="s513">They killed -- they, they took him from that point where I left everybody when the barbed wire was cut.</span> <span id="s514">They took them by groups across...across the hill where the Germans with the machine guns stood and they had already ditches prepared and they were killing them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: They shot them and ....?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Shot them and throw them in the ditch.</span> <span id="s517">And I heard from some non-Jews, Ukrainians who came and they said the earth was shaking and blood was gushing out because we were healthy people, and my thoughts...I was very hurt because I know I have my

taken away.</span> <span id="s538">There was a big celebration...rockets was running and colorful people who was rejoicing and I stood down there by the municipal center, I remember, in my town, and

place.</span> <span id="s552">And it's a funny thing.</span> <span id="s553">You know, our own people built that camp.</span> <span id="s554">And they was suspicious I remember at that time...you remember the camp that I told you...and they were asking questions the Germans.</span> <span id="s555">They said, “We have -- we are bring POW's,” and the front was not far and it made sense to us.</span> <span id="s556">But they deceived us at that time.</span> <span id="s557">The camp was made for us, and this was like a slaughter camp.</span> <span id="s558">After they murdered everybody, they dismantled the camp there should be no trace, except the three graves who remained down there for the people, where they killed off all the people.</span> <span id="s559">And this, is some speaking and I'm living...</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How did you manage to deal with these terrible experiences you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s562">I was young and I had a lot...a lot of hate against the injustice was done, and I said, “If a human being, how could they have done it, how could it -- how could they had sense?”</span> <span

actually unpredictable.</span> <span id="s570">I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s571">Yes, sometimes they asked me, “How did you survive?”</span> <span id="s572">You cannot say...I could not tell them in one word.</span> <span id="s573">It's my youth...my revenge wanted to take, and the mis-justice what they had done to our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">01:50:21</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: But it was difficult to deal with these memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s577">It was very difficult, but at least for me it was...I had a gun in

group and I haven't seen Szymon.</span> <span id="s597">Szymon remained with that...with the group down there, and he did some what ever he did down there also the same thing like going out and derailing, whatever, and he remained and after the war I met him.</span> <span id="s598">I met up with him.</span> <span id="s599">I met him and he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Is he

had to do with...that you survived because you were willing and able to do them?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I survived because I was willing.</span> <span id="s625">Yes, I wanted to live very, very much.</span> <span id="s626">And I remember when we were taking...in our group there was a Madame Kless and I will never forget, and there was a little girl, and this Madame Kless was a good friend of hers.</span> <span id="s627">She came up to me and she said, Brenda, you are young and you are so...you are so flink, you are so fast on the move.</span> <span id="s628">You are fast on the move.</span> <span id="s629">You'll survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Is she the girl who had the bad leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: No.</span> <span id="s632">There's another, another lady.</span> <span id="s633">And she said, “You, you may survive.”</span> <span id="s634">I said, “Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Kless, we are going -- I don't know where we are going,” but in --

destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s639">Very much so.</span> <span id="s640">I was left and my father, I lost right then and then.</span> <span id="s641">Who knows?</span> <span id="s642">My father had a terrible temper.</span> <span id="s643">Maybe he ca-- went up -- I lost him.</span> <span id="s644">Maybe he couldn't face the family.</span> <span id="s645">Right in the camp, when they brought us in, they pushed us in, all of us.</span> <span id="s646">Maybe he went to the gate to speak to one of the of the of the soldiers, of the Nazis and maybe he got in a fight and maybe they killed him right then and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">9 quick (Yiddish) Because I hadn't seen him anymore after we were -- we got in, in this camp.</span> <span id="s648">My two grandparents and one of my grandparents as I described before, he blessed me.</span> <span id="s649">And maybe he was blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">01:56:51</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Overall you have no enmity towards the Russians, their activities were helpful to you?</span> <span id="s652">A: They were helpful, yes.</span> <span id="s653">They're helpful, and let's not forget they were Allies of the United States at that time.</span> <span id="s654">They were a bigger evil at that time to conquer.</span> <span id="s655">And they were -- they, they had just nice words.</span> <span id="s656">I don't remember saying anything against the Americans, any bad words, from the partisans, from the immediate people, from the immediate comrades I was associated with.</span> <span id="s657">Nothing but good words.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: And what happened to those Jews that they shipped off to Siberia when they were -- back in '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Some -- in '39 -- some survived and some died of natural death.</span> <span id="s660">Some died maybe of overwork, but it was, it was, you know, everything is in comparison, but you ask, there is no choice.”</span> <span id="s661">They killed us all out – all, all.</span> <span id="s662">There was no--</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: So they were just fortuitously taken out of the war, out of the Hitler--</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Out, out, out of Hitler, yes.</span> <span id="s665">Yes.</span> <span id="s666">Out of Hitler and they sent them to Siberia because they thought they were anti-Communists.</span> <span id="s667">They were, they were, they were capitalists.</span> <span id="s668">They were anti-Communists, all kind, all kind of business at that time.</span> <span id="s669">And let's see to it -- and I'm again saying it, that this should never, never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: And how, how do you suggest we might work toward that?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I think this, this monument being erected as a learning center, people will come.</span> <span id="s672">They will see all the testimonies from different survivors and -- like college professor like in Chicago came out and wrote this, this thing, it will never happen again, and he said that the Holocaust didn't happen -- in response to the skinheads, and the Ku Klux Klan and revisionists would like to falsify history and tell them it didn’t happen, deny it.</span> <span id="s673">So we will stand by and we will see to it that it will never happen again, so our dead who died will not be in vain.</span> <span id="s674">If you will not remember the yesterday, the future is uncertain.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: What you are saying it is important for this museum to keep that alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Absolutely alive.</span> <span id="s677">And tours and school kids.</span> <span id="s678">Let them learn, let them see the evil.</span> <span id="s679">But people are capable to do good things and to do evil things, too.</span> <span id="s680">And that to stop, and stop, and stop them when they start.</span> <span id="s681">If Hitler would have been stopped in time he would not have the guts what he did but nobody stopped him and he exploited the situation to the best of his, to his political at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Thank you we are stopping now.</span> <span id="s683">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s684">01:00:20 End of Tape

id="s689">A: when I joined the group, there was this General Naumovand was the head of the of the partisan movement at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: He was Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: He was Russian.</span> <span id="s692">He was, and all his officers were mostly Russians, Russians at that time but rather a potpourri with a bunch of people from different -- they were POW's, they were escapees like Jewish escapees, or people who felt not comfortable with the Germans, and there -- they were composed of mostly of, of those people, and our daily life was constant to go on the move, constant on the move.</span> <span id="s693">We did not -- let's say if we stopped in one place that day, we went at night -- usually at night we used to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Where did you get the assignments?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: The assignments we used to receive from Moscow.</span> <span id="s696">We had our radio station with three people working on it.</span> <span id="s697">We used to receive and trans-- to receive telegrams and give it back to them whatever they ciphered it in cipher because you know the Germans could have could have gotten this -- the, the if it wouldn't be ciphered, but they used to send ci-- ciphered telegrams to Moscow and from.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: And you had assignments which--</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: We had assignments.</span> <span id="s700">For instance, to, to go and to derail this and this rail.</span> <span id="s701">Q: Tell us about some of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I described you one -- the incident in the Carpathian mountains and there were some more incidents like this.</span> <span id="s703">Like, like we would come into our to our to our place that we have to derail, and then we used to put it in TNT, this little -- it's like little fobs and we used to put it in, in, in four, in three, in two and three places, and there was a long string used to come and then we used to ignite and this would come and would ignite the train, the, the, the TNT, the, the, the explosives.</span> <span id="s704">And this was ignite in three places because you can fix it right away if it would be just in one place, the railroad.</span> <span id="s705">And later this -- they, they put in some sentries and they were on the rail, on the railroads.</span> <span id="s706">Some, some German 10 M. I. Naumov sentries used to watch them, so we knew about it, so we used to put it in three, even sometimes in four places, the railing.</span> <span id="s707">When the when the train would come, they would, would take them a long time to fix that train and we had time to mess up them but good.</span> <span id="s708">Yes.</span> <span id="s709">And we raided bases, ambush any German who go to the front, from the front.</span> <span id="s710">We used to play cat and mouse like, used to play games.</span> <span id="s711">We used to play cat and mouse games.</span> <span id="s712">We used to ambush, and they didn't have no rest, no day, no night and I remember some Germans who used to come to the front through the woods, and there were some, some -- not the highway like here is sophisticated -- but through the woods and they were afraid even to go into the woods to relieve themselves because they knew that some unfriendly hands is down there waiting for them.</span> <span id="s713">And, but mainly we show our presence that we are there.</span> <span id="s714">I -- yes, I remember on the -- in the -- on the going, going with the partisans, we, we got a hold of a big engineer.</span> <span id="s715">Engineer used to build the phantom bridges, you know—</span></p> <p><span id="s716">02:04:54</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Pontoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Pontoon—</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Bridges—</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Bridges you call it, used to build those, those phantom bridges for the tanks and, and the, and the heavy, and the heavy artillery, whatever they had it should go fast, go through, and get a hold of this guy with these with this cart.</span> <span id="s721">He was driving leisurely with his with his chauffeur, with his car.</span> <span id="s722">He thought he was down someplace in Germany.</span> <span id="s723">They got a hold of him and, and he begged for his life.</span> <span id="s724">They asked me sometimes, “Did you have prisoners of war?”</span> <span id="s725">No, we didn't.</span> <span id="s726">If we took in anyone...</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: You had no, no way to deal with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No place.</span> <span id="s729">No.</span> <span id="s730">No way to deal with them, and we had plenty hate against them, to do whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: You were a young girl.</span> <span id="s732">You were just probably blooming, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.</span> <span id="s733">How did you feel as a young girl in this…?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: In this environment, in this group?</span> <span id="s735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Comparatively, I felt good because I had a gun in my hands.</span> <span id="s737">I fought.</span> <span id="s738">I escaped from fire.</span> <span id="s739">I escaped from the execution.</span> <span id="s740">I knew that there is, there is, there is at least for now when I'll, when I'll die, it will be with a gun in my hand, and I'll take as many as my enemy as I</span></p> <p><span id="s741">can.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And you acted like a grown-up.</span> <span id="s743">You were -- young girl, boys or--</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No.</span> <span id="s745">It's my, my, my youth was shattered, of course, and they ask me sometimes how old I am and I say by my experience, a hundred.</span> <span id="s746">By my -- the way I feel, I'm very young at heart and that's keeps me going, and maybe that was my -- and my positive outlook towards life maybe was what kept me going.</span> <span id="s747">I was, I was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: You felt good because you were doing something?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s750">We were doing something and, and I felt that there will be a tomorrow and I'll survive and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Did you have any romances within the partisan group?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s753">There were one.</span> <span id="s754">There were two even where they fell actually in love, but I was -- shied away, right away.</span> <span id="s755">I don't know.</span> <span id="s756">I was standing my ground.</span> <span id="s757">I said, “It's not a place, not a time.”</span> <span id="s758">But there were romances and there were guys who I flirted with them and they but that's as far as we went.</span> <span id="s759">We didn't have time for whatever.</span> <span id="s760">They were even more, but not in my case, no.</span> <span id="s761">I didn't think it's the time and the and the place for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">02:07:51</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Did you have any special assignment that you remember that you could tell us about, aside from the group action, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: The general once, a few times sent me, yeah.</span> <span id="s765">The general sent me a few times to bring some, some from the village and it was a dangerous mission to go and to do it.</span> <span id="s766">I went and did it and I brought him the thing.</span> <span id="s767">He thanked me for it, and we were constantly in the fight.</span> <span id="s768">I was in the fights.</span> <span id="s769">I was...I was...I don't know if you'll ask me if I personally...no.</span> <span id="s770">But I was in fights and there were bullets, bullets, bullets -- were running right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">They were killed Germans.</span> <span id="s772">They were killed enemies.</span> <span id="s773">But... Q: So there was constant action, and you were in it all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Constant action.</span> <span id="s775">Constant action.</span> <span id="s776">The, the night -- some nigh-- some, some days were quiet and the Germans were afraid of us.</span> <span id="s777">They used to call us the bandits.</span> <span id="s778">They were the bandits, but they called us the bandits.</span> <span id="s779">For us it was no choice.</span> <span id="s780">They were the occupants and they did all the horrible things.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: When did you hear the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: When actually the beginning of April.</span> <span id="s783">We heard...we heard already the news that our front is advancing, in the partisans.</span> <span id="s784">Our front is advancing and we had assignments to go deeper into...like we went into the almost to the Carpathians because it was a dangerous mission in there to go into the Carpathians.</span> <span id="s785">It seemed to be into the heart of the Germans, and they were infested down there.</span> <span id="s786">They had their bases.</span> <span id="s787">They were infested, so we went along, we went along.</span> <span id="s788">And we speed it up.</span> <span id="s789">I think we speeded it up, the, the, the defeat of the Germans.</span> <span id="s790">We speeded it up, I'm positively sure of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: The partisan activity was very important to that...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s793">We were very much, very much...and there were heroes.</span> <span id="s794">There were guys who they put their life on the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Were there many Poles in your
