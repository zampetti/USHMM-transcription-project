<p><span id="s16">A: His name was Shulim actually, not Shalom.</span> <span id="s17">What do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: S-H-U-L-E-M?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: No, L-I-M, Shulim.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Because with the “e” it would have been Shulem.</span> <span id="s22">No, Shulim.</span> <span id="s23">This is how you would read Shulim?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Yes, this is right.</span> <span id="s25">He was born in Kolbuszowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Kolbuszowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Someday I’ll pronounce that right.</span> <span id="s28">And, okay so this was Leibush’s son?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: This was Leibush’s, Leibush’s oldest son.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: How many children were there in Leibush’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: He had, well the first one was born and he died after a week.</span> <span id="s32">So, three children, Shulim was the oldest, you want the children’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: All right, the second one’s name was Shlomo, he was born September the twentieth, ’31.</span> <span id="s35">And then was the daughter Raisa, how do you say?</span> <span id="s36">{Rose.}</span> <span id="s37">Well, Rosa; she was born February 15, 1933.</span> <span id="s38">See, because I don’t know if you’ll use this, but I have pictures, so I will give you the pictures.</span> <span id="s39">So this was from the next batch.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And Leibush, he at this time owned his own sales general store?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Leibush, he owned the same store as my father, I mean the same kind, wholesale general store.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: I remember you saying Leibush was a big fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, he was not so big.</span> <span id="s44">In Kolbuszowa he was considered big, but he was known -- everybody is known for something and he was known for his strength.</span> <span id="s45">He was the strongest man, if somebody wanted to give an example he strong, so they said he’s as strong as Leibush.</span> <span id="s46">So he was very well known, not that he used his strength for some fight or something, but he was known as the strongest man in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Is this something Shulim would have been proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, I was very proud of it, because nobody would start up with me but he never got involved, but he was, I was always be proud.</span> <span id="s49">And also when Jews never stood up against anything what was done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn’t take abuse.</span> <span id="s50">And there was one I write in the other book, once there was a draft commission, you know a draft commission came to our town to take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came a few high Polish officers and a military doctor, and they conducted the draft.</span> <span id="s51">So once when Jews had to go to ______ to the bigger town, they went by wagon, they went by autobus.</span> <span id="s52">The autobus went once a day, eight in the morning to _______ so when the Jewish people, some Jewish people wanted to go on the autobus, so those officers were standing by the door, they didn’t let in Jews and Leibush --.</span> <span id="s53">I can, stop it……where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: We were talking a little bit about Leibush.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Okay, he had the store.</span> <span id="s56">I started to tell you about-----so those two officers, the three officers were standing in the doorway they didn’t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to the big town.</span> <span id="s57">And there came also was standing a young woman and she had a sheitl a wig, because they were very religious, so when she wanted to go in they grabbed her by the hair and they pulled down the wig, she was very embarrassed because they were shamed.</span> <span id="s58">When my brother saw that they don’t let her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time, I would say about twenty years old, or twenty-one years old.</span> <span id="s59">But he went and he wanted to go and he pushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pushed him so fast, he was standing there, that he fell on the other one and the other one, they all, three or four, they all fell down.</span> <span id="s60">And naturally he was afraid, so he run away, then the police came and they arrested my brother and there was a big case and they took about four, five years.</span> <span id="s61">This was taken to J_________ to a superior court and they made a big issue because who would touch a Polish officer?</span> <span id="s62">The main thing, after he knocked them down all the Jews went in that car, but they had my brother arrested.</span> <span id="s63">But the main thing was that they asked the woman to be a witness who was pulled down the wig, and she didn’t want to be a witness, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s64">But then later we had to hire big lawyers and it cost money and this was, but he was known about his strength.</span> <span id="s65">When he was younger, I was a very poor eater so my mother used to say “I never had trouble with Leibush, because Leibush, when put down for breakfast a bread, he finished the whole bread.</span> <span id="s66">He finished the whole loaf.”</span> <span id="s67">So they ask Leibush, they ask him, “When do you know that you have enough?”</span> <span id="s68">He was not fat, when do you know it’s enough?”</span> <span id="s69">So he said, he never said when he’s full or something, {when the muscles} not the muscles, how you call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Jaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: The jaw.</span> <span id="s72">When the jaw starts to hurt you, then he knows he has enough.</span> <span id="s73">And there were other cases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one, he was known as strong.</span> <span id="s74">So he came over once and said “Let’s wrestle.”</span> <span id="s75">My brother said I don’t want to wrestle, I’m not a wrestler.</span> <span id="s76">He said “Let’s wrestle.”</span> <span id="s77">He wanted to show he is stronger, so my brother didn’t want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said “Okay, let’s wrestle.”</span> <span id="s78">So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket.</span> <span id="s79">It took a second, the other one was stretched out.</span> <span id="s80">So then he said that he approved he’s the strongest.</span> <span id="s81">And then he was with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp.</span> <span id="s82">But in the end he died of a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he died and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone.</span> <span id="s83">So this is about Leibush.</span> <span id="s84">Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don’t know, you have the record….</span> <span id="s85">.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I have the copy back in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Shulim, here is not pronounced right, it’s not __________ the A is not important.</span> <span id="s88">All right, so this you have corrected.</span> <span id="s89">Now, you want me to read this over and correct it what is here?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Well, let’s see.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Let’s see what is important, what’s not important.</span> <span id="s92">Now this was written on the ID, let’s see what we can correct.</span> <span id="s93">He’s a very beautiful boy, my nephew, I don’t see that this uh….</span> <span id="s94">.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Yeah, I think we’re not going to use that voice.</span> <span id="s96">You know, it’s going to be written.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Him.</span> <span id="s98">Right, so he cannot say I’m a very beautiful boy.</span> <span id="s99">He is three years old, his parents dressed him in a player’s show, cut his hair for the first time and brought him to the teacher at the religious school, at the cheder.</span> <span id="s100">His father can hardly wait for the day when Shulim will begin his public school education.</span> <span id="s101">I think this is very….</span> <span id="s102">.</span> <span id="s103">it’s not the right language.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: So they can get better language, ’39 the Germans have taken over our town, Shulim nine years old, knows that he no longer goes to school because all the Jewish schools have been shut down.</span> <span id="s106">He didn’t have no Jewish schools, this was public schools and Jews couldn’t attend public schools anymore, not that the Jewish schools were shut down.</span> <span id="s107">And he cannot walk on the sidewalks, this was not right in the beginning, Jews could walk on the sidewalks, but this was not the main thing because he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s108">But he doesn’t understand what lies behind these rules because I think the whole thing is, he couldn’t go to school because Jewish schools were shut down; all schools were shut down.</span> <span id="s109">In 1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans were, we can say we were at this time in the ghetto in Kolbuszowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: In ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: In ’42, because the ghetto was established in July ’41.</span> <span id="s112">The Germans law was that all Jews twelve years and up had to wear the yellow armband.</span> <span id="s113">We didn’t have a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s114">The white with the blue Star of David.</span> <span id="s115">Had to wear the white and blue armband, there was nothing, and register for work.</span> <span id="s116">This is okay, we had to register from 12 to 60.</span> <span id="s117">Getting the band was such a proud moment for Shulim, to him it meant he was now a man, that he was growing up to be like his father.</span> <span id="s118">He never realized that it was part of the Nazi, I don’t use the word Nazi, as the Germans plan to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s119">I don’t who the Nazis, Shulim and German, maybe we can say the picture, because we’ll take out _______, the picture that he asked me, or he can say I asked my uncle to make a picture and I have a picture the day he put on the armband.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: I know that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: The picture, and when he shows off the band, because he was so proud of it so maybe this can be incorporated.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So he asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes, he bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Uncle Naftali, can you make a picture of me with the….</span> <span id="s125">?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s127">Then I made the picture and I took the other children also and he showed the band.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q ; He put it on the other arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Well, no he had it on the right arm.</span> <span id="s130">He had it on the right arm, but he pulls out the arm to show the picture; he was so proud of it.</span> <span id="s131">Shulim was transported with his mother, brother and sister to Belges death camp where he was killed in July 1942.</span> <span id="s132">Now, should we….</span> <span id="s133">.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: July 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, July, I don’t know the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Just July, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: July, 1942 because I don’t know because they were kept in the trains, but in July he was killed.</span> <span id="s138">Now I don’t know if we should write anymore about his father, that his father survived, or just to let it go.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Probably just let it go.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What else do you remember about Shulim as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well I remember….</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did he like certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: He was a very good- looking boy, he was really very -- and he was a very good student, when he started to go to school.</span> <span id="s145">Because after all he went already three years in public school was from six to nine, and he was a very, very good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So he went to public school and also to….</span> <span id="s147">.</span> <span id="s148">?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, he went to public school and after public school he went to cheder, to a Jewish school, like everybody else.</span> <span id="s150">From eight to twelve or one, we went to public school.</span> <span id="s151">Then in the afternoon, from two on, I think we went to cheder.</span> <span id="s152">And when the war broke out there was nothing left anymore, what else, there is nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did he ever help on the work detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work details.</span> <span id="s155">It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work.</span> <span id="s156">They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things.</span> <span id="s157">And we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so happens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at.</span> <span id="s158">And we got the room and we worked together, we lived together.</span> <span id="s159">He wasn’t, it wasn’t so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the ________ about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it’s written how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat.</span> <span id="s160">Leibush’s father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this was the place that he was not thrown out.</span> <span id="s161">So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s162">They had enough, everything.</span> <span id="s163">Until it was the transport to J_________ and J_________to Belges and then they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So they lived in an apartment, that’s what they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, they had an apartment, the apartment was of two large rooms and a large kitchen, so when we moved into the ghetto we took over the large kitchen, I say we, I mean my father, my mother, and I and two sisters.</span> <span id="s166">So we had the kitchen, and he with his three children had the bedroom, so we lived together what we used the same kitchen and they had this one room.</span> <span id="s167">But he also had, in the basement, he had the store still, there was not too much merchandise, but how much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So he lived above the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: He lived above the basement, yeah, and we lived in the same….</span> <span id="s170">.</span> <span id="s171">and he was lucky in this time that his apartment, his store was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s172">Like for us, they threw us out from our house and to go into the ghetto, but he was there, so we came to live with him.</span> <span id="s173">Now, if we wouldn’t live from him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came in the house.</span> <span id="s174">But the main thing is from Shulim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim was born the same year as Richard, my older brother’s son, but Richard was born in America.</span> <span id="s175">My brother had moved there after a pogrom in our town in 1919.</span> <span id="s176">I always think of these two, Richard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12.</span> <span id="s177">See the people are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark down 13.</span> <span id="s178">So he was born when he was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s179">So this, I think, this is a very nice sentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in America and Shulim killed in Poland at the age of twelve.</span> <span id="s180">So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is enough material.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Anything distinguishing about his mother that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished.</span> <span id="s183">She took care on the house and Leibush took care on the store, but nothing special.</span> <span id="s184">But maybe to mark down that Leibush survived the war.</span> <span id="s185">That Leibush survived the war with me in the woods and died in America in 1960.</span> <span id="s186">Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of passports, the new ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well that is a very nice format, it looks very good.</span> <span id="s189">The only thing it should be correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No who do we go now?</span> <span id="s192">To_______________</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Yeah, that would be very interesting to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Passports come out, send the corrected passports this way.</span> <span id="s195">I want to keep it, I have always collections I would like.</span> <span id="s196">Now Naftali you went over mine, so we don’t have to add anything on mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Now, what you want Dr. Anderman.</span> <span id="s199">His name was Leon Anderman.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N, yeah.</span> <span id="s202">Leon Anderman, he came to Kolbuszowa from uh, it came out the book, All Physicians in Poland and he was a mention to that I dated back to my nephew but that was written the year when he was born, the date.</span> <span id="s203">Anyway, he came to Kolbuszowa in the early 20’s and he -- well not in the 20’s mark down in the 20’s, I don’t know if the early twenties.</span> <span id="s204">So cross off the early twenties.</span> <span id="s205">He became the physician of Kolbuszowa.</span> <span id="s206">There were in this time, there were two doctors in Kolbuszowa; it was the county doctor, the official doctor which we called the physic, and then there it was this private doctor.</span> <span id="s207">Mostly Jews used him, he was very….</span> <span id="s208">.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Used Dr. Anderman?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Dr. Anderman, yeah.</span> <span id="s211">He was a very assimilated Jew, he didn’t have anything to do with the Jewish causes, he never stepped in the synagogue, and so was his wife.</span> <span id="s212">They had one son, he was about two years younger than I was; his name was Jurek, J-U-R-E-K.</span> <span id="s213">He was -- he never attended a cheder, or to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s214">His wife had never any contact with Jewish women.</span> <span id="s215">He was very respected by the Polish community as he was an officer in the Polish army, in the reserve army, he was also an officer yet in the Austrian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Where was he from originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: He was originally from a town near Tarnople, this is near Stanislovov this is near the Russian border, there was a few brothers he was originally from there.</span> <span id="s218">He started medicine in Vienna, because this belonged to ---.</span> <span id="s219">Too bad I don’t have the book because in the book it’s written exactly the date when he was born, when he graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Is it a “Who’s Who” of ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Only doctors, a book about physicians in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Who died, who were killed.</span> <span id="s224">It’s a thick book, if you want to know I can find out exactly, you want to know about this, is it important?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Yeah, I’d like to try to get his birth date.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: I may even be able to find this book at the Library of Congress.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: It’s book, he has it, so I’ll give it to you.</span> <span id="s229">Give Kevin the information, I’ll tell him to make a copy….</span> <span id="s230">.</span> <span id="s231">information of Dr. Anderman.</span> <span id="s232">It’s also, certain things is not correct also.</span> <span id="s233">Somebody who wrote it didn’t know.</span> <span id="s234">Well, anyway he, said he never bothered with Jewish causes when the first time when they threw out the Jews from Germany in __________ this was the first time that he came.</span> <span id="s235">They organized a committee in every little town to help the German Jews who were thrown out and we organized in Kolbuszowa also and this is the first time he took part for it.</span> <span id="s236">And I remember the first time that he attended shul when he spoke about giving money to this organization to help.</span> <span id="s237">The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when before the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war, so they wanted the citizens should donate money to buy airplanes because the Polish air force didn’t have too many airplanes; they had a few.</span> <span id="s238">So, they collected money so I remember he, this is the second time he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews, naturally he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s239">Spoke to the Jews willing to give money, and I remember his words, he said, “Today we beg you to give the money, but in a few months, I am afraid they will take it without.”</span> <span id="s240">He meant the Germans, they would take it without begging you, without asking you.</span> <span id="s241">He asked the people for money, and then this was the first two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor to the army.</span> <span id="s242">He was taken to a prisoners’ camp in an officers’ prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s243">And then later he was released, short after he was released and see, in this book was written exactly where he was interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: This was after the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: After the German invasion, he was in the army, they drafted him, they drafted all the doctors and he was a reserve officer, being a doctor so they drafted him.</span> <span id="s246">And then he was taken as a prisoner of war, and he came back to Kolbuszowa he started to run his office.</span> <span id="s247">When the Germans ordered the Jews should make a Judenrat, that means a Jewish council, and there was one Jew who right away volunteered.</span> <span id="s248">As the Germans came in he started to be an important man by the Germans, he started to come to the commandant and he started to tell them all kinds of stories.</span> <span id="s249">He was not a very person, this….</span> <span id="s250">.</span> <span id="s251">he started to tell them which Jews have hidden merchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew.</span> <span id="s252">Like he came to my -- the Germans liked ________ coffee, coffee beans.</span> <span id="s253">He came to my -- and we had coffee beans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans.</span> <span id="s254">Today he wanted two kilo, the next day three kilo and then four kilo….</span> <span id="s255">and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean we don’t have new shipments.</span> <span id="s256">He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be dry.</span> <span id="s257">So he said well if you don’t want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and he squealed that my father has hidden merchandise.</span> <span id="s258">They came over and they took away everything we had.</span> <span id="s259">I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had because he squealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Not just coffee, everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said that he ---.</span> <span id="s262">They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything.</span> <span id="s263">My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to Russia, which later I came back.</span> <span id="s264">And he, and this man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said.</span> <span id="s265">Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally.</span> <span id="s266">So even there was here in America there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them something and they don’t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this?</span> <span id="s267">I don’t want to mention his name because he has his family.</span> <span id="s268">So they say, what do you think I am him?</span> <span id="s269">He was known that he is – for money he can be a witness.</span> <span id="s270">So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s271">So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad.</span> <span id="s272">We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn’t look Jewish, I mean he didn’t have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he started in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews.</span> <span id="s273">A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become__________ so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor.</span> <span id="s274">I don’t want to be a politician, and I don’t want to have a job like this.</span> <span id="s275">The Jews begged him, they told him, look if you don’t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that this man is no good for the Jews.</span> <span id="s276">Well, anyway, after a few times.</span> <span id="s277">I remember my father went to him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one condition.</span> <span id="s278">If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can pick out the people I want.</span> <span id="s279">So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people, mostly people without beards, and that shouldn’t be, again, the Germans shouldn’t dislike them and also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war.</span> <span id="s280">They were people, respected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council which included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh_____, well younger people.</span> <span id="s281">He organized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the streets from their houses for work.</span> <span id="s282">He organized and made lists, and everything that had to be done was done through the organization.</span> <span id="s283">If you want more details, in the book I have more details about Anderman.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: So around July ’41 he became the head of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s286">He became head of the Judenrat in, before the ghetto, he became head of the Judenrat in the middle of ’40.</span> <span id="s287">In the middle of ’40, even earlier, I would say in spring of ’40, spring 1940, yeah.</span> <span id="s288">And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they had to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that had money.</span> <span id="s289">If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you’ll see he was a very fair man, and I liked him very much.</span> <span id="s290">Later he opened an ambulatorium, a free clinic because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don’t have money, so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty store because he was in the flower business, and in the war they didn’t have flower, so he opened in his store the ambulatorium.</span> <span id="s291">He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who was sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee.</span> <span id="s292">He needed help so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to teach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good as I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it.</span> <span id="s293">I went there and for this, because I was with him, this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked with him for over a year in this ambulatorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: When did that open?</span> <span id="s295">That ambulatorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: This ambulatorium opened in the middle of ’40, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940.</span> <span id="s297">And I worked with him with my friend, we…….</span> <span id="s298">.</span> <span id="s299">Then later more and more, I was more skilled, so a lot of things I could do, special with wounds and dressings and all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You saw Poles and Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, no only Jews.</span> <span id="s302">No Poles, they had their doctors there, he wasn’t allowed to treat Poles; the Germans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles.</span> <span id="s303">Then also he gave me a job, before the war I was the buyer for my father’s store and I used to go to different towns.</span> <span id="s304">They needed somebody to bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be, we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns.</span> <span id="s305">Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the black market, like potatoes, they didn’t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened a public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organized a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s306">The kitchen needed certain things that the Germans didn’t give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to different towns.</span> <span id="s307">I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those things that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans.</span> <span id="s308">By going out and having this pass, I also could buy a lot of black market for the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed, and also I bought on the black market for myself, for my family.</span> <span id="s309">I brought in stuff and they sold it so they could make something out of it, my father.</span> <span id="s310">So this was how we worked with Anderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was very fair.</span> <span id="s311">There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it.</span> <span id="s312">Again in his book, you have the stories about it.</span> <span id="s313">Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live.</span> <span id="s314">He built a house a year before the war, and this was the most exclusive, the most beautiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---.</span> <span id="s315">It was a modern house, this was the only house what had electricity and was the only house who had indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s316">You see, he had a, not compressor, what you call it, to make electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: A generator?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: He had a generator and the generator produced enough electricity to take care on the toilets, with the water.</span> <span id="s319">It was a beautiful house, it had nice furniture, so this _________ the head of the county, the German who was very vicious, his name was Twardon.</span> <span id="s320">And Twardon wanted to take over his house for himself because it was in a nice section.</span> <span id="s321">So he urged Anderman to take over an apartment in the ghetto, in the place where the ghetto is.</span> <span id="s322">He said to him, you take, because you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best apartment for yourself.</span> <span id="s323">Anderman said I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head.</span> <span id="s324">And if the Jews will be settled, then I will take it.</span> <span id="s325">See, he wanted to move in his apartment, then later said to him, I want to move in the apartment but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to renovate the apartment.</span> <span id="s326">He said renovate it, it’s just a new house, it’s just a year old.</span> <span id="s327">And besides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn’t live long in this house, the war will end and I will go back to the house.</span> <span id="s328">See, he didn’t like these answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: That’s a very bold thing to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, yes, well he didn’t like these answers, so on a certain day this was about, I would say about two weeks after the ghetto was established, Twardon came and he arrested the whole Judenrat, everybody in the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s331">Besides the Judenrat he also arrested about ten more people, and naturally for the town it was a very big shock they arrested, but Anderman was free.</span> <span id="s332">Everybody said Anderman he’s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be released.</span> <span id="s333">He went and spoke to this Twardon so two days later, or a day later he was arrested.</span> <span id="s334">Once he was arrested we felt that the situation was very grave because he was the only one who could --.</span> <span id="s335">They were in jail in Kolbuszowa about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So the whole Judenrat except him was arrested first?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: First, yes, and then later he was arrested, two days later.</span> <span id="s338">So, he -- now my brother was arrested, my brother-in-law wasn’t arrested, because my brother-in-law, I’m writing also in the book, there was before the ghetto was established they took a certain amount of Jews from the market place and they sent them away to have less Jews by us.</span> <span id="s339">He wasn’t there, so they didn’t arrest him.</span> <span id="s340">Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat.</span> <span id="s341">Now we were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders but then he said he’s looking for a new head of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s342">While they were sitting in jail, they were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi Rappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews.</span> <span id="s343">They had their business before the war that they used to send pigs to Katervitz it’s a big town near the German border, this was their business, so Anderman said….</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Pigs they sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yeah, this was their business.</span> <span id="s346">They bought pigs, they sent them out, they slaughtered them, they sent the meat to this town and they had this business.</span> <span id="s347">It was a very unusual business for Jews but they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did.</span> <span id="s348">Anderman knew -- we knew that Twardon’s looking for a new ________ but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in jail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not like a regular jail, but they kept them in the basement from the magistrate building.</span> <span id="s349">So Anderman said that if he would ask somebody to become________ the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse.</span> <span id="s350">This way if everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can.</span> <span id="s351">This maybe will force them to let out Anderman.</span> <span id="s352">Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn’t listen to him and he told his wife to go to Twardon and tell him that her husband, this Pashik Rappaport is willing to become Judenrat.</span> <span id="s353">That he’s young, he’s energetic, he’s good looking and the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in K________.</span> <span id="s354">He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and they took out this Pashik and they saw that he --.</span> <span id="s355">They take him away to the office where the ____ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald____.</span> <span id="s356">Anyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twardon he would be a good Judenrat man and he will serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from jail, and he made the president and his brother the assistant.</span> <span id="s357">Once this happened, Anderman said now we have lost everything.</span> <span id="s358">We didn’t believe that a Jew would do it but he did and this man started to pick out members of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s359">Naturally he picked out different kinds of people that Anderman wanted.</span> <span id="s360">Anderman wanted the best quality and he picked out from the people that they were servant.</span> <span id="s361">He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle business and a few black marketers.</span> <span id="s362">He made a new Judenrat.</span> <span id="s363">Now the new Judenrat started to work and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman.</span> <span id="s364">Anderman could go out because, as a matter of fact, practically every night he went out to sleep in some Polish house.</span> <span id="s365">This was watched, this jail was watched by the municipal police.</span> <span id="s366">They knew him so they let him out and the next day before dawn he came back.</span> <span id="s367">The Polish people begged him not to go back.</span> <span id="s368">Eventually they would do something with those people, they will not keep them forever.</span> <span id="s369">He didn’t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care.</span> <span id="s370">I am the one who can speak to the Germans for them; they listen to me.</span> <span id="s371">He didn’t run away and then one day they came and they took all of them away to J______.</span> <span id="s372">They let out only three Jews, they let out, my brother included.</span> <span id="s373">If you read the book you will know the reason why.</span> <span id="s374">My brother-in-law came back from J____ so Twardon said that there are some members of the first Judenrat, they should take them in.</span> <span id="s375">They became in the second Judenrat.</span> <span id="s376">They were in J____ about two weeks.</span> <span id="s377">After two weeks they took all of them to Auschwitz and this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as later.</span> <span id="s378">They took them to Auschwitz and as they took them to Auschwitz, the families start to receive telegrams.</span> <span id="s379">They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one died trying to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Let me flip the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Very good, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Must be -- because I bought one, it’s not very good.</span> <span id="s384">All right so there came the telegrams and always the telegrams had something to say.</span> <span id="s385">They had to sign, somebody died, let’s say on lung cancer.</span> <span id="s386">Why they had to sign that he suffered from lung cancer a long time.</span> <span id="s387">Why they did it, why they make so evident a ------; somebody died on some other sickness, that he suffered from it.</span> <span id="s388">Then a week after they received the telegrams and you could see the postman came in went into a house, that right away you could hear the crying and the screaming so we knew that he comes with a telegram.</span> <span id="s389">About two weeks later, the same people received bills from Auschwitz with bills to pay for the cremation with some ashes.</span> <span id="s390">They had to pay for the cremation.</span> <span id="s391">This is how Anderman was gone.</span> <span id="s392">Meanwhile when he was arrested, his wife and son were left in Kolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s393">They went to Warsaw and they lived this Aryan as Catholics in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s394">His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground when it was the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s395">Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw uprising, he was killed in the uprising.</span> <span id="s396">His wife survived and after a while she came over here an old broken woman.</span> <span id="s397">She died here in America.</span> <span id="s398">For Anderman, when he was arrested so the Polish people, even the mayor who was in _____ went to V_______ and told them he should be released if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man.</span> <span id="s399">He says this is why we arrested him, he was too honest.</span> <span id="s400">I think that this Anderman that what he did for the Jews that he never, never associated with the Jews, that he was an exceptional man.</span> <span id="s401">I always say if the Jews would ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint.</span> <span id="s402">Because he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he was considered to be a Polish Catholic.</span> <span id="s403">He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews because the Germans listen to me and they respect me.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Do you think he just went a little too far with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: He went a little too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: He was a little too resistant?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Well, he tried because he saw that they respected him so certain times he went a little too far.</span> <span id="s408">He was not a person that we call it like a Jew-boy.</span> <span id="s409">He always had his pride and for the Germans, he was not good.</span> <span id="s410">If you read the book, you will see a lot of things that I gave examples of what he did.</span> <span id="s411">It was a little too much so he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: When you were part of the Polish army you were able to go to Auschwitz and you found those photos of Anderman?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah, well I didn’t found it in this time.</span> <span id="s414">Later, a few years later, usually --.</span> <span id="s415">No, the photos of Anderman I had because I save them.</span> <span id="s416">This is one photo, I think from the thirties and one what I had when he built the new house was few years, a year before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Sitting outside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Sitting outside the house, I have it.</span> <span id="s419">Then I got a photo of his son.</span> <span id="s420">His wife gave me the photo when she was here.</span> <span id="s421">Now his photos from Auschwitz, now usually the Germans didn’t make mug shots from prisoners.</span> <span id="s422">They had millions and millions, I don’t know what they did,______.</span> <span id="s423">Now the people who were selected to be, to go the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s424">As you know, about 85% right away went to the gas chambers; about 15% they went to the camp.</span> <span id="s425">So the people who went to the gas chambers didn’t get the tattoos.</span> <span id="s426">Only the people who went to the right or to the left like they had the selection.</span> <span id="s427">But very few, Anderman naturally was not -- all the Kolbuszowa were not gassed right away.</span> <span id="s428">This time, there were no transports to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s429">This was a camp where they took mostly Polish people were in the underground or were in the black market.</span> <span id="s430">Jews who were called for one reason or another, like the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s431">So they didn’t have selections; they were in the camp, some a week, some, some were two weeks.</span> <span id="s432">Because he was doctor, and because he was an important person, they made him mug shots.</span> <span id="s433">This is the first time I saw that somebody got out.</span> <span id="s434">The mug shots that I got out about ten years later, about ten years from Anderman.</span> <span id="s435">They kept Anderman, for this I have the number and the triangles because they have two kinds of triangles.</span> <span id="s436">Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal or political, the Jews usually had two.</span> <span id="s437">They had political and Jews so the triangle made like a myogen David.</span> <span id="s438">So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one was the yellow, the yellow was for Jews.</span> <span id="s439">So I got later from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: What was his, do you know?</span> <span id="s441">What triangles did he have?</span> <span id="s442">Do you know the colors?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Usually Jews had red and blue.</span> <span id="s444">One was political and one was Jewish.</span> <span id="s445">On this, it’s black and one, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s446">But this is probably what Jews had.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Once he was deported, you never heard from him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Once he was taken to Czechowice.</span> <span id="s449">He was in Czechowice about two weeks.</span> <span id="s450">When he was in Czechowice together with the other people from Kolbuszowa; this time they arrested not only in Kolbuszowa they arrested in other towns from the section where Czechowice was the head town.</span> <span id="s451">We used to come to one place every week with packages for them because there was one of the guards that he could be bribed.</span> <span id="s452">We gave him money and he took the packages with letters for them.</span> <span id="s453">If they arrived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s454">Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I told you I went two, three times to buy, to bring the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the packages.</span> <span id="s455">We met in one place and there I met people from all other towns from around us.</span> <span id="s456">Everybody did the same thing.</span> <span id="s457">They brought the packages and later this German, somebody came.</span> <span id="s458">They took the packages, they got paid and he supposedly gave them the food.</span> <span id="s459">But we never found out because he never brought back letters.</span> <span id="s460">We send them letters.</span> <span id="s461">He could take the money, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them.</span> <span id="s462">I think once they came in, that they brought back letters.</span> <span id="s463">He was there about ten days or two weeks.</span> <span id="s464">After two weeks they send both to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s465">In Auschwitz, after a few weeks, I think after two weeks, the telegrams started to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you know what his said, his telegram?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I don’t know because his telegram didn’t arrive because there was nobody to send a telegram.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Because his wife and son had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: His wife disappeared.</span> <span id="s470">They disappeared the day he was arrested.</span> <span id="s471">But the other people, the telegrams came and I saw the telegrams.</span> <span id="s472">Mostly the telegram says that we want to let you know that your husband, this and this day, he died of cancer or he died on lung failure, TB.</span> <span id="s473">She had to sign that he suffered from TB.</span> <span id="s474">Then some they were killed while trying to escape.</span> <span id="s475">But this was not --.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: You suspect he was gassed at Auschwitz versus being executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, they were all gassed, they were all gassed.</span> <span id="s478">But in the beginning, we don’t know because this was in 1941.</span> <span id="s479">This was towards --.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: They were still building the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: They were still building it, so I don’t know if this were gas or executed, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s482">I would suspect that there was one --.</span> <span id="s483">The crematorium was already there.</span> <span id="s484">But the gas chambers I don’t think were there.</span> <span id="s485">I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on the commission.</span> <span id="s486">There was a commission that studied the crimes for the Germans.</span> <span id="s487">I was a member of this commission which was headed by Hewlett Johnson (?)</span> <span id="s488">.</span> <span id="s489">He was the Dean of Canterbury.</span> <span id="s490">{You have photos of him, don’t you Norman?}</span> <span id="s491">Yes, I have photos of him.</span> <span id="s492">The Archbishop of Canterbury and he was the head.</span> <span id="s493">The members of this commission were professors of universities from all over the world.</span> <span id="s494">There was an American, a Russian and I was sent from the Polish government.</span> <span id="s495">There were two delegates from the Polish government.</span> <span id="s496">I was one and the other one was, his name was Meega.</span> <span id="s497">But his name was not Meega, he was a lawyer from Cracow, his name was Dissenfeld.</span> <span id="s498">Later he lived in England.</span> <span id="s499">He was a lawyer before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: A Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: A Jew, yeah, distant.</span> <span id="s502">But then he masqueraded as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s503">His name, he changed it to Meega.</span> <span id="s504">We were both sent but we were sent as members to this commissions, from the secret police.</span> <span id="s505">Because they wanted to know what contacts they had, this delegation.</span> <span id="s506">They didn’t trust nobody.</span> <span id="s507">So this Hewlett Johnson who was quote a “Red Dean” because he was very pro-communism.</span> <span id="s508">He was archbishop.</span> <span id="s509">They wanted to know what connections he had with the Polish underground, with all those things.</span> <span id="s510">We were sent and officially we were members of the Polish delegation but our mission was completely different.</span> <span id="s511">This Hewlett Johnson, the reason they called him the “Red Dean” was because when it was the Korean War, he went to Korea and he wrote how the Americans behaved and what the Americans are doing, very pro-communist.</span> <span id="s512">Then later I wanted to go and I went over to one commentator and wanted to tell him how he was misled.</span> <span id="s513">How we arranged his meetings with the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so that everything was such officially done and everything was lies.</span> <span id="s514">That the government did it just to show him.</span> <span id="s515">Then later, he said to me, listen they won’t bother you, don’t start because you came over here.</span> <span id="s516">They will ask you how you know those things and --.</span> <span id="s517">So I let it go.</span> <span id="s518">I went, his last name, his name Barry Gray.</span> <span id="s519">He was a very outspoken commentator, I went to him.</span> <span id="s520">He said to me, you come over here, you had so much trouble.</span> <span id="s521">Don’t go into more trouble.</span> <span id="s522">I could find out from Auschwitz in the beginning everything because I was the authority but there were so many things.</span> <span id="s523">The war was still going on that this was secondary to --.</span> <span id="s524">But I made pictures in Auschwitz, I have the pictures still today.</span> <span id="s525">You don’t have all because we didn’t come yet to those pictures.</span> <span id="s526">This is -- I made a list, the pictures that I gave you.</span> <span id="s527">Is supposed to be 150 but actually it was 153 because some were made A.B.C.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So this is Anderman.</span> <span id="s530">Taken in --.</span> <span id="s531">I have the date but I don’t know if you want to have the date for the picture, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: No.</span> <span id="s533">Just need their birth dated, approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Birth dates I don’t know.</span> <span id="s535">Let’s see, if they were three and a half years old and it was ’38, ’39, ’40, ’41.</span> <span id="s536">They were born in the second half of ’38, both of them.</span> <span id="s537">I don’t remember the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: They’re the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: They’re the same age, yeah.</span> <span id="s540">The difference was in about a month, I think.</span> <span id="s541">Now she was older, her name was Blimcha.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: B-l-i-m-i-c-a?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: B-l-i-m-c-i-a.</span> <span id="s544">.</span> <span id="s545">You got it?</span> <span id="s546">Blimcia.</span> <span id="s547">Lische, L-i-s-c-h-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Her father was Moshe?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: The father?</span> <span id="s550">No.</span> <span id="s551">The father was Shayadovid; the mother was my second sister, Malcia, M-a-l-c-i-a, Malcia.</span> <span id="s552">This was Blimcia.</span> <span id="s553">The other’s names was Henoch, H-e-n-o-c-h, Kornfeld.</span> <span id="s554">You know how to spell Kornfeld.</span> <span id="s555">His father’s name was Moses, Moshe, we called him Moshe.</span> <span id="s556">His mother’s name was my third sister Lieba.</span> <span id="s557">How you spell Lieba?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: L-i-e-b-a?</span> <span id="s559">L-e-i.</span> <span id="s560">I guess for Lieba.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: L-i-e-b-a.</span> <span id="s562">{Just L-i, some people could read it Lyba.</span> <span id="s563">So it’s better L-i-e that’s Leeba.}</span> <span id="s564">So Lieba and my second sister, born the same.</span> <span id="s565">Oh, you have the machine going?</span> <span id="s566">good.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Now, there were, what I can tell you.</span> <span id="s569">They are beautiful, they were beautiful children.</span> <span id="s570">Will you mark down to send me the map?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Copy of map.</span> <span id="s573">Now you can make two, three, maybe I will need it.</span> <span id="s574">They were beautiful children, happy children, playing around like children did.</span> <span id="s575">What the question?</span> <span id="s576">You want to ask if --?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Were they religious families?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Very religious, very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Hasidic?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Hasidic, yeah.</span> <span id="s581">Like Lische who was a grandson from a very famous dynastic rabbi which is not important which one it is.</span> <span id="s582">Kornfeld was a graduate of the Yeshiva Hach______ Lublim.</span> <span id="s583">We spoke about it before, the Yeshiva Hach_____Lublim.</span> <span id="s584">We changed there but I think --.</span> <span id="s585">How did you mark down?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: H______Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Is wrong, should be Yeshiva Hach_______Lublim.</span> <span id="s588">You will remember, Yeshiva__________Lublim.</span> <span id="s589">It means the Yeshiva of the Smart ones of Lublim {The wise men}.</span> <span id="s590">The wise men of Lublim.</span> <span id="s591">Mark down that this is the correct for Kalman.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: You have it there?</span> <span id="s594">If you mark down, it doesn’t get lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: No, I’m very good about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Good, so you correct it because now it’s wrong there Hach___Yeshiva Lublim, it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s597">Yeshiva Hach___Lublim.</span> <span id="s598">So he was a graduate of this yeshiva and he was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q; What did they do for work?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s601">Lische Shadovid had a wholesale flour business.</span> <span id="s602">This was my father gave him over part of our store.</span> <span id="s603">When he came in, he was never a businessman so he took a part of the store, flour, and he used to sell to stores and to bakeries, the flour.</span> <span id="s604">Moshe had a wholesale of textiles, mostly crude textile for underwear.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Was this also set up by your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s607">All through my father, yes.</span> <span id="s608">He was always -- my father bought them houses and he set them up in business.</span> <span id="s609">Now what else would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Did they have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s612">Blimcia had one sister, a year and a half younger and her name was Dobcher, D-o-b-c-i-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: One and a half years younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: One and a half years younger, she was killed when she was two.</span> <span id="s615">I think two years younger.</span> <span id="s616">Henoch had a brother the same age, one and a half years younger, his name was Yussel.</span> <span id="s617">Moshe, you know the business.</span> <span id="s618">They were with us together in ghetto.</span> <span id="s619">They lived together in one apartment, consisting of two rooms.</span> <span id="s620">In the ghetto, Shadovid was a member of the Judenrat and then later he was sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: After being arrested, he was sent away with Anderman?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, he was not arrested because he was away.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: He was away?</span> <span id="s624">that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: He was away; for this reason he was not arrested to be sent away.</span> <span id="s626">Then later when he came back, Fathering said to accept him.</span> <span id="s627">Moshe worked like everyday jobs what they sent out people to work.</span> <span id="s628">Nothing --.</span> <span id="s629">{Slave work}.</span> <span id="s630">The children played in the ghetto, they had games like children games.</span> <span id="s631">But one, an exceptional game , which I want you should put it in, which this is very important.</span> <span id="s632">The Henoch, he was like the ringleader, was very smart for his age.</span> <span id="s633">When he lived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far from the German police.</span> <span id="s634">We knew the German commandants of the police.</span> <span id="s635">Everybody knew them.</span> <span id="s636">One was good, one was bad, one was worse.</span> <span id="s637">There was one man, his names was Harenbeer.</span> <span id="s638">Habier is H-a-b-i-e-r.</span> <span id="s639">He had a face like very, very like a bulldog.</span> <span id="s640">His face was not really a human face and he was very vicious.</span> <span id="s641">He killed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s642">The children knew about it and their game in ghetto was that this Henoch and Blimcia took together a few other children.</span> <span id="s643">Henoch stood in front of them and he spoke to them German because he heard about it.</span> <span id="s644">He used to ask them, he had in his hand a piece of wood pretending this is a rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: The German he spoke was just what he heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: What he heard, how could he speak real German.</span> <span id="s647">He said Bist Du Juden?</span> <span id="s648">That means are you a Jew?</span> <span id="s649">To the children.</span> <span id="s650">Now this was a game and children answered Yavol, yes that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s651">He said, _______.</span> <span id="s652">Because you are a Jew, you are dead.</span> <span id="s653">He took the rifle and started to pretend, poof, poof, one after the other.</span> <span id="s654">After he pointed the rifle, he said poof, they fell down, pretending they are dead.</span> <span id="s655">This was their game.</span> <span id="s656">It shows you that the time the children of three and three and a half years had those games.</span> <span id="s657">Every time.</span> <span id="s658">the same game, got together, he was the policeman.</span> <span id="s659">Yeah, also when he said, first introduced himself when he got the job.</span> <span id="s660">He said, Ich ben Habier, he didn’t know the Habier.</span> <span id="s661">He said he heard it so he said I am Habier.</span> <span id="s662">Bist Du Juden and this was the game.</span> <span id="s663">I think because they had such beautiful children, I think a picture like this with this story --.</span> <span id="s664">They were sent in July, 1942, they were sent with their families to Belzec death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Right from --?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No, from Kolbuszowa, everybody was sent to Czechowice.</span> <span id="s667">But in Czechowice they were there about a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s668">Because what they did, the gathered the people from all the small towns in one place.</span> <span id="s669">They wanted to have in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: They liquidated your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: They liquidated mine.</span> <span id="s672">Then once they had them in Czechowice, then they made big transports.</span> <span id="s673">They made five transports.</span> <span id="s674">With the first transport, I have the date, they were sent to Belzec, this was July 7.</span> <span id="s675">They were sent to Belzec, together, in this day they send out 12,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s676">Six were killed in a nearby forest by Glowkoff G-l-o-w------ Well, I described this in the book.</span> <span id="s677">They sent 6,000 elderly were killed in prepared ditches and the rest were sent to Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: So, 6,000 were killed at Glowkoff and another 6,000 deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Deported to Belzec, yes.</span> <span id="s680">But at this time --.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And they were deported, these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Together with -- yeah.</span> <span id="s683">Because only elderly and crippled were killed in Glowkoff.</span> <span id="s684">In this time, they were so busy with the transport in July that they had to wait sometimes three, four days in the cattle cars till it was processed this arrival.</span> <span id="s685">Sometimes they waited two, three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Once at Belzec, they would sit?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: They would sit there on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s688">A lot of times this was in the summer, there were ten carloads.</span> <span id="s689">There were French cars, cattle cars and they were made out of heavy tin.</span> <span id="s690">The heat without water; sometimes they opened the doors, half of them were dead.</span> <span id="s691">They had to wait sometimes two, three days till there was place to process them in, to take them down to undress and to gas them and then later to cremate them.</span> <span id="s692">Well, actually in the beginning, they were not cremated.</span> <span id="s693">There were ditches which they filled the ditches, this was near the Russian border, so there were ditches made, anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s694">I have a complete description because when I went there, I arrested one of the engineers.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Do you remember like what color hair and eyes they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Oh, yes, sure.</span> <span id="s697">Blimcia, she looked like an angel.</span> <span id="s698">She had light blonde curly hair, all curls.</span> <span id="s699">Her eyes were watery blue.</span> <span id="s700">You know sometimes somebody has blue and they are like watered down, very, very bright, light blue.</span> <span id="s701">And always had a face, she was chubby, had a face always smiled.</span> <span id="s702">Like she smiles in this picture.</span> <span id="s703">Now Henoch, his hair was darker.</span> <span id="s704">It was a dark blond hair and dark eyes.</span> <span id="s705">He had a more olive complexion and he was always more serious than Blimcia.</span> <span id="s706">She was always happier than -- so this was --.</span> <span id="s707">{How about some chocolate to stick in your mouth?}</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Just --.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: I don’t know if I should describe Henoch’s brother.</span> <span id="s710">{You’re not writing about him.</span> <span id="s711">Just the name is enough.}</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: What do you remember about how your sisters were with these two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: I don’t know, anything special about the way they treated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: They treated them like a mother treats a child.</span> <span id="s716">They were crazy about them.</span> <span id="s717">Not only for them.</span> <span id="s718">You see, those children, they didn’t have one mother.</span> <span id="s719">They had five, six mothers because my grandmother was --.</span> <span id="s720">They were more in my house than they were in their house because we lived not far.</span> <span id="s721">Blimcia’s girls, their house was next to our house so a whole day she was by us.</span> <span id="s722">She ate by us, she went home to eat, to sleep.</span> <span id="s723">The other one also, they were more home.</span> <span id="s724">All my sisters, the other sisters considered them our children.</span> <span id="s725">Special with me, I was the closest with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Because you were the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No, not only the youngest.</span> <span id="s728">I was the one, especially in the war, that I used to go around in different towns for merchandise.</span> <span id="s729">Every time I came, there was not a time that I shouldn’t bring something special for them.</span> <span id="s730">If it was candy, fruit about the first cherries, the first apples, the first pears -- every time if I could only buy a few, it was for them.</span> <span id="s731">It was also, that we always laughed, that they knew that I am away in another town and I have to come back.</span> <span id="s732">Usually I came back on a bicycle; they always used to wait.</span> <span id="s733">By Jews there is a saying when you mention Sabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish.</span> <span id="s734">It means the Holy Sabbath.</span> <span id="s735">She heard the Shabot Kordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their aunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit.</span> <span id="s736">They gave them a treat.</span> <span id="s737">They used to come in and they used to say Shabbos Optz.</span> <span id="s738">Optz means in Jewish, fruit.</span> <span id="s739">They used to give to ess Shabbos Optz to get something.</span> <span id="s740">When they waited for me to bring something, somebody mentioned oh you waiting for him because he’s going to bring you Shabbos Optz.</span> <span id="s741">This girl she remembered something but she didn’t remember exactly so when I came in, so she came to me and she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish.</span> <span id="s742">It means the Holy Sabbath because she didn’t remember the expression.</span> <span id="s743">Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and they say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath.</span> <span id="s744">But everything for us, we had something.</span> <span id="s745">Naturally they were the first one because we were a very close family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing.</span> <span id="s746">It didn’t make a difference who the mother was, her mother, his mother loved us as much as her, and her mother loved her --so it’s always the same.</span> <span id="s747">If my mother in the ghetto, if she had something, if I brought her something special or something, they were the first one to have it.</span> <span id="s748">I remember we once received a package from Turkey.</span> <span id="s749">In the package was a salami, a Swiss cheese and a package of chocolate.</span> <span id="s750">All kinds of goodies that we didn’t have it in ghetto.</span> <span id="s751">My mother, naturally took it, it was something, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to get it.</span> <span id="s752">Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package from Turkey, did you send it?</span> <span id="s753">He said I didn’t send it but there was once an ad in the paper that said when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German-occupied Europe, a package.</span> <span id="s754">So he went, he sent in $15.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: This was your brother in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No, my brother in America.</span> <span id="s757">He sent in the $15 and we got it.</span> <span id="s758">It was the highlight in the ghetto to get a package for those things.</span> <span id="s759">A box of margarine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee.</span> <span id="s760">Then I asked him how many packages did you send in?</span> <span id="s761">He said once.</span> <span id="s762">I asked why once, we got it.</span> <span id="s763">He said why didn’t you send it every day.</span> <span id="s764">Yes, he could afford it.</span> <span id="s765">Every day, send in $15.</span> <span id="s766">He said well I didn’t get a receipt that you received it.</span> <span id="s767">I said, how could you get a receipt?</span> <span id="s768">We were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s769">But to take a chance, maybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in, why not?</span> <span id="s770">So -- it was late.</span> <span id="s771">I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and every day they came and they got the piece of cheese, they got a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s772">We were very, very, very close and naturally the children were everything.</span> <span id="s773">For this reason, now I have grandchildren their age.</span> <span id="s774">I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those children were undressed.</span> <span id="s775">The mother had to take them in to a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s776">They had to be killed being two and three and a half years old.</span> <span id="s777">The mind cannot absorb it.</span> <span id="s778">We cannot talk about it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Those were such beautiful, beautiful children.</span> <span id="s780">They didn’t ask nothing from the world, they only wanted to be alive.</span> <span id="s781">Naturally they didn’t realize what’s going on.</span> <span id="s782">This is how they went.</span> <span id="s783">I think that f you will write about them, you’ll put them both together not separate because they were -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s784">Everything I remember when they came to our house in the ghetto, they always came together.</span> <span id="s785">They were beautiful, they were nice dressed and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: They lived apart from you in the ghetto, otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: They lived, before the war, this Blimcia lived next door to us because my father bought them a house next door to us.</span> <span id="s788">He lived away, I would say about 200 meters.</span> <span id="s789">During the day, he came over.</span> <span id="s790">During the ghetto we lived on this street, we lived far away, maybe 100 meters.</span> <span id="s791">Only they had to go all the way to us.</span> <span id="s792">So they were by us practically every day, all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: When they were deported to Belzec, they were with their mothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yeah, with the mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: And who else?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: They

when you get a transport like this with children like this and special to tell the story, their game.</span> <span id="s800">They didn’t play ring-a-round-the-roses or something picking up flowers.</span> <span id="s801">In their mind this was something important.</span> <span id="s802">This Habier went out and he killed Jews.</span> <span id="s803">They turned around in a game.</span> <span id="s804">I witnessed a few times, I was standing there, I couldn’t grasp it.</span> <span id="s805">He tells and he imitates this German, he said when you are Jewish you are dead.</span> <span id="s806">Everybody knows that when he makes poof, they fall down.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Do you think they ever saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: No, no, they just heard talking about.</span> <span id="s809">They heard talkings that Habier killed today a Jew.</span> <span id="s810">They didn’t see it no, but they heard talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: This was the German police?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: This was the German police.</span> <span id="s813">He was like a meister, like a sergeant with the German police.</span> <span id="s814">Especially he was in this time, a very vicious man.</span> <span id="s815">He always walked around with his face, he always had a big German shepherd on the leash.</span> <span id="s816">Because mostly German police had German shepherds.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Did he work with Tarnoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: What?</span> <span id="s819">Tradon.</span> <span id="s820">Tradon, no.</span> <span id="s821">Because when Tradon --, well he worked, he was the police.</span> <span id="s822">But then later he was transferred.</span> <span id="s823">When the ghetto was there, he wasn’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s824">This was before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s825">They were transferred, you know.</span> <span id="s826">There was a other guy who worked with Tradon, I describe it in the book, his name was Smicher.</span> <span id="s827">This is the one who came to beat up my brother and then later he took him out from jail.</span> <span id="s828">Then later -- so he was also there.</span> <span id="s829">It was special certain German policemen that they were exceptional vicious.</span> <span id="s830">They were known for their viciousness.</span> <span id="s831">There were some who were nice.</span> <span id="s832">Nice, it doesn’t mean that if they would catch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn’t arrest you or shoot you.</span> <span id="s833">But they didn’t go out of their way to do more harm than they were supposed to do.</span> <span id="s834">There were a few.</span> <span id="s835">There was even one I also described in the book, that one who was also a sergeant, a meister.</span> <span id="s836">He used to go for vacation home and he always used to bring stuff that my brother asked him to bring like saccharin and other things which was illegal but he brought it and my brother bought it by him.</span> <span id="s837">He made money and my brother made money.</span> <span id="s838">Now this is the one, he told us to go with the transport the first day.</span> <span id="s839">Because he said, we don’t control, the Gestapo controls it and you never know when the Gestapo changes from one day to another.</span> <span id="s840">We went with the first day with the transportation.</span> <span id="s841">So we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there?</span></p> <p><span

him.</span> <span id="s907">He didn’t have in his Judenrat one man with a beard.</span> <span id="s908">He was successful in business, every time better and better.</span> <span id="s909">More details about the business, about conditions I’m writing this out of the book.</span> <span id="s910">When the war started, we lived in our house then later we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s911">In

because he was a Jew but this was a very high position.</span> <span id="s957">Besides this he had his own business too.}</span> <span id="s958">.</span> <span id="s959">He was an ardent Zionist, Hash ___, like a movement you know, that they believed in Hebrew and they studied Hebrew and wanted to make sure that his daughters, you can see that he adored us.</span> <span id="s960">He was a very devoted father -- that we got the proper Jewish as well as secular education.</span> <span id="s961">When the Russians occupied our town in 1939, I think it was the end of September, something, end of September, he was demoted from his job.</span> <span id="s962">He had to work as a laborer, physical worker in scrap iron.</span> <span id="s963">Then thanks to an acquaintance, he got a job in a chemical laboratory, analyzing ___; you know they used to use it for heat.</span> <span id="s964">Peat, yes.</span> <span id="s965">The Russians so this is how he worked.</span> <span id="s966">When the Germans came in -- I don’t want what we went through, it was very hard because the _____ is not very important what we went through.</span> <span id="s967">When the Germans came, he was assigned as slave laborer to work on the railroad and in 1942, in October, they took -- gathered or took all the laborers who worked outside the ghetto, also in the railroad authority and they shipped them all to Belzec.</span> <span id="s968">On the way, on the way to Belzec, he jumped.</span> <span id="s969">You can even describe how he pried the boards of the floor of the cattle car with his hands, no tool nothing and he jumped out of the running cattle car.</span> <span id="s970">Only one girl, age 17 from Kolamia joined him.</span> <span id="s971">The rest I guess, they didn’t want to separate.</span> <span id="s972">They jumped and successfully reached a peasant house on the outskirts of Halech.</span> <span id="s973">Again I was sitting there, this terrible, I was one hour walking distance and my father knew I am alive and then he went for me in ghetto.</span> <span id="s974">Reached a Ukrainian peasant’s house who gladly employed them as field hands because her husband was in the army in Russia and she needed.</span> <span id="s975">But my father didn’t see me at the transport, didn’t see his daughter Amaria, who’s still -- you must put those people in, his daughter Amaria who was the last survivor of the whole family in the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Which transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: To Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: The one he was on?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yeah, because they took fresh from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s980">Then they brought from the working places wherever there are slave workers, they gathered together and they loaded on the cattle car.</span> <span id="s981">He didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s982">I don’t want to go there because we had an agreement in case we are separated, it’s all in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Right, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: But what I -- what you write.</span> <span id="s985">Although he found safe haven, he decided to go to the train and to go back to the ghetto to look for his daughter which meant death sentence if he would be caught.</span> <span id="s986">On the train, an Ukrainian architect who bought lumber from him and befriended him -- I’m sorry this was an Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s987">I can’t help if people write what they want.</span> <span id="s988">Who befriended him, pointed him out to the Gestapo because in each train was a German police and Gestapo, pointed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: He knew this man before, dealt with him in business?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: He used to come, dealt business, used to come for tea to our house.</span> <span id="s991">We were very friendly.</span> <span id="s992">I know the name too, I don’t want to use because it was told to me later.</span> <span id="s993">Pointed out to me later.</span> <span id="s994">{Why don’t you use the name?}</span> <span id="s995">Isuzan Wizy.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: I don’t know how to spell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: L-y-s-y-j.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: L-y-s-y-j?</span> <span id="s999">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Pointed him out and he was taken back to Steinswadoff to the Rudolph’s Mill, this is flour mill, Rudolph’s which was a gathering place for the Jews who were supposed to be sent to Belzec.</span> <span id="s1001">You know the gathering place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1003">And so they waited in a warehouse there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: And then they were shot, yes.</span> <span id="s1005">Without food, without nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: He was shot at the mill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, he was shot at the mill.</span> <span id="s1008">So you see this is supposed to be told because first of all, the devotion of the parent, to show even if you’re safe, the irony of fate is that I was just one hour walking distance from where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Mundich had found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Mundich told me.</span> <span id="s1011">Everybody told me that something they caught a Jew, like here somebody would catch a killer or G-d knows what.</span> <span id="s1012">You caught a Jew and what happen.</span> <span id="s1013">My father was just one hour walking distance.</span> <span id="s1014">I don’t know that he is there and he didn’t know where I am.</span> <span id="s1015">He thought I am in the ghetto and I thought that he was sent to Belzec, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1016">He told me that he would get in touch with me, within three weeks if he managed to get off the train.</span> <span id="s1017">I didn’t hear from him so I assumed that he is dead.</span> <span id="s1018">Therefore I let myself be persuaded by the car ride to go to his house.</span> <span id="s1019">So when this happened he heard about it, Mundich, but he didn’t want to tell me until after months later, what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s1020">By the way, the girl who jumped with him, survived.</span> <span id="s1021">Mundich told me.</span> <span id="s1022">She was by the peasant’s house and then she let herself be caught as non-Jew to a slave labor and she survived in Austria because she got in touch with this Mundich.</span> <span id="s1023">Told Mundich the whole story.</span> <span id="s1024">Also she needed somebody like I needed somebody, when you are masquerading as a gentile After all you have to have family, to get some mail.</span> <span id="s1025">So Mundich used to write to her.</span> <span id="s1026">He just doesn’t know when the war ended, what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1027">But he told me he used to get letters from her from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1028">This is the story.</span> <span id="s1029">I think it is very important, devotion, courage, no nothing to be packed like sardines; to be able to pry the boards; to jump out of a running -- any train to jump.</span> <span id="s1030">The point is that you only have slightly bruised knees.</span> <span id="s1031">The girl was not harmed at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did he break through the bottom of the train, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: {They didn’t jump, they didn’t jump.</span> <span id="s1034">What they did, the train has a floor.</span> <span id="s1035">The floor are grooved boards so he pulled out two boards.</span> <span id="s1036">While the train was running, what they did, they let themselves down, through and between the wheels and the train went and they were not touched.}</span> <span id="s1037">I mean he had only the height, the bruised knees I was told and the girl not at all.</span> <span id="s1038">I think a story like this again, it’s unusual, hair-raising, courage and devotion should be told.</span> <span id="s1039">It’s not only because he’s my father but this should be told the same thing about my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What was his father’s business?</span> <span id="s1041">He was in the lumber business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1043">Before the First World War, my father was from a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s1044">He used to have forests and they used to have mills.</span> <span id="s1045">During the First World War --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Lumber mills?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1048">During the First World War, it burnt down.</span> <span id="s1049">They remained only with an inn and a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1050">This what remained and they were not anymore so rich.</span> <span id="s1051">The point is also that his mother used to say always you see, material things you have, you can lose.</span> <span id="s1052">She believe very much in giving education to her children and all her children got education.</span> <span id="s1053">This is why my father too, he say, I prepare dowry for you, he had hard realty but I don’t know if he would if he would also foresee if I would be able to take advantage.</span> <span id="s1054">So let me give my daughters the best education that I can because with this they will be able always to make a living.</span> <span id="s1055">This why, do don’t forget, this is from kindergarten, he paid --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: How many Jews, did you go to private school?</span> <span id="s1057">to primary?</span> <span id="s1058">to kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1060">Then secondary school gymnasium was very expensive and he had three daughters only one year apart.</span> <span id="s1061">He sent us all to all this and don’t forget that the earning possibilities in Poland were not the same like in the United States.</span> <span id="s1062">To be able to afford it, means that he had to deny himself certain things to be able to do it.</span> <span id="s1063">After all, he was not a millionaire, he was not the richest man, he was comfortable but not the richest, but you always have priorities.</span> <span id="s1064">With him, priorities was education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Do you remember, did he ever paint in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Oh, yes, this is good you told me.</span> <span id="s1067">He make murals, he liked also to make enlarged portraits.</span> <span id="s1068">I remember Hertzel and others and also he always liked to study.</span> <span id="s1069">He learned French by himself.</span> <span id="s1070">He was an avid reader; he liked the history of _____ in German.</span> <span id="s1071">Actually he could quote you from the big German poets, Heine, the same way like from Talmud.</span> <span id="s1072">Because of it, you know the Jews did not like to go to courts when they had a dispute.</span> <span id="s1073">They rather settle among themselves.</span> <span id="s1074">My late father was chosen to be the judge because of his knowledge.</span> <span id="s1075">Actually, I wrote it in the book but they took it out.</span> <span id="s1076">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1077">They didn’t allow me too much space in this book but he read.</span> <span id="s1078">But this is very important.</span> <span id="s1079">So he was chosen to be arbitrator because of his knowledge.</span> <span id="s1080">Between the merchants, business people and the people in the lumber business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Just among Jewish merchants or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yes, Jewish merchants.</span> <span id="s1083">They didn’t like to go to courts, also the expenses and also they didn’t like to run always to the rabbi and the rabbi had like a judge.</span> <span id="s1084">They rather settle in their own line of business, they thought they would be better understood than the other party.</span> <span id="s1085">The two parties used to nominate, choose like a judge, it’s called b___.</span> <span id="s1086">My late father was chosen many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: He wanted to emigrate to Palestine himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: He saw that there’s no future for us in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: This was after everything was nationalized?</span> <span id="s1090">Is that when he became --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: No, even before because of the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1092">He saw that {Nationalize was nothing against him because he wasn’t --}.</span> <span id="s1093">But he saw that there’s no future.</span> <span id="s1094">Therefore he planned to emigrate to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s1095">.</span> <span id="s1096">He felt that he wants to give us education and save enough money.</span> <span id="s1097">Because in order to go to Palestine, you needed at that time, I think, 10,000 zlotys, not per family, per person.</span> <span id="s1098">{5,000}.</span> <span id="s1099">Families, 10,000 and this was a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: For a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: At that time it was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1102">So he wants to give us education, therefore he taught us.</span> <span id="s1103">Made sure that we knew Hebrew and as our foreign language in gymnasium, we had a choice between French, German and English.</span> <span id="s1104">We have chosen English so we have to prepare it, to prepare us for studies in Palestine and to emigration to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1105">What is if you want to know , it’s very unusual also about him.</span> <span id="s1106">He didn’t have any sons so you know we took from the family --.</span> <span id="s1107">You saw the family picture, maybe you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Yes, he had that adopted son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: A boy from that family, yes.</span> <span id="s1110">He raised us like boys.</span> <span id="s1111">The bad part is which later turned out to be the good one, is that every Friday evening, he made us study with him after dinner.</span> <span id="s1112">We had to study with him wintertime so called bocherash ____ this is tracked from our sages and the _____, that means the sa_______.</span> <span id="s1113">You know in the Bible each week is different.</span> <span id="s1114">Imagine three girls to keep us and to study and G-d forbid if we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1115">In summertime when my friends used to go to the park for a walk or to the movies, we had to study with _______.</span> <span id="s1116">This is also the things of the sages and the wise men.</span> <span id="s1117">If one of us didn’t know, he deprived us of allowance to go to movie.</span> <span id="s1118">You know there was a carrot and stick; a lot of laugh, a lot of devotion, attention, strict like boys.</span> <span id="s1119">He raised us like a Prussian officer.</span> <span id="s1120">You know girls like it more easy.</span> <span id="s1121">Thank G-d my mother was a very sweet, easy- going woman.</span> <span id="s1122">With my mother we were like friends, she was also very young mother.</span> <span id="s1123">With him, also he laughed and he bossed around four women in his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: When did you adopt this boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: My parents took him in, I think, in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Who was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: He was my mother’s kid, first cousin.</span> <span id="s1128">His father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Your mother’s first cousin’s child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1131">He died.</span> <span id="s1132">At that time he was, I think, five years old when they took him.</span> <span id="s1133">My father ________him over.</span> <span id="s1134">His name was Manasha.</span> <span id="s1135">The same thing, my father sent him to the Hebrew school, extra expense.</span> <span id="s1136">extra clothing and everything.</span> <span id="s1137">He still wanted very much a boy.</span> <span id="s1138">Actually this is why he had three daughters because he tried twice.</span> <span id="s1139">Then he said the third time must be boy and it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1140">Now between you and me, it was ______ in his family.</span> <span id="s1141">All the sons, all the brothers had daughters, all the sisters had sons.</span> <span id="s1142">It’s unusual but this is how it was.</span> <span id="s1143">My father was the second eldest or the third eldest child in his family, the second or the third.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: The second eldest of three?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No, wait a moment.</span> <span id="s1146">How many there were.</span> <span id="s1147">Five sons and three daughters.</span> <span id="s1148">So he was the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So eight children altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s1151">At least alive, because they had some children when they died in infancy.</span> <span id="s1152">But to my knowledge, eight and he was the second oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Were they a religious family, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: My grandparents were religious, not as religious as Norman’s family.</span> <span id="s1155">As a matter of fact, surprisingly my paternal grandmother was very well educated in Judaic studies.</span> <span id="s1156">She had done with her children the same thing what my father with us.</span> <span id="s1157">They lived like in a summer resort.</span> <span id="s1158">I remember when we used to come there and his brother from Germany used to come, she used to ask them questions.</span> <span id="s1159">If somebody didn’t know, she didn’t hesitate to punish them by slapping their face.</span> <span id="s1160">I remember this as a child when we went there.</span> <span id="s1161">But the sisters went to school, the sisters used to all play mandolin, progressive.</span> <span id="s1162">So the brothers nod their heads, progressive.</span> <span id="s1163">They were progressive, Jewish, traditional.</span> <span id="s1164">I think about my father, what to think but the most important is really the episode --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: How he escaped to come back to find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Devotion and also the courage.</span> <span id="s1167">Again he didn’t go like sheep to slaughter, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s1168">{To pull out boards --} Unfortunately he gambled, he should really not gone for me.</span> <span id="s1169">But he couldn’t live with the thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Without knowing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: He didn’t -- how will I manage to shelter a child.</span> <span id="s1172">He was saved by this woman, this peasant.</span> <span id="s1173">She didn’t ask any questions.</span> <span id="s1174">By the way, he didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1175">He was blond, green eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: That benefited you later in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: But my father was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: In terms of having a look that didn’t look Jewish, that helped you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, my father looked less like Jewish.</span> <span id="s1180">I had Semitic eyes don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1181">With me, really was luck that the Germans thought I’m Polish and the Poles thought I’m German but no one took me for their own, you know.</span> <span id="s1182">My boss questioned my eyes, Semitic eyes.</span> <span id="s1183">In college, I was always on the offensive instead of being on the defensive.</span> <span id="s1184">You know the book when the policeman followed me and I wanted to know if he’s just a womanizer or really --.</span> <span id="s1185">He followed me to the ladies’ room.</span> <span id="s1186">Instead to shiver and to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you have to follow me?</span> <span id="s1187">This is -- after all I knew who he is.</span> <span id="s1188">This put him off!</span> <span id="s1189">He was a police and like nothing he would have given me away.</span> <span id="s1190">In all instances like my boss, I start to say no and to deny and to be caught and to blush, I said most probably my grandmother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1191">He thought it’s the best joke.</span> <span id="s1192">You know this is how I was able.</span> <span id="s1193">We saw now a movie and I told Norman, it was very similar I acted.</span> <span id="s1194">Which was it, Norman, the last one that we saw?</span> <span id="s1195">Oh, you didn’t the movie ‘Shining Through’?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: When she acts like a spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Right, I saw the coming attractions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: The same.</span> <span id="s1200">Don’t forget I didn’t have any experience and I was 17, 18 but somehow my logic in this dictated me to act like it is.</span> <span id="s1201">My father had a good chance.</span> <span id="s1202">He had a very good command of Polish and because we didn’t speak Yiddish, he didn’t have the singsong like I don’t have.</span> <span id="s1203">I don’t have in my Polish and I don’t have in my English.</span> <span id="s1204">This helped a lot because if you have the singsong, immediately they recognize it.</span> <span id="s1205">Many looked not Jewish but they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1206">So please put</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: (TAPE STOPS ABRUPTLY HERE)</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Interview with Norman Salsitz</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">By Carmit Kurn</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">About Rozia Susskind</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: What do you want me to tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Tell me about Rozia</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Rozia was born in Kollupzowa in 1922.</span> <span id="s1214">In March, well, it doesn’t make a difference.</span> <span id="s1215">I don’t remember the date, but I know it was in March 1922.</span> <span id="s1216">Their father had a flourmill in the lumber mill and they were not ultra, well, let’s forget about the orthodoxy.</span> <span id="s1217">She went to Kollupzowa to public school.</span> <span id="s1218">After public school she started to work for somebody who was a seamstress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Was she an apprentice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: She was an apprentice.</span> <span id="s1221">She wanted not for a profession but just to know how to dress, to fix and all those things.</span> <span id="s1222">This was a neighbor of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: How old was she when she did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: She was on this time, no before the apprentice, when she was in the public school she also attended Basiankov (?)</span> <span id="s1225">.</span> <span id="s1226">Basiankov is a religious school for girls and when she finished Basiankov, she must have been at this time about 15 years old.</span> <span id="s1227">And then later she started to be an apprentice by this woman who was a neighbor of theirs and she start to learn how to sew and those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Did she have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yes, she had one sister which she’s alive.</span> <span id="s1230">The sister, the name was Hanka and Hanka, after she finished gymnasium, means high school, she went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1231">Then she had a brother and after the brother finished gymnasium, which was high school, he worked in a bank.</span> <span id="s1232">That was the only Jewish bank in Kollupzowa and the brother worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: His name was Yanik.</span> <span id="s1235">Now Hanka with her husband survived the war in Russia.</span> <span id="s1236">They were sent away to Russia and Rozia’s father and Yanik went with them together and they all survived in Siberia in Russia.</span> <span id="s1237">Rozia was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: When Rozia was 15, it was 1938 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Right when she started apprenticing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No, she started apprenticing earlier.</span> <span id="s1242">She started in 1936 I would say.</span> <span id="s1243">In 1936.</span> <span id="s1244">And she with this woman who had this place she was there about three years and then the war started.</span> <span id="s1245">Rozia, when the war started, the sister Hanka, with her husband, they lived in Kracow, they came to Kollupzowa to escape the Germans, they escaped to the East and they came to Kollupzowa so the father and the brother went with them to escape to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1246">Hanka, the husband, and the brother and the father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: What about Rozia’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Rozia’s mother was left home because on this time the Jews thought the woman can be saved because nobody thought they would do anything to a woman, they thought only to the men.</span> <span id="s1249">So she remained home.</span> <span id="s1250">Her mother didn’t feel so good so they remained home.</span> <span id="s1251">And, well, you don’t want to bring me in I have nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Well, when did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I met her when I was 13 years old, she was 11 years old, I fell in love with her, and I didn’t speak to her because we couldn’t speak to girls.</span> <span id="s1254">I was a Hassidic boy until I was about 17, 18 years, the first time I spoke to her.</span> <span id="s1255">But I always had her in my mind and when I escaped to Russia she remained home and then I was in Russia for three months.</span> <span id="s1256">Then one day somebody came and told me that her mother is gravely ill and I decided to come home.</span> <span id="s1257">They said not to tell it to her brother, to her father and to her sister because if you would tell it to them they were afraid they would come back and they didn’t want they should come back to the German side, because they were on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1258">But the day I was told I decided to go home.</span> <span id="s1259">I thought she is alone, she is sick I will go home and I came home on a Sunday and Tuesday her mother died.</span> <span id="s1260">I saw her Sunday when I came home; she hardly recognized me, and I told her I gave her regards from the husband and son and the daughter and the son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1261">Tuesday she died, she died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1262">So Rozia…</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: And this was in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: This was already in January 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: What was the situation then in Kollupzowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Well in January ’40, it was the situation was the Germans started Jews to work and to harass Jews.</span> <span id="s1267">But nobody knew and nobody thought that such a thing can be like extermination of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1268">They took Jews to work to forced labor.</span> <span id="s1269">I was with the Germans before I escaped to Russia.</span> <span id="s1270">I was with the Germans for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1271">After when they occupied my town, then later I escaped to the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1272">But when I came back the situation settled a little.</span> <span id="s1273">The Jews had to work every day or they didn’t have the quota so they went from house to house and they took out the Jews and they had to do all kinds of work.</span> <span id="s1274">This was in winter so mostly the Jews were used to clean up the roads from snow, they cleaned the streets.</span> <span id="s1275">But we knew the Germans were there but the Jews were still in their homes, they still had businesses.</span> <span id="s1276">It was just in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: So, now what was Rozia doing during this time after her family left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: After her family left she was with her mother.</span> <span id="s1279">Her mother was very sick so she was with her mother.</span> <span id="s1280">Now when I came back and her mother died and she was left alone.</span> <span id="s1281">She was in this time 18 years old, so and uncle took care of her.</span> <span id="s1282">Because there was a house, two houses, the business was a family business.</span> <span id="s1283">Like two uncles and her father, so they took her in.</span> <span id="s1284">She was still in her apartment, but she ate by them and they took care of her.</span> <span id="s1285">Then she didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1286">By the Germans if they started to take people to work, usually Rozia was not taken to work because she lived not in the town, this was in the outskirts and the Germans didn’t go to catch Jews to work because they were mostly like Poles and they didn’t take the Poles.</span> <span id="s1287">So they didn’t know if there are Jews.</span> <span id="s1288">So she actually didn’t go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Her uncles did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Also no, because they were far away from the town.</span> <span id="s1291">Her, only had one uncle, his name was Kila Schmidt, he was an elderly man and he was a very, very intelligent man with a grey beard.</span> <span id="s1292">He was taken from time to time.</span> <span id="s1293">Only when the Poles showed the Germans that there are Jews living there.</span> <span id="s1294">Because mostly they caught the Jews when it was a very concentration where the Jews were living.</span> <span id="s1295">So he was brought to work and they humiliated him because he was an elderly man.</span> <span id="s1296">And I remember one time they put on him like a bottle on his back and he had to take water and carry it in the bottle.</span> <span id="s1297">One time they took a wagon and they harnessed him to the wagon instead of the horse and he had to pull the wagon and there were a few German soldiers were sitting on the wagon and they used to hit him that he should go faster.</span> <span id="s1298">He was an old man.</span> <span id="s1299">So I remember a few times when the uncle was humiliated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: And her uncle, did he live in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No he lived in the same house, the same place.</span> <span id="s1302">Because they had two houses which belonged to this flourmill and the lumber yard.</span> <span id="s1303">So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this time.</span> <span id="s1304">And this house she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite often, practically every day.</span> <span id="s1305">And if she needed something I took care of it.</span> <span id="s1306">And she lived there with the family ‘till June 1941, was established a ghetto in our town, so she was taken with the family to that ghetto.</span> <span id="s1307">They got two rooms in a house in the ghetto and she lived with the two uncles, the aunts with their children in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: You were in the ghetto too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: I was in the ghetto too, so when in the ghetto, there was a different system.</span> <span id="s1310">The Germans didn’t go out and grab people, Jews from the houses in the streets to go to work, it was already organized.</span> <span id="s1311">There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they divided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work.</span> <span id="s1312">This way not the same Jews should be called every day.</span> <span id="s1313">So when it came to Rozia’s time so she was notified and she went to work like other Jews went to work, cleaning houses by Germans, cleaning the streets, throwing away snow in the winter.</span> <span id="s1314">She did all kinds of work the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Let me just check this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: O,K.</span> <span id="s1317">Then we lived like this in the ghetto and then later I was taken away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1318">This was in January ’42 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I had a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the ghetto so she had to go with me with my younger sister to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1319">But the day we had to go by sled in the very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature, so she didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1320">But when I was in the hospital and I was operated, about two weeks later she came to this town to the big town, somehow she got a pass because you couldn’t travel by train, you couldn’t go out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1321">We were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1322">So she got a pass and she came to me to the town where I was in the hospital and I think this was the most happiest day in this time that she arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to Tarnov.</span> <span id="s1324">I wasn’t sent.</span> <span id="s1325">I was with an ear infection over four weeks.</span> <span id="s1326">Instead to take care, we didn’t have nobody to take care and it got worse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no way.</span> <span id="s1327">I was practically dead.</span> <span id="s1328">So with a sled they took me out of the ghetto to _______, to a bigger town and we came to ____________ and we came to ______, to a doctor, there was a specialist to an ear, nose and throat, Dr. Heller, and he said if I did not get an operation within two hours, three hours, I would be dead because the pus was already around my membrane, from the brain.</span> <span id="s1329">So through, my brother went back home and finally they bribed somebody and we got a pass to go on the train, because to this town we had to go to Kracow, so two sisters went with me.</span> <span id="s1330">On the train Poles wanted to throw me out from the running train.</span> <span id="s1331">So they called the police and the police saw that we had legitimate passes, so the police said what do you want, they have legitimate passes because we got the passes.</span> <span id="s1332">So the Poles said, nevertheless you have to throw them out because no Jews are allowed on the train.</span> <span id="s1333">So we begged them, the police, we begged the police, we begged the police to let us stay ‘till the next station.</span> <span id="s1334">Not to throw us out from a running train.</span> <span id="s1335">They said I am almost dead.</span> <span id="s1336">So the police said O.K., so we sent to the next station which was Tarnov, this was half way from us to Kracow and they took us down, they had to carry me to some friends, because I was almost dead.</span> <span id="s1337">And there was a hospital and luckily in Tarnov, there was a doctor, and his name was David Robinovitch.</span> <span id="s1338">He used to be the head of a very famous hospital in Lodz but the name of the hospital was _________ and he was a specialist, ear, throat, nose.</span> <span id="s1339">So when they brought me over to him, he said he doesn’t think he can do anything to me, that it is too late because I was already with this ear infection for about four or five weeks and the pain was so that people cannot imagine how that pained.</span> <span id="s1340">So he said we have nothing what to lose we have to have an operation right away.</span> <span id="s1341">And he took him about six hours and he operated me and he said to my sisters, he said I made the operation but ninety-nine percent he wouldn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s1342">And if he would even wake up all his mouth would be crooked or his eyes he wouldn’t see or his ears, because it was impossible because everything was already full with pus.</span> <span id="s1343">Anyway when I woke up after eight days when he took off the bandages I can hear on this ear better than on the other one.</span> <span id="s1344">The eyes are good, the mouth is good.</span> <span id="s1345">He was a genius that he made this operation, and then a few days later, Rozia came.</span> <span id="s1346">When she came naturally I was very happy and I was in this town, in Tarnov, I was February, March, ‘till April 20 or April 12, 1942, because until he had to clean.</span> <span id="s1347">Meanwhile she was with me all the time and then she had always trouble with her tonsils, so she complained so the doctor said once you are here he operated, he took out her tonsils.</span> <span id="s1348">Now he wanted money, but from Rozia he didn’t want a penny, because from me we had to pay him a lot of money for the operation and for Rozia he said he would do the operation without money.</span> <span id="s1349">So we asked him how come.</span> <span id="s1350">He said well when you came and you started to tell me stories and your sisters, so I could get money out from you.</span> <span id="s1351">With Rozia she had nobody, her mother died, her father, sister and brother were in Russia, where would she have money.</span> <span id="s1352">So I need people like you, they should pay me for people who cannot pay me.</span> <span id="s1353">So I do operations for free.</span> <span id="s1354">So he operated on Rozia and took off her tonsils, she shouldn’t owe us because every few months he had infections in the tonsils and we came home both together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: So when was it you went back to Kollupzowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: So we came back from this town, from this hospital, we came back to Kollupzowa.</span> <span id="s1357">When we came back, the ghetto was all together changed, we couldn’t recognize the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1358">It was already so far, the gates were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father, they shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and then later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and killings.</span> <span id="s1359">Until June the 20th we were chased out from our ghetto, from Kollupzowa, to a larger ghetto, to _______ and in _____...</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: How was Rozia’s family, all her uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: All her uncles were alive, she was staying with her uncles, all her uncles were alive and when we were all chased out to this larger, she went with her uncles and we were in this larger town from about June 20th ‘till July 7th.</span> <span id="s1362">July 7th they started Axias, means transportation from Rzeszow to Belzec, and with this first action, this was July the 7th, my family was taken and naturally Rozia with her uncles were taken the same day to Belzec and she perished in Belzec.</span> <span id="s1363">I don’t know exactly the date, but it could be a day or two or three days the most after July the 7th.</span> <span id="s1364">But was mostly the trip to Belzec from us, took about five hours, and sometimes they had to wait in line because there were so many trains waiting, so they should be next exterminated.</span> <span id="s1365">This was one of the first death camps that they didn’t have gas chambers, they suffocated the people when they put them in hermetic closed chambers and they pumped in carbon monoxide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: From trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: From trucks.</span> <span id="s1368">Not so much in trucks as from Russian tanks.</span> <span id="s1369">And then later when they choked to death which took quite a long time, it took about twenty to twenty-five minutes, they took them out.</span> <span id="s1370">They didn’t cremate the people in this time yet, because this was right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1371">But they had very big ditches.</span> <span id="s1372">Those ditches were made because this was near the German/Russian border, before 1941 when Germany attacked Russia so they had anti-tank ditches so they filled up those ditches with people and they covered them with sand.</span> <span id="s1373">Then later they took kerosene and they burned them.</span> <span id="s1374">So this is how she perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Did you lose track of her once you left Rzeszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Well when they left the ghetto they were in Rzeszow for a few weeks, not a few weeks about two weeks, no I had contact with them same as with my family but when they took them to Belzec we didn’t know, so we hired a friendly Pole and the friendly Pole we sent him on the same track that the trains went so it took him two weeks and he came back and through people he found out they were taken to a place called Belzec and supposedly they were killed in Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: She was taken there, you weren’t taken there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: I wasn’t taken because what happened is my family was taken there but when they were taken, so this man who was the head from the Gestapo in our town he organized a camp.</span> <span id="s1379">If you read, everything is in the book.</span> <span id="s1380">He organized a camp, a labor camp in Kollupzowa, and he brought back hundred young Jews and me he established in our house of prayers or synagogue.</span> <span id="s1381">He established a camp.</span> <span id="s1382">And the reason he brought us back is because he wanted to destroy the ghetto, because they didn’t want to leave anything that was Jewish, so we lived in the synagogue and made the camp and every day went out and we destroyed house by house.</span> <span id="s1383">And it’s exactly the description how the destruction went on in the book.</span> <span id="s1384">Because we had to go together to Belzec, but they took out hundred from our town and we went back and when we saw we had nothing left.</span> <span id="s1385">After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the woods and this is how I survived.</span> <span id="s1386">Otherwise we would be taken to Belzec the same thing as all the people, because they accumulated in Rzeszow about hundred thousand Jews from all towns who surround Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1387">Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one place where there is a railroad station.</span> <span id="s1388">Now they told the Jews that they can take along with them anything they want.</span> <span id="s1389">So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything and later when they took them away to Belzec all their stuff was left in the town in the ghetto and the Germans had it in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: In Rzeszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: In Rzeszow and they later took it to their warehouses and the things that they needed they took away and the rest they gave to Poles.</span> <span id="s1392">The other thing I wanted to mention about Rozia, when we saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1393">You see I had a younger sister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s1394">She spoke a few languages.</span> <span id="s1395">She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Was this Rachel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Rachel.</span> <span id="s1398">And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should escape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their houses, from their town in Pozna.</span> <span id="s1399">Pozna was a town that it was next to the German Reich.</span> <span id="s1400">This was from western border in Poland and they came to our town and they opened a little store in our town in the beginning of the war, and became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1401">And they had a son a little older than I was, about five years older, and we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1402">So he begged my mother and Rachel, they would move away from our town to a different town and they would make believe that her son is a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to survive with them.</span> <span id="s1403">When they told us this, we thought it’s a very good idea and then I came to Rozia and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan.</span> <span id="s1404">She had blue-greenish eyes and she had gold hair and she didn’t look at all Jewish.</span> <span id="s1405">So I told her, let’s make arrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them and we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister.</span> <span id="s1406">We’ll make false papers, it means that she’s married to this Pole and you will go away with them.</span> <span id="s1407">We talked and talked and she somehow was afraid.</span> <span id="s1408">She said, I cannot take a chance.</span> <span id="s1409">I am afraid.</span> <span id="s1410">I do not have guts to do it.</span> <span id="s1411">She said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you can do it.</span> <span id="s1412">So Rachel didn’t want to go because she didn’t want to leave the family.</span> <span id="s1413">And Rozia was afraid, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s1414">Maybe if she wouldn’t be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow leave the family and go.</span> <span id="s1415">Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to be saved.</span> <span id="s1416">When the ghetto was established, they brought into our town Arbeits Amt.</span> <span id="s1417">Arbeits Amt means a German labor office to register all the working people and the head of it was a German, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could write German.</span> <span id="s1418">My sister spoke beautiful German.</span> <span id="s1419">So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his secretary, and she worked with him.</span> <span id="s1420">They became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1421">He liked her very much.</span> <span id="s1422">She was a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our ghetto to Rzeszow, naturally this Arbeits Ant didn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s1423">So in Rzeszow, in the ghetto, somehow on the street he met my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from Rzeszow and I am now the head of the Arbeits Amt in Rzeszow and I need a secretary.</span> <span id="s1424">Why don’t you become again my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away.</span> <span id="s1425">So she said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother.</span> <span id="s1426">My father was already shot.</span> <span id="s1427">He said well I can only save you not the other ones.</span> <span id="s1428">So she didn’t want.</span> <span id="s1429">So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was a curse for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1430">Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run away, or do something, but they wouldn’t do it because they didn’t want to leave their families, their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s1431">So this time she didn’t want to go away if he wouldn’t give the permit to them to be left.</span> <span id="s1432">So we’re talking about, we went away a little from Rozia, but this is how she perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: How did you find out about Rozia’s family in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Well when I went to Russia, when I escaped to Russia, I knew that they are there.</span> <span id="s1435">So we went to Lemberg, Lvov.</span> <span id="s1436">In Lemberg everybody from each town knew about somebody else who was there.</span> <span id="s1437">So we got acquainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: And later, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: After the war they were in Siberia and during the war before Germany attacked Russia they used to send cards to Rozia from Siberia.</span> <span id="s1440">So we answered them a letters.</span> <span id="s1441">Then after the liberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to Rozia to Kollupzowa and they wanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in ______ because they were released from the ______.</span> <span id="s1442">And they wrote a letter, so I got the address.</span> <span id="s1443">I wasn’t in Kollupzowa, and somebody in Kollupzowa who received this card brought it to me.</span> <span id="s1444">I was already in this time in the army in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1445">So they brought me the card what they wrote to Rozia.</span> <span id="s1446">So I had their address, so I wrote them the letter.</span> <span id="s1447">And I remember the first letter.</span> <span id="s1448">I told them that from the whole town only nine people survived and I told them who and I told them that Rozia didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1449">And since then we were in contact with each other.</span> <span id="s1450">When they came back from Russia, so they came to Poland, but in this time when they came to Poland, I was already out I escaped before.</span> <span id="s1451">And we were in contact then the family went to Palestine, we were in contact.</span> <span id="s1452">The brother went to Santo Domingo, from Santo Domingo he came over here.</span> <span id="s1453">In the beginning I had a business so somehow I managed to take him in the business and he lives here in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1454">He got married.</span> <span id="s1455">My wife was the matchmaker when He got married because his wife was a Hebrew teacher together with my wife and when he came over he couldn’t stay here.</span> <span id="s1456">If he wouldn’t be married to an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1457">And because she was a Hebrew teacher, they got married and this way he could stay.</span> <span id="s1458">Now they have two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: The rest of Rozia’s family went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1461">The father went to Israel, he died there and the sister with her husband and her two children, so they are in Israel.</span> <span id="s1462">They are in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1463">And this is how.</span> <span id="s1464">It’s the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: I’m thinking in terms of the ID cards.</span> <span id="s1466">If you can remember something about Rozia, the story about her before the war, about ’35 to ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Well, from ’35 to ’39 the only story I can remember is that, because I was not in contact with her, because I couldn’t speak to her, I was a Hassidic boy and we had nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1468">I remember she had an uncle and the uncle used to go every Friday to the steam bath.</span> <span id="s1469">He was an elderly man.</span> <span id="s1470">This was the man who the German, he was always sitting, he could not go down for cold water in the steam bath, so I was near him and every time he needed a bucket with cold water, I used to bring it to him.</span> <span id="s1471">Not so much that I liked him, but I figured this would bring me closer to Rozia.</span> <span id="s1472">Also he used to tell stories.</span> <span id="s1473">He was a philosopher.</span> <span id="s1474">So sometimes he caught me with my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy.</span> <span id="s1475">Nobody wanted to listen.</span> <span id="s1476">I always was standing there listening to him because again the same stories.</span> <span id="s1477">But special about Rozia, yes, also this may be interesting.</span> <span id="s1478">After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I started to see Rozia, we joined the Hanoar Hotzioni, this is a youth, Israeli Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1479">And I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my sister Rachel, was the head of this group in our town and then later when I wasn’t anymore Hassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization.</span> <span id="s1480">And we got together and we sang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my happiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1481">So that’s all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: How long did she belong to the youth movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two years.</span> <span id="s1484">I would say ’38 and half ’39.</span> <span id="s1485">And then the war started.</span> <span id="s1486">Then in 1939 I wanted to go to Palestine, but I couldn’t so I made contact to go to Palestine illegal.</span> <span id="s1487">You paid in 500 zlotys and they took you to Romania and from Romania, illegal on a ship to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1488">So I remember with a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn’t have the money so I remember his mother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money.</span> <span id="s1489">We sent in the money and we waited any day to go.</span> <span id="s1490">We got letters and then we didn’t go because the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1491">And during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to Palestine the first thing I would see to make arrangements for Rozia to come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: She wanted to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: She wanted to go, yes.</span> <span id="s1494">Well this was everything quietly.</span> <span id="s1495">I didn’t tell it to my family, she didn’t tell it to her family.</span> <span id="s1496">But between us we made plans to go and to settle in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1497">Also, in the beginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody wants to go to America and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to America.</span> <span id="s1498">And this was during the war.</span> <span id="s1499">You had to send in so much money to be registered but you had to have blood relations.</span> <span id="s1500">Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel, registered and I registered with Rozia and I registered that we were married, because we said in case this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go.</span> <span id="s1501">So we sent in some money and later we didn’t hear anything about it.</span> <span id="s1502">So my sister, Rachel, had a Chusen (?)</span> <span id="s1503">, so he came to America a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1504">She could come before but she waited for him.</span> <span id="s1505">Listen, you only need half a page, but I don’t know what you would pick out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: I think that’s fine and I’ll call you if I have questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: All right, if you have it, or you can send me a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: You can send me a copy by normal mail.</span> <span id="s1510">You can send it and I will correct it or something and then later I will correct it and I’ll send it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Now, I just want to ask one or two more things.</span> <span id="s1512">Maybe you can describe to me where Rozia lived, maybe the house she lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: O.K.</span> <span id="s1514">They lived, mostly Jews lived in the town.</span> <span id="s1515">Mostly Jews lived around the market place and the market place all houses were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1516">Only four houses in the market place, which was very big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not rich, were very poor lived around the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1517">They were small crooked houses, old houses falling down.</span> <span id="s1518">Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile out of town on the road to go to Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1519">And they lived there and they had two houses.</span> <span id="s1520">Three families had two houses.</span> <span id="s1521">There was a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s1522">Her parents.</span> <span id="s1523">Her mother had a sister and a brother and they were all in the business.</span> <span id="s1524">In the business before the war and they lived in those houses.</span> <span id="s1525">They were nice houses.</span> <span id="s1526">It’s not comparison like we have in America because there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s1527">But the houses were nice with beautiful gardens with flowers.</span> <span id="s1528">Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was Mrs. Smith, she was very particular in her garden.</span> <span id="s1529">She always worked, with beautiful flowers and every time there was a concourse, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest, her flowers were the nicest.</span> <span id="s1530">She didn’t have children so she had the flowers.</span> <span id="s1531">So they lived there, like I said.</span> <span id="s1532">The only thing they had more than we in the town, we didn’t have electricity, they had electricity.</span> <span id="s1533">The reason why is because they had electricity from the mills because they had there the generators, so they had electricity for themselves.</span> <span id="s1534">So for us it was something important because when we come we saw electricity.</span> <span id="s1535">They had very beautiful homes, very nicely furnished.</span> <span id="s1536">But for our town it was nice.</span> <span id="s1537">But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Was the mill fairly successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: It was successful, but later it fell down because in the beginning of the ‘30’s it was a fire, there was a big fire in the mill and they somehow could never recuperate, they could never build themselves up as it was before the fire.</span> <span id="s1540">So it was not so big, it was a small flourmill and a small lumber mill, it was not big.</span> <span id="s1541">It wasn’t that they manufactured to send out for export like other mills, it was mostly for domestic use.</span> <span id="s1542">Peasants needed to have flour brought over some grain but it was not successful after the fire, it was not successful.</span> <span id="s1543">But it was a very prominent family.</span> <span id="s1544">They were a little more modern than the majority people in our town.</span> <span id="s1545">The majority people were very orthodox and they were already a little more progressive, like you could see like Rozia’s sister and brother already went to gymnasia, my sisters didn’t go because my father would never allow us to go on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s1546">Rozia didn’t go anymore to the gymnasia but her brothers went.</span> <span id="s1547">The reason Rozia didn’t go to the gymnasia because this was after the fire and probably this was quite expensive because it was a private gymnasia, private high school, and probably it was too expensive for them to send Rozia to the gymnasia.</span> <span id="s1548">So instead of the gymnasia, so after she finished the ________ she went to a seamstress to learn how to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: The seamstress worked in town or next door to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Well, not far from them.</span> <span id="s1551">There was a seamstress, she was special, a very elegant seamstress.</span> <span id="s1552">She was from Kollupzowa originally and later she moved to Vienna and she had a workshop in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1553">.</span> <span id="s1554">Later she came back when Hitler started to, when Hitler came to power in Germany because her husband was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1555">His name was Rosner.</span> <span id="s1556">So her husband was Jewish and she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1557">But anyway because when they started with all the laws in Germany and Vienna, so she figured she didn’t want to wait so she came back home.</span> <span id="s1558">The woman by whom she worked.</span> <span id="s1559">So see I know all those stories, I don’t know what else I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: I think that’s good.</span> <span id="s1561">.</span> <span id="s1562">So they were sewing like dresses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Well, mostly they were sewing to order.</span> <span id="s1564">If somebody wanted to have elegant nice dress, but they didn’t sew dresses to sell or something, this was only to people from the town would come.</span> <span id="s1565">Not the average person because average person went to somebody who was cheaper, but somebody who wanted to have a very elegant dress, a very elegant suit, women, so they came to her.</span> <span id="s1566">Because her being already having already a workshop in Vienna, she was a little more sophisticated.</span> <span id="s1567">And then Rozia after the war and before the war she was very capable.</span> <span id="s1568">She did all her dresses herself.</span> <span id="s1569">She was very good at it and then later when her sister left for Russia, so she left all her clothing with her because they wouldn’t take away, so later she fixed them over to fit for Rozia.</span> <span id="s1570">And then later when she needed to eat, so she started to sell little by little what her sister left in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: So in the ghetto she had things from her family to sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: She had things from her family to sell, yes.</span> <span id="s1573">But she was by herself, so she ate with her uncle.</span> <span id="s1574">With her uncle who didn’t have no children and how they lived, they lived together.</span> <span id="s1575">I know I used to travel a lot and I used to go out in the ghetto, I took off always my armband, because I didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1576">So I used to go out and I used to bring in a lot of food to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1577">So every time they needed something, so I brought it for them.</span> <span id="s1578">This is how we went along.</span> <span id="s1579">If the Germans wouldn’t have a total destruction, a lot of people could survive.</span> <span id="s1580">You see Rozia had the big chance because she looked so much gentile and she spoke so good Polish.</span> <span id="s1581">Because her language actually was Polish.</span> <span id="s1582">They didn’t speak home Yiddish like the majority.</span> <span id="s1583">The majority Jews did.</span> <span id="s1584">Like for instance, in my home we spoke Yiddish, but nevertheless my sister spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1585">I spoke a good Polish because we spoke Polish in the business, in the store with the non-Polish population and my father was practically the only Jew with the long grey beard who spoke beautiful Polish.</span> <span id="s1586">But the majority people in our town didn’t speak good Polish.</span> <span id="s1587">But Rozia’s family spoke only Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Did Rozia speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s1590">She spoke always, I remember, when she came to us and sometimes she spoke to my father, so my father laughed and she always, well you speak Yiddish like a shiksa.</span> <span id="s1591">She spoke very bad.</span> <span id="s1592">She spoke German.</span> <span id="s1593">Everybody by us in our section spoke German because our section was Galicia and this belonged to Austria until the end of the First World War.</span> <span id="s1594">So everybody spoke Polish, I mean German.</span> <span id="s1595">But Yiddish, she didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s1596">She understood, but.</span> <span id="s1597">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: So when you two spoke it was in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: It was in Polish, yes.</span> <span id="s1600">And I remember even when she came to our house so my sisters, my mother spoke to her in Polish.</span> <span id="s1601">And late when she came to our house when we were in the ghetto and there were certain times that I brought over things that you couldn’t get in the ghetto, salami, a piece of cheese.</span> <span id="s1602">All I remember my brother in America sent through turkey, a package with chocolate, with salami with other goodies that you couldn’t get in the ghetto, and I would divide it for all the children.</span> <span id="s1603">When she made little pieces, she always included Rozia.</span> <span id="s1604">She said it was for her, she got also a part.</span> <span id="s1605">I remember it was Rozia’s birthday and I wanted to give her a present and I there was nothing to sell in the time of the war and my sister had a beautiful manicure set and she got it from her first boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1606">It was with initials R.S. so she gave it to me I should give it to Rozia.</span> <span id="s1607">My sister was Rachel Saleschutz and Rozia was Rozia Shiskin, and she said give it to Rozia.</span> <span id="s1608">Then later she said to me, well maybe I shouldn’t give it to you because this gift didn’t work out good for her, but nevertheless she gave it to me and I gave it to Rozia.</span> <span id="s1609">You see, we were very close and I was the youngest in the family and if I wanted something it was all right with the family.</span> <span id="s1610">See her family was different from my family.</span> <span id="s1611">My family was more Hassidic, ultra, ultra orthodox and their family was modern.</span> <span id="s1612">So this was a little bad, but later it didn’t make no difference.</span> <span id="s1613">It so happens that her brother, now in America, he’s very religious.</span> <span id="s1614">He goes every day to shul.</span> <span id="s1615">I don’t go.</span> <span id="s1616">I go once a year.</span> <span id="s1617">You know, it changed those things.</span> <span id="s1618">You don’t always have the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Well, that’s it.</span></p></body></html>
