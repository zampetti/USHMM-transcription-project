memories of Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">HF: Only vaguely.</span> <span id="s27">I remember going to school in Vienna, public school...</span></p> <p><span id="s28">NL: A public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">HF: Which was not very far from our house.</span> <span id="s30">I remember going to a small synagogue with my father.</span> <span id="s31">And I remember the last couple years before the Anschluss, of my grandparents living with us, who were refugees from Berlin, and they lived with us in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">NL: Ah ha.</span> <span id="s33">They left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">HF: They left Germany in 1937 and they came to live with us, in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: They thought it would be safer, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">HF: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s37">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s38">NL: And more protected.</span> <span id="s39">Both grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">HF: Both grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">NL: Now, do you remember anything about your parents’ relatives?</span> <span id="s42">Close relatives, sisters or brothers or...</span></p> <p><span id="s43">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">NL: Cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">HF: On my father’s side he had relatives in Poland, which we visited once in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">NL: What were your memories of that visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">HF: Well, it was a very small village in Poland where he came from, near Tarnow.</span> <span id="s48">And I just remember vaguely visiting with him.</span> <span id="s49">And then he had other relatives who lived in Krakow, and we visited there too, but I was a very young age at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">NL: Did you think your situation was better, more comfortable in Vienna?</span> <span id="s51">Or didn’t you make any comparison?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: But those folks remained in Poland as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">HF: No, they survived.</span> <span id="s55">They live in Israel now.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">NL: But they stayed in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">HF: Yeah, they stayed in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s59">And on Mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">HF: Mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NL: Did she have any sisters?</span> <span id="s62">Brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">HF: Mother had a sister and a brother who both emigrated to America during the Hitler period.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s65">HF: My uncle was interned in Mauthausen during Kristallnacht, but he was let out and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NL: Do you know what were the circumstances?</span> <span id="s69">Because that’s very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">HF: I think a lot of German Jews were let out after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s71">They had to promise to leave Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NL: Ahhh!</span></p> <p><span id="s73">HF: Within a very short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NL: Yes, I thought that was true just of the German concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HF: Well it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">NL: But obviously it was true for Mauthausen too.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">HF: I believe it was Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s78">I’m not too, I know he was let out on the assumption that he would leave Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NL: He would leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HF: Within a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NL: Do you know if it was difficult for them to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HF: They had visas to come to America and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NL: So they must have applied...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">HF: They had already Amer-, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: Very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">HF: Very early, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">NL: And you had said at one point I think in our discussion, sometimes it was easier for someone who was poor to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">HF: Yeah, but they had...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">NL: They had...</span></p> <p><span id="s90">HF: They had well-to-do relatives in California, from...</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HF: From his side of the family, although his mother remained behind and perished in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NL: She stayed behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s95">Because she had no papers.</span> <span id="s96">And later my grandmother also perished in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NL: Again for the same reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s99">She was, everybody left and she was, she stayed behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NL: Do you know what their last names...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">HF: Well my grandmother’s name was Hedwig Schwarz.</span> <span id="s102">I don’t know what my uncle’s, what his mother’s name was.</span> <span id="s103">I mean it was Herrscher.</span> <span id="s104">That was a family name.</span> <span id="s105">But what her first name was, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">NL: H-I-R-?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HF: H-E-R-R-S-C-H-E-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">NL: And they both perished...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">HF: In Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NL: In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s111">Sometimes this is helpful in setting up registers and there is a big organization of survivors of Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia, in London, and they might be interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">HF: But this happened, I mean, this happened in, I don’t know what year it happened.</span> <span id="s113">I really don’t have the documents for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: But you know this...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NL: Happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HF: We have documents.</span> <span id="s118">I have an aunt, my mother’s sister, who still lives in California, and she has, she knows about.</span> <span id="s119">There were documents sent to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s121">About their fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">HF: About their fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NL: Now about the school experience.</span> <span id="s124">Did you encounter any antisemitism in this Vienna public school that you attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">HF: Well, the time it was most obvious was in Vienna we had what you call Religionsunterricht, which means public religious education.</span> <span id="s126">And at that time the Jewish children got their Religionsunterricht separate from the non-Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">NL: This was after regular school or it was part of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HF: No, that was during, that was, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s129">That was during.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">NL: Once or twice a week or more often?</span> <span id="s131">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HF: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s133">I believe twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">NL: And what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">HF: Well the Jewish children learned Jewish subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NL: Including Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">HF: And, I don’t believe Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">NL: The Bible?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">HF: Yeah, Bible and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">NL: History.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">HF: History.</span> <span id="s142">And the non-, and that started very early in grammar school.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">NL: And it was taught by a Jewish teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">HF: Yeah, by, yeah.</span> <span id="s145">It was all, in Vienna everybody had to pay a Gemein-, a tax, like a..</span> <span id="s146">.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: Membership.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">HF: Membership tax to belong to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s149">And basically then the government paid the salary of teachers, Jewish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">NL: They came in just to teach these religious courses or...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">HF: Subjects, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">NL: Subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">HF: Subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: Or were they regular teachers who also taught these subjects?</span> <span id="s155">You had a different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">HF: It was a different person I think.</span> <span id="s157">And...the non-Jewish children were of course taught Christian subjects.</span> <span id="s158">And there was instilled all of the hatred against the Jews as being the killer of Christ.</span> <span id="s159">And that was the, and after this one hour was over, they was always trying to beating the Jews from the non-Jewish children.</span> <span id="s160">And I know I’m getting away from the subject, but my mother-in-law went to school in Stuttgart, in Germany.</span> <span id="s161">And we discussed this one time, she being about 30 years older than I am.</span> <span id="s162">She experienced exactly that same thing in Stuttgart thirty years earlier.</span> <span id="s163">So this was very, because you didn’t have a separation of church and state of being taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s165">And you felt the antisemitism particularly after these classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">It was, that’s the only type of antisemitism that I can remember as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NL: But I suppose there were comparatively few Jewish students in your pubic school.</span> <span id="s169">Or am I wrong?</span> <span id="s170">Did you have a goodly number of Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s172">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">NL: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">HF: We did not live in a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s175">I mean, there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">NL: It was mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">HF: We lived, Vienna is divided in what, 21, they call it Bezirk which is sections of the city or...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">NL: Neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">HF: Neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s180">And most Jews, as Polish Jews and the poor Jews lived in the second district, whereas we lived in the ninth district, which was, there were Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s181">And everybody, it was not a..</span> <span id="s182">.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">NL: Solely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">HF: City, yeah.</span> <span id="s185">There was a large Jewish population before World War II in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">HF: I think it was 100 and some thousand probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">NL: Yes, a very large population.</span> <span id="s189">And you, so you had non-Jewish playmates, do you remember, Mr. Finder?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">HF: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">NL: Jewish playmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">HF: No they, all my friends were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">NL: Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">HF: But in school of course it was mixed, schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">NL: Non-, mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">HF: Right.</span> <span id="s197">There were more non-Jews in class than Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">NL: And the synagogue that your father, your family, attended...?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">HF: My father attended a small...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NL: Was it Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HF: Small Orthodox.</span> <span id="s202">My father was Orthodox, came from an Orthodox background.</span> <span id="s203">My mother not.</span> <span id="s204">My mother came from a German, I would say maybe Reformed or...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NL: Reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">HF: Reformed.</span> <span id="s207">But when she married my father, she kept a strictly kosher household and so on.</span> <span id="s208">But she really was not from a Orthodox background.</span> <span id="s209">There was a larger synagogue not far from us, but my father preferred to go to a smaller synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s211">And were most of their friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">NL: They socialized mostly with...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">HF: Yes, mostly with Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">NL: Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">HF: [unclear] Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">NL: Friends.</span> <span id="s218">Would you say that they were fairly comfortable in Vienna, that they didn’t seem to be troubled by antisemitism in the early years of their marriage and in your early childhood period?</span> <span id="s219">Did your father suffer economically in his work because of any anti-Jewish feelings as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">HF: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s221">Why, I, although I believe there was always the tendency, as far as what I heard him say, that he was rather a, although he was Orthodox, modern in appearance.</span> <span id="s222">And when he spoke German well, he wrote German well, and he was an Austrian citizen.</span> <span id="s223">I mean, he came to Vienna as a young man.</span> <span id="s224">My mother was from a German background.</span> <span id="s225">And I think that the antisemitism or the antagonism against Jews was felt more among the Jews who still, you know, lived in the Jewish neighborhoods, who did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">NL: From eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">HF: Eastern European Jews who were still clinging mostly to the hasidic garbs, the beards.</span> <span id="s228">This was the impression that the population had of Jews, because my father would say many times that even people would say, didn’t even know that he was Jewish because he just...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NL: Seems like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s231">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">NL: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s233">The same thing of course happened in Germany, that the anger was very often directed against the Eastern European individuals...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s235">Because I remember he would, when after Hitler, I mean, after the Anschluss when the Germans came into Vienna and they used to, you know, just to antagonize the Jews.</span> <span id="s236">They would gather them up, all of a sudden a group of Jews on the street and they made them scrub the...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">NL: Pavement.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">HF: Pavement...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">HF: With water and lye and you would step on it.</span> <span id="s241">And like, people like my father, they would, someone would say to him, “Well why don’t you go away?</span> <span id="s242">You don’t belong here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s243">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">HF: Only...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">NL: They made a distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">HF: When, yeah, in their mind these were a different Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">NL: A different [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s249">A different, yeah.</span> <span id="s250">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">NL: When...as far as you can remember did you sense antisemitism in the general population?</span> <span id="s252">When was there some penetration of the Nazi movement in Viennese life?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">HF: The only thing I remember a little bit, and I was very young at the time, was in 1933 when they had the assassination of Dollfuss.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: The Chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">HF: The Chancellor.</span> <span id="s256">I remembered that yet vaguely.</span> <span id="s257">But otherwise I really cannot recall, except the events that happened in school with the antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">NL: These religion, after these other religious classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">HF: After, yeah.</span> <span id="s260">Otherwise I really personally did not feel anything.</span> <span id="s261">All, the only thing I remember of course, we were aware of the, what happened in Germany due to the fact that my grandparents came to...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">NL: Live with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">HF: To live with us.</span> <span id="s264">But prior to that, while Hitler was already in power in Germany, we went to visit them, to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NL: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">NL: Do you remember what they reported about their own life at the time?</span> <span id="s268">I guess you were too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">HF: No.</span> <span id="s270">That I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">NL: But their lives were not yet changed apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s273">And as a matter of fact, my uncle from Berlin, who they lived in Berlin too, before they were, they came to visit us also in Vienna nearly in 1936, ‘37.</span> <span id="s274">And there was no problem for Jews to travel.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe because they were German citizens.</span> <span id="s276">Now see, there is also a distinction between Eastern European Jews and German Jews or Austrian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">HF: Now to bring it one step further, my grandfather went back to Germany in 1937, because he wanted to liquidate what he had there.</span> <span id="s279">And while he was there, he suffered a heart attack and died.</span> <span id="s280">And my mother had no problem going to Germany for his funeral, from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">NL: From Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">HF: She...went to the funeral and...</span></p> <p><span id="s283">NL: No restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">HF: No restrictions whatsoever.</span> <span id="s285">And she...</span></p> <p><span id="s286">NL: So, you first felt the brunt of antisemitism then after the Anschluss, I presume.</span> <span id="s287">Or, was this happening before?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">Well, the knowledge we had of course through my grandparents, while my grandparents were living with us.</span> <span id="s290">I mean, why they left Germany.</span> <span id="s291">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s292">NL: But you didn’t anticipate a takeover?</span> <span id="s293">You...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">HF: I don’t know what my parents anticipated.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">NL: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s296">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s297">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">HF: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: Do you remember the Anschluss day?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">HF: Yeah, the Anschluss I remember very distinctly, because it happened on Friday night.</span> <span id="s301">And we didn’t know anything Friday night.</span> <span id="s302">Not even my parents knew anything Friday night.</span> <span id="s303">But we had school on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s304">And they were, all public schools were open Saturdays.</span> <span id="s305">And I remember going down on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s306">I was nine years old at the time.</span> <span id="s307">I wasn’t even...quite nine years old.</span> <span id="s308">I was just a month shy of being, I was, went to the third grade at the time.</span> <span id="s309">And I went down, and the first thing, we lived across [from] a girls’ school, a girls’ high school.</span> <span id="s310">And there was the German flag hanging there already.</span> <span id="s311">In one night there were all German flags hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">HF: And that was...something strange because I never had seen that.</span> <span id="s314">And I came to school, which was only, maybe five minutes’ walk from my house, and it was closed that day.</span> <span id="s315">And so when I came back, I told, my father even asked me, I remember him asking me, “Why do you come home from school?”</span> <span id="s316">And I said, “Well, there, the Germans are here and there is no school.”</span> <span id="s317">And he was not even aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">NL: Was he surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s320">Now, of course there was no, we didn’t have radios and television.</span> <span id="s321">You did not have all that instant news.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">NL: But there wasn’t any uproar in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">HF: Not...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NL: Or panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">HF: Where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">NL: Not where you lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">HF: We lived, I mean we did not live on the main thoroughfare.</span> <span id="s328">We lived on a side street.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">NL: But presumably the other Jews in the neighborhood didn’t know either?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">HF: To the best of my recollection my father and mother were not aware that it had happened, or whether they were aware that things were going on, I cannot, no, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">NL: Did they seem upset?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">HF: At that time?</span> <span id="s333">I cannot, all my recollections are that I came home and I told them that the German flags were hanging all over with the Hakenkreuz and the school was closed.</span> <span id="s334">And that’s all I remember really of that particular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">NL: And then what is your next memory, following the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">HF: Well, following the Anschluss not very long, much later rather, we were not able, the Jewish children had to go to a different school.</span> <span id="s337">The...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">NL: Oh, then let me ask.</span> <span id="s339">Were you able to resume your schooling the following week, and were you able to stay in the same class?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">HF: Yeah, no, we stayed in the same class for a short period of time, and then I had to go to a school which was much further away from my house, where only Jewish children went.</span> <span id="s341">And that was maybe April of 19-, the Anschluss was in March ‘4-, eh, ‘38, and this was maybe in April, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">NL: Do you remember if you were upset by that?</span> <span id="s343">Or was it just something that as a child you accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">HF: Just accepted.</span> <span id="s345">The only thing of course, I always heard my father telling me, you know, they would, they would, as people, Jews, were walking the street, they would grab a certain amount of Jews and they would make them scrub the streets and clean the sidewalks.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">NL: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">HF: I don’t remember seeing.</span> <span id="s348">I just remember my father telling me about it, that he got caught up in these things.</span> <span id="s349">And he would travel a lot in the countryside and he could not pursue that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">NL: He wasn’t able to continue his work.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">HF: No, to continue his work, because he wasn’t able to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">NL: He worked for a Jewish company or...</span></p> <p><span id="s353">HF: No, he worked for a non-Jewish company.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">NL: Non-Jewish company.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">HF: Non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">NL: So what sort of work, then, did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">HF: I guess he just traveled inside the city.</span> <span id="s358">He was not able to go out of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s360">And still able to make a living as far as you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">HF: For a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">NL: For a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">HF: And then my next recollection, the, there were a lot of refugees coming to Vienna from the countryside.</span> <span id="s366">They were expelled almost immediately, especially around Tyrol.</span> <span id="s367">And we had a lot of refugees streaming into Vienna, very shortly after the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">NL: And what provision was made for them, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">HF: Well, the Jewish community tried to provide for them in every way.</span> <span id="s370">I remember we had some who would come to our house for dinner.</span> <span id="s371">And we would take them in.</span> <span id="s372">They would eat and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">NL: So they were somehow absorbed.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">HF: They were, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">NL: Do you have any recollection of Jews leaving, or trying to leave the city?</span> <span id="s376">Or do you remember your parents discussing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">HF: Well I remember we all discussed, right away we discussed where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">NL: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s380">And one of the things we discussed was, we thought about Uganda.</span> <span id="s381">A lot of them were trying to flee to Uganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">NL: Your parents discussing that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s384">They were discussing, looking up on the map, where was Uganda and so on.</span> <span id="s385">And within...a very short time, I mean, my father made every effort to try to leave Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">NL: So he applied for papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">HF: Well we, our, actually, we left already in August...1938 we left Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NL: Oh, you left then, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">NL: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">HF: Well, we, I don’t know, well he was, wanted to leave, and I guess my mother wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s392">I remember them selling everything we had.</span> <span id="s393">And he had to stand in long lines to get all the necessary exit papers I know.</span> <span id="s394">One time he got kicked in his kidneys and he had to be hospitalized for a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">NL: Kicked by one of the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">HF: Yeah, because he had to stand in line, for days.</span> <span id="s397">He had to stand in line just to get all the documentation, permission to leave.</span> <span id="s398">Because you could get permission to leave, even if you had no where to go.</span> <span id="s399">That did not really matter that much to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NL: Well Eichmann was already in charge [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s401">HF: I mean, that, yeah.</span> <span id="s402">I mean, this is not some, certain, some of the things that I recollect.</span> <span id="s403">But I recollect that he was standing in line, he would come home late, he had to stand like all day in line, until he got all his papers together.</span> <span id="s404">And we left Vienna around the middle of August of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NL: And did your grandparents leave with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">HF: My grandfather died.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">NL: Oh, your grandfather died.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">HF: And my grandmother, she, through the Anschluss was, she did not want to stay in Vienna any longer, and she returned to Berlin.</span> <span id="s409">She said that within a very short time things happened in Vienna that took many years to develop in Germany, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s410">So she decided that’s what she wanted to go, she didn’t want to stay with us.</span> <span id="s411">She insisted on going back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NL: And did she have any place to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">HF: Well my, my mother’s sister, they lived in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">HF: They had, because they left for America in 1939.</span> <span id="s416">And my mother had a brother who still was, who left in 1939 for America.</span> <span id="s417">So she went back.</span> <span id="s418">She just said she, “This is much worse than Germany.”</span> <span id="s419">She just did not want to stay there.</span> <span id="s420">They, so she left for Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: Yes, apparently Eichmann speeded up all of these processes that as you said, had taken years in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">NL: Did you hear from her after that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">HF: Yeah, well, while we were still in Vienna we heard from her.</span> <span id="s425">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">NL: But after you left...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">HF: Later we...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">NL: Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">HF: Well, when we, we left Vienna in August, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">NL: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">HF: Well, we went to Köln, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NL: Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">HF: Cologne, yeah.</span> <span id="s434">Cologne, Germany.</span> <span id="s435">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s436">NL: Why did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">HF: Well, it was known at this time, I mean I found out, I mean, that’s how we went.</span> <span id="s438">Now how my father got the hint of it, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s439">That if you bought a ticket, a ship board ticket, to England, you could leave Germany into Holland—even if you had no visa to go into England.</span> <span id="s440">As long as you had a ticket to go to England, you could leave Germany.</span> <span id="s441">I mean, Germany would let you out.</span> <span id="s442">There was no question.</span> <span id="s443">And Holland would let you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">NL: With a ship ticket to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">HF: With a ship ticket to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">HF: So, we left.</span> <span id="s448">We went to Köln.</span> <span id="s449">As far as I remember we stayed a few days in Köln.</span> <span id="s450">We went from Köln to Aachen.</span> <span id="s451">Aachen?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">HF: And from Aachen we stayed I believe another day or so.</span> <span id="s454">And then we crossed the border, I mean, by train, into Holland.</span> <span id="s455">And we ended up in Breda.</span> <span id="s456">Breda is Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">NL: Breda.</span> <span id="s458">Holland, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">HF: Of course we got, we couldn’t take any money out, except ten Marks, I believe.</span> <span id="s460">And we were all searched on the border.</span> <span id="s461">Even though it was a charter it was searched.</span> <span id="s462">Everybody was searched.</span> <span id="s463">And we just took some, had some hand luggage.</span> <span id="s464">That’s all we had.</span> <span id="s465">And we went into Breda.</span> <span id="s466">Now it was known, for some reason, that if you smuggled yourself from Breda—I mean there’s no chance of getting to England if you had no papers—if you smuggled yourself illegally across the border, into Belgium, Belgium did not deport anybody to Germany.</span> <span id="s467">Now we could not stay in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">NL: You couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">HF: No.</span> <span id="s470">Holland did not absorb anybody, illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">NL: That was because of the government restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">NL: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">HF: But Belgium...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">HF: We ended up in Breda.</span> <span id="s477">We spent one night in Breda.</span> <span id="s478">And then, I don’t know, my father must have made some arrangements with the Jewish committee or somewhere.</span> <span id="s479">And we traveled to the border with Holland, with Belgium.</span> <span id="s480">Belgium to Holland.</span> <span id="s481">And I think, I believe it was by car.</span> <span id="s482">We got out of the car and there was a group of people.</span> <span id="s483">And we crossed the border on foot, from Holland into Belgium.</span> <span id="s484">And soon we were on the other side of the border.</span> <span id="s485">That same car picked us up again, and took us to Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">NL: Antwerp.</span> <span id="s487">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">HF: And we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">NL: You weren’t searched on the Belgian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">HF: No, we’re illegal.</span> <span id="s491">We’re illegal immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">NL: You were illegal immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">HF: Yeah, well we crossed the border illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">NL: But there were no guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">HF: There were only, there was no guards, I don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">NL: That you could...</span></p> <p><span id="s497">HF: Yeah, we even heard a patrol further away were some soldiers marching.</span> <span id="s498">but we just, I mean they were all official smugglers.</span> <span id="s499">I know “official,” I mean they were paid smugglers...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">NL: Paid smugglers.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">HF: Who smuggled people from Holland to...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">NL: Were you frightened during that time, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">HF: No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NL: You had your parents around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">HF: We had the parents and it was not such a big...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NL: Not so risky.</span> <span id="s507">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">HF: I mean nobody was shot.</span> <span id="s509">If they would have caught them they would have sent them back across the border.</span> <span id="s510">I mean it wasn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">NL: But you knew there was no deportation, from Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">HF: People apparently knew, back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">NL: Back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">HF: Now you could not go directly from Germany into Belgium, but you could get [unclear] the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">NL: And you had to be wise to all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">HF: Well, I mean, and so we ended up in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s517">And once we got to Antwerp, the Jewish Committee or the, would help the people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">NL: Were there many other Jews from...</span></p> <p><span id="s519">HF: Refugee Jews?</span> <span id="s520">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NL: Who were refugees, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">HF: And we could, then you could go to the police in Belgium and get official identification cards, and reside in Belgium, and they would not send anybody back, providing they did not catch you working.</span> <span id="s523">You were not allowed to take a job.</span> <span id="s524">Because they had high unemployment.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">NL: But the Jewish community...</span></p> <p><span id="s526">HF: Helped, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">NL: Provided for you.</span> <span id="s528">They provided you with some housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">HF: Well, they provided with housing the first couple days.</span> <span id="s530">But they provided with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NL: Money.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">HF: People rented their own apartments and...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NL: You found...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">HF: The population, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NL: You found a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">People did some odd work or...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">HF: But not official work.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">NL: Not official.</span> <span id="s541">And what did Father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">HF: He was not able to do very much.</span> <span id="s543">My mother was able to do more than...</span></p> <p><span id="s544">NL: What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">HF: Well, she worked.</span> <span id="s546">She did a little, some domestic work for rich, there were a lot of rich Jews in Belgium.</span> <span id="s547">She did some baking.</span> <span id="s548">She was, she did some, [unclear] she would go and bake cakes, something like that, and then she would do a lot of handy work, like belts and stuff.</span> <span id="s549">And my father would sell it, would go out and peddle it like.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">NL: Embroidery?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">HF: Not, yeah, some sort of embroidery.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">NL: Dressmaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">NL: Dressmaking.</span> <span id="s555">Hand, handiwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">HF: Yeah, handiwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">NL: And what happened to you?</span> <span id="s558">Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">HF: Well I thought, yeah, when it, a matter of fact, we went to a very religious school there.</span> <span id="s560">They had a very good Jewish day school in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s561">And I did not actually lose any...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">NL: Any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">HF: Any time.</span> <span id="s564">I went up to the third grade in Vienna, and I picked up right away to the fourth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">NL: But you had to speak a new language.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">HF: Well, we learned Dutch, which was not that, Dutch is not...</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NL: Not too hard for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">HF: Not too hard, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">NL: And that was the language of instruction in the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">HF: Well, half a day was Dutch, and half a day was Hebrew.</span> <span id="s571">Of course my Hebrew was not as strong as the children there either, but I had learned some Hebrew in Vienna.</span> <span id="s572">But I was able to master that.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">NL: And you made some friends at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s575">Well, it was a very active Jewish community.</span> <span id="s576">They were very helpful to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">NL: Helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s579">A matter of fact I always recall they were, there were women who would work in the kitchen, in soup kitchens—they had maids at home—would come and work in the soup kitchens for the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NL: ...of our interview with Mr. Herbert Finder.</span> <span id="s582">You were saying that the maids of some of the wealthy Jewish families came and cooked?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">HF: No, no, the women came.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">NL: The women themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">HF: The women themselves came who had maids at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">NL: Who had maids at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">HF: Maids at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">HF: They would help then.</span> <span id="s590">But most refugees within a very short time had their own apartments and where [unclear], to live somehow and manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">NL: And did you hear from your grandmother in Berlin during this time, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">HF: I don’t really recall, I, whether we did or not.</span> <span id="s593">Of course later we had a visit from one, from my mother’s brother who left for America to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s594">And he, a matter of fact he spent a couple days with us in Antwerp before he came to America.</span> <span id="s595">And while we were in Antwerp we applied for visas to come to the United States too, and we actually did receive visas in April, 1940, after we were already in Antwerp for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NL: For America.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">We had our visas, but we didn’t have any money for the ticket, because we were refugees.</span> <span id="s599">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">NL: Your parents couldn’t save enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">HF: No, we couldn’t save anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">NL: They couldn’t save anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">HF: And the way it was done in Antwerp, the HIAS would give people tickets, pay for the tickets to come to America.</span> <span id="s604">But visas for America were good for a period of four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">NL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">HF: And due that we received our visas in April, 1940, we were like on the list to come to America maybe around July of 1940.</span> <span id="s607">But in the meantime, on May 10, 1940, Hitler invaded Belgium, Holland, and France.</span> <span id="s608">So that’s why we got caught up in that dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NL: You were saying that you learned Dutch.</span> <span id="s610">Was that a language of instruction in the Belgian schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">HF: Well, Belgium actually divided in two halves.</span> <span id="s612">The Flemish section, and the French section.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">NL: Ah ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">HF: Now Antwerp is part of the Flemish section, the northern part of the country, where the official language is Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">HF: And the southern part of the country, the official language is French.</span> <span id="s617">But most people speak both languages there.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">NL: So you stayed in the school for several years, then...</span></p> <p><span id="s619">HF: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">NL: Until...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">HF: Two years.</span> <span id="s622">I went there in fourth grade and...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">NL: The spring of ‘40.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">HF: The fifth grade, until May 10, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">NL: Now, do you remember any discussions either with your playmates or with your parents about what was happening to Jews in Germany or elsewhere?</span> <span id="s626">Or do you think your parents knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">HF: Well, I believe they knew.</span> <span id="s628">I mean, by that time I was getting ten and eleven-year old.</span> <span id="s629">The only thing that I remember and which was very misleading to many Jews, the Jews in Belgium would always say, “Well, what happened in Poland and what happened in Germany will never happen here, and can never happen.”</span> <span id="s630">And that, they had such a lull in them that I don’t think any Jews from those countries really made an effort to leave Belgium or felt a threat to themselves due to what’s happening in Germany or Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NL: Also, well, I’m wondering, I know in America there was this myth about the invulnerability of the Maginot line.</span> <span id="s632">Did...of course that wouldn’t have protected Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">HF: No, because that’s one of the reasons why Hitler invaded the low country...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">HF: Because the Maginot line stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">NL: Stopped.</span> <span id="s637">And so you didn’t feel any protection from that.</span> <span id="s638">And you didn’t obviously expect an invasion [unclear] ?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">HF: As a child I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NL: But, I think that’s true also of the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">HF: Yeah, as a child I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s642">But that, I only remember that, always the saying by the Jews living there.</span> <span id="s643">Now most Jews in Belgium were Polish Jews, that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">NL: Ah ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">HF: Because in Belgium, unlike other countries, you never really became a Belgian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">NL: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">HF: Because the Jews could have, there were many Jews who lived in Belgium were Polish Jews from twenty years, and even their children, and they never became citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">NL: Was it because they didn’t want to or they couldn’t?</span> <span id="s649">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">HF: I believe they probably could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">NL: They couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s653">NL: My understanding is that about half the Jewish population was foreign, those who were Polish, and the other half Belgian born.</span> <span id="s654">I didn’t, but your impression was that most Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">HF: Well, it’s hard for me.</span> <span id="s656">I mean, the impressions were half...</span></p> <p><span id="s657">NL: But that was your impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">HF: But I only remember it that the difference was, you had different ID cards.</span> <span id="s659">They had different ID cards and they were allowed to work and had businesses.</span> <span id="s660">But they still were not citizens of Belgium.</span> <span id="s661">Now, maybe there were some, but most Jews that I remember meeting were Jews that really came from Poland.</span> <span id="s662">Although we had friends that came from Holland.</span> <span id="s663">There were Jews who came from Holland and lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s664">They were in the diamond business.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NL: Who emigrated?</span> <span id="s666">Oh, oh, who just emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">HF: Yeah, emigrated.</span> <span id="s668">But not, I mean it had nothing to do with the Hitler period.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">NL: Not...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">HF: They emigrated for...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">NL: Not out of any urgency.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">HF: It must have been economic reasons or what.</span> <span id="s673">Or they lived in...</span></p> <p><span id="s674">NL: Now, Mr. Finder, did conditions for your father improve within those two years so that he could earn a living a little more easily?</span> <span id="s675">Or was work still barred?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s677">NL: Work was barred.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">HF: Work was always barred, I mean officially work was barred.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">NL: Officially.</span> <span id="s680">So, then he and Mother just had to improvise in order to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s682">Yeah, they’d improvise.</span> <span id="s683">And of course everything was being temporary because with the hope of leaving for United States and...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">HF: And you had the visa applied and all of that.</span> <span id="s686">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">NL: Now, what happened to your family at the time of the invasion?</span> <span id="s688">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s689">You must remember that, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s691">Well, at the time of the invasion I remember distinct.</span> <span id="s692">The Jews that were German citizens, or Austrian citizens, had to report.</span> <span id="s693">And they were all arrested.</span> <span id="s694">They probably were con-, the Belgium government was afraid that there were some fifth column among them.</span> <span id="s695">So my father of course, being that he had a, [unclear] had a German passport, because when Austria was, after the Anschluss, I believe he had, he, from the Austrian passport he became, he got a German passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NL: What became part of the greater Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">HF: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">NL: The greater German Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">HF: So therefore he was arrested.</span> <span id="s700">And he was sent immediately to France, to southern France.</span> <span id="s701">All those Ger-, all Germans, he was classified, as far as Belgium was concerned, he was classified as German, and he was sent to southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">NL: And he was sent by the Belgians?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">NL: To work in a work battalion or was it just a deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">HF: No, no, it was not a question of work battalion.</span> <span id="s706">It was a question of removing all German...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">NL: All German Jews.</span> <span id="s708">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s709">HF: Citizens.</span> <span id="s710">Not Ger-, he was then really not classified as Jew, but Jews, but German.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">NL: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">HF: And to remove them from the front, or to remove them any contact.</span> <span id="s713">So that he ended up way, way in southern France in a camp, near the Pyrénees.</span> <span id="s714">Now I don’t remember the name of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">NL: But by himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">HF: Yeah, by him, all men.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">NL: All men.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">HF: All men, who were German.</span> <span id="s719">Now, with the refugees who came from Germany, like my uncle, my father’s brother was there, and he was stateless.</span> <span id="s720">He was never an Austrian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">HF: He was what they called stateless.</span> <span id="s723">He was not interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NL: He was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">HF: No, only...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NL: He was allowed to remain in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">HF: Well, we all left.</span> <span id="s728">In other words...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">NL: When your father left?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">HF: Well, after my father was left, two, three days later, before even the German occupied Antwerp, we fled.</span> <span id="s731">My mother, with me and my uncle, my father’s, we fled together.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">NL: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">HF: And we ended also up in southern France, within a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">HF: We were never under German occupation in Belgium.</span> <span id="s736">We fled to southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">NL: So this would have been about May 8th or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">HF: No, this, no, May 10th was the, this was like May 14th, 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">NL: Oh, after the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">HF: Yeah, after the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">NL: After the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">HF: After the invasion, but before...</span></p> <p><span id="s743">NL: Before...</span></p> <p><span id="s744">HF: The German troops reached Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s746">Did you know where your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">HF: No.</span> <span id="s748">No, we had no idea where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">NL: And what made you go to southern France?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">HF: Well, we just fled Ger-, we fled the German advance.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">NL: But, why not...</span></p> <p><span id="s752">HF: And it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s753">NL: Why not an effort to get to Paris?</span> <span id="s754">Was there something in...</span></p> <p><span id="s755">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">NL: The southern part that...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">HF: That the Ger-, we were, first we were, we were fleeing gradually towards the border of France, from Belgium we crossed into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">HF: But then they just gathered those refugees and put them on trains and just shipped them south.</span> <span id="s760">The French...</span></p> <p><span id="s761">NL: The French did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">HF: Shipped all the refugees south.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">HF: And we, we ended up in a small village near Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">NL: Do you remember the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">HF: Not where we ended up first, no.</span> <span id="s769">No.</span> <span id="s770">And there we were the, all the refugees were distributed among the farmers.</span> <span id="s771">Each farmer had to take in some, now just, not just Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s772">We were, all refugees were like distributed among the...</span></p> <p><span id="s773">NL: Ah, you were mixed, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">NL: The Jewish and non-Jewish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">HF: Yeah, among the farmers in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">NL: And who...did that diversion, the French?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">HF: The French government.</span> <span id="s779">That was all before actually the.</span> <span id="s780">.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">NL: Before the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">HF: Yeah, before even Hitler reached Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">NL: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s784">HF: He hadn’t even, I mean, we’re talking about the very early period.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">NL: Is it possible that this was a French resistance movement or do you think it was official government action?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">HF: No, this was before.</span> <span id="s787">This was while the war was actually still, while the fighting was still going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s789">But not the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">HF: It was just to...have, no, it was just a question of something to accommodate the refugees, what to do with refugees who came from Belgium and Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">NL: And what happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">HF: And northern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">NL: To you and Mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">NL: You went into the home of a farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">HF: So we were there, yeah, we were there a few days.</span> <span id="s797">And then it was announced that all refugees that were stateless, all the men that were even like stateless, had, were interned in camps.</span> <span id="s798">And that’s when my uncle, who was with us, my father’s younger brother, he was then interned in a camp.</span> <span id="s799">And he ended up in the same camp as my father later.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s802">NL: Just a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">HF: Yeah, well this I guess this maybe was the only camp, which, as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">NL: Oh, and you...</span></p> <p><span id="s805">HF: And my mother decided she did not want to stay there.</span> <span id="s806">And she went to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s807">We ended up in Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">NL: Were you hearing from Father at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">HF: No.</span> <span id="s810">At that time we didn’t even know anything yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">NL: No.</span> <span id="s812">So you and Mother went to Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s814">This was maybe, we were on the farm for a very few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s816">Were you treated fairly well by the French?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">HF: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s818">Of course we had, there was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s819">We didn’t speak French and they didn’t speak anything else.</span> <span id="s820">But we didn’t, she didn’t like it and she thought it would be better if we ended up in Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">NL: She was a city lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">NL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s824">And did you know anyone in Toulouse?</span> <span id="s825">Did she know anyone who took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">HF: No, it was just...there again the Jewish Committees started to take care of...</span></p> <p><span id="s827">NL: There were other refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">HF: Oh yeah, a lot of refugees ending up in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s829">And then it was very hard for her to take care of me.</span> <span id="s830">I remember we lived in a hotel room.</span> <span id="s831">It was with four other women, you know, who also their husbands were in camps.</span> <span id="s832">And we got to know this French Jewish farmer.</span> <span id="s833">He was actually not French.</span> <span id="s834">He came originally from Russia.</span> <span id="s835">And he had emigrated from Russia to Palestine, in the ‘20s.</span> <span id="s836">And he contracted there malaria.</span> <span id="s837">And after he had malaria he could not stay in Palestine.</span> <span id="s838">He married also a woman who was from Odessa, a Jewish woman, and they came then from Palestine to southern France, in the very early ‘30s, and they established a farm, 25 kilometers from Toulouse.</span> <span id="s839">And they took refugees to their farm—part to work, part to take care of them.</span> <span id="s840">They were very, they had no children.</span> <span id="s841">They were very benevolent people, very.</span> <span id="s842">And they took me as a..</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">I was 11 years at this time.</span> <span id="s845">And I went...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NL: Mother stayed in Toulouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">HF: My mother stayed because she wanted to find out what happened to my father and be more in contact.</span> <span id="s848">And that was already in May, 1940, that I went to live with these Jewish, Russian-Jewish farmers in France, in a small village in, 25 kilometers from Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">NL: Did you work on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">HF: Well, we went to school.</span> <span id="s851">[unclear] by that...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">NL: You went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">HF: And when the next school semester started, that was May, the next school semester started in September, I went to school there.</span> <span id="s854">And during the, after school hours, I helped on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">NL: What were they growing?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">HF: Well, they were growing wheat.</span> <span id="s857">But I at the time had to take more care of the cattle.</span> <span id="s858">They had cows.</span> <span id="s859">I mean, cattle, and I was with them.</span> <span id="s860">And then later my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s861">NL: Were there any other children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">HF: They had no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">NL: I mean...</span></p>

would leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">NL: Oh, transients.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">HF: Yeah, always.</span> <span id="s872">Whoever needed a home temporarily, he would take, he would go to the city and pick up people that had no place to go and he would bring them to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">NL: So how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">HF: Well I was

school.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">NL: How were you treated there by the other children?</span> <span id="s882">Because you didn’t know any French.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">HF: Well, I learned, you know, children learn the language rather quickly and I learned...</span></p> <p><span id="s884">NL: Were they fairly cordial to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">NL: They were.</span> <span id="s887">They knew you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">HF: Yeah, but in the first village we lived, the name was Pigeodran [phonetic], in the department of Haute Gar [probably Haute Garonne] I think it was.</span> <span id="s889">There was actually no other Jews and they didn’t know what a Jew was.</span> <span id="s890">Those people really did not, there were no French Jews ever lived in those areas, except for the refugees.</span> <span id="s891">So for them Jews were something that they had no concept

then...my father was able to leave the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">NL: Did Mother finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">HF: Yeah, she found...</span></p> <p><span id="s898">NL: Find out where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">HF: Yeah, she found out where he was, and she...was able, she went to where that camp was, and she found out.</span> <span id="s900">And...</span></p>

of the German.</span> <span id="s911">And I think she had this farmer promise that he would give him employment.</span> <span id="s912">So they released him, and he came to live then with me on that farm, with those...</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NL: With that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">HF: With that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">NL: And what happened to Mother?</span></p>

say they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">HF: They just wanted me to come along.</span> <span id="s1070">And as a matter of fact they did like, the farmer we lived with, he was in France longer.</span> <span id="s1071">They didn’t arrest him.</span> <span id="s1072">They only arrested the recent refugees that came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">NL: The foreign, foreign

id="s1106">But anyway, they said that they would not take me, that they would take me instead of him, if he wouldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1107">And then somebody from these Jews knew where he was, because they knew he would be on the other farm, and they sent somebody after him and he came back.</span> <span id="s1108">And then of course they took both of us.</span> <span id="s1109">But I think one more Jewish family, they were also from Vienna, who lived there.</span> <span id="s1110">As a matter of fact, he was a rabbi in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">NL: Where did they take

staff were there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">HF: I mean, Jewish, yeah.</span> <span id="s1264">And we were given food and we had a bed to sleep in.</span> <span id="s1265">And on the last day, I only remember the last day before we left, they cut everybody’s hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">NL: Did they tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">HF: Just to, in order to, for cleanliness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">NL: Sanitary reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">HF: Sanitary reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">NL: Was the treatment pretty decent in those few days?</span> <span id="s1271">You don’t remember being...</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">HF: Yeah, there was nothing exceptionally...</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">NL: Scolded or beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">HF: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">NL: Something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">HF: Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">HF: Nothing like that whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">NL: And you were put on a train at Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1281">And we were actually, we left on September 4th, 1942, and it was the 28th convoy of deported Jews leaving, I mean, of Jews leaving there for the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">NL: Convoy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">HF: 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">NL: From France or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">HF: From France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">NL: From France, the 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">NL: So presumably there had been 23 others leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">HF: 28, 27 others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">NL: 27 that were leaving Drancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">HF: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">NL: From Drancy before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">HF: Yeah, before September 4th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">NL: 4th.</span> <span id="s1295">Ah ha.</span> <span id="s1296">And how long were you on the train to the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">HF: I don’t remember exactly whether it was two days or three days.</span> <span id="s1298">I don’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">NL: Did you have a place to sit down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1301">Then we were strictly in what the French called cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1302">I mean there was no more passenger cars.</span> <span id="s1303">We had, there were cattle cars, and we were together, not separated.</span> <span id="s1304">I mean, men, women, children in the same car.</span> <span id="s1305">There was enough room in each car for, and people still had luggage.</span> <span id="s1306">And I mean everybody had a suitcase, clothing.</span> <span id="s1307">Nothing was yet taken away from anybody.</span> <span id="s1308">Everybody was still allowed to have their personal belongings with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">NL: Excuse me, I’m going to close the [tape off then on] And you had been told that you were going “to the east”...</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">NL: By people at Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">NL: Do you remember any anxiety on the part of your father or any other adults at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">HF: Not really.</span> <span id="s1315">I can’t really, all that stands vividly in my mind was I mean not so much my personal reaction, but the children of that family who were with us.</span> <span id="s1316">And there were small children there.</span> <span id="s1317">The boy was maybe five or six and the girl was eight or nine then.</span> <span id="s1318">I remember them being very upset when they cut their hair off, in Drancy before.</span> <span id="s1319">And I remember the children were more, and it stands vividly in my mind that they were very upset.</span> <span id="s1320">Personally I don’t remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">NL: Did you see those children on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1323">We were toge-, a matter of fact we were in the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">NL: They were still upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">HF: Yeah, they were in the same car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">NL: They were still upset, yes.</span> <span id="s1327">And so after two or three days you arrived...</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">HF: After two or three days, the train had stopped.</span> <span id="s1329">Although there were several stops in between.</span> <span id="s1330">But the train just stopped and the doors were opened on the train, from the outside.</span> <span id="s1331">I mean you could not open the doors from the inside.</span> <span id="s1332">The doors were opened.</span> <span id="s1333">And we heard a German voice calling.</span> <span id="s1334">And in German, a soldier calling all men from the age of 16 to the age of 45, to get off the train.</span> <span id="s1335">And this was at a, not really at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1336">It was rather in a rather deserted railroad siding.</span> <span id="s1337">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">NL: Were you in Poland yet, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1340">Yes, it was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">NL: You were in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">HF: And it was in Poland.</span> <span id="s1343">It was, actually it was what in Germany was called Oberschlesien Osten, East Ober...</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">NL: East, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1346">It was not very far from Katowice.</span> <span id="s1347">And it was, according to records I have, the name of the place was Kosel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">NL: How would that be spelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">HF: K-O-S-E-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">NL: K-O-S-E-L.</span> <span id="s1351">Was this the place that you were looking for on the map?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">NL: Did you happen to find that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">HF: So anyway, well the name of the place is not that important because it was not really a station.</span> <span id="s1359">And so all the men, whoever wanted to—nobody was really forced to leave the train.</span> <span id="s1360">No German soldier went up on the train to check if people got off or not.</span> <span id="s1361">Whoever went got off the train and had to line up in front of the train.</span> <span id="s1362">And opposite us was a row of German soldiers, one next to the other, holding up the trains.</span> <span id="s1363">And we were told to line up one next to the other, and a few minutes later passed by a German S.S.</span> <span id="s1364">We called him a Sturmbann-führer, and he selected the men and told them to, either to go on the other side a little bit away from the train—there was like a little area, assembly area, to go over there—or he told them to go back on the train.</span> <span id="s1365">And my, I was standing next to my father, and next to that other man who, from that family who was with us.</span> <span id="s1366">And my father and that other man, a Mr. Hager, he told to go to the assembly area.</span> <span id="s1367">To me he told to go back up on the train.</span> <span id="s1368">Because I was only 13 years at the time.</span> <span id="s1369">Of course I had not told him that, but, I mean, according to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">NL: You weren’t very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">HF: I was not as big or as a sixteen-year-old although I was rather tall for my age all along.</span> <span id="s1372">I was always tall for my age.</span> <span id="s1373">But anyway he had told me to go back up on the train.</span> <span id="s1374">But I mean he did not stop and wait for anybody whether they followed his orders or not.</span> <span id="s1375">He just kept on going from one car to the other.</span> <span id="s1376">And so my father immediately left for the assembly area and I just stood on the bottom without...</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">NL: Going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">HF: Going anywhere.</span> <span id="s1379">So then the German soldier standing opposite me, it was maybe a distance of I would say maybe ten feet, fifteen feet, I mean the distance was not very great, and he asked me, in German, “Why don’t you go back on the train?”</span> <span id="s1380">Now I answered him in German because I was, German was my native tongue, that my father went over there in the other area and I would like to go there too in order to be together with my father.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, not knowing really why he was sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">NL: But you wanted to be with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">HF: I just, because although more, on the train most of the people were families, my father and I were just the two of us.</span> <span id="s1384">There was no question of family.</span> <span id="s1385">So I wanted to just be together with my father.</span> <span id="s1386">So the German soldier told me then in German, “When the Ober Sturmbannführer will come back again, because he had to come back the same way, just tell him, stop him and tell him that you are 16 years old and that you want to go to work.”</span> <span id="s1387">And a few minutes later, after the Sturmbannführer returned from, after he had gone all the way to the end of the train he returned.</span> <span id="s1388">And I stopped him and said, “Herr Ober Sturmbannführer, I am 16 years old and I want to go to work.”</span> <span id="s1389">So he said, “Go to work.”</span> <span id="s1390">And this is how I rejoined my father, who was only a short, I mean a short distance, a few hundred feet away.</span> <span id="s1391">And then they closed the cars, the doors of the train, and the train just pulled away.</span> <span id="s1392">And we were just almost like left stranded there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">NL: About how many do you think there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">HF: I would say probably about maybe 100 people, 100, 150 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">NL: But most...</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">HF: Maybe 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">NL: Most went back on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">NL: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">HF: No, most of the men really, because there was only men between 16 and 50 were supposed to go to come down, so I would say most men were selected, the stronger ones were selected to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">NL: To work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">HF: To work, yeah, and the others were supposed to go back on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">NL: And how long did you have to wait at this assembly point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">HF: Oh, I don’t know if I, I think this was late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1405">I think we stayed there like a few hours.</span> <span id="s1406">And then trucks came.</span> <span id="s1407">And we were taken away to a work, to a camp.</span> <span id="s1408">And the name of that camp was Tarnovich, in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">NL: Tarnovich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">HF: Tarnovich.</span> <span id="s1411">In Polish it’s called Tarnosky Gura.</span> <span id="s1412">That’s how it’s listed on all maps today.</span> <span id="s1413">Tarnosky...</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">NL: Gura.</span> <span id="s1415">G-U-R-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1417">Tarnosky Gura.</span> <span id="s1418">That’s a Polish name.</span> <span id="s1419">In German it’s Tarnovich.</span> <span id="s1420">And this was a work camp under the direction of the...Germans.</span> <span id="s1421">It was strictly, the function was to work for the German railroad.</span> <span id="s1422">It was basically a work camp for working on the German railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">NL: Were you laying tracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1425">Now, we got to the, in the train administration on the inside was really already pretty well-established, and it was mostly in the hands of Polish Jews, who were recruited at that time from that area and they were like the, in charge of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1426">In charge of, there were even women, Polish Jewish women...</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">HF: Young women, young.</span> <span id="s1429">And they were in the kitchen working the kitchen and the whole camp only consisted of a few hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">NL: And you were the youngest, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">HF: I, yeah, I was the young-, I know.</span> <span id="s1432">I was the youngest in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">NL: You were the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">HF: And when we went the first day from the camp to the work place, which was outside the camp—I mean every day we had to walk to the work place, which was along the railroad, and we were building railroad siding, enlarging the railroad station and so on—the man in charge of the project wanted to know what I was doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">NL: A Jewish man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">HF: Yeah, the Jewish man, who was, I mean, from the inside man, who was in charge.</span> <span id="s1437">He said to us, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1438">You cannot work as hard as the others.</span> <span id="s1439">I’m going, “From now on you just should stay inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1440">I don’t want you on the work place.</span> <span id="s1441">But then the German engineer, he was from Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s1442">He was in charge of the construction of the railroad.</span> <span id="s1443">He said, “No.</span> <span id="s1444">I want this boy to come every day.</span> <span id="s1445">I want him to come here, on the work place every day, and I want him to carry my equipment.”</span> <span id="s1446">It was like engineering equipment.</span> <span id="s1447">So that’s how I worked there every day.</span> <span id="s1448">And that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">NL: And Father was actually doing the heavy work...</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">NL: Laying the tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">HF: Laying the tracks.</span> <span id="s1453">Now the other man who was with us, that Rabbi Hager, he did not last very long.</span> <span id="s1454">He died within a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">NL: By the way, what happened to his children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">HF: They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">NL: They went on that train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">HF: They were left on the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">NL: By themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">HF: With everybody else.</span> <span id="s1461">No, with his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">NL: Oh, the wife was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">HF: The wife was on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">NL: So they went straight on to Auschwitz, presumably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">HF: Presumably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s1467">So he perished quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">HF: Well, the people that could not work any more, that just got weakened off after, there were, we never knew what happened to them, but they, every few weeks there came a truck and they were loaded up on the truck from the camp and they were sent, the rumor was to Auschwitz to be gassed, in other words, the ones that were not able to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">NL: Continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">HF: Because I remember one day during the winter of ‘42 I became very sick.</span> <span id="s1471">And the Jewish camp leader told me, “Don’t stay, even how no matter how sick you are, don’t stay in the camp because today they will come and pick up everybody who cannot work any more.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">NL: Did you get something to eat that could keep you sustained?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">HF: Well, we got, actually we only really got one meal a day.</span> <span id="s1474">We got a piece of, every evening we got a bowl of soup and a piece of, and a portion of bread.</span> <span id="s1475">And that was our...</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">NL: That was your sustenance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">HF: Sustenance for the day.</span> <span id="s1478">Now if we wanted to save part of it for the, bread for the next day, there was really...</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">NL: Nothing for breakfast?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">HF: No, there was one allocation, one daily allocation.</span> <span id="s1481">And during the day this became a, and breakfast we got, they called “coffee” in the morning, like a black brew, but nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">NL: Nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">HF: And the same we got at noontime also, like black brew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">NL: There was nothing in the fields that was growing that you could pick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">HF: Well we were not really working on the field.</span> <span id="s1486">We were working on the railroad...</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">NL: On the railroad.</span> <span id="s1488">No [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">HF: No.</span> <span id="s1490">Well, occasionally, I mean, we would get sometimes, civilians would throw food at us or a Polish civilian or even sometimes even some of the German guards would give you, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">NL: How about this German who wanted you to carry his equipment, did he ever give you any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">NL: No?</span> <span id="s1494">Did you stay by his side most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">HF: No, no, not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">HF: No, and then later I was, many, being that I was the youngest, so a lot of my function was to build fires for the German guards.</span> <span id="s1498">You know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">NL: In their barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">HF: Because it was windy.</span> <span id="s1501">No, outside like campfires.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">NL: No, outside.</span> <span id="s1503">To keep them warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">HF: To keep them warm, because I mean we were not inside a camp.</span> <span id="s1505">In other words we were really outside and it was their function to, every guard was assigned a certain amount of prisoners.</span> <span id="s1506">We called it [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">NL: So they got cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">HF: They were cold.</span> <span id="s1509">That was more, one of my functions, either carry the equipment or to make a fire or to do all kind of different, or go for coffee.</span> <span id="s1510">I mean, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">NL: For them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">HF: For, and do all kinds of different chores.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">NL: But you didn’t get any special favors from them in the way of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s1515">On occasion someone would give you something, but it was really nothing that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">NL: And were you near Father most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">NL: Did you see each other every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">HF: Yeah, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1523">HF: In the same barrack.</span> <span id="s1524">I mean, we got, in other words, food what they thought would sustain the people to do their work, because that was their function.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">NL: It was not manufactured work.</span> <span id="s1526">This was genuine work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">HF: No, no, it was strictly construction work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">NL: This was genuine work.</span> <span id="s1529">It had a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">HF: Genuine that, yeah it had a purpose for the German

was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">NL: I guess a great deal of turnover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">HF: No, it was really, it just reduced itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">NL: Reduced itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">HF: Yeah, we did not get...</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">NL: No new...</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">HF: No new people came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">NL: Groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">HF: No new, I don’t remember any new group that came to us.</span> <span id="s1562">Now the inside administration was strictly run by Jews.</span> <span id="s1563">And the outside leadership, you know, this was all one Jewish Kapo responsible for a group than towards the...German authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">NL: Did you have any contact with the inside Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">HF: Leadership?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">NL: Leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">HF: Oh yeah, constantly, because they were in charge of distributing the food on the inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">NL: Oh, they distributed the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1570">There was no German...really involved...</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">HF: In the administration of the camp whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">NL: Did the Jewish people inside eat better than you did, as far as you could see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">HF: Oh yeah, well, sure, they had access to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1575">They were over, they had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">NL: So they didn’t share?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">HF: No, no, they had all the food, I mean, it’s, I mean if X amount of food was given for the camp, they would take whatever they wanted and distribute the, they were in authority charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">NL: And they were mostly from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">HF: Yeah, they were mostly from Poland, from that area.</span> <span id="s1580">They were really from that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">NL: From that area.</span> <span id="s1582">All right, and did you get any rumors, did you hear any rumors, any reports about what was happening outside your own little area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">HF: The only...</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">NL: Any news or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">HF: The only thing we heard is what sometimes the German soldiers would tell us.</span> <span id="s1586">Now we, for example, we knew about the German defeat at Stalingrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">NL: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">HF: Because the German soldier would tell us or, you know, especially when I would build a fire for them and standing and I had the advantage that I spoke German, because very few people spoke German.</span> <span id="s1589">Because most, all the transports that came was from western Europe.</span> <span id="s1590">So not many spoke German.</span> <span id="s1591">So, I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">NL: That was an advantage for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">HF: It was an advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">NL: And did you get the feeling that they realized that this was a very great defeat for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">HF: Well, the only one recollection I have was of this German S.A. man telling me that they really feared the Russians.</span> <span id="s1596">They did not want to be captured by the Russians, because they knew of the atrocities that the Germans committed while advancing on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1597">And the example he gave me was they would tie people around the tree and then douse them with water, I mean, in the winter time in the cold of the winter and the people would just freeze up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">NL: Freeze.</span> <span id="s1599">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">HF: And we also suffered tremendously from the cold, because the problem was all the time that we worked outdoors all the time.</span> <span id="s1601">And whenever we came back, we had to stand for hours in front of the barrack for the count to come out.</span> <span id="s1602">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">NL: You didn’t get any special clothing for the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">HF: No, our clothing was very, very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">NL: Did you have boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">HF: No, our clothing was very, very minimal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">NL: Just shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">HF: As a matter of fact, at that time we still had our civilian clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">HF: We were not even issued any clothing, whatever people brought with them.</span> <span id="s1611">But eventually people died and it became that one took the clothing from another and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">NL: Did you have a coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">HF: Yeah, we had a coat, yeah.</span> <span id="s1614">And what I was gonna say, now there was a chance, people didn’t attempt to, but we were not guarded as heavily that some people could not escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">HF: But it was made clear that for everybody that was missing, a certain amount of, would be shot on sight.</span> <span id="s1617">I know one time really somebody was missing and every tenth person in the row that was standing, they would just pull them out and they would shoot them.</span> <span id="s1618">So I mean there, so there was a big deterrent about escaping.</span> <span id="s1619">And the second biggest deterrent was that there was a reason for them to send western Jews to Poland for work camp because nobody knew the lang-, people didn’t know the language, didn’t know the area.</span> <span id="s1620">They didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s1621">So that was the other biggest deterrent.</span> <span id="s1622">And we were in that particular camp for about six months, until the Spring of 1943.</span> <span id="s1623">In 1943, they took everybody that was left in that camp and they liquid-, they closed that camp down.</span> <span id="s1624">And they sent us, including the Polish Jews that were in, in autho[rity], they were in charge.</span> <span id="s1625">And they sent everybody to a work camp in Sosnowiec.</span> <span id="s1626">Now Sosnowiec is just outside of Katowice.</span> <span id="s1627">Now this was not a very great distance.</span> <span id="s1628">We, I think only, maybe an hour or two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">NL: May I ask, was the work on the railroad finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">HF: No, I don’t know by what decision they decided all of a sudden to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">NL: I guess the moving of the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">HF: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">NL: The victory at Stalingrad made some change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">NL: No?</span> <span id="s1638">Well, all right, so you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">HF: I really don’t know why they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">NL: They may not have had a good reason either.</span> <span id="s1641">Sometimes they were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">HF: Because the camp at Sosnowiec was basically the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">HF: With all that, but there we was already in established camp.</span> <span id="s1645">Or maybe they didn’t have enough people left there to do any productive work.</span> <span id="s1646">I just don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">NL: So you resumed the same kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">HF: We resumed the same general type of work.</span> <span id="s1649">We were in a little camp.</span> <span id="s1650">It was also a few hundred people, in barracks, in Sosnowiec.</span> <span id="s1651">And every day we were taken by train to Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">NL: To Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">HF: Katowice, yes.</span> <span id="s1654">And there were, we worked at the main railroad station in Katowice.</span> <span id="s1655">And we were also building, and we worked in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">NL: Stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">HF: Building a railroad station.</span> <span id="s1658">There was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">NL: And then you were doing heavier work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">HF: Then we were doing heavy work, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">NL: But you personally did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">HF: Yeah, then I was already doing heavier work.</span> <span id="s1663">And basically, the purpose of that was to build supply lines to the east for the German troops.</span> <span id="s1664">Now we saw many, while work on the main line we saw many German troops transferred, going east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">NL: Going east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">HF: Yeah, we saw many what the Germans would call Lazarett trains, Lazarett, hospital trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">NL: Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">HF: Coming west.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">NL: Lazarett.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">HF: Lazarett, yeah.</span> <span id="s1671">And we also saw many movements of Volksdeutsche, from Russia, moving back west.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">NL: West.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">NL: Interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">HF: So due to the fact that we worked on those main lines, we always saw that all those trains were going...</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">NL: Traffic...</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">HF: Traffic going all different directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">NL: Did you have, did you hear any rumors or reports about Auschwitz or the fate of Jews in the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">HF: No.</span> <span id="s1680">Well, we were in the east, actually, but we did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">NL: But you didn’t know what that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">HF: No, we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">NL: The trains going “to the east.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">NL: You didn’t know where they were going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">HF: No, no, remember we did not see any trains of Jews going, we did not see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">NL: Oh, and you didn’t hear about those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">HF: No, we did not hear about it, not to my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">NL: And at Sosnowiec you also were in the company of Polish Jews?</span> <span id="s1690">These were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">HF: A few.</span> <span id="s1692">Yeah, but most of the Jews, they also were from the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">NL: Ah, and how about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">NL: This is tape two, side two, continuing our talk with Mr. Finder.</span> <span id="s1696">Was the food any better here, Herbert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">HF: No, it was just as bad, the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">NL: The same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">HF: It was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1700">There was not really, just that it was a different location and I think that it was more concentrated.</span> <span id="s1701">We worked more, the whole camp more worked in one general area.</span> <span id="s1702">So we had less contact with civilians, with Polish civilians, or German civilians, than we had in Tarnovitch.</span> <span id="s1703">And the administration was a little bit more cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">NL: More cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">HF: Yeah, more cruel.</span> <span id="s1706">But basically we got one ration of food a day, and that was supposed to last us until the next...</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">NL: The next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">HF: Next, every evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">NL: Did you suffer ill health besides your loss of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">HF: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">NL: Were you or your father ill during any of this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">HF: But many people, I mean, many people died through lack of food, but basically, I mean, the population in the camps decreased continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">NL: And did you get new transports to this camp or was it just a general thinning out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">HF: I, no, no, it was just a general thinning out, a continuously thinning out of people that perished.</span> <span id="s1717">I mean they were beaten on the work if you didn’t move fast enough.</span> <span id="s1718">They were beaten continuously.</span> <span id="s1719">And as you got weaker, as we got weaker, your condition became worse, because you could not keep up with the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">NL: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">HF: And we were there until November, 1943.</span> <span id="s1722">And in November 1943, the camp was also dissolved and we were put on a train and shipped to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1723">So that was then our first experience with Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">NL: By train or again by truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">HF: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">NL: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">HF: By train, yeah.</span> <span id="s1728">But that was only, also only, it was only a very short distance away.</span> <span id="s1729">Now whether at that time they dissolved all those little labor camps or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1730">But from there we, when we arrived in Birkenau we arrived there at night, in the late evening at night.</span> <span id="s1731">But there was no selection because these were already all only men, only working men.</span> <span id="s1732">In other words, it was not a transport that came with wives, women, children and so on.</span> <span id="s1733">All I remember that we were transferred into Birkenau at night and were put in the barracks, and there we got our tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">NL: Were you whipped off the platforms by the guards?</span> <span id="s1735">Did you see Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">HF: No, there was no selection.</span> <span id="s1737">There was no guards.</span> <span id="s1738">They were, yeah, we were with the dogs, guards, it was Germans with dogs mainly.</span> <span id="s1739">And they were, chasing for barracks, where we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">NL: Which had already been occupied?</span> <span id="s1741">Or was it an empty...</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">HF: No, no, it was just an empty, another barrack not occupied.</span> <span id="s1743">But it was a barrack where we received a tattoo on our hand.</span> <span id="s1744">Everybody in Auschwitz, rather Birkenau, got their tattoo, their number.</span> <span id="s1745">And I have a number 160,440, which was a consecutive number given at the time and my father had 160,441.</span> <span id="s1746">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">NL: Were you still with the group from Sosnowiec?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">HF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">NL: Basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">HF: Basically we were, but then we were, split up and made into smaller groups and put into barracks, large, we had already very large barracks.</span> <span id="s1751">[phone; tape off then on] O.K., so we arrived in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1752">After [unclear] tattoo.</span> <span id="s1753">We were chased into...</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">NL: The very large barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">HF: The very large barracks and everybody just had to find an empty space.</span> <span id="s1756">Because it was, they were, the bunks were three...high and took three people wide.</span> <span id="s1757">We always laid in the same bunk with three people wide and three people high.</span> <span id="s1758">And that was our first experience to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">NL: It must have been very cold by this time then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">HF: It was around the beginning of November, 1943.</span> <span id="s1761">Now, in Birkenau we were not assigned to any work force.</span> <span id="s1762">We were just staying there.</span> <span id="s1763">Every morning we were chased out of the barracks and we either had to do calisthenics outside and, or we had to roll in the mud, or we had to go out and carry stones from one area to another area.</span> <span id="s1764">Just busy work.</span> <span id="s1765">And mostly were chased by Germans with dogs, to hurry up from one area.</span> <span id="s1766">I mean, and then another group would pick up the stones again and this was a constant harassment and constant, I mean not like before, with work, productive work.</span> <span id="s1767">This was mainly, like taken out of Birkenau and carry stones or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">NL: Senseless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">HF: Senseless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">NL: Senseless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">HF: Yeah, and continued with chasing with dogs, and rushing around back and forth.</span> <span id="s1772">And this lasted for about, we were there about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">NL: Did you get any information about what was happening on the outside world from any of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">HF: No, there we were very isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">HF: In Birkenau nobody really worked.</span> <span id="s1777">Too much.</span> <span id="s1778">And I mean we saw, we saw the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">NL: Did you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">HF: And we knew about the gas.</span> <span id="s1781">Then we knew already about the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">NL: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">HF: From the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">NL: This was the first, first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">HF: This was our first experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">NL: First time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">HF: Because we could see the smoke.</span> <span id="s1788">I mean we were right in the middle of this large camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">NL: The crematoria were close enough that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">HF: We could, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">NL: So that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">HF: We were right...there.</span> <span id="s1793">We were right inside that area.</span> <span id="s1794">We could see the smoke around.</span> <span id="s1795">But we didn’t see any, I never saw any trains arriving, or any selection or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">NL: Did anyone tell you where you were going or what would happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">HF: In Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">NL: In Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">HF: No.</span> <span id="s1800">Nobody really knew how long this would last or what would happen.</span> <span id="s1801">Nobody really knew anything.</span> <span id="s1802">And after three weeks, and we got assembled every day, every night we had.</span> <span id="s1803">In mornings we had assembly.</span> <span id="s1804">Night assembly.</span> <span id="s1805">And one evening assembly they just called out that these and these names should line up on the other side.</span> <span id="s1806">And my name and my father’s name was among that list that we had to line up on that other side.</span> <span id="s1807">And it was many people from our transport from Sosnowiec.</span> <span id="s1808">And they were, again, they were mostly Jews that originally came from western Europe.</span> <span id="s1809">And we didn’t know why we had to line up.</span> <span id="s1810">In other words, we had to line up there and we were not allowed back into the barracks.</span> <span id="s1811">And then we had to walk to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1812">Auschwitz was an adjoining camp to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1813">And we walked to Auschwitz and Auschwitz, we were given new clothing.</span> <span id="s1814">We were given clothing.</span> <span id="s1815">We were shaved.</span> <span id="s1816">We were put...</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">NL: Your hair hadn’t been shaved?</span> <span id="s1818">It had been shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">HF: It had been, yeah, but I mean they shaved again, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">NL: Another shave, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">HF: We were shaved again, were given new clothing, and we were to go to take showers there in the shower area, to take showers.</span> <span id="s1822">And we stayed there one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">NL: Let me backtrack for a minute.</span> <span id="s1824">Did you have a chance to bathe in the other places at all?</span> <span id="s1825">Did you get any soap at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">HF: On occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">NL: On occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">HF: But very, very, very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">NL: Seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1831">Most of the time we undressed on the outside, went in the shower.</span> <span id="s1832">Even in the middle of winter no matter how cold it was we always undressed on the outside, left our clothes on the outside, went inside, showered, came out again, put on our clothes again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">NL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1834">But now at Auschwitz you got it, was it hot water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">HF: I don’t remember if it was hot water or cold water.</span> <span id="s1836">Anyway we were supposed to shower.</span> <span id="s1837">We had to [unclear] in and, I mean it was always under a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s1838">And then we were given some food.</span> <span id="s1839">And we slept there one night in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1840">And we stayed there one night.</span> <span id="s1841">And we were separated from the other people from that camp, except the ones, the Jews and the Kapos are the ones that were in charge.</span> <span id="s1842">And we stayed there one night.</span> <span id="s1843">And the next night, the next day, rather, we were put on trains and shipped out.</span> <span id="s1844">And then we were shipped out to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">NL: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">HF: Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1847">Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">NL: Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1849">And now this is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">HF: This was November of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">NL: Still November of ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">HF: Yeah, we were only three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">NL: Three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">HF: At, it was, to the best of my recollection it was late November, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">NL: Late November.</span> <span id="s1856">And now you’re part of a Kommando to clean up the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1858">Now when we arrived in Warsaw, there were already there five thousand men from Auschwitz were sent to Warsaw already earlier, that fall.</span> <span id="s1859">And they already had set up barracks.</span> <span id="s1860">Now this was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">NL: In the ghetto or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">HF: We were right inside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">NL: Inside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">HF: Inside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">NL: Had you heard at all about the Warsaw Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">HF: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1867">We didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">NL: Nothing about the revolt, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">HF: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">NL: What did you find, besides the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">HF: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">NL: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">HF: Well, actually, it was like two, it was a large, a small camp inside a large camp.</span> <span id="s1874">In other words, our barracks were surrounded by walls, with barbed wire on top, with guard towers, and Ukrainian soldiers guarding them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">NL: Did you see any of the rubble of the destroyed buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">HF: Well, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">HF: I will come, now, then, this was inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1879">The ghetto, again, was around, surrounded by the other wall.</span> <span id="s1880">So we had a small camp inside a large camp, which was really the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1881">We never got out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1882">Every morning we walked out, we were sent out or, out of...this camp, into the ghetto area...</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">NL: Into the ghetto area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">HF: Under supervision by...</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">NL: Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">HF: No, we actually were not guarded then.</span> <span id="s1887">Because the whole thing was one big camp.</span> <span id="s1888">The ghetto was one big camp, but at night we had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">NL: Go into your smaller one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">HF: Into the smaller camp.</span> <span id="s1891">And basically it was, again the inmates themselves would had risen to higher positions, who led the people to work, who got their...</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">NL: Rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">HF: Orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">NL: Oh, orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">HF: Who got their orders from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1896">But all administration—I want to emphasize—all administration for all the camps up to now, and even later, was always done by inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">NL: And in your case, Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">HF: Yeah, mostly.</span> <span id="s1899">Now the only, the first time we were exposed to non-Jews was in Birkenau, in Auschwitz and in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1900">In Warsaw we had a contingent of German non-Jews, who were also inmates of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s1902">These were political prisoners do you think, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">HF: Some were political, yeah.</span> <span id="s1904">We were living in the same barracks, but they were in charge.</span> <span id="s1905">In other words, they were given the administrative positions.</span> <span id="s1906">They were in charge of the barracks, they were in charge of the camps, they were in charge of the work details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">NL: Rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">HF: Of the rationing, of the food, of the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">NL: And how did they treat you, Herbert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">HF: Well, they, we were almost equal except for their position.</span> <span id="s1911">I mean they were Kapos.</span> <span id="s1912">Actually, the worst Kapos were the Jewish Kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">HF: The Jewish Kapos were responsible for many deaths and more than the Germans, from German Kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">NL: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">HF: We were, suffered much more viciously from Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">NL: In these other labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">HF: Yeah, in these other labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">NL: More beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">HF: Yeah, well, there was no, in the other labor camps there were no non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1921">Everything was under Jewish administration, up to the outside world, of course the engineers, the people in charge of construction were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1922">But everything else was done...</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">NL: I wonder if there was some cultural antagonism, Polish Jews against western?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">HF: No, some of them really were not Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1925">There were some German Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">NL: Who also were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">HF: Yeah, yeah, it was, you know, that they wanted to protect their status.</span> <span id="s1928">This was their status, was guaranteed them along with survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">NL: And if they were harsh they would last longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">HF: Yeah, yeah, it was basically to gain the favor of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1931">And many German soldiers were very, not very impressed with them, really did not like them too much, because of their, I mean, they did not, could not see that the Jew should, should really...</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">NL: Show that much power or authority?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">HF: Power and authority.</span> <span id="s1934">Now I mean I’m not talking about the S.S. who was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s1935">I’m talking mainly about German soldiers guarding, on guard duty, not the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">NL: Not the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">HF: Who was in charge of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">NL: Camp itself, yes.</span> <span id="s1939">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">HF: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">NL: Oh, excuse me, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">HF: Now in Warsaw the Germans that were in the camp were mostly, they were different categories.</span> <span id="s1943">There were some that were old political prisoners that had been in prison since 1933, and who also, very few had survived down the road.</span> <span id="s1944">Then there were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">NL: So-called anti-socials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">HF: Anti-socials, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">HF: They were people that were thieves on the outside, criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">NL: Did you encounter some homosexuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">HF: Homosexuals, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">NL: And they were all mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">HF: All mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">NL: All mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">HF: All mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">NL: And of course many non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">HF: Yeah, well, they were a smaller portion of the camp.</span> <span id="s1957">They were in, and the reason was, what some of them had told me why they were there, because that if they had gotten a prison sentence—the anti-socials; I’m not talking about the politicals...</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">HF: During Hitler’s regime, if they were several years in prison, afterwards that he would not let them back out into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">NL: Regular society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">HF: Into the society.</span> <span id="s1962">But were sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1963">You know, some prisoners, they went to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1964">And they were, because they were Germans they got a little better treatment.</span> <span id="s1965">They got a little more authoritative treatment, because they had the more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">NL: Did they get better, they did get better food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">HF: They had, well, it was like everything else.</span> <span id="s1968">I was like, a certain amount of food was given by the Germans for everybody.</span> <span id="s1969">And whoever was in charge took care of himself too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">NL: It was sort of a trade-off, yeah.</span> <span id="s1971">Was the food here at all better for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">HF: In Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">HF: Warsaw was one of the very poorest conditions that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1977">First of all the winter was very cold.</span> <span id="s1978">And from 5,000 that were there in November, by January-February it was only like 1,000 left.</span> <span id="s1979">And this was due to a typhoid epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">NL: Typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1982">Of course there every, there there was not no difference whether it was German or Jews or I mean, typhus didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">NL: Everybody, well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">HF: Know any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">NL: Did you encounter any Polish civilians during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">HF: Yes, that was, I met, during the day it was Polish civilians were inside...</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">NL: In the walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">HF: Inside the big camp.</span> <span id="s1989">It was inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1990">And they were also there for the same function of cleaning up the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">NL: Now was this in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">HF: And then we got some news then, but of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">NL: News.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">NL: What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">HF: Well, not, see the news was that, very few of them could speak anything but Polish.</span> <span id="s1997">And most of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">NL: Inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">HF: Inmates did not speak Polish.</span> <span id="s2000">Now, my father was one of the few who did speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">NL: Ah ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">HF: And as a matter of fact, many of the Germans sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">NL: Used him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">HF: Used him to interpret, because he originally had come from Poland and migrated to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2005">And then of course he became a western.</span> <span id="s2006">See, the Germans for some reason did not take into consideration that among those western Jews might be some Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s2007">Or maybe they did, maybe they just, or something.</span> <span id="s2008">So many of the German Kapos used him to relate to the Polish civilization.</span> <span id="s2009">That’s when we found out what really happened in Warsaw during that time and what happened in...</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">NL: Some of the civilians told you about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">NL: Destruction of the ghetto, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">HF: Yeah, they told us about it.</span> <span id="s2014">Well, we saw the destruction because we were among the [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">NL: Yes, you saw the rubble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">HF: Yeah, we were inside the rubble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">NL: And so, and then you knew that there had been some resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">HF: Yeah, yeah, we, then, yeah, then we knew exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">NL: Did any of the civilians bring any food to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">HF: Well, they would bring if you could pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">NL: And how were you supposed to pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">HF: Well, at first the first ones that came before us, did find some things in the old ghetto yet while cleaning up, and they would trade it with them.</span> <span id="s2023">Now later, the later one, well, it was, you, if it was early sometimes you’d find something.</span> <span id="s2024">Sometimes you would steal something.</span> <span id="s2025">You would always, they would bring, there was, in Warsaw itself for some reason there was plenty of food available.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">HF: Yeah, because they would bring in, I mean the Germans had money.</span> <span id="s2028">Somehow they were, and they would trade...</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">NL: They would spend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">HF: Would trade with the Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s2031">If you had zlotys, well, their currency, they would bring you white bread, salami, whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s2032">But most of the Jewish inmates didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s2033">They had nothing.</span> <span id="s2034">Now one thing happened which saved my father’s life and my life actually later was that he had some gold teeth.</span> <span id="s2035">And he would, he extracted them and would sell them to the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">NL: He could do that himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">HF: Well some way that was done, you know, like you had those gold crowns.</span> <span id="s2038">Of course, although the German had registered everybody that had gold crowns.</span> <span id="s2039">But at that point nobody really worried that much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">NL: So he used that as a bargaining chip?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">HF: Yeah, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">NL: For some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">HF: Yeah, for money, and then the money you would get...</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">NL: The money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">HF: But I mean, I’m really getting ahead of it, because like I said, most of the camp died of the typhus epidemic.</span> <span id="s2046">Not most, but almost three-quarters of the camp died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">NL: And you fell ill too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">HF: I had typhus.</span> <span id="s2049">My father had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">NL: Were you able to go to any kind of clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">HF: Well there were barracks, but they just put the sick people.</span> <span id="s2052">Now people did not really die from typhus.</span> <span id="s2053">How did the typhus spread?</span> <span id="s2054">It spread because you didn’t get any change of clothes for two months.</span> <span id="s2055">No change of clothes.</span> <span id="s2056">No washing.</span> <span id="s2057">There was no facilities whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2058">And so typhus was spread by lice, and that’s how it spread.</span> <span id="s2059">Now, most people did not die from the typhus.</span> <span id="s2060">They died afterwards.</span> <span id="s2061">Because everybody got so weakened from it that unless you had opportunity to get some extra food, you could not get any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">NL: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">HF: So that’s when my father would go with gold teeth and we got a little bit extra food and somehow you survive.</span> <span id="s2064">And many of the Germans died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">HF: Proportionately even more than the Jewish, because they were stronger.</span> <span id="s2067">They were bigger, you know, because they had more.</span> <span id="s2068">And the old saying, “The bigger you are the harder the fall,” and that’s exactly, it happened very truthfully because bigger people need more food.</span> <span id="s2069">So they also, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">NL: Also.</span> <span id="s2071">Oh.</span> <span id="s2072">Now, when you say you were there to clean up the ghetto, what did that mean, actually?</span> <span id="s2073">What did you do on any given day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">HF: Well, basically we were going out there where the buildings and clean up brick by brick and we would clean the bricks, and then they would ship the bricks out somewhere.</span> <span id="s2075">That was basically to clean the bricks, to clean the bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">NL: To send them to Germany, presumably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">HF: I don’t know what...</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">NL: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">HF: And there were a lot of Poles working in the ghetto too.</span> <span id="s2080">They worked, to tear down the walls, because it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s2081">They had those walls of the buildings standing and just single walls.</span> <span id="s2082">And that was basically the function.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">NL: You didn’t find any Jews in any bunkers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">NL: Or did you hear about any Jews who survived in bunkers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">HF: No, that was so much later.</span> <span id="s2087">I mean the uprising was in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">NL: No, I mean, presumably there were still some Jews left in the ghetto after May of ‘44.</span> <span id="s2089">But you’re speaking now of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">HF: November, right.</span> <span id="s2091">From November there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">NL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2093">And so you stayed in the ghetto for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">HF: We were there until April, ‘44.</span> <span id="s2095">Not April, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2096">Until July ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">NL: July ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">HF: July ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">NL: Now, how long was your father sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">HF: With typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">HF: Oh, we were all sick a few days, a week.</span> <span id="s2103">I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s2104">The time, I must have been delirious at the time because I don’t even remember what happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">NL: You were delirious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">HF: Yeah, during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">NL: Did anybody give you any kind of care?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">HF: No, there was no care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">NL: There were no women around?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">HF: No, there were no women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">NL: This was an all male...</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">HF: This was an all, there was no women in the camp at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">NL: And no medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">HF: No medicine, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">NL: No medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">HF: There were some...</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">NL: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">HF: Doctors, inmate doctors.</span> <span id="s2119">But I mean they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">NL: They couldn’t help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">NL: So it was just your own body that fought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">HF: You just survived it.</span> <span id="s2124">Yeah, you survived or you didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s2125">And that’s why so few survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">NL: So you were ill probably for several months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s2128">Typhus lasts only a couple weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">NL: But when you recovered, your...</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">HF: Yeah, the recovery was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">NL: Then you were very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">HF: Yes, very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">NL: Debilitated.</span> <span id="s2134">Were you able to somehow work after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">HF: Well, the ones that were able to work, worked.</span> <span id="s2136">And the others just died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">NL: So you and father eventually...</span></p> <p><span

‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">NL: Now were you getting any news about German defeats on the fronts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">HF: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s2145">We knew pretty much what was going on through the Poles that were, entered the camp.</span> <span id="s2146">But there the camp was replenished.</span> <span id="s2147">See, after we were down to a few, we got new transports from Auschwitz all the time.</span> <span id="s2148">So the population remained fairly constant in Warsaw, I mean the camp population.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">NL: The camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">HF: After a while we got Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s2151">We, there we got the first transport of Hungarian Jews in ‘44 that came to Auschwitz, to Warsaw, from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2152">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">NL: Were you getting any more news about what was happening at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">HF: Well I guess by that time we pretty knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">NL: You knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">HF: We knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">NL: You knew what was happening, yes.</span> <span id="s2158">And were you able to communicate with the Hungarian Jews at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">HF: Well, we were all in together.</span> <span id="s2160">I mean, whoever spoke German.</span> <span id="s2161">They spoke German and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">NL: They spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">HF: German, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">NL: Was there some sort of communication or did you keep separate from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">HF: No, no, it was all, everything was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">NL: All together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">HF: Wherever there was room in the barracks.</span> <span id="s2168">There was really no separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">NL: No cultural...</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">HF: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">NL: Difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">HF: No difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">NL: So you stayed there until July of ‘44 and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">HF: Well, in July of ‘44, we were evacuated from, I mean they closed up this whole camp, in...</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">NL: Again, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">HF: That happened when the, we heard already the bombings from the Russians, the artillery of the Russians when they advanced towards Russia.</span> <span id="s2177">So the Russian Army was getting very close.</span> <span id="s2178">And they were fearing, then that’s what started the revolt of the Polish, Warsaw Revolt started at that time.</span> <span id="s2179">One thing I just want to bring out.</span> <span id="s2180">Before, while we were still in Warsaw, we knew about the atrocities that the Germans did in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2181">We heard that every time they would, that a German would be killed, for example, they would just arrest 50 Poles anywhere on the streets of Warsaw, and they would bring them next to our camp, inside the ghetto was the old Polish prison.</span> <span id="s2182">And there they would shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">NL: Was that Paviak?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">HF: Paviak, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">NL: Paviak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">HF: It was right next, Paviak was right next to our camp.</span> <span id="s2187">And they would, and then, well we had to dispose of the corpses.</span> <span id="s2188">And as a matter of fact they were, at that time they were building even a crematoria in the, in our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">HF: But that was never really completed.</span> <span id="s2191">But the way we had to bury, and we had to burn all the corpses.</span> <span id="s2192">I mean, there was a special detail that did that.</span> <span id="s2193">They would lay a layer of wood and a layer of corpses and then just douse them and we had like a pile that would burn for days.</span> <span id="s2194">And that was continuously burning.</span> <span id="s2195">But that was one of the functions that all the Poles that were killed by the Nazis were brought into the, our camp.</span> <span id="s2196">And not to the inside of the camp because it was into the ghetto area, into the larger area.</span> <span id="s2197">And there we had to dispose of them.</span> <span id="s2198">As a matter of fact, one time one of the Poles that worked with told my father, I mean I could not talk to him, that the day before his son was caught up in one of those...</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">NL: Conflagrations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">HF: Well, yeah, in one of those, where they would arrest a..</span> <span id="s2201">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">NL: Roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">HF: Roundups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">NL: Roundups, yes.</span> <span id="s2205">But that was before...</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">HF: That’s how they terrorized.</span> <span id="s2207">That’s how they terrorized the population against revolting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">NL: So this was of course before the Warsaw Revolt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">HF: Yeah, that was before.</span> <span id="s2210">That was during the Spring of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">NL: The Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">HF: Yeah, so we, all the time that we were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2213">And then when they were feared of the revolt, of the Polish Revolt, they closed up, and we walked out of, the German...guards and the prisoners, everybody just walked out, out of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2214">And we walked for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s2216">Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">HF: And we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">NL: West?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">HF: West.</span> <span id="s2220">We walked to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">NL: To Lodz.</span> <span id="s2222">Did anybody tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s2224">We just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">NL: Did you get anything to eat on this walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">HF: Well, no, I don’t think we got anything to eat.</span> <span id="s2227">We didn’t get any water.</span> <span id="s2228">Water was the biggest thing because it was July and it was very hot.</span> <span id="s2229">And then we walked on the road and just, and whoever didn’t keep up, they would just beat them or shoot them and I know after a day or two we arrived at the, I mean at night we didn’t walk, because they were worried, you know, they just, they put us inside a big field and they just would surround the field and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">NL: Also, the German guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">HF: The German guards.</span> <span id="s2232">The German, I don’t know whether it was S.S. at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">NL: Did you get any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">HF: We might have gotten some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">NL: Some food from the civilians on the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">HF: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2237">This was all pretty well isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">NL: Isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">HF: Isolated.</span> <span id="s2240">And I remember once we came to a river.</span> <span id="s2241">Everybody just rushed into the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">NL: To drink from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">HF: To drink from the river.</span> <span id="s2244">And the ones that got too far away they would just shoot them.</span> <span id="s2245">They got too far down in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">NL: And I’m sure lots of people got sick from the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">HF: And then the next night, some miracle, we camped in the field and people would start digging.</span> <span id="s2248">There must have been very low ground water because after we dug only a few feet, there was water.</span> <span id="s2249">And everybody could, that was the first time everybody could just drink as much as they wanted because there was just so much water.</span> <span id="s2250">I mean, actually we dug with spoons.</span> <span id="s2251">We had a little spoons.</span> <span id="s2252">All we had was little spoons and we could dig holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">NL: But no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">HF: No food.</span> <span id="s2255">And that lasted for about, after the third day, we arrived at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2256">And then we were put on trains and, big cattle trains, and shipped to Dachau.</span> <span id="s2257">And that was a journey of several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">NL: Several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">HF: And that was in July 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">NL: This is tape three, side one, continuing our interview with Mr. Herbert Finder.</span> <span id="s2262">Today is March 26, 1987.</span> <span id="s2263">So, Mr. Finder, would you be good enough now to tell us a little about this trip to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">HF: Well, the trip in the train from Lodz to Dachau lasted approximately three days.</span> <span id="s2265">We received a little bit of food before boarding the train.</span> <span id="s2266">But during the trip we didn’t receive neither water nor food.</span> <span id="s2267">It was in the middle of July during very hot weather.</span> <span id="s2268">We were in very cramped conditions, in what the Germans call trains for animals, or cargo cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">NL: Were you able to sit down?</span> <span id="s2270">Did you have to stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">HF: We had, we, no, we had room to sit in cramped conditions.</span> <span id="s2272">But we, many inmates died during that trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">NL: From thirst and exhaustion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">HF: From thirst, exhaustion, and really, but we had nothing to do with the corpses.</span> <span id="s2275">The corpses remained inside the car.</span> <span id="s2276">And actually, it showed how dehumanized people can get.</span> <span id="s2277">We made benches out of the corpses, and we sat on them, just to get a little bit additional space.</span> <span id="s2278">And this trip, like I said, lasted about three days, when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">NL: Were you able to get off from time to time to relieve yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">HF: No, it was just in the corner of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">NL: The car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">HF: Of the car.</span> <span id="s2285">No, nobody got off the train or off the car during that whole three-day period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">NL: And there were Nazi guards inside your car, during this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">HF: No.</span> <span id="s2288">The cars were just, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">NL: They were sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">HF: Yeah, sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">NL: Sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">HF: But there were like...</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">NL: Openings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">HF: Two little openings, not windows.</span> <span id="s2295">Two little openings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">NL: Did you have any idea where you were going, in what direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">HF: We knew we were going towards Germany.</span> <span id="s2298">We were, in other words we were heading west.</span> <span id="s2299">I mean, by...looking out sometimes through those little portholes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">NL: Did you get any information about the, what was happening in the world from those Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">NL: Any retreating soldiers or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">NL: Evidence of bombing?</span> <span id="s2305">Nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">HF: No, not at that.</span> <span id="s2307">That was in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">NL: Did you know Germany had already lost the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">NL: You didn’t know that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">HF: No, we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s2312">We came from the east towards the west.</span> <span id="s2313">So there was no destruction.</span> <span id="s2314">I mean there was no bombing coming from east to west.</span> <span id="s2315">Because the Americans already, although they had just about landed, were coming from west to east.</span> <span id="s2316">We were 1,000 miles away.</span> <span id="s2317">I mean...miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">NL: But a good part of Germany had been bombed earlier.</span> <span id="s2319">You didn’t see any evidence of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">HF: No, that was, well I don’t recall, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">NL: It must have been dreadful, three days in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">HF: So when we arrived in Dachau, everybody arrived in a very, really a very weak and weary condition and even the German administration of Dachau themselves were almost appalled by the conditions that was, we arrived.</span> <span id="s2323">Because just the so-called labor working groups that had arrived, they were themselves appalled by the condition that we arrived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">NL: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">HF: We heard remarks by the guards that took over our trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">NL: Did they give you something to drink right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">HF: Yeah, when we, well yeah, when we arrived in Dachau, they gave us new clothing.</span> <span id="s2328">They gave us food and water.</span> <span id="s2329">And we stayed in Dachau for approximately three weeks, in Dachau itself, in the concentration camp of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">NL: And these were now German guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">NL: German supervision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">HF: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">NL: No longer Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">HF: No, this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">NL: No, this was German.</span> <span id="s2337">And did you see non-Jews there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">HF: In Dachau?</span> <span id="s2339">We, well, yeah, there were non-Jews in Dachau, but in the area where we were in Dachau, there was mostly Jewish, except the supervision was non-Jewish, I mean the in-camp supervision.</span> <span id="s2340">And we were in Dachau approximately three weeks when we were told again to get ready and to walk out.</span> <span id="s2341">And we were sent to a camp by the name of Allach, A-L-L-A-C-H, which is really a, or was, rather, a satellite camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s2342">I mean, it was only maybe between ten and fifteen kilometers away from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">NL: Did you do any work at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">HF: In Dachau?</span> <span id="s2345">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">HF: In Dachau we basically did not do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">NL: Did you recoup some of your strength there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">HF: Yes, yeah, in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">NL: And were you with Father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">HF: We were in Dachau together, but he somehow got an infection in his foot while we were on the transportation from Warsaw to Dachau.</span> <span id="s2352">And he was put into what they call in German Lazarett, like a..</span> <span id="s2353">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">NL: Clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">HF: Clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">NL: Did you get any care or was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">HF: Yeah, he got some care there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">NL: You got some care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">HF: But while he was there I was sent away and, from Dachau, to that camp in Allach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">NL: So you went alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">HF: I went alone, while he remained in Dachau.</span> <span id="s2362">There were other satellite camps to Dachau besides Allach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">NL: Did you think you would see him again?</span> <span id="s2364">You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">HF: No, we did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">NL: And where, what did they tell you when they sent you to Allach?</span> <span id="s2367">What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">HF: Well, Allach was strictly a labor camp again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">HF: It was a large labor camp where there were Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s2371">In the camp the Jews were separated from the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s2372">But on the labor part it was together.</span> <span id="s2373">And we worked mostly there on, again on railroad, and on the construction.</span> <span id="s2374">We were building a large underground factory for engines, airplane engines.</span> <span id="s2375">It actually was part of what they called BMW aircraft.</span> <span id="s2376">It’s today they manufacture the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">NL: Automobiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">HF: Automobiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">NL: And did you get some decent food there or was it again the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">HF: No, it was again that same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">NL: Same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">HF: Same story.</span> <span id="s2383">Very meager rationing and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">NL: Did you sleep in this camp or did you come back to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">HF: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2386">No we were permanently in that camp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">NL: You were at that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">HF: Yeah, there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">NL: They had barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">HF: We had our own barracks and we worked there permanently in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">NL: And did you learn from the other prisoners anything at all about what was happening outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">NL: The progress of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">HF: We learned a little bit, what we heard from the prisoners, we heard from, I mean, sometimes we heard on the outside.</span> <span id="s2395">Civilians would talk to us, some German civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">NL: Did you realize that Germany was losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">HF: They never admitted to that fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">NL: You didn’t have any inkling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">HF: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">NL: Any signs of Allied activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">HF: Oh yeah, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">NL: Were reported?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">HF: Where we were then there, we were bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">NL: You were bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">HF: We were bombed many times.</span> <span id="s2406">Our camp was never bombed, but we were very close to Munich.</span> <span id="s2407">And every day, at noon time, an American bomber would fly over us, and we could see the bombing of Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">NL: Did that give some spurt to the morale of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">HF: Well, I want to talk about the morale a little later after we finish this chronological thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">NL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">HF: So we were there in, so we arrived there in, it was early, late August, early September.</span> <span id="s2412">And we were in that Allach camp, actually until the last week of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s2413">And we worked either on railroad construction or we worked on the factory.</span> <span id="s2414">We had to work day shifts, night shifts, seven days a week.</span> <span id="s2415">And so people died again.</span> <span id="s2416">But it was not really a extermination camp.</span> <span id="s2417">It was mostly a labor camp.</span> <span id="s2418">People just died out of poor food, lack of food and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">NL: Exhaustion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">HF: Exhaustion.</span> <span id="s2421">I mean, and all that.</span> <span id="s2422">But it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">NL: Were you maltreated there?</span> <span id="s2424">Do you remember being beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">HF: Well, the only maltreatment was mainly on the job site.</span> <span id="s2426">I mean constantly [unclear] but no, but that was about the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">NL: And about how many men in...</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">HF: In this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">NL: In this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">HF: It was a rather large camp.</span> <span id="s2431">I would say there were several thousand men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s2433">And most of them worked in this underground operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">HF: Either there or the railroad.</span> <span id="s2435">There were different job sites in that general area where, yeah, a matter of fact we got, we were, also worked people like French forced laborers, which were Germans in the army who were, German Army, not deserters, but rather people who...</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">NL: Asocials?</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">HF: Yeah, asocials who did things not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">NL: According to regulation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">HF: According to regulations and were punished and had to be in forced labor.</span> <span id="s2440">So there was a strong urgency to complete this underground.</span> <span id="s2441">It was not really though underground.</span> <span id="s2442">It really was built above ground.</span> <span id="s2443">It’s out of concrete and they were going to cover the whole thing with that [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">HF: And it was like a hill from the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">NL: It was going to be a hangar, or like an airfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">HF: No, not a hangar.</span> <span id="s2448">Not an airfield.</span> <span id="s2449">A manufacturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">HF: A manufacturing.</span> <span id="s2452">A manufacturing of engines.</span> <span id="s2453">So we was really right inside the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">NL: How did you manage?</span> <span id="s2455">You were alone.</span> <span id="s2456">That is you were no longer with Father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">HF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">NL: Did you have any friends there or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">HF: Well, as I was, to going back to that, yes, the surprising thing was after three weeks there came another transport of Dachau and my father was just among.</span> <span id="s2460">And he could just have easily have ended up somewheres else but he came, he ended up right in this came camp.</span> <span id="s2461">And I remember distinctly it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah in 1944.</span> <span id="s2462">And just out of pure coincidence we ended up together again, after about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">NL: And was he, was his foot better?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">NL: He had recovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">NL: And he worked with you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">HF: He worked with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">NL: In the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">HF: Yeah, sometimes together.</span> <span id="s2471">Sometimes together, sometimes separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">NL: And were there any people your age at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">HF: By that time there were already some among the, by that time we, the western Jews and the Polish Jews were really a minority in the camp.</span> <span id="s2474">The majority of the camp were the Hungarian Jews who would come all again in the camp for a very short duration.</span> <span id="s2475">And among them were, from other towns, some were like 16 years old.</span> <span id="s2476">And by that time they already were some they were like sixteen, sixteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">NL: Did you have anything in common with them or was there a language, a serious language barrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">HF: Between the Hungarian Jews?</span> <span id="s2479">I, there, I wouldn’t say there was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s2480">There was a certain, I would say hostility between the old timers and the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">NL: The newcomers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">HF: Yeah, because for some reason old timers had a tendency to survive a little longer, after they had survived a certain, I would say the death toll among the Hungarian Jews probably was higher in that particular camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">NL: They were not yet conditioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">HF: Seasoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">NL: Seasoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">HF: Usually they...</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">NL: They were already hardened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">HF: Yeah, hardened, yeah, after, I mean, after we had, after two years or so, for some reason, the ones that survived, unless they were really, they mostly had a tendency to just always survive a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s2489">And basically we were in that camp until about the very last week of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s2490">So we heard when Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s2491">News could get through somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s2493">That news came through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">HF: That news came through.</span> <span id="s2495">And when the, I guess again when the Germans came closer towards Dachau, I mean the, when the American troops came closer towards Dachau, they tried to evacuate us towards Austria, further back.</span> <span id="s2496">And we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">NL: But you didn’t have any real hard news about the progress of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s2499">Oh, well, we knew that American troops were coming closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">NL: Did you know that this was the end of the war?</span> <span id="s2501">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">HF: Well, partly we knew it was the end.</span> <span id="s2503">And we really feared the end also, because we always feared that they would kill everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">NL: They did in some cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2508">And how we also knew, for example, there were many, the Germans that were in the camp, the non-Jewish Germans just tried to recruit them into the army.</span> <span id="s2509">In other words they prom-, the Germans promised them that if they would volunteer for the army, they could not, they would not force them because they were really like inmates.</span> <span id="s2510">I mean, prisoner inmates they considered.</span> <span id="s2511">But if they volunteered, that if they would come back from the war and survive, then they would pardon them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">NL: Did some volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">HF: I don’t, see most of them I heard their comments, I remember their comments that they would not volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">NL: They would not volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">HF: It was not worth it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">NL: Not worth it.</span> <span id="s2517">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">HF: Anymore to volunteer and to fight the Russians than...</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">NL: And the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">HF: And the Americans.</span> <span id="s2521">And we figured this way was a better way.</span> <span id="s2522">And so we would, and then they put us on flats.</span> <span id="s2523">They didn’t even have any boxcars any more.</span> <span id="s2524">They put us on flat cars.</span> <span id="s2525">And we really never moved very far, because by that time the railroads were really bombed out.</span> <span id="s2526">So we just almost like in one location sitting for a couple days.</span> <span id="s2527">And then we had no more food at all, once we got on the train.</span> <span id="s2528">But we could get off the train.</span> <span id="s2529">They were guarded yet by Germans, but these people got off the train and would pluck grass and stuff and eat that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">NL: What did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">HF: Grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">NL: Grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">HF: Grasses, for the last few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">NL: Father too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">HF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">NL: Civilians did not come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">HF: No, there were no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">NL: There were no civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">HF: No civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">NL: So you were just on a siding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">HF: On a, yeah, Just standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">NL: And the guards waited?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">NL: Did they shoot any one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">HF: Not in our outfit.</span> <span id="s2546">Now, so we were there two days until, oh that was on Saturday, between the night of Saturday April 29th and Sunday April 30th the German guards just disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">NL: Ah ha, without any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">HF: Without any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">NL: Explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">HF: Explanation.</span> <span id="s2551">Just disappeared.</span> <span id="s2552">And then we didn’t know which way to go.</span> <span id="s2553">We just stood there.</span> <span id="s2554">And then on Sunday, April 30th, around noontime, the first American tanks approached us.</span> <span id="s2555">And everybody just started walking away from the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">NL: Train.</span> <span id="s2557">Ah ha.</span> <span id="s2558">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">HF: That was Patton’s Army, Patton’s Third Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">NL: Patton’s Third Army.</span> <span id="s2561">Were the American soldiers solicitous?</span> <span id="s2562">Did they have any food or water for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">HF: Well, the thing is they did not really have, they didn’t have any food either.</span> <span id="s2564">I mean, they had food and they shared but they only had their K rations.</span> <span id="s2565">They were advanced combat troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">NL: They were on their way east.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">HF: Yeah, well yes, they were.</span> <span id="s2568">And so therefore we were there again it was just fetching for ourselves.</span> <span id="s2569">You know, [unclear].</span> <span id="s2570">I mean they shared their little bit that they had but all, really they did not have it.</span> <span id="s2571">They were not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">NL: They were not equipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">HF: Equipped to handle anything.</span> <span id="s2574">They were not occupying troops.</span> <span id="s2575">They were strictly...</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">NL: Did they looked shocked when they saw you?</span> <span id="s2577">Or could you tell that they had had some experience with other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">HF: Well, they, the ones where the, see we were not in a camp.</span> <span id="s2579">We were really on a siding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">NL: But you must have been very thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">HF: Yeah, but they just kept on moving.</span> <span id="s2582">I mean it was not an occupying...</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">NL: Force.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">HF: It came but only like a week or so later that, you know, these people were not an occupying force.</span> <span id="s2585">They were strictly a tank unit that passed through and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">NL: That happened to meet you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">HF: Happened to meet up with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">NL: So how longer did you have to stay on this siding?</span> <span id="s2589">Or did you just leave?</span> <span id="s2590">You left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">HF: No, we just, everybody just, we just left.</span> <span id="s2592">We were in the Starnberger See, which is in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s2593">And we just walked south towards Starnberg, which was a little bigger city and people would just go to the farms and just get food from the German farmers and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">NL: You took it or were they, did they give it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">HF: Oh they was, yeah, they gave it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">NL: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">HF: Now, and this was basically the end of the war for us.</span> <span id="s2598">Now to say many things about it, in retrospect, all what happened to all those people during the war by the Germans, there was no atrocity committed by anybody towards any German civilian that I could remember, or that I saw, no force, forcing of, keep out of the houses.</span> <span id="s2599">Because we, even the liberated, the Jews, the non-Jews, they would sleep in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">NL: Sheds.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">HF: In the sheds and they would not chase any Germans out.</span> <span id="s2602">I mean the Germans would give them, give us food.</span> <span id="s2603">Actually, later the American troops that entered when we came like within the next few days when you get more occupying troops, as they progress, were much more hostile than the inmates.</span> <span id="s2604">So I guess everybody was so exhausted they just did not have any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">NL: Energy left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">HF: Energy left to do more.</span> <span id="s2607">I mean I remember somebody, they got a cow.</span> <span id="s2608">They killed it and made, they cooked it and stuff and everybody organized a little bit.</span> <span id="s2609">But basically no...</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">NL: I suppose partly you were just so stunned to be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">NL: Wasn’t that part of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">NL: Stunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">HF: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">NL: You didn’t know really how to react because you had been enslaved for such a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">HF: Yeah, we just walked and then we stayed in different places every night and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">NL: Farms, mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">HF: Farms, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">NL: And you were able to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">NL: You could find a way, yes.</span> <span id="s2623">And how long did that go on then, a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">HF: Well, it went on.</span> <span id="s2625">Eventually the German occu-, eh, the American occupying forces came more like over, but Germany was in a total chaos at that time.</span> <span id="s2626">I mean there was no government, no German government.</span> <span id="s2627">There were no German railroads.</span> <span id="s2628">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s2629">And when the whole country was just at a standstill.</span> <span id="s2630">There was really nothing operating at that time.</span> <span id="s2631">The war was not over yet.</span> <span id="s2632">The war lasted another actually another seven days, until May 7.</span> <span id="s2633">But the American soldiers were telling, you know, would come, by that time they would get more food.</span> <span id="s2634">Whoever they would find.</span> <span id="s2635">Then the whole country was nothing but a movement of people.</span> <span id="s2636">The Germans would move.</span> <span id="s2637">Everybody would just be on the roads going somewheres.</span> <span id="s2638">And we just, my father and I just did not want to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s2639">Germany, you know, we made an effort to basically just walk out of Germany.</span> <span id="s2640">After a few days we walked from Munich to Augsburg, which is 120 kilometers, over several days, stopping every night.</span> <span id="s2641">And from there we got already on some trucks with some American soldiers.</span> <span id="s2642">They were going from Augsburg to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s2643">And then from Stuttgart we, there were already trains going.</span> <span id="s2644">And so they were already packed with people, bringing back French prisoners of war to France.</span> <span id="s2645">And so we got on with them and they came from western Europe.</span> <span id="s2646">We got on with them to France.</span> <span id="s2647">And from France we went back to Belgium because we never really knew what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s2648">We didn’t know if she survived or if she did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">HF: So we didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">NL: Did you get any information in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">HF: I showed it to you last week.</span> <span id="s2653">Remember that document paper...</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">NL: The document...</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">NL: That, you got that in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">HF: In Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">NL: In Belgium.</span> <span id="s2659">I see.</span> <span id="s2660">And what was the agency now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">HF: That was a Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">NL: A Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">HF: By that time Belgium was already in normal conditions because Belgium was already liberated like six or eight months before or even maybe ten months.</span> <span id="s2664">But things were already pretty normal in Belgium at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">NL: Was it Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">HF: Antwerp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">NL: And did you see many Jews returning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2669">There...by that time Jews were returning to Antwerp or to their places.</span> <span id="s2670">See, all the, like the DP camps in Germany and all that, we never saw them, because we had actually left Germany before these DP camps were even formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">NL: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">HF: Because we just had such a desire to get that behind us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">HF: So we left there and then we...</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">NL: Did you meet up with any people you knew, old neighbors or old friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">NL: Landsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">HF: [unclear] No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">NL: And were you helped economically?</span> <span id="s2680">Did the Jewish Agency...</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">HF: In Belgium?</span> <span id="s2682">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">NL: Give you any money or clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2685">When we got there, when we got to Belgium they gave us, they put us up where they had like a..</span> <span id="s2686">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">NL: Dormitories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">HF: Dormitories for the refugees to put them up and then they helped them financially and even the Belgium government and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2691">So within three weeks after we were liberated we were in Belgium.</span> <span id="s2692">Now while, I mean, we were fortunate.</span> <span id="s2693">Our train was really not attacked by American troops while we were still moving, but there was a train only a short distance from us which we met that the Germans had parked, so to say, next to an ammunition train.</span> <span id="s2694">And this ammunition train was bombed.</span> <span id="s2695">And a lot of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">NL: Inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">HF: Inmates were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">NL: Killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">HF: Died.</span> <span id="s2700">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">NL: The day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">HF: Yeah, everybody, we saw fears that day of liberation because we heard, found out later that in Dachau it was, we were only a few kilometers away, the Germans had decided to kill everybody in Dachau before the Americans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">NL: And they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">HF: No they did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">NL: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">HF: They didn’t, because somehow word had gotten to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2707">And they made a special effort to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">NL: Get there early.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">HF: Get there, [unclear] to get there ahead of time.</span> <span id="s2710">But those things we found out after liberation.</span> <span id="s2711">We did not know then.</span> <span id="s2712">And this is, basically ends the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">NL: And so you stayed in Antwerp how long?</span> <span id="s2714">This might have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">HF: Well we stayed in Antwerp until we came to the United States, until December 1946.</span> <span id="s2716">We applied for a visa to come to the United States as soon as we got to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s2717">And we came to the United States in December of ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">NL: And were you able to work at all during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">HF: Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s2720">By that time we could, everybody could basically do it.</span> <span id="s2721">They could work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">NL: There was no prohibition against foreign Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">HF: No, no, no, no, no, not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">NL: And what did Father do, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">HF: I worked in a, although I was 16 years, I worked in a shop where there were manufacturing fur coats.</span> <span id="s2726">And he worked somewhere where they were, in the direct like supervision for kosher bread.</span> <span id="s2727">He was like a supervisor.</span></p> <p><span

you applied to live here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">HF: Yeah, because we had relatives in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">NL: Cousins or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">HF: No, I had an aunt.</span> <span id="s2738">It was my mother’s sister, who left Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">NL: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">HF: In 1939 and they...</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">NL: She had established herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">HF: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">NL: And you knew her address.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">HF: Well, we knew her address.</span> <span id="s2745">And they had moved in the meantime.</span> <span id="s2746">But there was also a coincidence.</span> <span id="s2747">I mean we met an Ame-, they had lived in San Francisco, and we met an American soldier, right, that, an American Jewish soldier, right, a couple days after our liberation.</span> <span id="s2748">You know, we were all talking.</span> <span id="s2749">And he said he was from San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2750">And he wrote to, he says he’s going to write his girlfriend in San Francisco to let our relatives know that we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">NL: Oh, oh that was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">HF: And he told us afterwards that they got the message.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">NL: They got the message and then they communicated with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">HF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2755">Well in the meantime we’d left.</span> <span id="s2756">I mean they didn’t know where we were with all the, because were still on the move.</span> <span id="s2757">We were still in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">HF: But at least they knew that we had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">NL: They knew that you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">HF: And later when we got to Belgium of course then there things already was normal because it was brighter and there, but in Germany itself when we were liberated, there was really no postal service, no transportation.</span> <span id="s2762">There was really nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">NL: Did you get any sense as to what the Jews in Belgium were planning?</span> <span id="s2764">Were a number of them planning to stay?</span> <span id="s2765">Some going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">HF: Well, the young ones planned to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2767">And I was also part of the, then of the Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">NL: Really?</span> <span id="s2769">Did you want to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">HF: I wanted to go to Palestine, but a relative from America had come here would help me get an education and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2771">But a lot, some of them, some Jews, they were already established by that time.</span> <span id="s2772">They were most in the diamond business.</span> <span id="s2773">And they really stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">NL: They stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">HF: They stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">HF: They, the ones that were needy from Belgium that had come back.</span> <span id="s2778">Although some, we have a cousin who left, although he was established.</span> <span id="s2779">Because there was at that time a fear, still a fear of the Russians, that the Russians would invade.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">NL: Come west.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">HF: Come west.</span> <span id="s2782">Not in ‘46, but later like 1948, ‘49, when the Cold War started.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">NL: After they absorbed the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">HF: A lot of Jews from Belgium went to America.</span> <span id="s2785">Although they were established in Belgium...</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">HF: And they were doing rather well, but like my cousin, they were, he was never as well established in 20 years in the States when he came here as he was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s2788">But they just had fear that they didn’t want to go through another war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">NL: It’s understandable of course, yeah.</span> <span id="s2790">Did you, you didn’t go to school at all?</span> <span id="s2791">You were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">HF: In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">HF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">NL: You were working.</span> <span id="s2796">And so when you came here, was it in New York or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">HF: Yeah, yeah, right in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">NL: And did you then, were you then able to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">HF: Well, when I came, no, when I came to the States...</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">NL: You were already 18 I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">HF: No, I was 17, not quite 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">NL: Oh, O.K., 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">HF: I was not quite 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">NL: Not quite 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">HF: It was 19-, O.K., so I came 19-, in December of ‘46.</span> <span id="s2806">I was born in ‘29.</span> <span id="s2807">I was just 17 going on 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">NL: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">HF: Well I worked in the day time and went to school at night.</span> <span id="s2810">I had never finished, actually I had never really gone to high school.</span> <span id="s2811">I only went up to, see, I went three grades.</span> <span id="s2812">First, second and third grade I went in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2813">Fourth, fifth grade in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s2814">Sixth and seventh grade in France.</span> <span id="s2815">And we were going to a village school.</span> <span id="s2816">And then when I came to America I started going to high school at night and worked in the day time and I went to high school at night.</span> <span id="s2817">And I finished high school in the, in 1949.</span> <span id="s2818">It was in a..</span> <span id="s2819">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">NL: Was it a struggle for you both?</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">NL: Did you live with your relatives for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">HF: No, no, they lived on the west coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">NL: Oh, oh, so you didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">HF: Yeah, we visited them once.</span> <span id="s2826">But then I..</span> <span id="s2827">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">HF: No, we stayed in New York...</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">HF: Until 1950, and then we moved to Vineland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">NL: Did you know some people there?</span> <span id="s2833">Did Father know some people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">HF: Yeah, we met people.</span> <span id="s2835">We knew some people from before.</span> <span id="s2836">We knew some people from before.</span> <span id="s2837">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s2838">He knew people from before the war who had emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">NL: But did this family, the relatives, provide you with an affidavit or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">HF: Yeah, they provided us with the affidavit, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">NL: There were papers that you might have needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">NL: And so that was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">NL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">HF: They provided us with the affidavit to come here.</span> <span id="s2847">Otherwise we would not have been able to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">NL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2849">Well now, please, let’s go back and go...</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">NL: Continuing our interview with Mr. Finder, tape three, side two.</span> <span id="s2852">Yes, if you could say a few words about the feeling of hope or hopefulness that kept you going from day to day, Mr. Finder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">HF: Well, I think this is one of the things that are most difficult for people to understand—what, how come people survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">HF: And especially, I mean you learn in history books, because you learn facts, but you don’t learn the question of human emotion.</span> <span id="s2856">And basically what helped me to survive was the hope that the end or liberation would come very soon.</span> <span id="s2857">In other words, if you had told people they would be in concentration camps for two years or three years, or, a matter of fact anywhere, people would probably...</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">NL: Give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">HF: Would have given up very soon.</span> <span id="s2860">The people that gave up really did not last.</span> <span id="s2861">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">NL: Well, you must have known that for quite a long time Germany was winning, or didn’t you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">HF: Well, we knew, well, when we got into the camp it was already 1942.</span> <span id="s2864">And so Germany was at that time already at a sort of a stalemate in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">NL: In Russia, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">HF: And maybe the hopes were false hopes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">NL: But they...</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">HF: But I remember already we heard about the retreat in Stalingrad, which was ‘43, which was, and we were only in the camp already a short duration.</span> <span id="s2869">And even with that, I don’t know, there was always the, but I remember the hope that things cannot last, that things will sort of come to, that the, maybe the Americans would help.</span> <span id="s2870">Maybe the Germans would collapse.</span> <span id="s2871">The Russians were, I mean, maybe these were unrealistic things, looking back today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">NL: But they kept you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">HF: But they kept the people going.</span> <span id="s2874">And it is very hard for people to understand who were not in the same situation, that hope that existed, that somehow we would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">NL: You would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">HF: That as long as people lived, and no matter how weak they were and how hard they worked and how much beatings or cruelty was committed against them, that they would survive.</span> <span id="s2877">I think this is the problem.</span> <span id="s2878">Most people that study the Holocaust cannot come to grips with.</span> <span id="s2879">They sort of say, “Well, why didn’t people fight or why didn’t they revolt or do something?”</span> <span id="s2880">But people had the hope that if they would survive, so therefore they did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">NL: Have to plan or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">HF: No, I wouldn’t say have to plan.</span> <span id="s2883">Did not feel, why endanger, everybody wanted to keep as low a profile...</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">NL: Ah, that’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">HF: As possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">NL: Yeah, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">HF: As low a profile.</span> <span id="s2888">And naturally you didn’t go out to get out to get beatings.</span> <span id="s2889">You didn’t go out to try to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">NL: To try to provoke someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">HF: And to, I mean, work as little as possible.</span> <span id="s2892">And when you could, then you learn after a while to pace yourself.</span> <span id="s2893">I mean, when the German would come, you worked harder.</span> <span id="s2894">When they would go away, then you would walk away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">NL: You could slack off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">HF: Whenever you could you would slack off your work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">HF: And so therefore, I think this is a very hard thing.</span> <span id="s2899">And I think it’s a very harsh judgment made upon inmates or whatever you want to call us in concentration camps, why they did not resist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">NL: I agree, yeah.</span> <span id="s2901">I think it’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">HF: Because a typical example is, here you have Jews, most of them were not trained in anything.</span> <span id="s2903">And we came across our own workers, American prisoners of war, British prisoners of war, Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s2904">Now you would say, these are men who are taught to fight, who are all much stronger.</span> <span id="s2905">And none of them resisted.</span> <span id="s2906">They behaved just as meekly...</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">NL: As the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">HF: As the Jews.</span> <span id="s2909">And there is no criticism...</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">HF: Leveled against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">NL: Yeah, I often bring this up.</span> <span id="s2913">I think it’s so unfair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">HF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">NL: And four, what is it, four million Russian prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">HF: You read about...</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">NL: There was no revolt of any kind among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">HF: And you read about the, of course I didn’t experience that but you sort of, the Polish officers that were, there were people you would think they were trained and, to fight and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">NL: Quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">HF: And when they just, I know.</span> <span id="s2921">And the first year when we were at that same labor camp in Poland, we had contacts with many American war prisoners and the British war prisoners who worked, I mean, on the work place, not on the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">HF: They had different camps and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">NL: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">HF: Occasionally they would slip us some food if they could.</span> <span id="s2926">But as far as their behavior, it was not more heroic.</span> <span id="s2927">And there were people in all age brackets.</span> <span id="s2928">And the Jewish inmates were not trained to fight.</span> <span id="s2929">We were, we had no food.</span> <span id="s2930">Because all those, those war prisoners had much food than we.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">HF: First of all they got more food from the Germans and they all got packages and got clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">NL: The International Red Cross helped, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">HF: And they had, they did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">NL: So it’s a very lopsided equation and I often raise this question why people don’t choose the French or the Poles or the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">HF: They were, and besides this there were thousands or maybe hundreds of foreign laborers in Germany.</span> <span id="s2937">And nobody...</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">HF: Revolted.</span> <span id="s2940">Everybody was very meek and took...</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">NL: Meek.</span> <span id="s2942">And obedient, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">HF: Obedient and meek and all the criticism is directed against... And the same thing, you have to bear in mind the punishment.</span> <span id="s2944">I mean if one inmate would run away, they would kill 50 other inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">NL: Terrible [?]</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">HF: Now how can you, that responsibility?</span> <span id="s2947">But if one American soldier ran away they did not kill 50 Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">NL: It wasn’t the same kind of intimidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">HF: I don’t think there was any because they were all, I mean, there was records of how many were there and they were afraid against their own prisoners.</span> <span id="s2952">So, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">HF: So, but this is hard for people to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">NL: Well I think they have to recognize it as a reality and then it’s not so hard to understand.</span> <span id="s2956">But if you know that, you know, 50 people may be killed if you were, hit a German officer or soldier, you’ll think a lot before you do it.</span> <span id="s2957">Now you were also saying before something about an awareness of Jewish holidays, religious holidays.</span> <span id="s2958">And did you depend on some rabbis or older Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">HF: I don’t think we had, well, we had some older Jews, some Orthodox Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">NL: Who knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">HF: We had alrea-, yeah, who knew, and had somehow kept track of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">NL: Some kept track.</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">HF: Who knew the dates somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">NL: And for instance on Friday night was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">HF: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">NL: There was no Friday or Shabbat.</span> <span id="s2967">You were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">HF: We were always working.</span> <span id="s2969">The only time would be like, I know on the first of, like we had some Jews would take a, would not eat any bread on Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">NL: They knew it was Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">HF: They knew it was Pesach.</span> <span id="s2972">Or on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, they would make like a small minyan in the back of the barracks, although that was strictly forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">NL: Is that so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">HF: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">NL: They could have been killed for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">HF: Oh yeah, killed or punished or beaten, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">NL: And people would just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">HF: Flogged.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">NL: Remember the prayers, the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s2981">Yeah, everything by heart.</span> <span id="s2982">But that was also again in the sense of hope.</span> <span id="s2983">I mean not all hope was strictly geared towards man.</span> <span id="s2984">I mean a lot of hope was geared towards God.</span> <span id="s2985">I mean, if you believe in religious beliefs, for those that believed, by the same token you can say, “Well, that hope was part messianic, hoping God would somehow, there would come an end to this thing.”</span> <span id="s2986">And basically this would sustain everybody.</span> <span id="s2987">There was hope in God.</span> <span id="s2988">Well, because many people will ask you today, “How come, how could you believe in God under these circumstances?”</span> <span id="s2989">So that’s not true either.</span> <span id="s2990">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">NL: You do believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">HF: You do believe.</span> <span id="s2993">I think under those circumstances...</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">NL: You have to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">HF: You believe stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">NL: There’s nothing else to believe in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">HF: There’s nothing else to believe in.</span> <span id="s2998">You believe strongly.</span> <span id="s2999">You believe strongly in God and you believe strong that some miraculous thing will happen.</span> <span id="s3000">And this is the...</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">NL: To take you out of this terrible...</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">HF: To take you out of it.</span> <span id="s3003">And I strongly, I believe.</span> <span id="s3004">Of course I cannot witness to that, but through my own feelings, experiences, that’s [unclear].</span> <span id="s3005">And people say, “Why didn’t people rebel when they went to the gas chambers?”</span> <span id="s3006">Because there was always that belief, to the very end, that there will be an intervention before the final hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">NL: And these were supposed to be showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">NL: Where one was going to be cleaned up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">HF: But everybody, there was always a feeling they will be, that, of survival, and there would be...</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">NL: A better day.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">HF: Better, yeah.</span> <span id="s3013">There will come an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">NL: An end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">HF: An end to their suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">NL: Do you remember any particular figures, older people, who instilled this hope in you?</span> <span id="s3017">Political leaders or rabbis?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">HF: No, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">NL: But just among yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">HF: It was, yes, there was no political thing.</span> <span id="s3021">It was talking and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">NL: Just talking.</span> <span id="s3023">Did Father...</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">HF: People...</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">NL: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">HF: There was a lot of, continually, I mean, people would talk a lot among themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">NL: You weren’t punished for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">HF: No, no, we could talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">NL: But you would have to speculate because you had so little information.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">HF: Yeah, but people, well, but people would talk about, well a main topic of conversation was always food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">HF: Food.</span> <span id="s3033">People only had one, actually, they didn’t even have a wish of liberation.</span> <span id="s3034">Their biggest wish was to have one, enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">NL: A good meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">HF: Once enough food to eat to be, that was one of the biggest dreams of people, to have food.</span> <span id="s3037">More than even, see the [unclear] liberation [unclear] food and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">NL: Warm clothing or warmer [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">HF: But food was really, because was more, was more
