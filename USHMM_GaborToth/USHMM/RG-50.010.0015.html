LaVista and Briarcliff.</span> <span id="s7">Mr. Budansky lives at a motel at present on Clairmont Avenue, N.E. at 30329.</span> <span id="s8">He was born May 16, 1924.</span> <span id="s9">He was between the ages of 19 and 20 at the time he was involved in the liberation of various ghettoes, labor camps and a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s10">At the time he entered the service in Russia he was already in military training.</span> <span id="s11">His military unit was 171 Division, a tank corps.</span> <span id="s12">His rank at the time of liberation of the various ghettoes was lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">He liberated and saw the following ghettoes, labor camps and concentration camp.</span> <span id="s14">In Russia he saw the Vilna Ghetto, he was in the Riga Ghetto and Rovno Ghetto.</span> <span id="s15">In Poland, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Livuv Ghetto.</span> <span id="s16">The labor camp that he was involved with was near Lodz, which was a small ghetto at which he saw only women and children when he entered.</span> <span id="s17">The concentration camp that he entered was Maidanek.</span> <span id="s18">Mr. Budansky, let's start from the beginning You are</span></p> <p><span id="s19">from Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I am actually Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: From Poland.</span> <span id="s22">Let's start back there then.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Rovno belonged...like from here to LaVista [Road] was Russia and here was Poland.</span> <span id="s24">And I was born in Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: You lived there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A..</span> <span id="s27">I was born there and I lived there until I was exactly 18 years old.</span> <span id="s28">Q: And then your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: And my whole family.</span> <span id="s30">My family -- my father, my mother, and my two sisters, my grandfather from my father's side, my grandmother from my mother's side, and all the uncles and the children.</span> <span id="s31">A family of 64 people.</span> <span id="s32">And when the Germans attacked in 19411 the choice was to run back to Russia.</span> <span id="s33">The only solution for the people was to run with the Russian Army and try to escape the Germans.</span> <span id="s34">But a lot of Jewish people were thinking different.</span> <span id="s35">They were talking to each other like they didn't want to leave their homes, their furniture, and in this category were my father and mother.</span> <span id="s36">I begged them and they said, “What can they do to us?"</span> <span id="s37">And they didn't have time because the city of Rovno was burning around them.</span> <span id="s38">The Germans were 8 kilometers from the city when I was still in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: How many brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I had two sisters.</span> <span id="s41">Two sisters and one brother.</span> <span id="s42">Q: And you are the one brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: And I am the one.</span> <span id="s44">The oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So there were three children.</span> <span id="s46">And your mother and father did what?</span> <span id="s47">A: Mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">1Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and all of Poland came under German control.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: My father used to have a leather business.</span> <span id="s51">Q: Leather.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Leather.</span> <span id="s53">In those days they used to make leather for the horses and they used to make belts.</span> <span id="s54">They used to make all kinds of little bags.</span> <span id="s55">It was a little place and my father and grandfather together managed this business.</span> <span id="s56">I went to a Hebrew School in Rovno.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't go to public school because they found the money to put me in Hebrew School.</span> <span id="s58">And when the Germans attacked in 1941, I took only a pair of shoes and a jumper and I said that I would be back in two or three days.</span> <span id="s59">And all the young boys and I were running together with the Russians back to the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You were now in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, we were running with the Russians.</span> <span id="s62">Q: Just running with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">When we arrived in Kiev in a Russian truck, the Russians took us out and they told us, "You got two things.</span> <span id="s65">You can go to work or you can join the Army."</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Your parents and your family were still in Poland at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I left them in Poland.</span> <span id="s68">In Rovno.</span> <span id="s69">I heard over the radio that all of Rovno had fallen and already another couple of cities before they took Kiev.</span> <span id="s70">And from Kiev we didn't have enough time.</span> <span id="s71">They evacuated us to Kubishev, a big city in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Can you spell that for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I should say Samara, because they called it Samara in those days .</span> <span id="s74">And when we arrived in Samara they didn't ask us too many questions.</span> <span id="s75">They wrote a letter for us to come to a military point.</span> <span id="s76">We went through a medical checkup and they asked us what do you want to be?</span> <span id="s77">Where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s78">School?</span> <span id="s79">Or do you want to go straight into the Army and go to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Where did you live at that time with these boys that you went with?</span> <span id="s81">A: We lived in a place like here you call it when the....</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: A youth hostel or....</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: A hostel but a [unintelligible] was a hostel!</span> <span id="s84">No water, no nothing.</span> <span id="s85">You can imagine there in Russia.</span> <span id="s86">I cried every night, "When can I see my parents?"</span> <span id="s87">I was not young, 18 years old, but was still feeling when can I see my family again.</span> <span id="s88">The time came that all the boys from Rovno talked to each other.</span> <span id="s89">We knew we had no chance to get back unless we went back and gave ourselves up to the Germans and we would go to the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: You knew about the concentration camps already then?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s92">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s93">I knew what a concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s94">I knew they were taking the Jewish people around and taking them away.</span> <span id="s95">But they didn't know....</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: This was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s98">And then in Kubishev I met a Russian family with another boy on a train traveling from one city to a little city.</span> <span id="s99">And before the end of the military, the officers school, they invited us home for dinner.</span> <span id="s100">They were very nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">They kept us one week.</span> <span id="s102">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s103">They didn't have beds for us but they kept us for one week, and then after three weeks we came to the military point where they were taking the people.</span> <span id="s104">We went through a medical check up.</span> <span id="s105">Very quick.</span> <span id="s106">They didn't make it big like they do here.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Not very detailed?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No.</span> <span id="s109">As long as you had two hands and two eyes and two legs -- bad leg, good leg -- you're okay.</span> <span id="s110">And I was very happy because they told us that it would take a minimum of 18 months to two years to become an officer or to become something that you want.</span> <span id="s111">But one morning, just 8 1/2 months later, they woke us up and put us in this big place, and in front of us were new uniforms.</span> <span id="s112">They gave us a shower.</span> <span id="s113">They gave us [unintelligible] and took us in the new uniforms, we went back on the trains, and we went to the front line.</span> <span id="s114">When we went to the front line, I don’t need to tell you it was very, very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s117">Not only frightening but it's all this shooting.</span> <span id="s118">The Germans attacked us very, very hard.</span> <span id="s119">But God was with me all the time.</span> <span id="s120">I was wounded in the first three months but very light.</span> <span id="s121">And they put me in a little hospital and they kept me about seven weeks and right away it was back to the front line to the same division.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Did you hear from your parents or your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s124">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s125">I tried and I couldn't.</span> <span id="s126">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s127">Q: There was never any mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Never.</span> <span id="s129">Oh, no, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s130">When I went to the front line, I was with two Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s131">There were four people in my tank.</span> <span id="s132">One was from the Saradominga.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: He was from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s135">In Rumania.</span> <span id="s136">And you know a military man gets a, how you call it, a helmet.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: The helmet.</span> <span id="s138">The hard helmet.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And we would get out of the tank when it was stationery, to have breakfast maybe or something to eat.</span> <span id="s140">I always begged him, "Misha, never take off your helmet because a sniper can pick you off.</span> <span id="s141">If you are shot, you may have a chance to live.</span> <span id="s142">But if you’re shot in the head, you haven't got a chance."</span> <span id="s143">And he did it for a couple of weeks and then he forgot and a sniper took him and he died in my hands.</span> <span id="s144">I called him and in a second he was gone.</span> <span id="s145">I started to cry, "Why does this happen to a good Yiddish boy like that?"</span> <span id="s146">But I took it like I took everything.</span> <span id="s147">I am in the Army.</span> <span id="s148">I lost my family.</span> <span id="s149">I don't know what's going on there.</span> <span id="s150">All of our Jewish boys were very experienced, very smart.</span> <span id="s151">What I mean by smart is that in school they taught us about the tanks, what you're doing with the tanks, how to go to the front line, how to protect, how to shoot.</span> <span id="s152">Everything was okay.</span> <span id="s153">Other people didn't pick it up as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: But you went to a Jewish school you said?</span> <span id="s155">A: In Rovno, before the war.</span> <span id="s156">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: But there you didn't learn anything about the military.</span> <span id="s158">A: No.</span> <span id="s159">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: But this was after the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I went to the Hebrew school when I was 13, 14, 15.</span> <span id="s162">I speak Hebrew today.</span> <span id="s163">I never lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s164">And I speak German.</span> <span id="s165">That will come later.</span> <span id="s166">I'll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Then after 15 you went into a military school?</span> <span id="s168">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: You were still in Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I went into the military when I was 18 after the Germans had already occupied half of Poland.</span> <span id="s171">The war started in 1939 if you remember.</span> <span id="s172">I don't think that you remember.</span> <span id="s173">You're young.</span> <span id="s174">In 1939 the Germans took half of Poland.</span> <span id="s175">The Russians took half of Poland.</span> <span id="s176">Stalin and Hitler signed the pact.</span> <span id="s177">2 But Hitler outsmarted Stalin and he prepared himself two years for 1941 and then out of nowhere he attacked [Russia] and unfortunately the Russians were nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">And especially in the Ukraine, General Blassov was pro German and he gave all 2August 23, 1939 Germany and Russia signed a non-aggression pact and a political agreement about Poland.</span> <span id="s179">Germany attacked Poland from the west on September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s180">Russia invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939.</span> <span id="s181">On September 28, Germany and Russia signed an agreement dividing Poland between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">of about 4 or 5 divisions with the tanks, with everything, over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s183">But that's beside the point in my story.</span> <span id="s184">I had been in the army, I was kaneinora, very smart.</span> <span id="s185">I learned very easily to operate a tank and to be a little bit more than average from the shaygetz, from the Russian Goy.</span> <span id="s186">And they knew I was Jewish and they loved me and they always listened to me exactly when we went in to fight.</span> <span id="s187">They always listened to me and they gave me [unintelligible], like sergeant, and I became....</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: A title.</span> <span id="s189">They gave you a title.</span> <span id="s190">And you became a leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And when our corps went in to fight, the Germans took us around once.</span> <span id="s192">Q: They surrounded you.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: And one Major of our corps and the General and everybody always came to ask me my opinion.</span> <span id="s194">What do you think?</span> <span id="s195">How can we get out of this trouble?</span> <span id="s196">And like always -- my wife knows in business -- I always kaneinora.</span> <span id="s197">I always gave a good atezer.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: A good answer.</span> <span id="s200">I didn't know how it worked but it worked.</span> <span id="s201">There was a big fight near Riga, 8 kilometers from Riga in Latvia.</span> <span id="s202">We had been in very, very big trouble with a SS Division and about 160 tanks were involved on our side.</span> <span id="s203">Our major was killed, our colonel was killed, and many lieutenants.</span> <span id="s204">In Russia it was nothing to become a lieutenant in wartime.</span> <span id="s205">To get a medal you shoot down three tanks and you got a medal.</span> <span id="s206">But in my position I had to figure out how to work the fighting and how to get out of this trouble.</span> <span id="s207">Then they made me a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s208">In practice, not theory, I’m a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s209">In this particular battle when the major and the colonel were killed, they all agreed I should take over command because we were in a very bad position and all of us were in danger.</span> <span id="s210">I gave the command, and we lost a lot but I came out of it although I was shot.</span> <span id="s211">I think I opened the top of my tank and I took out my binoculars to look where the German Tigers were.</span> <span id="s212">And they weren't far away.</span> <span id="s213">They were about 200-300 yards away, still looking at us.</span> <span id="s214">But I gave a command [unintelligible] -- right flank, left flank to go against them then [unintelligible] we were still going after them.</span> <span id="s215">We went.</span> <span id="s216">We fought very hard, but when I went out and looked where they were, I got shot here.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Right in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: But, I had koich when I was young.</span> <span id="s219">Q: You had "strength".</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: The strength.</span> <span id="s221">I went into the tank.</span> <span id="s222">I got the command from there.</span> <span id="s223">Q: Your earphones.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: The earphones.</span> <span id="s225">And half hour later I still was giving the commands.</span> <span id="s226">Q: After your injury?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: After my injury.</span> <span id="s228">I gave the command and the man who was sitting next to me, the driver of the tank, saw the blood running.</span> <span id="s229">He said, "Jenya -- in Russian they called me Jenya -- you get away.</span> <span id="s230">Give it over to another one, to the navigator."</span> <span id="s231">I said, no.</span> <span id="s232">I must take them out.</span> <span id="s233">In half an hour we picked them up, we came out, and then they made me a real official lieutenant.</span> <span id="s234">They took me to the hospital in Siberia.</span> <span id="s235">Then Olga Yakinov, a Jewish Sergeant, took this operation from thereon.</span> <span id="s236">And when the Germans got to Stalingrad and to Moscow, it was a very big decision for Stalin to take over and he took over command.</span> <span id="s237">Chuikov and Rokossovsky, the generals, had been very, very good particularly in those days, and they took over 11 or 12 divisions from Siberia.</span> <span id="s238">They were fighting for Japan, and they took over the whole [unintelligible] from there and the old people they sent there.</span> <span id="s239">And with the strength of this young division and Stalingrad they took the German Army.</span> <span id="s240">I had been in Stalingrad for two months because my division was a special division, a breakthrough division.</span> <span id="s241">When there was a bad situation on the front line, they always sent us there because of my success.</span> <span id="s242">That's why the high command put us in a very, very bad position.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: The front line.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Front line all the time.</span> <span id="s245">And we did a good job.</span> <span id="s246">I am proud I’m alive, but I killed so many Germans.</span> <span id="s247">I saw how many I killed.</span> <span id="s248">They came to me and said, "Good Russ, Good Russ."</span> <span id="s249">When we took the Germans inside, to Russia's side, we used to ask them questions like you're asking now and I became, how you say...?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You were an interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I was an interpreter for six months.</span> <span id="s252">The General asked, "Who speaks German?"</span> <span id="s253">I said I didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s254">I spoke Yiddish, Jewish, but I spoke German well enough.</span> <span id="s255">"Okay, Jenya, come here."</span> <span id="s256">I started to interview them, and we looked under the arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Under the arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: It was the SS [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s259">Q: SS burnt in?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Burnt into the armpits.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Under the arm.</span> <span id="s263">Yes.</span> <span id="s264">That was the SS.</span> <span id="s265">I interviewed thousands.</span> <span id="s266">And we said, “SS to the right, the others to the left.”</span> <span id="s267">All the SS were interviewed for one or two hours.</span> <span id="s268">Then in the [unintelligible] boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s269">There was no court, no giving them food or nothing.</span> <span id="s270">They didn't make a big deal out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: In other words you had the SS on one side, and the other soldiers were on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: They took the others to Russia to build Russia, to work in the camps.</span> <span id="s273">But the SS...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did you interview the SS?</span> <span id="s275">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s276">.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What were some of the things you had to ask the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: One in particular I will never forget in all my life.</span> <span id="s279">He was Garnfelt.</span> <span id="s280">Q: Garnfelt?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Ginfelt or Garnfelt.</span> <span id="s282">I forget exactly what the spelling of his name was.</span> <span id="s283">He had blond hair.</span> <span id="s284">He was about 36 or 37.</span> <span id="s285">And they called his name and he came to my table.</span> <span id="s286">I said, “Now sit down.</span> <span id="s287">What's your name?"</span> <span id="s288">And there was another man sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: With his typewriter?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: "Which division?</span> <span id="s291">How old are you?</span> <span id="s292">When did you join the SS?"</span> <span id="s293">I asked him all the questions.</span> <span id="s294">I asked, "Why did you join the SS?"</span> <span id="s295">He said, "Because they made me."</span> <span id="s296">I said, "Don't tell me stories.</span> <span id="s297">Nobody makes anybody do that.</span> <span id="s298">You are a young man."</span> <span id="s299">He said, "Yes, but I didn't kill the Jews."</span> <span id="s300">He saw I spoke German and he was so smart.</span> <span id="s301">He said, "I am sure I didn’t kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s302">Believe me.”</span> <span id="s303">I said, "Look, I believe you, but you tell me where, how, in which division, where you have been in Russian territory and Poland."</span> <span id="s304">And he told me the story where he had been and when I said he must go to the right...I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s305">I'll always remember this moment that I was a machiyah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: It was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: He fell on his knees and he said, "Please, I have two little girls at home.</span> <span id="s308">I live in Boyton.</span> <span id="s309">My wife wants to see me and I’d like to see my family."</span> <span id="s310">I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s311">Didn't you think when you became an SS how many Jewish families, mothers and fathers, would want to see each other and the children?</span> <span id="s312">And you took them to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s313">You killed them.</span> <span id="s314">You tore the children.</span> <span id="s315">You broke the legs.</span> <span id="s316">How could you do a thing like that?"</span> <span id="s317">He said, "But they told me to do it.</span> <span id="s318">I didn't want to do it."</span> <span id="s319">I said, "Now, look out at the Germans here.</span> <span id="s320">They haven't got the SS here.</span> <span id="s321">But you made yourself, made the SS.3 I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s322">I can't help you.</span> <span id="s323">The last two hours you can eat."</span> <span id="s324">The Russians made a special kasha for them.</span> <span id="s325">He said, "But, please, you're the only man who can help me."</span> <span id="s326">I said, "Yes, in here I’m the only man who can help you.</span> <span id="s327">I can help you go with the same people who are going to the right."</span> <span id="s328">I took his address only because I wanted to see his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did you see his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s331">When they took him out, I didn't go to shoot because there was a special squad of 12 Russian officers.</span> <span id="s332">They took him away.</span> <span id="s333">And they took the papers where he had been, what division.</span> <span id="s334">That's all they wanted to know and....</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Out on the field.</span> <span id="s336">And they were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Straight away.</span> <span id="s338">It's a waste of money to give him food and drink and that trouble.</span> <span id="s339">When we took Boyton, Germany I was stationed over there.</span> <span id="s340">It was a little bit far to travel but I took two days off and I traveled to this address that he gave me.</span> <span id="s341">Some of the Germans had been living fantastically, in beautiful homes.</span> <span id="s342">Mrs. Kaiser.</span> <span id="s343">Franz Kaiser.</span> <span id="s344">And on the door was written Franz Kaiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Franz Kaiser was the one that you spoke to?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s347">I pushed the button and the door opened and a beautiful woman opened the door.</span> <span id="s348">I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s349">We are now here in Germany.</span> <span id="s350">Don't you worry.</span> <span id="s351">I'd like to talk to you."</span> <span id="s352">And then I saw the little kids, the little two girls.</span> <span id="s353">Straight away she made food and we sat down and she asked me one question at first, "How do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s354">I answered, “There are a lot of people in the world who speak German.</span> <span id="s355">A lot of people who speak Russian.</span> <span id="s356">But I didn't come to kill you.</span> <span id="s357">I didn’t came to do harm to you.</span> <span id="s358">I would like to ask you a couple of 3Mr.</span> <span id="s359">Budansky is probably referring to the “SS” burned into his armpit.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">questions.</span> <span id="s361">Where is your husband?"</span> <span id="s362">"My husband is in the Gefangnishaus in Russia.”</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: In the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: In jail.</span> <span id="s365">I said, "Do you know it for sure?"</span> <span id="s366">"Yes, they took him.</span> <span id="s367">They told me here from the German [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s368">They sent me a letter that he had been taken into Russia."</span> <span id="s369">I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s370">How old is your husband?</span> <span id="s371">“ “Thirty-five.”</span> <span id="s372">“Do you like him?”</span> <span id="s373">"Yes, I love him."</span> <span id="s374">I said, "Do you know what your husband did in the war?</span> <span id="s375">Could you tell me where he was?</span> <span id="s376">In what army?</span> <span id="s377">What uniform did he wear?"</span> <span id="s378">She said, "He was in the SS but he didn't do anything wrong."</span> <span id="s379">And then the bedroom door opened and the child came out from the bedroom.</span> <span id="s380">In the bedroom was a picture with her together with him in his SS uniform.</span> <span id="s381">I said, "Look, Mrs. Kaiser, I'll make it very quick.</span> <span id="s382">I haven't a lot of time.</span> <span id="s383">I don't want to harm you.</span> <span id="s384">You didn't do anything wrong to me.</span> <span id="s385">I talked to your husband on the front line.</span> <span id="s386">I caught your husband.</span> <span id="s387">Your husband will never come home."</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: I’m going to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s389">How old were you at the time?</span> <span id="s390">A: I was exactly 23 years old.</span> <span id="s391">Exactly.</span> <span id="s392">Not in a month later.</span> <span id="s393">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s394">That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I said, "Mrs. Kaiser, instead somebody will tell you that he’s alive.</span> <span id="s396">I would like you to have an easy life.</span> <span id="s397">Don’t join any more of these organizations.</span> <span id="s398">I wouldn't do you harm because I am not the government and I don’t know in what you've been involved but believe me, forget about your husband.</span> <span id="s399">Your husband was a killer.</span> <span id="s400">Your husband was a SS.</span> <span id="s401">He admitted that somebody told him to do it.”</span> <span id="s402">She started to cry a little bit.</span> <span id="s403">She said, "How did he look?"</span> <span id="s404">I told her he looked like that, like the picture in her bedroom, and that he begged me but I didn't have the power to save him and the children started to take out on the mother.</span> <span id="s405">Then she begged me to come again to visit her for dinner, to get something more from me.</span> <span id="s406">But I was very aware of what she wanted.</span> <span id="s407">I said, “Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s408">I must leave the city because I’m not staying any more here.”</span> <span id="s409">I can't forget the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: I have to ask you a question here.</span> <span id="s411">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: When you walked into that apartment and you saw this woman with the two children did you, at any time, feel sympathy for this family?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: In spite of what you knew about her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s416">If I hadn’t had a Jewish heart, if I had had the hatred I witnessed at the front line, I would have shot her because I shot a lot of Germans for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s417">Because our Jewish boys from Russia, Poland, [unintelligible], their hate was so much, madam, I can't explain to you.</span> <span id="s418">I have a captain, a friend of mine, who is in Israel and he cut here [unintelligible] and he said, "That's for my mother, that's for my father, that's for my brother, that's for my grandfather."</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: He cut some Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s421">I saw it with my eyes and I told him, not because I was seeing it, I said, "The Russian General will see it."</span> <span id="s422">And he used to have a lot of medals and he said, "If the German General will tell me something I will shoot him too."</span> <span id="s423">He took absolutely no mercy at all.</span> <span id="s424">Children, women, men.</span> <span id="s425">When you're driving in a tank and you are taking a city and people are looking out through the windows, the Russians are arriving, you can't put on your...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Rifle or your...from the town.</span> <span id="s428">The big....</span> <span id="s429">Q: Gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Gun to shoot exactly in the flat.</span> <span id="s431">And he drank a little bit of vodka and said, "Jenya, I will tell you how I laugh at life,” and he put on the gun and straight in the flats he took off a whole street.</span> <span id="s432">I said, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s433">He said, "Jenya, you forgot already."</span> <span id="s434">I said, "I couldn't [unintelligible].”</span> <span id="s435">I went through a lot, madam.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Certainly.</span> <span id="s437">Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I went through a lot in Berlin.</span> <span id="s439">When we took Berlin, the Americans were not there.</span> <span id="s440">We took all of Berlin and we were waiting for the Americans.</span> <span id="s441">Four hours, five hours later we saw the tanks.</span> <span id="s442">The Americans came in and then the Americans came out and when we caught up with each other we started to kiss each other and we were drinking and singing.</span> <span id="s443">And the only thing I remember is one Yank told me, "God damn, you're good.</span> <span id="s444">You're good."</span> <span id="s445">And he gave me a bottle.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: [Laughing].</span> <span id="s447">That was from a Yankee?</span> <span id="s448">From an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And he gave me a bottle.</span> <span id="s450">He was an American.</span> <span id="s451">He was with black on the top and he kissed me and I kissed him, because in those days we fought one war against the Germans.</span> <span id="s452">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s453">I didn't care about the Russians at all but I fought because I was against the Germans.</span> <span id="s454">95% of us didn't care if Russia won or lost, but the only thing was to go to the front line to see how to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s455">And the biggest officers in the Russian army were the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">You wouldn't believe how many I met in Berlin from different divisions, not only lieutenants.</span> <span id="s457">Like I told you it was nothing in the war to be a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s458">They made a lieutenant like that, but captains, majors, colonels, generals...a lot of them Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: I'm going to go back to the SS interrogation.</span> <span id="s460">When you talked to the SS....</span> <span id="s461">A: I can see him there in my eyes.</span> <span id="s462">In the night my wife asks what's wrong.</span> <span id="s463">I see him and the major next to me says, "What is he saying to you?"</span> <span id="s464">I say, “He's begging me for his life.”</span> <span id="s465">He said, "Send him away."</span> <span id="s466">I said, "I want to get more out of him."</span> <span id="s467">He says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s468">And in the line were more people and there were people [unintelligible] the SS.</span> <span id="s469">They couldn't run away because the Russians were standing with a big automatic and looking after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s471">Did you talk to any of the other SS?</span> <span id="s472">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Any other similar experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Some admitted.</span> <span id="s475">Some didn't want to admit.</span> <span id="s476">Some said we saved a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s477">Like when we went into Germany, every German said," Oh, we've been very good to the Jewish people."</span> <span id="s478">And that was a fact of life.</span> <span id="s479">They wanted to save themselves.</span> <span id="s480">What I want to say is the Americans were too good to them in the first two, three months.</span> <span id="s481">It could be a different story if the Russians would have had the full end of what to do with them.</span> <span id="s482">They would have cleaned them out and sent them completely to Siberia and the German Reich, the Germans, would be completely disappeared from the next 10-12 centuries.</span> <span id="s483">If only there had been no Nuremberg -- a big deal to give them "life" and to make a big story for all the world to know.</span> <span id="s484">We are Jewish.</span> <span id="s485">Today in Israel we'll kill two Arabs and the Arabs will kill a thousand Jews and they say the Jews are wrong.</span> <span id="s486">That's the way it was after W.W.I.</span> <span id="s487">The Jewish people wanted to go to emigrate to America, to Australia, to Canada and it was always very hard.</span> <span id="s488">Why?</span> <span id="s489">Because they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s490">But within half an hour the Embassy gave other people -- criminals or people who had been criminals -- a permit to go to Australia or to New Zealand.</span> <span id="s491">The Jewish family would have to go from one Embassy to another and they were fighting to go emigrate to another country.</span> <span id="s492">I remember because I went.</span> <span id="s493">For me it was easy because my people were in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s494">My story is that we defected.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: I want to get to that but we want to go back and move from your experience in the army.</span> <span id="s496">When you rounded up the SS, you became an interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: When did you visit the ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: When we went into the ghettos...we didn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s500">We stayed one to two days because we were a moving division.</span> <span id="s501">We couldn't go in and stay with them and [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Did you purposely go there?</span> <span id="s503">Did you know that you were going to a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s505">An hour before that we knew that there was a ghetto at this and this point because when a division is moving into a city, we have a map.</span> <span id="s506">We know everything that's in the city -- where is the factories, where is something like any military.</span> <span id="s507">We knew everything.</span> <span id="s508">But we didn't know exactly how big, what is...we knew there was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Were you given orders when you went into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s511">We were given orders not to give them food.</span> <span id="s512">We were given orders not to go in because there were electrical wires and things like that around.</span> <span id="s513">We were told not to touch anything.</span> <span id="s514">We were told we could look but only the medical corps, the generals, and the big people could go in to see what they could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">But like a Jew, like a chutzpah, my old friends and I pushed ourselves in.</span> <span id="s516">One survivor was standing on the [unintelligible], I remember, in Riga.</span> <span id="s517">He was so skinny that he couldn't even open his mouth and I wanted to give him something to put in his mouth.</span> <span id="s518">And one woman, a Russian nurse, caught me.</span> <span id="s519">"Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Lieutenant, please don't do it.</span> <span id="s521">First [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s522">There is infection.”</span> <span id="s523">First they cleaned them out then they lay them down on special medical...like you take an ambulance....</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Stretcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Stretchers.</span> <span id="s526">And first they washed him and then they gave him some injections, not here, but here....</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: In the back.</span> <span id="s528">Under the scapula bone?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes, I remember, because they couldn't find the veins.</span> <span id="s530">Q: Because they were so starved.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: That's why I have the nightmares.</span> <span id="s532">It's not only for my family.</span> <span id="s533">Sometimes my wife says it's been how long, how many years has it been?</span> <span id="s534">And I can see where I am going in.</span> <span id="s535">I am driving the tank.</span> <span id="s536">I can see the people dying and I am going out...over the people with the tank.</span> <span id="s537">I can see things and I am fortunate that I can still be a normal man after all this.</span> <span id="s538">I have been shot five times.</span> <span id="s539">I have been in the hospital, the front, the hospital, the front.</span> <span id="s540">That means it was a very bad experience for me and I thank God that I am alive, for I have nobody in the world.</span> <span id="s541">I got my wife and one daughter living in the United States, married to a Long-Islander boy, and he is finishing medical school.</span> <span id="s542">She is expecting a baby in August.</span> <span id="s543">That's when we decided, after 29 years living in that beautiful country [Australia], that maybe we can adjust to living with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Once you are a grandpa you will adjust.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s546">He wants to come to Emory.</span> <span id="s547">His parents want him in New York somewhere, or he wants somewhere in Florida or Miami.</span> <span id="s548">I don't know.</span> <span id="s549">But he wants very much to come to Emory.</span> <span id="s550">He's brilliant.</span> <span id="s551">He finished his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s552">Now he is finishing his M.D. He's the number one.</span> <span id="s553">He got special awards from the professors, from the medical school.</span> <span id="s554">He is very brilliant.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Gives you lots to be proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: I'm proud.</span> <span id="s557">I’m very proud.</span> <span id="s558">I’m proud I'm alive.</span> <span id="s559">I'm proud of what I went through.</span> <span id="s560">That's my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Oh, beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: My son-in-law, that's my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Wonderful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s564">Everything you went throug h is all worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s566">In Austria, when I talked to my friends, the Hungarian people, who didn't go through this...and when we would go to a party, and we would go out and tell stories, I would tell them, “I have been in the concentration camp, but I didn't go through what you went through.”</span> <span id="s567">And that's a fact.</span> <span id="s568">I went through a lot in ... I didn’t wish to be in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s569">I was very happy I was in the front line and I came out alive, because a lot of Jewish kids, in the thousands, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Again, I was the lucky one.</span> <span id="s571">My tank 22 times was battling on the time I was in the tank.</span> <span id="s572">I was the luckiest to get out and all of them were dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: It's hard to believe when you think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: When I start to think about it, when the Rabbi came in to the hospital and gave me the last words and I'm dying...the doctors said a heart like that they had never seen in their life, so they took out [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s575">When they wanted... it came water.</span> <span id="s576">From the water became thickness.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Thickened fluid.</span> <span id="s578">From the lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: It was too late, and the professor said he couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s580">And one doctor came in and made a hole and put a drain, and then they kept me, and I went [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s581">I was lying about a month on oxygen, of course.</span> <span id="s582">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: The will to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: The will to live and after what I had gone through I said I must live.</span> <span id="s585">Because then I was involved in the Irgun Zvi Leumi.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Yes, the Irgun.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I was involved in Europe in one, because they took us.</span> <span id="s588">This Irgun was very interested in our people -- all the Russians coming out from the army, the partisans.</span> <span id="s589">They had done a lot of jobs in Austria and in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Irgun.</span> <span id="s591">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: There is so much here and I am trying in my mind to move with you from one step to the next.</span> <span id="s594">You started to go into the ghettoes, and you went in.</span> <span id="s595">Through the military you were given instructions by your higher-ups as to what to do when you got into a ghetto, and those were very clear instructions.</span> <span id="s596">Medical instructions.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yes, there was a medical instruction for everybody not to go in, and not to touch even one man or one woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Not to give food.</span> <span id="s599">Did they tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: They don't explain too much to you.</span> <span id="s601">They don't want to give you why, what, where.</span> <span id="s602">When we arrived, we took [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s603">We took a camera.</span> <span id="s604">We took anything.</span> <span id="s605">And when we went in, they told us straight away, nobody can go next to their gates or around to talk to anybody or touch anything.</span> <span id="s606">“You can see, you can look, you can try to talk, but from far away.”</span> <span id="s607">Then the medical corps went in -- about 20 or 30 people, women and men, dressed with masks and everything.</span> <span id="s608">They took stretchers with ambulances.</span> <span id="s609">The minute they came in, they put people on stretchers, and then I remember I saw some drugs they gave some people on the tongue.</span> <span id="s610">Drops.</span> <span id="s611">What it was I couldn’t explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: I am comparing now what the American forces knew when they went into the camp as to what to do as compared to what you seemed to have known when you went in.</span> <span id="s613">Do you remember many people in the ghettoes dying as a result of getting food that they should not have gotten?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I could not explain it that they [unintelligible] not to get food.</span> <span id="s615">I would say the Russians were so occupied at the time and the people I saw dying there in the concentration camp were dying there when we liberated them.</span> <span id="s616">They were so excited.</span> <span id="s617">Some of them died maybe from excitement when they saw that some people had come to liberate them.</span> <span id="s618">I am sure they didn't know what army it was.</span> <span id="s619">Some of them only knew we were opening the gates and people were coming in to see them.</span> <span id="s620">I am sure a lot of women...I didn't want to explain how the other women were looking when I saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Somebody was naked, and some of them were mentally.</span> <span id="s623">Absolutely mentally.</span> <span id="s624">A: Mentally ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Even when you asked them what their name was they didn't know.</span> <span id="s626">They were shouting and they were hysterical, and they didn't know exactly what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s627">But after we left, the Russians or the government or the medical corps looked after them.</span> <span id="s628">But a lot of them died, and at the same time [unintelligible]I saw a lot of them just in daze.</span> <span id="s629">They came in and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did you see any guards when you came in?</span> <span id="s631">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: They had already gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: When the Russians came into our city, there were no guards.</span> <span id="s634">In the place in Rovno where my family was involved, the guards were not there.</span> <span id="s635">But I met ten families in the shul4 and when I came to them they told me they knew the people, not the Germans, but the Polish people in the town, and they robbed them more than the Germans.</span> <span id="s636">They gave me some names and where they lived and told me I could find some Jewish goods there.</span> <span id="s637">The Jewish people used to have nice things.</span> <span id="s638">They used to have the nice silver and nice things, so I went to catch them.</span> <span id="s639">But in those days, in Rovno, I couldn’t shoot them for every</span></p> <p><span id="s640">4Synagogue government was there.</span> <span id="s641">I could only give them over to the authorities.</span> <span id="s642">I found the materials, I found the forks, I found the shoes, the boots, the mink.</span> <span id="s643">I found everything put away which people told me about.</span> <span id="s644">I took it away.</span> <span id="s645">I took the family away, and I gave them over to the secret police.</span> <span id="s646">They were going to Siberia, and who knows if they would stay alive or not.</span> <span id="s647">In those days...not today, because today the hate is against the Jewish people, but in those days, it didn't matter if you were Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s648">If you fought for the country, for Russia, and you fought against the Germans, and you found a man like that cooperating with the Germans, he was a traitor, like a Russian runaway from the Army.</span> <span id="s649">He has no right to go to court.</span> <span id="s650">The court is on the spot.</span> <span id="s651">Boom and you’re gone.</span> <span id="s652">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s653">The Russians allowed no appeal.</span> <span id="s654">It was a different kind of ...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Completely different political situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Completely different altogether.</span> <span id="s657">There is no coming [unintelligible] and saying paragraph this and paragraph that.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Don't you need a convention?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No conventions, and no things like that.</span> <span id="s660">When I came out here, there was this man murdering people here in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s661">They gave him the chair and the night before, one woman was saying, “He is a good man and he must live.”</span> <span id="s662">Over there, there is no such thing as he must live.</span> <span id="s663">He killed a man.</span> <span id="s664">He goes.</span> <span id="s665">No paper, writing when it was, how it was.</span> <span id="s666">Forget it.</span> <span id="s667">Completely different mentality of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: I am going to go down the different ghettos now.</span> <span id="s669">We will start with the Vilna Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: The Vilna Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">[End of first tape.</span> <span id="s672">Conversation continues on new tape as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Soup.</span> <span id="s674">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: They got soup and the only people in charge was the medical corps and the big people who made their report: the government, [unintelligible] supplies with the liberated.</span> <span id="s676">That’s the people who were taking the names.</span> <span id="s677">All this informality goes on: from which city you are and not very friendly.</span> <span id="s678">They kissed them when...some children were very, very strong and very good; some Nazis took a child and killed him.</span> <span id="s679">I saw it with my eyes.</span> <span id="s680">They were very attached to some people.</span> <span id="s681">I didn’t say all the Russians, but some of them were very....to see a tragedy like that, they had been very, very attached.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s683">Did you go out and hug the Jews?</span> <span id="s684">Did you kiss any of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: I kissed...I took one boy who was about 16 years old, maybe, and I took him around.</span> <span id="s686">He was kaneinora.</span> <span id="s687">In this kind of position he was a little bit [unintelligible] still on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: There was still some meat left on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, a little bit.</span> <span id="s690">And I took him around and I taught him Yiddish.</span> <span id="s691">And he knew since I was Yiddish, he followed me and he caught me like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Hugged you.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: He hugged me.</span> <span id="s694">I said where is your father.</span> <span id="s695">He said no father, no mother, nobody.</span> <span id="s696">I said in Yiddish, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s697">We will take care of you.</span> <span id="s698">Maybe they’re still alive and in different camps.</span> <span id="s699">Maybe you‘ll find your uncles, your father, your mother.</span> <span id="s700">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s701">.”</span> <span id="s702">He said, “Please come again.”</span> <span id="s703">I said, “I’m sorry son.</span> <span id="s704">I still have to fight.</span> <span id="s705">I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s706">I would love to stay with you.</span> <span id="s707">I would love to see to help you more.”</span> <span id="s708">But the only help I could offer was to talk Yiddish to them.</span> <span id="s709">The biggest thing for me was to talk to them in Yiddish and say [unintelligible] “I can see what you went through.</span> <span id="s710">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s711">The Germans will never come again.”</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Your way of helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: It’s the mind...it’s the psychological thing.</span> <span id="s714">They still were thinkin g the Germans were coming so it mentally destroyed....</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: That you’ve killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s717">I told him don’t worry.</span> <span id="s718">There is no chance anymore the Germans will come again.</span> <span id="s719">You are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: The best news you could have given them.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: The best news I could give...knock on wood.</span> <span id="s722">The best news I could give the women “you’re free” in Yiddish and when I told them in Yiddish they were very, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s724">That was the best medicine for them at the time.</span> <span id="s725">I am sure.</span> <span id="s726">You went into the Riga Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Riga Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Similar thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Similar thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Anything unusual happen there?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: The Riga Ghetto was a very clean place, fortunately, for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s732">It wasn’t dirty like in other places.</span> <span id="s733">There were barracks, but in better condition than in other ones.</span> <span id="s734">They caught two people -- Latvians, not Germans -- still standing on the other side with no gun, nothing, but they pointed at them then the Russians caught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Those were Latvian guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Latvian guards of the camp.</span> <span id="s737">They told us that they would say they’ve been good to us, but actually they were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s738">But these two Latvians were thinking that they could get out of the trouble.</span> <span id="s739">They were young men, 27- 28.</span> <span id="s740">We went in.</span> <span id="s741">The same thing.</span> <span id="s742">I made myself clear.</span> <span id="s743">Not just me.</span> <span id="s744">With me was another 25 Jewish officers.</span> <span id="s745">We went in, [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s746">We couldn’t go where the medical corps was doing their job.</span> <span id="s747">We could only go where they had already been and some of them were lying on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: On the stretchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I said, “I am a Yid.</span> <span id="s750">Take it easy.</span> <span id="s751">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s752">They will take care of you.</span> <span id="s753">You will get food in another hour.</span> <span id="s754">You will get food.”</span> <span id="s755">They said, “Oh, God told you to give the food to me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: That God should give out to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I sent another boy, my friends.</span> <span id="s758">That was our help.</span> <span id="s759">Because actually to give them food was against the law.</span> <span id="s760">The Russians couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s761">I couldn’t give them anything.</span> <span id="s762">I had the power to take any meat from any farm and bring in as much as they wanted, but I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s763">They handled it.</span> <span id="s764">They took them away.</span> <span id="s765">They put them in places....</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: But you gave them the reassurance that....</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: The reassurance that the Germans wouldn’t come any more.</span> <span id="s768">For me, personally, I was very happy to save children.</span> <span id="s769">I saw children.</span> <span id="s770">Some children were still with the mothers.</span> <span id="s771">That was to me...because I left two young sisters.</span> <span id="s772">I didn’t cry but I cried inside.</span> <span id="s773">I cried in myself because like I say I was an Army man.</span> <span id="s774">Before I went in, I thought like that, to take my strength to talk to them.</span> <span id="s775">Then they took away the uniform from them.</span> <span id="s776">They didn’t let them go.</span> <span id="s777">The man who worked in the medical corps took them on a stretcher, spritzing with disinfectant, then they brought some things to dress them in, and put them back in a different one.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">When everything was ready, only two guys who had been there looked up at the</span></p> <p><span id="s779">medics...</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So really the Russian Army was very well organized in how they looked after these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Organized but mind you every battalion and every corps used to have only 25% of its people looking after our people, the wounded people.</span> <span id="s782">A lot of women were involved in the Russian Army in this kind of business and they were professional.</span> <span id="s783">I must say that.</span> <span id="s784">A nurse -- you call it a nurse, in Russia we call it sister -- was as good as a doctor in Russia.</span> <span id="s785">It was very strict how you became a nurse.</span> <span id="s786">They had good hearts.</span> <span id="s787">Apart from everything, politically speaking, what was going on in the world in those days, if it hadn’t been for those nurses [unintelligible] the Americans, not one Jew in 2, 3, or 4 weeks would have been alive.</span> <span id="s788">Believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: The Rovno Ghetto was where your family was?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: When we took Breslau, we had already gone over the German border.</span> <span id="s791">I got shot in the leg.</span> <span id="s792">A little scratch.</span> <span id="s793">But I told the medical corps I was too weak.</span> <span id="s794">I asked the major if he would give me two weeks because I wanted to see where my parents were.</span> <span id="s795">He said O.K. and gave me the papers.</span> <span id="s796">When I came to Rovno, I went to the shul on Bonotovsky.</span> <span id="s797">The street is Bonotovsky.</span> <span id="s798">I went to the biggest shul.</span> <span id="s799">I saw 10 families sleeping in there.</span> <span id="s800">Two girls, Ariva Spalberg and Sipa Spalberg, went to school with me in Rovno and they started to kiss me.</span> <span id="s801">They couldn’t believe I was still alive.</span> <span id="s802">I started for the first time to cry because these two girls had been in school with me and the first thing I asked was if they knew where my family was.</span> <span id="s803">The oldest, Sipa, told me they were in Israel and both were married.</span> <span id="s804">Ariva told me, “Don’t take it very hard.</span> <span id="s805">I know you are a very tough guy and you’ve been on the front line but your father and mother and sisters and all you family are lying with our families.</span> <span id="s806">We will take you there and show you.</span> <span id="s807">The graves are still not covered.”</span> <span id="s808">So God give us, all the Israel and the Jewish people, his own [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s809">I took a [unintelligible] [sounds like mignon] and we went there.</span> <span id="s810">It’s after the jail.</span> <span id="s811">In Rovno there’s a big jail on the main road.</span> <span id="s812">Three miles beyond the jail are some hills and on the hills the Germans separated the men and women, lined them up, took their clothes, and shot them.</span> <span id="s813">They fell in the graves and they didn’t bother to cover the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">When I came up on the hill with the mignon [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Where did you get the mignon?</span> <span id="s816">From the military?</span> <span id="s817">From the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: From the synagogue the people left.</span> <span id="s819">It was enough.</span> <span id="s820">The people came from different little towns.</span> <span id="s821">I begged them to come because it was a little far to go.</span> <span id="s822">About 12 miles.</span> <span id="s823">I took a big Russian truck, and I took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: You were how old at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: 23.</span> <span id="s826">Everything happened that year because 1945 the war ended, and in 1945 the Russians took the most cities.</span> <span id="s827">In 1944 we were still attacking but in January, February, March of 1945 I bring all the stories.</span> <span id="s828">As quick as the Germans were going to Russia, the Russians were moving quicker against the Germans.</span> <span id="s829">I was standing and looking and asking myself, what can I do?</span> <span id="s830">I said kaddish.</span> <span id="s831">I saw maybe a mile of graves with children, women, next to the men.</span> <span id="s832">Not covered.</span> <span id="s833">I saw it with my eyes.</span> <span id="s834">We were there an hour, and about half a mile away was a cottage where a goy lived.</span> <span id="s835">He saw all the people coming and he came and said to me, “Yes, I witnessed the Germans doing this.</span> <span id="s836">They took off the clothing, they took off the jewelry, everything.</span> <span id="s837">They even took the gold out of the teeth.”</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: This was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: There was starvation, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s842">It must have been there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s844">And they took all the Jewish people there from the little towns around Rovno, and they killed them all.</span> <span id="s845">Those that left with the partisans, like these ten families, and who went into the woods survived.</span> <span id="s846">But people who couldn’t help themselves...like I told you there were people who didn’t want to run.</span> <span id="s847">They were thinking, what can the Germans do to us?</span> <span id="s848">We’ve done nothing against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: They didn’t want to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: They didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s851">Some of them used to have nice homes and businesses, and families and they couldn’t believe for a moment that they had to leave everything and run.</span> <span id="s852">That killed a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: It couldn’t happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: It couldn’t happen to me.</span> <span id="s855">You’re right, madam.</span> <span id="s856">But I was a young man and I knew what was happening there.</span> <span id="s857">I knew I had to run because I would have been the first to be shot.</span> <span id="s858">I can’t still believe, where was God.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: That’s what I’m g oing to come to.</span> <span id="s860">A: Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I know exactly what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: That’s how I came now to my belief.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s864">I was young.</span> <span id="s865">I didn’t finish my schooling.</span> <span id="s866">It came to me [unintelligible] to leave my family and I led a different kind of Russian life.</span> <span id="s867">I went in the Army and fought and was in hospitals, wondering where my father and mother and sisters were.</span> <span id="s868">It happened so quickly that it was like [unintelligible] happening to me.</span> <span id="s869">A lot of people like me went through thoughts like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Where is God?</span> <span id="s871">What is your feeling about God?</span> <span id="s872">What is your belief about God?</span> <span id="s873">What is your belief about religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: What I believe about Judaism is that all Jewish people don’t need to have so many ceremonies or keep extreme kosher.</span> <span id="s875">They should all keep together [unintelligible] in one way.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Not to divide.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Not to divide among us.</span> <span id="s878">To think that because you have a yarmulke and because you go to Beth Jacob shul you are better than another one is the worst thing.</span> <span id="s879">Because after all I went through this year...I came from a city where people were poor when they went there but became millionaires.</span> <span id="s880">They have already forgotten what happened to their fathers and mothers.</span> <span id="s881">They don’t want to know about other people.</span> <span id="s882">They don’t want to know about Israel.</span> <span id="s883">They don’t want to know about their friends.</span> <span id="s884">Materialism has caused these people to become like animals after what we went through in life.</span> <span id="s885">Only I can say...I have, for example, a Chevrolet.</span> <span id="s886">In Sydney they don’t go for that car.</span> <span id="s887">One woman told me to buy a Mercedes.</span> <span id="s888">I wouldn’t buy a Mercedes because of what I went through with the Germans if the Mercedes were made of gold.</span> <span id="s889">Another woman [unintelligible] is driving a Mercedes, but they have gotten into a lot of financial difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Slaves to materialism.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: And they’re buying the Mercedes and they have big swimming pools with marble around them.</span> <span id="s892">The husband works hard.</span> <span id="s893">He borrows money, anything to make buying something the same.</span> <span id="s894">Why should it happen somebody comes in here and says I can’t pray.</span> <span id="s895">I can’t because I went through a bad life and I can’t pray.</span> <span id="s896">I don’t think there’s a [unintelligible] that I can’t pray.</span> <span id="s897">It’s my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">I’m telling you my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: That’s why I’m asking you.</span> <span id="s900">I want to hear your opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: My opinion is that the Jewish people have mostly forgot.</span> <span id="s902">Americans, Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians -- it doesn’t matter which part of the world.</span> <span id="s903">We forgot who we are.</span> <span id="s904">But life is short and life is so valued for everybody to think for one thing we are Jewish we must stick together.</span> <span id="s905">Why do I go to temple?</span> <span id="s906">Why do I go to Beth Jacob?</span> <span id="s907">I like the same [unintelligible] there.</span> <span id="s908">I like the same because I went through...I know what they went through.</span> <span id="s909">I don’t want to make different.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: The most important thing for you is unity.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: It’s unity for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s912">[Unintelligible] goes to a private school or goes to a big college.</span> <span id="s913">[Unintelligible] is finishing medical school.</span> <span id="s914">To me he’s the same human as a boy that cannot even finish college.</span> <span id="s915">Because he’s Jewish I must see this man the same as my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Apply for unity among the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: All of us forgot and it can come again.</span> <span id="s918">I’m predicting it.</span> <span id="s919">I’m predicting all the time and my wife tells me my head works all the time.</span> <span id="s920">I predicted everything exactly.</span> <span id="s921">I predicted [unintelligible] will come the biggest [unintelligible] in 18 months.</span> <span id="s922">I don’t know who would be involved.</span> <span id="s923">It can come again.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Based upon what you’ve gone through that’s...you see things in a very different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: The Jewish people are a target in one way I would like to tell you.</span> <span id="s926">In the United States, if something bad happens they target the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s927">That’s what I want them to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: The first target is the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s929">We didn’t get to the Warsaw Ghetto yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: The Warsaw Ghetto was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s931">When we took Warsaw, I had been on the front line there.</span> <span id="s932">[Unintelligible].</span> <span id="s933">Absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: No human....</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No human beings.</span> <span id="s936">Only bodies.</span> <span id="s937">They fought up until the very last second, last minute, as long as a 7-year-old boy could hold a gun.</span> <span id="s938">Some of them gave themselves up.</span> <span id="s939">But they died because the Germans shot them.</span> <span id="s940">There’s no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s941">When we went through, I saw there was nothing to see, only [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Leveled.</span> <span id="s943">Now there are garden apartments there in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Beautiful apartments.</span> <span id="s945">My friend went to visit Poland 8 years ago.</span> <span id="s946">He said I wouldn’t recognize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: It’s true.</span> <span id="s948">And the Lvov Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: There was about 800-1000 people in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: When you went into that ghetto, were there the same instructions, same medical care, same facilities...?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Same facilities.</span> <span id="s952">But there weren’t many facilities We only looked after the people for a while before the real medical corps took over.</span> <span id="s953">Because [unintelligible] like in Riga, we were stationed there only to make sure the Germans didn’t shoot again.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: For protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Then when everything settled down and we moved away, the normal people took over.</span> <span id="s956">But when I was there in Lvov many people I saw I didn’t think had much chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s957">Some of them were very, very [unintelligible], but 1% was a little bit...you could talk to them.</span> <span id="s958">They could tell you the stories, and they were kind to me because I told them I was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s959">They brought the Jews to the Warsaw Ghetto and from there they took them to another concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: A transfer point.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: The story was the women, the young girls.</span> <span id="s962">They were very badly....</span> <span id="s963">Q: In the Lvov Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s965">The Germans raped them.</span> <span id="s966">Not so much the Germans but the Poles.</span> <span id="s967">The German Volkdeutsch we called them.</span> <span id="s968">They took advantage of this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s969">In every part of Poland were the Volkdeutsch.</span> <span id="s970">Not the real Pole, but the Volkdeutsch took advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: How did they get that name Volkdeutsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Volk is the people.</span> <span id="s973">Deutsch is German.</span> <span id="s974">When they left Germany before the second world war, they emigrated to Poland on the other side, emigrated to Czechoslovakia, emigrated to Russia.</span> <span id="s975">Then the name became a word for everybody.</span> <span id="s976">They were happy to call themselves Volkdeutsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: But it describes a certain type of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: The hair.</span> <span id="s979">Blonde.</span> <span id="s980">You can see their eyes.</span> <span id="s981">Maybe 1 in a thousand had dark hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">But their eyes were mostly white.</span> <span id="s983">I saw them in the [unintelligible] in Poland.</span> <span id="s984">Q: But they always seemed to be the people that were accused of doing the worst.</span> <span id="s985">A: Yes they did.</span> <span id="s986">I’m telling you the truth.</span> <span id="s987">With the help of the Volkdeutsch the Germans had an easier job of finding the Jews, because all the people were hiding in places where the Germans wouldn’t find them for three years.</span> <span id="s988">They went to the Germans and said here they are, and they became big men.</span> <span id="s989">They gave them maybe a raincoat or money.</span> <span id="s990">They really helped to kill a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s991">The same happened in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: All Volkdeutsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: All Volkdeutsch.</span> <span id="s994">In Hungary they called them [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s995">In Poland they called them the Volkdeutsch.</span> <span id="s996">.</span> <span id="s997">They were a special people.</span> <span id="s998">They were waiting for this.</span> <span id="s999">The anti-Semitism was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: You spoke about the rape of the women in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1001">We hear many stories about the fear of the Russians when they came when they did so much raping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: That’s true but they didn’t rape a concentration camp girl.</span> <span id="s1003">When the Germans took a Jewish girl into any camp...they told me they raped my sister.</span> <span id="s1004">The ten families that were left in the shul told me the Germans...she was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1005">She was something special, and they told me they took her away in a different way.</span> <span id="s1006">They said I’m sure they raped her.</span> <span id="s1007">The same thing happened to a lot of girls even in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1008">The SS would drink and sit around at night and say why not?</span> <span id="s1009">They’re going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1010">We’ll keep them for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Use them.</span> <span id="s1013">And they did.</span> <span id="s1014">There’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s1015">One old Jewish man told me they raped all the [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s1016">In Yiddish he told me.</span> <span id="s1017">It was shocking.</span> <span id="s1018">There was shouting from the SS barracks.</span> <span id="s1019">But what can you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">You go and tell them, you get shot right away.</span> <span id="s1021">They raped them, they came out, and they went to the girls.</span> <span id="s1022">Fortunately, among these people there were the real [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: The lucky ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Because if the war had gone on another month or so and we hadn’t liberated them, I’m sure a lot would have died from starvation.</span> <span id="s1025">The Germans knew the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1026">We were coming so quickly they didn’t have time to kill them.</span> <span id="s1027">That’s why there were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s1028">We couldn’t catch the German tanks.</span> <span id="s1029">We were running after them like anything.</span> <span id="s1030">They were far away.</span> <span id="s1031">That’s why they were lucky.</span> <span id="s1032">It was like the winter in 1944 in Russia when the Germans were frozen to the ground.</span> <span id="s1033">It was lucky for us that the Germans were running too quickly.</span> <span id="s1034">That is what saved a lot of our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Tell me about Maidanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Maidanek was a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: What did you see when you came into Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: When I came into Maidanek I saw the ovens, I saw the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q No guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No guards were left.</span> <span id="s1041">Not one.</span> <span id="s1042">Everything was like...I can’s say exactly.</span> <span id="s1043">It was shocking.</span> <span id="s1044">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Not many.</span> <span id="s1047">I can’t say exactly but something like [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s1048">I didn’t count them.</span> <span id="s1049">Believe me, when you’re young and you see a thing like that and you know already what our Jewish people are going through, what good does it do to count?</span> <span id="s1050">If only to see the faces, only to see the way they’re standing.</span> <span id="s1051">You don’t see a person.</span> <span id="s1052">You see a dead person talking to you.</span> <span id="s1053">It’s enough to make you so emotional that you can’t even ask what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: The words leave you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: The words leave me.</span> <span id="s1056">Speechless.</span> <span id="s1057">I did talk to a couple in Yiddish, but it was the worst thing I ever saw.</span> <span id="s1058">The children.</span> <span id="s1059">Some bodies.</span> <span id="s1060">Not even burned yet.</span> <span id="s1061">Just bodies lying around in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1062">The bodies were lying on the bunks.</span> <span id="s1063">I saw it.</span> <span id="s1064">We went out quickly because of the smell.</span> <span id="s1065">The medical corps told us to quickly leave because they didn’t want us to get sick.</span> <span id="s1066">It was a very dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s1067">But for me, the Jewish people in the military, it was very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Did you talk to each other about it in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1070">We came to a conclusion when we went over the German border...like I told you what my Jewish friend, the captain, did.</span> <span id="s1071">He cut the pieces.</span> <span id="s1072">He was in a big hurry to get to the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: He couldn’t wait to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: He couldn’t wait a minute to get over the border.</span> <span id="s1075">When we went over the border, there was a big fight with a German SS division.</span> <span id="s1076">They sent their best division against us.</span> <span id="s1077">When we went into the German cities, we made a mess out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: What did you do when you got in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: The first thing I did was like my friends did.</span> <span id="s1080">We shot German men and women without any orders.</span> <span id="s1081">The order came from the commander “we don’t care what you do as long as you eliminate the Germans.”</span> <span id="s1082">The Germans were suffering like the Jews.</span> <span id="s1083">They were killing the Germans like the Russians did the Jews.</span> <span id="s1084">I was a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1085">I fought for my Jewish friends, but the Russian soldier was fighting for the...they burned their country.</span> <span id="s1086">They killed the German people and they made a mess.</span> <span id="s1087">If the Americans had done the same thing with us, it would have been a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did you talk to any Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s1090">They would say “I saved the Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s1091">They didn’t say things like “I saw the Germans take people away from the camp.</span> <span id="s1092">I saw the German SS take them away.”</span> <span id="s1093">No one told me that.</span> <span id="s1094">What they said was “Oh, I loved the Jews.</span> <span id="s1095">I saved them.</span> <span id="s1096">I took them in.</span> <span id="s1097">I gave them food.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So you talked to them.</span> <span id="s1099">What did you do with all this hate and passion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: What can I do?</span> <span id="s1101">I said, “You are a German.</span> <span id="s1102">You are responsible for our people.”</span> <span id="s1103">We [unintelligible] a lot of homes.</span> <span id="s1104">We took a lot of goods.</span> <span id="s1105">Because we were stationed there we took a lot of flats.</span> <span id="s1106">That was the job of the officers of the Army.</span> <span id="s1107">They threw a German out of his house, took what they could, and in 10 minutes they were done.</span> <span id="s1108">We did a lot of bad things, but there came a time to settle down and we couldn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s1109">[Unintelligible] what is enough is enough.</span> <span id="s1110">To rape or to kill them was like I am talking to you.</span> <span id="s1111">You could have done it if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1112">There would be no charges against you.</span> <span id="s1113">A general wouldn’t come and say why did you kill the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Would a Jewish soldier rape a German girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s1116">A lot.</span> <span id="s1117">Not one, not ten, a lot.</span> <span id="s1118">When we took Berlin, the word came down from Stalin that for 24 hours you could do whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s1119">You could rape.</span> <span id="s1120">You could kill.</span> <span id="s1121">You could steal.</span> <span id="s1122">You could do what you wanted in 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1123">You could take all the [unintelligible] into Russia, all the goods, all the shops.</span> <span id="s1124">Can you image the Russians?</span> <span id="s1125">They put watches on.</span> <span id="s1126">They went into the shops....</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: From the fingers up to the shoulders they put watches on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: They were very primitive.5 In those days 50% of the Russians who came from big cities acted badly, but the ones from the little towns were very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Would you say that those soldiers from the towns and the villages reacted differently from the soldiers that were from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: From the towns they were much worse.</span> <span id="s1131">The more primitive they were the more Germans they killed.</span> <span id="s1132">I saw it on the front line.</span> <span id="s1133">There was a primitive guy who had no schooling.</span> <span id="s1134">He went to the front line with his rifle and said, “I will take all of them.”</span> <span id="s1135">But the ones who weren’t primitive put more thought into their actions -- how can I do it, should I risk my life, do I want to risk my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: To figure it out first.</span> <span id="s1137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: When you went into the labor camp near Lodz, anything in particular you remember from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: There was a little town, a small village.</span> <span id="s1140">They kept them there.</span> <span id="s1141">Maybe 350 or 400 people.</span> <span id="s1142">They looked exactly like they did in other ghettoes.</span> <span id="s1143">They had been worked.</span> <span id="s1144">They worked in a camp.</span> <span id="s1145">They took them [unintelligible] they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: A factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Factory work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: What kind of a factory?</span> <span id="s1149">Glass factory.</span> <span id="s1150">Cement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">5Mr.</span> <span id="s1152">Bundansky uses the word “primitive” several times in this interview.</span> <span id="s1153">He is referring to the Russian soldiers from the small villages who were not well-educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Cement factory.</span> <span id="s1155">One man was sitting with me and I gave him a drink of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">I asked him what kind of work he did.</span> <span id="s1157">He said they took us in trucks and we mixed cement and we made cement.</span> <span id="s1158">But he said we did it to survive.</span> <span id="s1159">I asked what they gave them to eat.</span> <span id="s1160">He said nothing.</span> <span id="s1161">With a little water and [unintelligible] they made soup, and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1162">Tough.</span> <span id="s1163">The German bread.</span> <span id="s1164">He said thank God I could eat it because if I couldn’t have eaten it I wouldn’t have survived.</span> <span id="s1165">That was the truth.</span> <span id="s1166">To the people who survived in these little ghettoes came a power -- they dared to do things with the Germans standing in front of them all the time with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1167">A lot of them survived very well.</span> <span id="s1168">I would say about 25% of the people I saw that I remember weren’t in good condition, but you could talk to them.</span> <span id="s1169">They were tired...</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: But better than the camps.</span> <span id="s1171">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: In the Russian military, was there any opportunity to talk about what you had seen in the various camps with the higher officers?</span> <span id="s1173">Did you ever get together and really talk about what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: We didn’t get together like in a convention, but when we were having breakfast around the tank, we talked to the goyen -- not the Jewish men -- and they had the same opinion.</span> <span id="s1175">“Bandits!</span> <span id="s1176">Murderers!</span> <span id="s1177">We didn’t do enough to the city [unintelligible].”</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: After they had seen the ghettoes they talked about it and had the same reaction?</span> <span id="s1179">A: The same reaction as us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: This were non-Jews and they knew the ones in the ghetto were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1182">They didn’t call them Jews.</span> <span id="s1183">They called them Hebrews.</span> <span id="s1184">In Poland they called them Jit6.</span> <span id="s1185">In Russia you were not allowed at that time to called them</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">6Phonetic spelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Jit.</span> <span id="s1188">You had to say Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1189">The first time you said Jit, you got a month in jail, if there were witnesses.</span> <span id="s1190">The third time the same person called you Jit you got six months or a year.</span> <span id="s1191">That was when I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: The person that called you was the one that got 6 months or a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1194">If you called me a “Jit,” with two witnesses there are no accusations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Straight away.</span> <span id="s1196">Especially in the military.</span> <span id="s1197">If someone were to call me a “Jit” he wouldn’t have a chance, even if he were a general or anybody.</span> <span id="s1198">I could take out my pistol, put it in his mouth, and shoot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Nobody would accuse you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Nobody would accuse me of anything.</span> <span id="s1201">He was a traitor, I would say.</span> <span id="s1202">He signed the paper.</span> <span id="s1203">Two of my friends were witnesses and nobody could do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: That’s changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Changed a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So you really had a lot of chance to talk about what you had seen in the various ghettoes.</span> <span id="s1207">Was that helpful that you were able to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: It was very helpful for the people I talked to.</span> <span id="s1209">They saw us and they thought that God had come.</span> <span id="s1210">[Unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1212">In terms of being helpful when you talked about it with each other in the military, one soldier to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Very helpful.</span> <span id="s1214">It was shocking.</span> <span id="s1215">They wondered how a human being could do that to another human being.</span> <span id="s1216">They became very emotional when they saw the dead children.</span> <span id="s1217">It doesn’t matter if it was a goy.</span> <span id="s1218">If they saw the children dying or dead he became more aggressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: You were a soldier.</span> <span id="s1220">You saw a lot of death in the military.</span> <span id="s1221">Forget about the camp situation which I know is very special.</span> <span id="s1222">What was the difference between the death that you saw in the military and the death and starvation that you saw in a ghetto or a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: In the military you’re fighting for a cause.</span> <span id="s1224">We were fighting against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1225">If you survive, you’re O.K. I fight.</span> <span id="s1226">I’m not in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: I’m talking about your fellow Russians that were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: They were very emotional when a Russian fellow was killed.</span> <span id="s1229">Q: Was the emotion different between...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: No.</span> <span id="s1231">The same.</span> <span id="s1232">For them it was all human beings.</span> <span id="s1233">They didn’t say that it was special in the Jewish camps, because a lot of Russians were in the camps.</span> <span id="s1234">You understand me?</span> <span id="s1235">Not in every camp, but there were Russians, goyen, in some of the camps because they didn’t cooperate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1236">That’s why the Russians took it very seriously.</span> <span id="s1237">They took it the same way emotionally.</span> <span id="s1238">When they would go into another town they would try their best to take advantage of them.</span> <span id="s1239">And they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Was the Russian soldier who was of a lower rank have the same reaction as the soldier of a higher rank?</span> <span id="s1241">The medical corps or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No.</span> <span id="s1243">The primitive ones went after the regular soldiers, the German Army.</span> <span id="s1244">When the primitive ones saw the camp, they looked around and said “How horrible.</span> <span id="s1245">Too bad.:” Then after half an hour they forgot.</span> <span id="s1246">But the more intelligent man, the one who knew more about what was going on, reacted differently altogether.</span> <span id="s1247">The reaction was more than the man....</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">[End of tape.</span> <span id="s1249">Conversation resumes on new tape as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: The story is nothing.</span> <span id="s1251">My story is that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1252">Q: That's the story unto itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Not to be in a concentration camp, and to survive what I went through in the operations in the front line.</span> <span id="s1254">And to see the open graves of my people lying between the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1255">And not to know where they were.</span> <span id="s1256">The life was to me sometimes what I am, what I’m doing

light on the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s1268">Lights weren’t allowed in the night.</span> <span id="s1269">It was still wartime blackout.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">We went up to the fifth floor, and a man with white hair, in his 50’s, opened the door.</span> <span id="s1271">And I said, “Can you show me your papers?”</span> <span id="s1272">I saw a lot of cute girls and boys in green uniforms of the chalutz.</span> <span id="s1273">I already knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1274">And he said no, they’re from the concentration camp and he wanted to bring them to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1275">I said yes and my heart goes like that and next to me was a goy, an officer.</span> <span id="s1276">I said to him, “Sergeant, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s1277">Go downstairs and look out the door and see if something is happening there.”</span> <span id="s1278">I did that to get rid of him so I could talk to the man.</span> <span id="s1279">And when I got rid of him, the man took me in the middle and started to explain things to me.</span> <span id="s1280">He spoke not perfect Russian but good Russian.</span> <span id="s1281">He was a Czech himself.</span> <span id="s1282">I said to him in Russian, “I want to tell you and don't get shocked.</span> <span id="s1283">I am a Yid.”</span> <span id="s1284">He looked at me like that.</span> <span id="s1285">I didn't look Jewish when I was in uniform.</span> <span id="s1286">“You are kidding,” he said.</span> <span id="s1287">He talked to everybody and they came around me.</span> <span id="s1288">I said, “I haven't got much time because I got rid of this fellow, but he will come up and I must make a report.”</span> <span id="s1289">He gave me all the details and he said, “Please, if you have another Yiddish boy, come to me.</span> <span id="s1290">I am living at this address with my wife and children.</span> <span id="s1291">Come on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s1292">He was from the Haganah.7 They already worked the Haganah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: This was in Berlin in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: End of 1945.</span> <span id="s1295">I said O.K. and he gave me the address.</span> <span id="s1296">The Russians liked to steal things.</span> <span id="s1297">I was no better than the Russians.</span> <span id="s1298">I was young.</span> <span id="s1299">On the street was a Czechoslovakian car, and we took it and went to this address.</span> <span id="s1300">It was a Friday night.</span> <span id="s1301">I took another two Jewish boys with me.</span> <span id="s1302">There was knadel8soup, there was liver.</span> <span id="s1303">Liver and tzibele9.</span> <span id="s1304">We spoke in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1305">It was a machiyah.10 I said, “What you doing with these kids?</span> <span id="s1306">Where are they from?”</span> <span id="s1307">They said, “They are from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from the national army.</span> <span id="s1308">They defected.</span> <span id="s1309">We are taking them on Aliyah Bet.”</span> <span id="s1310">11 I had not heard of Aliyah Bet yet.</span> <span id="s1311">I said, “It’s okay, but how are you taking them out?”</span> <span id="s1312">He said, “Don't worry, everything is arranged.</span> <span id="s1313">We can't sit too long, or they will know where we are.”</span> <span id="s1314">I said, “You must go, and we will meet again.</span> <span id="s1315">He said, “Please, if you decide sometimes to go to Israel I can fix it for you.”</span> <span id="s1316">I said, “We are in Berlin and we can go anywhere we like.</span> <span id="s1317">We don't need to run away.”</span> <span id="s1318">He said, “But I can help you go to a place where it is nice and there the Jewish Haganah will take care of you.”</span> <span id="s1319">About three weeks later we left the Russians in Berlin and we went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1320">We saw a lot of Yiddish people coming in from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, and they got beautiful apartments.</span> <span id="s1321">The American Joint 12 (JDC) 7The mainstream Jewish underground in

id="s1324">And I saw the [unintelligible] and dollars and gold and people making money.</span> <span id="s1325">I was a little bit anxious to see what we could do, so I said to my friend, let's do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Then I started selling chocolate, sugar, and Gillettes which was a very hard thing to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Shaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: We made a little bit of money, but the Haganah was there asking when we wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1329">And I remember my father liked Jabotinsky.</span> <span id="s1330">13 I thought there must be some Jabotinsky organization.</span> <span id="s1331">I said I would like to meet these people sometimes.</span> <span id="s1332">They asked, “What are you ?</span> <span id="s1333">A [unintelligible]?”</span> <span id="s1334">I said, “I don't know what I am, but I would like to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1335">They are Jewish people too.”</span> <span id="s1336">They gave me the address and I went to them.</span> <span id="s1337">They took us with both hands, and we joined them.</span> <span id="s1338">We joined the Irgun Zve Leumi to have a lot of big jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: The Irgun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: The Irgun put a lot of bombs to put the English against the English.</span> <span id="s1341">Because the English and the people who they took to Cyprus, they sent them back all the time.</span> <span id="s1342">And we gave them hell and a lot of trouble, to give them back all the things that they are doing to our people.</span> <span id="s1343">And then came....</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: You were operating out of Austria then with the Irgun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1346">Austria.</span> <span id="s1347">The main office was in Paris.</span> <span id="s1348">We were operating from Austria, from a camp that all the Jewish people were in which was under the Americans.</span> <span id="s1349">It was a secret organization.</span> <span id="s1350">The Irgun helped a lot, and then they wanted us to take everyone to Israel, but when time goes on and you get older...and then a lot 13Vladimir Jabotinsky was the leader of the Revisionists division within the overall Zionist movement in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s1351">He called for the prompt establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine and proposed to Britain a plan for evacuating the masses of Polish Jewry to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">of people came from Hungary and from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1353">Then came my wife, a girl.</span> <span id="s1354">I saw them coming in with nothing, with tzerisen slacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Torn slacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Torn slacks and not [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s1357">And they had escaped Communism from Budapest through water and their feet got swollen.</span> <span id="s1358">I asked the man in charge in Vienna, Richel, where this girl was, what hospital she was in.</span> <span id="s1359">I went and saw the girls and I brought them bananas and oranges.</span> <span id="s1360">She couldn't speak Yiddish at all.</span> <span id="s1361">A lot of people from Hungary didn't speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1362">And then I took them to Linz, to a better Jewish camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: The Joint Distribution camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yes, a Joint camp.</span> <span id="s1365">Mr. Friendland in Linz was in charge of the Joint Distribution camp, and I told him they were from Hungary and I wanted him to give them good clothes.</span> <span id="s1366">I wanted him to look after them because I liked this girl, and he laughed at me and he said he would look after them.</span> <span id="s1367">Then a year passed.</span> <span id="s1368">I tried my best, but she said I wasn’t serious, and all the Hungarian people said, “Oh, Polish-Russian.”</span> <span id="s1369">I had already tried [unintelligible] and I had made some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: You were about how old at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I was already 25 or 26 years old, and I looked good.</span> <span id="s1372">I looked established a little bit.</span> <span id="s1373">And I fell in love and I married her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: In Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: My daughter was born in Linz.</span> <span id="s1376">And while we were in Linz, my wife got letters from Hungarian immigrants in Australia who had gone there a year before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">They wrote good letters that Australia was very good.</span> <span id="s1378">She said she wanted to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1379">I said it didn't matter to me.</span> <span id="s1380">I had lost everybody.</span> <span id="s1381">What's the difference to me?</span> <span id="s1382">So we went to Australia.</span> <span id="s1383">It was very tough the first three years.</span> <span id="s1384">There was a depression and no work, and as I said to you before, I didn't learn anything, any profession, because I was very young, and I didn't have the time to...I am not saying I am the smartest man in the world.</span> <span id="s1385">I am the same Jew, the same like everybody, but I came to Australia and I went to work, but it wasn’t enough to keep my wife and child.</span> <span id="s1386">I went and found a little shop.</span> <span id="s1387">I had a dry cleaning shop in combination with a laundry.</span> <span id="s1388">It didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1389">It was too hard for my wife.</span> <span id="s1390">So I noticed there was a very big demand for coffee lounges, and I opened a store with coffee and lunch, and we were very successful.</span> <span id="s1391">It was a beautiful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: It was a restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: It was like a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1394">You didn’t have to eat.</span> <span id="s1395">You could just go in and have a cappuccino, a nice continental cake.</span> <span id="s1396">My coffee lounge had tables with umbrellas.</span> <span id="s1397">You didn’t need to sit in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1398">A girl would come out and take your order.</span> <span id="s1399">And it was in a very good location, near big offices and big companies, and they always came to us.</span> <span id="s1400">22 years I have been in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: That was an established business.</span> <span id="s1402">So you really moved yourself along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: And I’ve traveled for the last ten years to see my daughter.</span> <span id="s1404">And when I traveled to see her in the United States, I always took a ticket to Israel.</span> <span id="s1405">I could not miss Israel.</span> <span id="s1406">And Europe.</span> <span id="s1407">Hong Kong is my love.</span> <span id="s1408">First is Israel, but Hong Kong...why?</span> <span id="s1409">Because I like to buy things.</span> <span id="s1410">I like to make my ticket.</span> <span id="s1411">And if you want to make your ticket, you must stay over in Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1412">That you can do to...minimum to make your ticket, what you spend on your ticket.</span> <span id="s1413">Because in Hong Kong there are a lot of things you can do.</span> <span id="s1414">Everything is free duty.</span> <span id="s1415">You can bring out half of Hong Kong and nobody will arrest you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Nobody will ask questions, so that becomes an area that you really enjoyed being in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: I like Israel very much.</span> <span id="s1418">If my daughter had married in Israel, I would be very successful in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: I was going to ask you, you sound like the type of person that would really love....</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: I love it.</span> <span id="s1421">I’ve sent her to Israel three times.</span> <span id="s1422">My wife’s had a sister in Israel for 32 years.</span> <span id="s1423">They built a kibbutz there in Israel.</span> <span id="s1424">I went in 1962 for the first time for myself.</span> <span id="s1425">The second time I took my wife, but she didn’t like it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Then I took her a third time and she started to fall in love with Israel.</span> <span id="s1427">Then my daughter finished college.</span> <span id="s1428">I don't know how it is in America, but in Australia when the kids are finished in school or their education is finished, they go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1429">They don’t want a car.</span> <span id="s1430">They want their parents to send them to Israel if they can afford it.</span> <span id="s1431">So I sent my daughter to Israel.</span> <span id="s1432">When she went the last time, she first went to see my mother-in-law in Budapest, and my sister and my wife's sister in Sofia, Bulgaria, and then she went to Israel, to Haifa.</span> <span id="s1433">A lot of American kids came, and she meet this boy, Jay Levine, from Long Island.</span> <span id="s1434">They fell in love.</span> <span id="s1435">I will make this very short.</span> <span id="s1436">I went to New York with my wife.</span> <span id="s1437">I gave over the business to my friends, and made the wedding in Long Island, and kinaynhorra14 I got a wonderful son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1438">He’s a very gorgeous boy and a very knowledgeable boy, and that's what keeps him...he likes everything that he is doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: A learning type of boy.</span> <span id="s1440">That's quite a life cycle.</span> <span id="s1441">Now you are in Atlanta and it’s going to take a while for you to adjust.</span> <span id="s1442">I am sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: That’s some big difference.</span> <span id="s1444">If you went to Sydney today...I’m not saying it's a big city but it's a good community, and when you are in Sydney and you belong to a community, you don't need to be free.</span> <span id="s1445">You can be free and go to a</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">14Knock on wood club and it's open, like in Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s1447">You belong to our club like I belong to our club.</span> <span id="s1448">My name is Zew Budansky.</span> <span id="s1449">I gave you the right name and you go to the 15th floor.</span> <span id="s1450">If you want to play ping pong, you play ping pong.</span> <span id="s1451">You want to swim, you can swim, all on the l5th floor.</span> <span id="s1452">If you want a sun bath....</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: A Jewish club?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: A Jewish club.</span> <span id="s1455">You want to play the poker machine, you want to play blackjack, or you want to see a show in the restaurant, you sit in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1456">You can see Sammy Davis Jr. from America.</span> <span id="s1457">All these big guys.</span> <span id="s1458">Frank Sinatra.</span> <span id="s1459">And if you want to go to a kosher restaurant, you go to the 16th floor, you got a kosher restaurant, something which is out of something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: How large a Jewish population is there in Sydney?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: In Sydney, about 60,000.</span> <span id="s1462">Melbourne is bigger.</span> <span id="s1463">There is Polish/Jewish in Melbourne.</span> <span id="s1464">In Sydney there are more Hungarians and Czechoslovakian/Germans.</span> <span id="s1465">There are a lot of Polish people, but only because they are making a good living.</span> <span id="s1466">And most of the Jewish population of Australia is very well off.</span> <span id="s1467">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1468">You don't need to read well, you don’t need to [unintelligible] well, you don’t need to...when you came to Australia, anything you touched...if you don't even know how to sign your name and there are people today who can’t even sign their names, they are millionaires.</span> <span id="s1469">Anything they touched, they made a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: At the time that they came?</span> <span id="s1471">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: But today, that's not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Yes, but today it’s still easier than it is here because thousands of Americans are settling down there.</span> <span id="s1474">All the Americans there are very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1475">For instance, the medical care is free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Socialized medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: It's not socialized.</span> <span id="s1478">If you are working, they take out about $2 or $3 per week from your wages.</span> <span id="s1479">You go to the doctor and you pay $20 or $30 or $50.</span> <span id="s1480">You then go across the road to the government office.</span> <span id="s1481">You give them the receipt, and they give you the money back.</span> <span id="s1482">You go into the hospital to have a baby, and it costs $2,000 or $3,000.</span> <span id="s1483">You pay and you go over and they pay the money back.</span> <span id="s1484">And if anything happens, everything is paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Less expensive to live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Less expensive.</span> <span id="s1487">You pay a minimum of about $60 or $70 per month here for your utilities, for gas and electricity.</span> <span id="s1488">In Sydney, I used to have a beautiful condominium with a balcony all around facing the beach, about 50-60 feet long.</span> <span id="s1489">Everything there is paid quarterly, and $44 is the most I have paid for electricity in any quarter, any three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Your wages are according to that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Bigger, yes, much bigger.</span> <span id="s1492">But even people from Greece, who can't speak English, come and they earn right away more than $6 per hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: I didn't realize there was such a difference.</span> <span id="s1494">I am going to get back into some of the questions that we have here.</span> <span id="s1495">You belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: My son-in-law and daughter told me to come to Atlanta, because it is warmer than the north, and in Australia there is no winter, no snow.</span> <span id="s1497">They are now in Louisville, Kentucky and he wants to try to go to Emory University, and he wants to settle here.</span> <span id="s1498">He said it would be better here because Louisville has no Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1499">There is a Jewish community, but they haven’t got a [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s1500">They don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1501">He said I know you are not religious, but you know you like Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1502">So I said yes and we came to Atlanta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: But you don't belong to any....</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: I would like to belong, but I can't take my responsibility and not that I am against freedom, because in America there is some mishagas 15 [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">I would like to go to a conservative synagogue like I did in Sydney.</span> <span id="s1506">That's what I like.</span> <span id="s1507">Do you belong to a synagogue?</span> <span id="s1508">Beth Jacob?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1510">I belong to the AA on the other side of town, the Ahavath Achim.</span> <span id="s1511">That's conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: That's what I like.</span> <span id="s1513">I think I saw it.</span> <span id="s1514">It's a big one.</span> <span id="s1515">Q: Very big.</span> <span id="s1516">It’s on Peachtree Battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: I think the agent who took me to look for some houses stopped and showed me that synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: That may be.</span> <span id="s1519">It’s a very nice building too.</span> <span id="s1520">It really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: I'd like to buy a house, but it's so much interest, it is impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Now it's almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1523">I have covered so much more than I ever intended to, and I probably tired you out in the process.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: I would remember.</span> <span id="s1525">I remembered yesterday.</span> <span id="s1526">My wife told me I had an appointment and believe me, I forget everything and I wanted to make myself a note yesterday.</span> <span id="s1527">It was about 11:00 at night and I thought I don’t need notes.</span> <span id="s1528">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Once you get started....</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: If you asked me again, I will go with the same thing and tell you exactly the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Once you get started, it is very easy to....</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Once you get started...because believe me I can tell you stories.</span> <span id="s1533">That’s why I said our Jewish people have forgotten what has happened to our Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">15Craziness</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: It's not so much forgetting, but that the majority doesn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1536">They don't even know enough to forget.</span> <span id="s1537">It is hard for young people to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: The young generation should know.</span> <span id="s1539">The history of what our people went through in the ghettos and in the concentration camps should be taught in school a minimum of one hour a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: We are doing a good bit of that where we are teaching in the schools, through the Anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s1541">Various members of the community are going out into the schools.</span> <span id="s1542">We have programs in some of the high schools, and some of the members of the Jewish community volunteer to come and speak to some of the high school classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: That’s a very good thing.</span> <span id="s1544">A school teacher has already asked me to go.</span> <span id="s1545">Q: Yes, you really should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: But I am going away to Louisville to see my daughter for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1547">I promised that I will come and talk to the kids when I come back.</span> <span id="s1548">I love to and when I see kids, more and more will come to me to explain to them exactly....</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: And you explain to them the way that children can understand.</span> <span id="s1550">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: But you come from a very unusual point of view, from the Russian side, and we just don't have those stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1553">Because the Russians that are coming here now are so [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Maybe 1/2 % of them was in the army, because all of them ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: That's why your experience....</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: I must ask you, what do you personally think of the Russians who are coming now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: I think I'd like to put that question back to you.</span> <span id="s1558">What do you think about the Russians that are coming now out of Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: I’ve been involved in Australia.</span> <span id="s1560">We gave money to help them, because the community gave to the Joint [Distribution Committee].</span> <span id="s1561">We helped them a lot, and I went to a meeting and they asked a lot of people in the community of Sydney why they didn't go into the Jewish community and become more involved with them?</span> <span id="s1562">Because the Jewish people that went down in Sydney, if they have kids, they want to give them help to go to school, not to be a rabbi, but to know about Jewishness .</span> <span id="s1563">They go one week, two weeks, then they are taken out and sent to public school.</span> <span id="s1564">Then comes Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">You don't need to go every Shabbos, we told them, to be religious, but if you go once a month, you feel you have your seat.</span> <span id="s1566">You don’t need to pay money and you know if you came from Russia, the rabbi will give you always a seat.</span> <span id="s1567">We sent letters to them and came Yom Kippur in Russia...maybe between 600 and 700 people...and I am very disappointed in them.</span> <span id="s1568">In a way, they are getting too much.</span> <span id="s1569">First of all, I am against the whole Joint [unintelligible] Australia.</span> <span id="s1570">All these people are sitting in Vienna and in Italy.</span> <span id="s1571">They are kept there eight months in hotels, given this big money and it is spoiling them.</span> <span id="s1572">And then they get a visa in Moscow, written very clearly, very plainly...it is a visa for Israel.</span> <span id="s1573">In Israel, they were happy the first year when the Congress in America approved to take out Jewish people that they must go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1574">Let Israel handle them if they want to leave Israel.</span> <span id="s1575">Why [unintelligible] people get involved.</span> <span id="s1576">It's a stopover in Italy.</span> <span id="s1577">Fine.</span> <span id="s1578">Keep them one week, then let them go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1579">Then if they want to go somewhere else, fair enough.</span> <span id="s1580">Let Israel handle that.</span> <span id="s1581">Don’t keep them eight months or one year in Italy on the shoulder of people.</span> <span id="s1582">This money can go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1583">They are laughing at us.</span> <span id="s1584">I went to Italy 2 1/2 years ago.</span> <span id="s1585">I went to Milan with another man to buy some gold.</span> <span id="s1586">And he knows I understand.</span> <span id="s1587">He took me and bought me the ticket.</span> <span id="s1588">And we went to Italy, and we went in where they are living.</span> <span id="s1589">They are living in beautiful hotels, paid for by the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1590">16</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: The HIAS organization is paying...</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1593">It still gives them money, pocket money, and then they change their minds [about going to Israel].</span> <span id="s1594">They find out, directly or not directly, that they have some brothers and sisters in America or Australia and they want to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Maybe some are lying -- I don’t want to say.</span> <span id="s1596">Not just me, but 90% of the Jewish community in Australia became very annoyed with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: You think they shouldn't have a choice to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1598">The choice should be Israel, and then if they want to migrate from Israel, they can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Fair enough.</span> <span id="s1600">Israel shouldn't keep them.</span> <span id="s1601">If they want to leave Israel and go to the U.S. or Australia to Canada or to New Zealand, I would say, Israel’s a free country.</span> <span id="s1602">But Israel should handle this.</span> <span id="s1603">Israel should direct all this business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: And there is a good possibility that many of them would remain in Israel, too, and Israel really needs them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1606">Israel needs them, and why should they come in here, begging and crying?</span> <span id="s1607">Madam, I saw a Russian immigrant in Sydney who had more diamonds in his pocket than I have ever seen in my life.</span> <span id="s1608">And he went to the Jewish Welfare to ask for money to buy a condominium.</span> <span id="s1609">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1610">He got it.</span> <span id="s1611">I asked myself a question.</span> <span id="s1612">Why don’t they check?</span> <span id="s1613">Why can’t they see they are making a mistake?</span> <span id="s1614">It's not the right thing.</span> <span id="s1615">Some of them come poor.</span> <span id="s1616">I agree with them, but you can't...like here, you have Social Security.</span> <span id="s1617">Some of them are entitled to it and some of them are not entitled.</span> <span id="s1618">They should do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1619">Some of them come in with a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1620">17</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Out of Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">16Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society 17Mr.</span> <span id="s1623">Budansky is saying some of the Russian immigrants are indeed poor and deserving of welfare.</span> <span id="s1624">Others are wealthy but receive the same welfare monies because the welfare agency doesn’t check up on them.</span> <span id="s1625">He draws a parallel with the Social Security program in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Out of Russia.</span> <span id="s1627">I know one who lives in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1628">He has got a [unintelligible] factory.</span> <span id="s1629">He's a millionaire.</span> <span id="s1630">He took out a fortune.</span> <span id="s1631">But he bribed the secret police to do it.</span> <span id="s1632">Again, I am coming to the same point.</span> <span id="s1633">It is not right to keep them in Italy or Vienna and spoil them.</span> <span id="s1634">If they want a visa to Israel, they should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1635">Fair enough.</span> <span id="s1636">The American Jewish community would like to know more Jewish people, immigrants.</span> <span id="s1637">We are very happy they are arriving.</span> <span id="s1638">We will welcome them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: They come from a form of government where they are taken care of there.</span> <span id="s1640">The government does everything for them.</span> <span id="s1641">Now to come to the U.S. -- we are talking about the Russian Jews -- and they have to start to do things for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: They didn't have anything there, the government didn't care for them.</span> <span id="s1643">They are used to stealing.</span> <span id="s1644">Nobody can survive in Russia on the wages they get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: They do a lot of stealing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: A lot of stealing where they used to work.</span> <span id="s1647">Some of them can tell their meisele 18 to an American Jew, but they can't tell me.</span> <span id="s1648">They can't tell me stories.</span> <span id="s1649">I remember and today is much worse than...they must stay in the morning until 10 o'clock to get a kilo of meat and when the door is closed, they can't even get the the kilo of meat or a good loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1650">They can’t tell me stories.</span> <span id="s1651">They made money.</span> <span id="s1652">They lived in beautiful apartments in Odessa.</span> <span id="s1653">They lived in a condominium, somewhere on the Black Sea, nicer than maybe where you live in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1654">Maybe smaller, but they lived very good.</span> <span id="s1655">They went out, they enjoyed themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: You don't mix with many of the Russians here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Yes, I mix with a couple of families.</span> <span id="s1658">Yes.</span> <span id="s1659">Very honest one from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1660">The</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">18Stories Melitzeir family.</span> <span id="s1662">He came poor.</span> <span id="s1663">He is a poor man.</span> <span id="s1664">The American Jewish Committee helped him a lot and they got jobs.</span> <span id="s1665">He is on a pension, but his wife still works, his son-in-law works, and they are very happy.</span> <span id="s1666">They have free dental care, free medical care.</span> <span id="s1667">They [unintelligible], but the point is his son would love to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1668">He said that if his mother and father won't come here, he would love to be there.</span> <span id="s1669">What I am trying to tell you....</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s1671">It's a very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s1672">A: A lot of children are going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: The only solution is that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: I’m not saying people must.</span> <span id="s1675">I am against that.</span> <span id="s1676">But again, we need, we want to save the Jewish people in Russia, and that was a good idea.</span> <span id="s1677">But the Russians were very clever to give them a visa to Israel, not a visa to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: There was a reason for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1680">That's why they should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1681">And they were very happy when they got a visa to Israel.</span> <span id="s1682">Now they want to go America.</span> <span id="s1683">Here they can pick up money on the street, but every immigrant has it very good in Australia.</span> <span id="s1684">The plane arrives from Italy on Wednesday.</span> <span id="s1685">Their Russian friends come to pick them up.</span> <span id="s1686">By Thursday night, I assure you Madam, they have already bought a car.</span> <span id="s1687">Where did the money come from?</span> <span id="s1688">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1689">But if you ask my wife, she will say good luck to them, I am very happy.</span> <span id="s1690">The thing is that we are bringing people in here, but maybe the Jewish state needs some of them.</span> <span id="s1691">They could stay there.</span> <span id="s1692">I am talking about young people.</span> <span id="s1693">I am not talking about the middle aged or the elderly or those who want to help themselves to a better life in the U.S. and Australia.</span> <span id="s1694">They went through maybe a hard time in Russia.</span> <span id="s1695">[Unintelligible] to die because of Israel.</span> <span id="s1696">Why start the trouble in the Jewish community because they want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1697">They took away the jobs, they don't let them go to synagogue, they don't let them go to meetings and people together, but that was before.</span> <span id="s1698">But it was all the people -- doctors, architects, managers, directors.</span> <span id="s1699">The Russian people didn’t differentiate between being Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1700">It didn’t say on your passport that you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1701">But the situation today has come within the last ten years, because of Israel, because of the Arab conflict.</span> <span id="s1702">But again, I am looking from my Jewish point of view.</span> <span id="s1703">If my daughter hadn’t married an American, I would be there tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1704">I don't care how hot it is.</span> <span id="s1705">I would be there tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: I would be in Israel.</span> <span id="s1708">I have nothing to do in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1709">Beth Jacob is a very nice community.</span> <span id="s1710">I’ve been invited to maybe 20 different homes....</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: We not talking about the Israelis at all.</span> <span id="s1713">Q: That's where your heart is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: My heart.</span> <span id="s1715">I don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s1716">Sometime they talk about how tomorrow we must do that in shul, we’re going to Miami, we’re going to a convention.</span> <span id="s1717">But I’ve never heard them say we’re going next year together to Israel and what are we doing about Israel, what is the situation in Israel.</span> <span id="s1718">They never bring up the subject.</span> <span id="s1719">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: There's an awful lot being done here, certainly for Israel.</span> <span id="s1721">A: Oh yes, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: But in terms of the Russian family and their discussion about going to Israel, is there a fear because of the persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: No.</span> <span id="s1724">Because of the Army.</span> <span id="s1725">The y don’t like that.</span> <span id="s1726">I’ll tell you the reason.</span> <span id="s1727">I’ve talked to a lot of them, and they say they have children and they don't want the Jewish Army to take their kids away to the front line.</span> <span id="s1728">I said if the Russians took you, you would be a Russian and you couldn't say to the Russians my child can't go to the Army.</span> <span id="s1729">They would be sent to Siberia for 20 years.</span> <span id="s1730">But because you are Jewish and you know that we are in a bad situation in Israel, and if your son goes to the Army, your son goes to a Jewish Army.</span> <span id="s1731">Now, I understand the mother.</span> <span id="s1732">She doesn't want her son to go in the Army, but again I am trying to make a point with her.</span> <span id="s1733">If she were still in Russia and they were attacking Afghanistan, and her son became a Russian soldier, could you tell the Russians your son doesn't want to go to the Army?</span> <span id="s1734">She said no.</span> <span id="s1735">I said why can’t you look at the situation in Israel the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: It's hard for them to look at it that way, I am sure.</span> <span id="s1737">That's a very good point.</span> <span id="s1738">Is there anything else that you have that we haven't covered?</span> <span id="s1739">I have just about covered everything here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: There is one thing.</span> <span id="s1741">When you are giving lectures to kids it’s not nice to say this, but, unfortunately, after the war, you found a lot of Jewish couples who used to work with the Germans to save their own lives.</span> <span id="s1742">I wouldn't like to suggest that you tell that to children of the new generation.</span> <span id="s1743">But a friend of mine and I caught a couple in Austria and we looked after them for three years in [unintelligible] but it was a real...he gave up Jewish people to the concentration camps in order to save himself.</span> <span id="s1744">And that's not a nice thing to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: In a way it's important.</span> <span id="s1746">I think that it's always important that the truth be told.</span> <span id="s1747">A: I know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: And that's part of the truth.</span> <span id="s1749">A: Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: And children are entitled to hear the truth, no matter how bad it sounds, to learn what not to do from the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Yes, I agree, but what kind of children.</span> <span id="s1752">What age children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: I am talking about teenagers that are old enough to develop some thought.</span> <span id="s1754">And with young children, you are very limited in what you can share.</span> <span id="s1755">In my own teachings of young children about the Holocaust, I talk about hope.</span> <span id="s1756">The existence of hope in some of the art work that came out of there and some of the poems, and some of the experiences between the young and old there, and to give them a feeling that under the worst of conditions, the greatest amount of despair, for some there is still a feeling of hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: There is a feeling of I hope but I hope the situation will change.</span> <span id="s1758">What I am saying here to you has nothing to do with my going to the concentration camps and my suffering with what I saw myself, but unfortunately what I see in the future, the United States is going on the the wrong side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: We are in the middle of a very critical time.</span> <span id="s1760">Very critical time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: I would say you don’t have a man who can lead this country in the right direction, economically and politically, and he has done so bad, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s1762">He has done the worst thing for Israel than any other president of the U.S.</span> <span id="s1763">The best to me was Nixon.</span> <span id="s1764">I’ve been in Israel seven times now.</span> <span id="s1765">My wife’s sister’s son is a pilot, a captain in the Army.</span> <span id="s1766">I asked him what do you think the Israeli Army would do if they were attacked.</span> <span id="s1767">He said thank God for 1973.</span> <span id="s1768">If no Nixon, no Israel.</span> <span id="s1769">He said to die we can’t afford to lying and to listen to what they are saying to us.</span> <span id="s1770">We must do ourselves.</span> <span id="s1771">What he’s [President Nixon] done for the political life of the United States is a different business.</span> <span id="s1772">I’m not accusing him of anything because I’m not an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1773">I am only a permanent resident.</span> <span id="s1774">I don’t think he’s done more wrong than any other president.</span> <span id="s1775">If he had not [unintelligible] he would be today the hero of the United States.</span> <span id="s1776">He did with the Russians what nobody could do.</span> <span id="s1777">He did with China what nobody could do.</span> <span id="s1778">He was looking like a president.</span> <span id="s1779">Maybe he was tough, maybe he was arrogant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">You need sometimes to be arrogant in a job like that.</span> <span id="s1781">I wouldn’t have survived if I hadn’t been arrogant in the Army.</span> <span id="s1782">I say this way to compare.</span> <span id="s1783">He’s done the best for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: The idea of leadership is to be able to act without having to react to somebody all the time, to take the initiative to do something that we are going to have to move towards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: I would prefer myself to see the Jews of the community take a risk and vote for Reagan because they have no other choice.</span> <span id="s1786">I can tell you what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1787">If [Jimmy] Carter stays in office, and I predict [unintelligible] was talking to a very normal man who went through a lot.</span> <span id="s1788">He promised a lot to the American people, but he didn't keep his promises.</span> <span id="s1789">He promised he would do his best for Israel, he didn’t keep it.</span> <span id="s1790">He gave up more than we needed to.</span> <span id="s1791">And [unintelligible] wants to give more.</span> <span id="s1792">He will succeed in some way.</span> <span id="s1793">But with Reagan I would hope that he wouldn’t let it go.</span> <span id="s1794">He would be tough on this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: I wonder.</span> <span id="s1796">I don't think we have any answers at this point, and that's the whole problem.</span> <span id="s1797">I myself don't have an answer.</span> <span id="s1798">I wish I did.</span> <span id="s1799">It's a tough election.</span> <span id="s1800">I am very frustrated.</span> <span id="s1801">Before I forget, because I think we can go on here all day, I have to get you to sign this release form, which you can certainly read it.</span> <span id="s1802">It says that all the information that we have shared can be made available for use for any particular studies.</span> <span id="s1803">And I want to thank you very very much for all the information you

id="s1819">A: My tank was burning and all the three others were alive.</span> <span id="s1820">They all ran away.</span> <span id="s1821">I was the last one, and the German who was shooting at me was maybe about 200 yards away, and I was running zigzag.</span> <span id="s1822">I went into where wheat was growing.</span> <span id="s1823">I zigzaged in the wheat and I ran into a barbed

God, and he was going to be talking to a group of people, and someone said to him, "what would you say if somebody asked you about God, do you believe in God?"</span> <span id="s1827">And he replied with another question and the question was "which God?</span> <span id="s1828">"The one that brought me into the camps or the one that took me out of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Out
