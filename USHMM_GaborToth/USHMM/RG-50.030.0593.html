your home and your family, and what – what life was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I lived in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s23">My father was a physician.</span> <span id="s24">My father was Jewish, my mother was Catholic, but neither of them really practiced their religion.</span> <span id="s25">My father was a very successful physician, so we had a very nice, privileged life.</span> <span id="s26">We lived in Stuttgart, which was a very modern city at the time.</span> <span id="s27">They had buildings by Gropius, and I had a very privileged childhood.</span> <span id="s28">We had live-in helpers who were like family and so my childhood was a very happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Do you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes, I have a sister who’s five years older than I, here name is – was Lisalotte(ph), and now is Lisa.</span> <span id="s31">And my brother, who’s three years older than I, his name is Karl Theodore, and is now Ted.</span> <span id="s32">My sister lives in Los Angeles, my brother lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Okay, did you – you attended school in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, I went to elementary school, and – for four years, and my teacher, whom I adored, was Fraulein Gruninger(ph).</span> <span id="s35">And I went to the Wagenborg(ph) schule and had a very happy early education.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Were there both Jewish and non-Jewish children at this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, there were all kinds of children, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant.</span> <span id="s38">And I have a friendship book in which some of them signed and had their pictures, and they’re of all religions.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Okay, so a lot of your friends were both Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s42">What are some of your earliest childhood memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, I have a lot of them, and many of them are in a memoir which I wrote, and was published last year.</span> <span id="s44">We were very close to my parents and we did the usual amusements and entertainments for Germans of the time.</span> <span id="s45">We went walking a lot, and we went to the puppet theater, and we visited my grandparents, who lived in Ulm.</span> <span id="s46">And in the summer, we went to Czechoslovakia, where my maternal grandparents had an estate, which was a castle.</span> <span id="s47">And so for the first seven or eight years of my life, I went to Czechoslovakia every summer to spend time at the castle.</span> <span id="s48">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: That’s so cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: – I had a very privileged childhood.</span> <span id="s51">Nothing but happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: That’s so good.</span> <span id="s53">So you said that your family didn’t really practice religion.</span> <span id="s54">Did you do any – prac – do any – I guess, recognize any Jewish holidays or Christian holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s56">I-I think even my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who were Jewish, I don’t think they practiced their religion either, which was not unusual for a lot of German Jews.</span> <span id="s57">But I did go to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s58">I went to German Lutheran Sunday school, and I think I just, you know, went once a week and it was just part of my growing up, I guess.</span> <span id="s59">And then when I came to the United States in 1940, I became a member of the congregational church, which apparently is not too dissimilar from the German Lutheran church.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s61">Remind me again what year you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I was born in 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s64">So, did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s66">It seems that Stuttgart was rather late in having anti-Semitism visible.</span> <span id="s67">I did know that – I think in 1938 perhaps, I was no longer allowed to go to the swimming pool.</span> <span id="s68">But I stayed in school, I think until early in 1939.</span> <span id="s69">However, in 1938, my father lost his medical license, and on Kristallnacht he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s70">Now, in those days, apparently, you could still get out after a fo – short period.</span> <span id="s71">And he was there for a month, and the requirements for leaving at that time, as far as I know, were that you had already applied for a visa to leave Germany, and that you had served in the German army in World War I. And my father was in the German army as a medic in World War I, but he was sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s72">And then, we’re not a hundred percent sure if the story is true, but I was told that the police chief in Stuttgart had a six year old son, and my father was the family doctor, and they say that my father saved the child’s life.</span> <span id="s73">And that when this police chief heard that my father was in Dachau, and had already applied for a visa and had served in the army in World War I, he also helped him.</span> <span id="s74">So my father got out of Dachau after a month, after he had to have surgery which was caused by his stay in Dachau, where they ruined his sinuses.</span> <span id="s75">He left through Switzerland and then went to England.</span> <span id="s76">And he came to England in September of 1939.</span> <span id="s77">My brother, my sister and I were sent to England in, I think April of 1939, on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s79">Well, let’s – let’s back up a little fur – a little bit before we talk about the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s80">Do you remember – you said you remember not being able to go to the swimming pool any more.</span> <span id="s81">Do you remember anything else happening at – you know, your father losing his practice, but I mean, did children treat you differently at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s83">No one treated me differently while I was still in school.</span> <span id="s84">My teacher didn’t, my friends didn’t.</span> <span id="s85">So it really didn’t affect me too much.</span> <span id="s86">And I was probably doing something very silly, I – my mother did let me have English lessons for a short while.</span> <span id="s87">And I remember going on the street and practicing my little English sayings, which of course was not very smart, because if anyone had heard me, there might have been a problem, but fortunately no one ever heard me or paid attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So you attended school up until you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">I think I probably was taken out of school few weeks or months, I really don’t remember how long.</span> <span id="s91">But I know that my mother had lots of clothes made for me to take to England, and I did have these English lessons, but I don’t remember how long I was out of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did your family at home, did your parents talk about the Nazi rise to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: It wasn’t a concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No, the only thing I remember is that the night my father was arrested, my mother woke me up and I remember having to say goodbye to my father, but that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: How long – sorry to interrupt –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: That’s all –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: – how long was he in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: About a month, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Okay, so when did your parents talk to you about the Kindertransport?</span> <span id="s101">When did you know that decision had been made?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t remember whether my mother ever explained it to me.</span> <span id="s104">It was through my mother that we were able to get out, because she did all this while my father was in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So this was in April or May of ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I think we left in April 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s108">And then what – what went into the preparation?</span> <span id="s109">Like you said your mother had clothes –</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: My mother had lots of clothes made, and I had a ba – brand new quilt for my bed, and she packed all my things, and I had some of my favorite books.</span> <span id="s111">One was about three Teddy bears, another one was about Kaspalay(ph), which is a puppet.</span> <span id="s112">And I also had family photo albums that she gave me.</span> <span id="s113">And – but I really don’t remember being scared or traumatized.</span> <span id="s114">I-I just didn’t really know what was going on, I was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What about – and your brother and your sister were – went as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, we all three left together.</span> <span id="s117">Now, I’m sure that my sister, who was 14, and my brother, who was 12, have more memories of it than I did.</span> <span id="s118">My brother, for example, remembers my mother saying goodbye to us at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s119">And I’ve read recently that Nazis did not want parents on the station – on the platform, but apparently my mother did go, and my brother remembers that.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t remember that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So you don’t – you don’t recall the days leading up – whether or not – how you were feeling –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s124">Do you recall the – the journey to England at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: A little bit.</span> <span id="s126">I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the violin on the train, because many Jewish families bought expensive musical instruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for money later.</span> <span id="s127">And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin, and I did, and I remember I played “Ach du lieber Augustine,” which was a famous song at the time for children.</span> <span id="s128">But that’s all I really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Okay, did you know if you went by train to – to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I think so, and then by whatever to England, and we went to London where the three English families that were taking us, met us.</span> <span id="s131">And my sister went to Buxton, my brother went to Harrow, and I went to Marple, which is outside Manchester.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s133">So what was the family like who you lived with?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: My foster father was professor of engineering at the University of Manchester, and his wife Edith.</span> <span id="s135">And they had twin daughters who were about six months older than I, Joyce and Kathleen.</span> <span id="s136">And the day that I arrived, and we went to Marple, my English family had a high tea in my honor.</span> <span id="s137">And I was very surprised, because I thought my foster mother spoke fluent German, I thought this is very easy to understand.</span> <span id="s138">And then when it was bedtime, the woman I thought was my foster mother disappeared.</span> <span id="s139">Turns out that my foster parents had invited the German teacher from the high school to come for the day and make my transition less traumatic.</span> <span id="s140">But from then on, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s141">But they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s142">And I am still in touch with them, and in 2008 I went to England for the twins 80th birthday.</span> <span id="s143">And we correspond, we send each other letters with pictures of our grandchildren, and we’re still very close.</span> <span id="s144">The only one in the family who is that way with the English family is I. My brother and sister did not keep in touch with theirs until a few years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s146">Wa – were there a lot of English customs that you had to adjust to, that was different from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, the one that I remember – and at – at this time, you could still write to Germany from England.</span> <span id="s148">My English foster mother always gave me tea, like everyone else in the family, but I refused to have milk in it, and she thought that that might not be good for me, so she wrote to my mother and asked whether it was all right for me to have tea without milk in it.</span> <span id="s149">And my mother said, oh yes, she has tea at home all the time.</span> <span id="s150">Well, what my mother didn’t realize is that English tea is very strong and very dark, whereas in Germany tea is fairly weak.</span> <span id="s151">And so my mother said no, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s152">So I learned to drink English tea, but was not very fond of it.</span> <span id="s153">And I wasn’t too fond of mutton either, although I did like Shepherd’s pie, which is ground mutton with mashed potatoes and gravy.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: I like that as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: And high tea, I liked high tea.</span> <span id="s156">And I had never had Jell-O, and very often my English foster mother made a dessert with different colors of Jell-O that was all chopped up and very pretty.</span> <span id="s157">And she also made lemon curd, which I’d never had before.</span> <span id="s158">And she always told me when I met them later in 1980, that I would come to the kitchen and I would try to help, and I would say, I will make – meaning that I would help her.</span> <span id="s159">And I remember squeezing lots of lemons for lemon curd.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So did – you said that you had taken some English lessons, but did it take you a while to learn the la – the – your new language?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I guess so, although I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you attend school when you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes, I went to school a week after I got there.</span> <span id="s164">I went to Manchester High School for girls, which was an elementary school in Manchester, so we commuted from Marple to Manchester, and the twins went with me.</span> <span id="s165">I think they were probably a year ahead of me in school.</span> <span id="s166">And I remember loving my school.</span> <span id="s167">And then when the war started in September, after a while, when bombing started in Manchester, like many other British children, we were evacuated to the countryside.</span> <span id="s168">So I had another English family, a Mrs. Emerson and her daughter, who was in her 20s.</span> <span id="s169">She was the – the – Mrs. Emerson was a widow.</span> <span id="s170">And I went to the Cheadle Hulme school, which was an affiliate of the school in Manchester.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Did the two twins go with you when you went –</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, the twins went to boarding school.</span> <span id="s173">And the school I went to was a boarding school, but I went as a day student.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Where were your brother and sister at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: My brother was in Harrow with his English family, and my sister was in Buxton with hers.</span> <span id="s176">My brother’s family had a daughter who was a little bit older than my brother, and my sister’s family I think had four children.</span> <span id="s177">And I saw them once while I was in England, we all got together in Harrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did you return to Marple after being evacuated to the countryside, or did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I went there I think on weekends, or whatever.</span> <span id="s180">I just didn’t go to school in Manchester any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did you experience any air raids, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So what – do you recall ha – what your knowledge was of the war during this time?</span> <span id="s184">Did you read about it, or hear about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s186">I knew that there was a war.</span> <span id="s187">The one thing I do remember is that Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose, spoke on the radio every week to the children of Great Britain to keep our courage up.</span> <span id="s188">And that’s about all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I was there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s192">So, do – and you – you wrote to your mother.</span> <span id="s193">How long did you – were you able to keep in contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I really don’t remember, but I know in the beginning.</span> <span id="s195">Now, my mother stayed in Germany because she didn’t have a German visa, she was born in – in Prague, so she had a Czech visa.</span> <span id="s196">And there – it wasn’t quite as rapid.</span> <span id="s197">And she eventually, she tried to pack up our – all our house, and our paintings, our – all our belongings to send to the United States, and of course nothing was ever delivered.</span> <span id="s198">My parents lost everything.</span> <span id="s199">But she left to go to Italy where my maternal grandparents had a house, which she inherited.</span> <span id="s200">So she went to Italy on the pretense of going to sell that house, and she never left Italy.</span> <span id="s201">And she then went through Portugal in September of 1940 and came directly to the United States.</span> <span id="s202">So I hadn’t seen her for a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Where was your father?</span> <span id="s204">I know he said – you – he got a visa.</span> <span id="s205">Did he – where did he leave to?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: He left, and came through Switzerland to Harrow.</span> <span id="s207">He lived in a boarding house in Harrow, so he and my brother did see each other while they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did you – did – you didn’t see your father though, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I saw him once, the one time that I went to Harrow.</span> <span id="s210">And then in April or May of 1940, my brother, my sister, I and my father all came over by boat on the Britannic to the United States.</span> <span id="s211">And my father had a research fellowship in Ypsilanti, Michigan, because he couldn’t practice medicine yet.</span> <span id="s212">And then a year later he passed the medical exam and then he moved to Massachusetts with us.</span> <span id="s213">And the reason we went to Massachusetts is there were very few states where you could practice medicine without being a citizen, and Massachusetts was one of them.</span> <span id="s214">So we moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston, and he started his practice again, and after a beginning struggle, he became very successful and eventually taught at Tufts Medical School, and put all three of us through college.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: That’s fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So what year was it that you immigrated to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: ’39, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, 1940 we emigrated.</span> <span id="s221">We left Germany in ’39, left England in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s223">Okay, so what about – did you still have grandparents who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes, my maternal grandparents had died early in the 30s, but my paternal grandparents, my grandfather was also a physician, they lived in Ulm.</span> <span id="s225">And it wasn’t until 1942 that they were sent out of Ulm.</span> <span id="s226">They were told they were going to a Jewish retirement settlement, they couldn’t pack very much.</span> <span id="s227">And they were sent to Theresienstadt, and they died in Theresienstadt within a week of each other in January of 1943.</span> <span id="s228">Now, my parents didn’t know that until after the war.</span> <span id="s229">My parents tried to get them out of Germany and couldn’t.</span> <span id="s230">And so it wasn’t until after war that my father found out that my grandparents had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So, your – your brothers and sis – your brother and sister, did they have a positive experience when they were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s233">My brother in Harrow, his family was as wonderful, and in fact, his foster mother eventually came to the United States, because his – their daughter eventually married an American serviceman, and then brought her mother over to the United States.</span> <span id="s234">My sister’s family also was very nice to her, except in the beginning.</span> <span id="s235">My sister at that time was 14, and they sort of treated her as a au pair, a household helper.</span> <span id="s236">And it – that didn’t stop until a cousin of my father’s from India came to visit and explained to them that, you know, she had been brought up in a very privileged household, and that she shouldn’t be treated like a servant.</span> <span id="s237">And everything was fine from then on, and you know, she was quite happy, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s238">Although, she was 14, and that’s not a – an easy age to, you know, uproot.</span> <span id="s239">But one of the children of that family did visit us in Massachusetts when I was in college.</span> <span id="s240">I remember he came – Aubrey came to visit.</span> <span id="s241">But my sister hasn’t kept in touch with them, and my brother really didn’t keep in touch with his either.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So before we move on, I want to talk about your life in the U.S.</span> <span id="s243">You had a photograph of a fr – a friend of yours, Ursula.</span> <span id="s244">Was that someone you knew in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes, my best friend from Germany</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: – was named Ursula Meyer.</span> <span id="s248">And I did visit her in England once.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know where, all I know is it was near the ocean somewhere because there is a photograph of the two of us on the beach in bathing suits.</span> <span id="s250">And I don’t know what ever happened to her, we lost touch when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s251">And I was just curious to see whether she was still alive, and whether she had stayed in England, or whether she got married, or what, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s252">And I first got in touch with the Kindertransport Association, to find out whether they could find her on a list anywhere.</span> <span id="s253">And they did find an Ursula Meyer, but it was a m – a married name, not her m – her maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s255">So how old were you when – when you immigrated to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I was nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Nine, okay, so did you s-start attending American school right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh, when I was s – came to the United States, I was 10.</span> <span id="s259">Yes, I – I first went to school in New York City for a few weeks, until my father got the research fellowship in Michigan.</span> <span id="s260">And then I went to elementary school in Michigan for a year.</span> <span id="s261">And then I – we moved to Braintree, and I skipped a grade, because they said I’d had so much education in Germany and England that I was ready for the eighth grade, I should really have been in seventh.</span> <span id="s262">And then I stayed, I went all through high school in Braintree.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So, was it difficult adjusting to, I mean, a new lifestyle, after being in eng – Germany and then England –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: – then America.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Not for me, I – I – you know, I remember my childhood as being a very happy childhood and I guess I was always happy from the time I was young, and I don’t remember really, any traumatic incidences at all, except for one in England, which I considered traumatic.</span> <span id="s267">My mother, when she was still able to send me packages from Germany had sent me a box of cherries from our Bing cherry tree in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s268">And one night we were to take a bath, and it was my turn to take a bath first.</span> <span id="s269">And the bathroom was quite chilly, but there was a nice little cabinet or closet where the hot water heater was, and it was quite warm in there, and you usually dried yourself in there.</span> <span id="s270">And I was in there drying myself when I heard one of the twins come up for her bath.</span> <span id="s271">And I thought that it was Kathleen, who was the very outgoing twin, and I thought, now wouldn’t it be fun to close the cabinet door and then open it and suddenly say boo.</span> <span id="s272">Well, I had made a mistake and it was not Kathleen, it was Joyce, who was a little more nervous.</span> <span id="s273">And of course, she cried and shrieked and Uncle Cornish(ph), my foster father, sent me to my room for what I considered just fun, but apparently he was concerned because one of the twins was crying.</span> <span id="s274">So I remember sitting on my bed on my beautiful new quilt, opening my box of cherries, and I ate every cherry one by one and I kept muttering to myself, and you won’t have any, I will eat them all by myself.</span> <span id="s275">And then in 1980, when I went back to England for my foster mother’s 80th birthday, I told him the story and he couldn’t remember it at all.</span> <span id="s276">But that’s about the only traumatic experience I had.</span> <span id="s277">And the only other one was in New York, when I was in school for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s278">I remember standing up at my desk to answer a question, and the little boy behind me was measuring the length of my dress with a ruler.</span> <span id="s279">And apparently my German dresses had gotten a little short as I got a year older, and I remember him measuring the length of my skirt.</span> <span id="s280">But that’s about the only traumatic experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you exchange a lot of letters and packaged with your mother when you were in England and she was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, she packed everything in my trunk, you know, that she thought I might want to have, like my Teddy bear and my books, and I don’t remember too many other letters from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Were your parents able to get anything out of Germany when – when they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, no, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Do you remember hearing about the war ending when you were in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Oh yes, and I – I distinctly remember Roosevelt’s death, because that came over the radio and I remember how shocked my parents were when they heard that.</span> <span id="s288">I was actually on – on Cape Cod when World War II ended, and I heard over the radio, and we all celebrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s290">So, let’s see, what else we have to talk about.</span> <span id="s291">Have – have you ever done an interview like this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Have you ever – do you talk to your – have you talked to your children – how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I have two daughters, and I have five grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay, whe-when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I got married what at that time was considered late in life.</span> <span id="s297">I was 27 and my husband was 31 and in those days, in 1956 that was considered over the hill.</span> <span id="s298">Most of my college friends were already mothers.</span> <span id="s299">But I got married in 1956 and I got married at the Harvard chapel, which solved all of the religious problems – my husband was Jewish.</span> <span id="s300">And anyone who went to Harvard, which I did, and he went to the Harvard Business School, was able to get married at the Harvard chapel, so that’s where we got married and it solved all the problems of who was going to marry us, and how, and what, and everybody was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: That’s good.</span> <span id="s302">Okay, so I guess we – we should back up.</span> <span id="s303">So you went – you went to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I majored in English and American literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Cool, and your – and did you meet your husband at Harvard?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s309">He actually went to the business school after I graduated.</span> <span id="s310">He worked for a few years before he went to graduate school.</span> <span id="s311">So I graduated in 1950, and this year was my 60th reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you attend it?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: It was a great reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: So, and you have two daughters and five grandchildren, and d – have you ever talked to them about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Well, I’ve talked to my d – my daughters, you know, about it, and a little bit to my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s320">But that’s really why I wrote my memoir, so that they would know.</span> <span id="s321">And you know, what they know about the Holocaust they read in – in their history textbooks, and they know what happened politically, but I don’t think they ever fully realized how it affects individuals.</span> <span id="s322">And I thought they should know how it affected my family, and what happened to me when I was nine years old.</span> <span id="s323">And that’s really why I wrote the memoir.</span> <span id="s324">And my husband kept insisting that I should write that and – for the grandchildren, primarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: I think it’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So it’s good that you did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And it’s also good that you’re sharing your story with us today, so thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Do you think that your experiences with the Kindertransport affected maybe especially the way that you raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s333">I mean, they’ve always known what it was like fo – you know, when I was a child from what I told them, but I don’t think it really affected them.</span> <span id="s334">As I said, my husband was Jewish, but he also did not practice his religion really, after he was in his 20s.</span> <span id="s335">And so we did a little bit of everything, you know.</span> <span id="s336">We practiced some Jewish holidays because his side of the family did practice them.</span> <span id="s337">But we also practiced Christmas, which is what my side of the family did, and so I think I’ve tried to make them non-prejudiced, and – and, you know, have respect for all religions and all races.</span> <span id="s338">But other than that, I don’t think it really influenced my raising my children in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Did you ever speak to your parents about maybe what they were going through when they –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s341">My father, for example, never talked about Dachau and we never asked him.</span> <span id="s342">And it wasn’t until he wrote a very small autobiography in 1972 that I learned a little bit about his experiences in Dachau.</span> <span id="s343">And I know he told me in that autobiography that two other people from Stuttgart that were sent to Dachau with him, died.</span> <span id="s344">One, because he was a diabetic and was not given insulin, and the other from some kind of intestinal infection.</span> <span id="s345">And as I said, my father suffered from some kind of sinus problems which had to have surgery once he got out of the hospital – I mean, out of Dachau and he went to the hospital in Stuttgart, before he went to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Does your mother ever talk about when she was in Germany alone, about what she was experiencing?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s348">We really didn’t talk very much about it.</span> <span id="s349">And it was just there, you know, we knew that that’s what we had gone through.</span> <span id="s350">And the only thing – you asked whether my parents were able to save anything.</span> <span id="s351">The only thing that they were able to save – and this is a – a rather unique story, a good friend of theirs was Emma Goering, who was a distant cousin of Goering’s, who was, of course, one of the biggest Nazis.</span> <span id="s352">She was very anti-Nazi, and very outspoken, but they never arrested her or bothered here, I guess because she was related to him.</span> <span id="s353">But she was a good friend of my parents.</span> <span id="s354">And when my mother was getting everything ready, packed to go to the United States, you were not supposed to take any jewelry or silver, you had to declare that and give it to the government.</span> <span id="s355">Well, my mother didn't want to do that.</span> <span id="s356">And Emma Goering suggested that she – my mother give it to her and she would bury it in her garden, in a box, which she did.</span> <span id="s357">And during the war, my brother was in the army for four years, and toward the end he was on a leave, and he went to visit Emma Goering, to see if she was still al-alive.</span> <span id="s358">And Emma Goering said to him, I have something that belongs to your mother.</span> <span id="s359">And they went into her garden, dug up the box, and because he was already a U.S. citizen and a serviceman, he was allowed to send it to the United States.</span> <span id="s360">So my mother got back all of the jewelry that she had inherited from her grandmother and great-grandmother, her German silverware.</span> <span id="s361">And then several years later Emma Goering visited my husband and me in New York City, and she was a charming, charming lady.</span> <span id="s362">And so that’s the only thing my parents did save, and it was because of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: That’s an incredible story.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So, your brother was in the army during World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Okay, so when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: He was in Patton’s army for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Oh, so when you immigrated, he must have joined the army right away, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Well, he – no, he – he was – when we immigrated, he was 13 – 14 –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: He went to high school in Michigan.</span> <span id="s373">And then he had started the University of Michigan when he was drafted, and then he went in the army, and he was in the army for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s375">That’s incredible.</span> <span id="s376">That’s great that sh-he – she was able to save –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So, is there anything else that you – you would like to add?</span> <span id="s381">Any other –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, it’s just that I – I guess I was a – a very, very lucky child, because my English foster family was just – just wonderful.</span> <span id="s383">And as I said, I saw them again in 1980 for my foster mother’s 80th birthday.</span> <span id="s384">And then I went back to England in 2008 for the twins’ 80th birthday party.</span> <span id="s385">And they were just so compassionate and loving, and so was Mrs. Emerson.</span> <span id="s386">And it taught me a good lesson, that compassion and friendliness and love and just being good people is important, and I’ve tried to teach that to my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: So you’ve returned to England twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes, I went back to Germany first in 1951 with my sister, we went to Europe for three months.</span> <span id="s391">And we visited our house in Stuttgart, and then I went back again in 1982, to visit my German cousins on my mother’s side of the family, whom I hadn’t seen until the mid-30s.</span> <span id="s392">And we’ve become very close friends and so we’ve gone back to Europe two or three times for birthdays and travel, and – with them.</span> <span id="s393">And so I’ve been back, yes.</span> <span id="s394">And when I went back in 1982, we went to Stuttgart, and the people who owned my parents’ house took my husband and me through it, to show us what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Was it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: And then – not really.</span> <span id="s397">Apparently it was damaged a little bit during the war, but not badly.</span> <span id="s398">And the interesting thing is, as we were leaving, a woman next door leaned over the fence and said, Erica, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s399">In German.</span> <span id="s400">And it turns out that she was my sister’s friend.</span> <span id="s401">She was my sister’s age, and for some reason she recognized me after all those years.</span> <span id="s402">And so I explained to her what happened to us.</span> <span id="s403">And so we did see the house in 1982.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Did you speak German at home with your family after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s406">I think once we came to the United States and my father decided we were now going to be Americans, and you know, we really didn’t speak much German.</span> <span id="s407">But I can still speak it, and I speak it with a strong [indecipherable] accent, and I can understand most German.</span> <span id="s408">I can’t understand legal German or technical German, but I can read German.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Mm-hm, that’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s410">So, if – if there’s anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, I’m just, you know, as I said, I was very lucky, I had a wonderful English family.</span> <span id="s412">I know not everyone was as lucky as I was.</span> <span id="s413">And we’ve stayed very close friends, and I’ve just recognized how – what a big sacrifice it was for these people, because they didn’t know whether they were going to have us for a month or a year or forever.</span> <span id="s414">I know there are some Kindertransport children who’ve been there, you know, were there for seven, eight, nine years.</span> <span id="s415">And I was only there for a year.</span> <span id="s416">But both families were just wonderful to us, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: And they – be – ma – my English foster family remained friends with my parents and came to visit them in the United States.</span> <span id="s419">And then my parents visited them in England, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: So, it was a nice relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Before we wrap things up, I’m curious, are the photos that you brought, are they pictures from – from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Maybe let’s look at them real quick and we’ll kind of talk about them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, sure, yeah, come and sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: I’ll come sit next to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Well, in the beginning, I have pictures of my father and my uncle and my aunt, and those have interesting stories.</span> <span id="s428">My uncle, who was an entomologist, left Germany in 1933, went first to Palestine for a few years, then to Venezuela, and eventually ended up in Mexico City, where he became a professor at University of Mexico, as an entomologist.</span> <span id="s429">My aunt, whose husband had factories that manufactured felt for printing in both Germany and Italy, left in 1936 and moved to Italy, and a farmer hid him as a farm helper during the war.</span> <span id="s430">And my aunt and my three cousins were saved by Italian nuns, who took them to a nunnery.</span> <span id="s431">So anyway, these are pictures of my father, and these are pictures of my mother in her childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Oh wow, that’s a wonderful photo.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, and she, you know, really grew up sort of like a debutante.</span> <span id="s434">And then, these are the pictures of my grandparents, Dr. Ludwig, and [indecipherable] Hecht.</span> <span id="s435">And they are the ones who died in Theresienstadt in 1943.</span> <span id="s436">And the reason I know that they didn’t go there until 1942, late in the year was that there’s a letter from them to my cousin in Italy, saying that they were going to have to leave in August of 1942.</span> <span id="s437">And then it wasn’t til after the war that we found out that they had died, but here’s a picture of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Did they s – did they stay in Ulm until this?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes, they stayed in Ulm until then.</span> <span id="s442">And these are my maternal grandparents, who died early in the 30s.</span> <span id="s443">And they’re the ones who had the – the estate in Czechoslovakia where I st-stayed every summer until I was probably seven or eight.</span> <span id="s444">And here, this is pictures of Stuttgart, where I grew up.</span> <span id="s445">And this is our house and there are my brother and sister.</span> <span id="s446">That’s me at the age of three.</span> <span id="s447">And there are my brother and I with our Steiff Teddy bears, who had a webbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Oh, that’s precious.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And then here’s me learning to ski at four, and learning gymnastics.</span> <span id="s450">And here are our nannies or au pairs, or whatever they were called.</span> <span id="s451">And here – when I was little.</span> <span id="s452">And here my school friends, and here’s Ursula Meyer, my best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Oh wow, look how long her pigtails are.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, oh, she had lo – and big, blue eyes, she was very, very pretty.</span> <span id="s455">And then, this is the castle that my grandparents had in –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: – in Czechoslovakia, where I went every summer.</span> <span id="s458">And there I am, and here I’m learning how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s459">And here’s my grandfather taking a nap after lunch.</span> <span id="s460">And this was our cook in Germany, who used to come with us in the summer to help.</span> <span id="s461">And here’s our nanny, or au pair.</span> <span id="s462">And these are relatives who were visiting.</span> <span id="s463">And here we are outdoor bowling.</span> <span id="s464">And this is all in – in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s465">And this place is also a religions shrine, so this is – this was how it fell apart in the 90s, and this is how it’s now renovated.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: And it’s still a – considered a religious shrine.</span> <span id="s468">These are paintings that my brother did when he was little.</span> <span id="s469">Then here’s another picture – oh, here’s my English foster family, Raun(ph) and Edith Cornish(ph).</span> <span id="s470">And this is their house in Marple.</span> <span id="s471">And this is the one time that I visited my brother in Harrow.</span> <span id="s472">And here I am in Wales, the summer of 1939, we went camping in Wales, in Saint David’s.</span> <span id="s473">And here I am, here’s my school blazer.</span> <span id="s474">You see we’re not wearing our blazers.</span> <span id="s475">Black, with yellow trim.</span> <span id="s476">And here’s Ursula Meyer, my best friend.</span> <span id="s477">And here’s my other English foster family, Mrs. Emerson and her daughter.</span> <span id="s478">And this is my favorite teacher, she was my English teacher, Miss Andrew.</span> <span id="s479">And this is Cheadle Hulme, the school I went to when the war started in – in England.</span> <span id="s480">And then all the other photographs – oh, this is the – the boat we came over on in 1940.</span> <span id="s481">And here’s our first apartment in Michigan, very tiny apartment.</span> <span id="s482">And here’s Eloise Hospital in Ypsilanti, where my father got his research grant for the first year.</span> <span id="s483">And here’s me in an evening gown because I played the violin with the Detroit Symphony [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s484">Here’s my eighth grade high s – eighth grade graduation picture, my sister and our dog and my brother on a furlough before he was sent overseas.</span> <span id="s485">And then the rest are all just pictures of me growing up, high school, college.</span> <span id="s486">And then when we moved to massachu – to New Jersey, and I worked in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s487">Here’s our wedding at the Harvard chapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: That is a wonderful wedding dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: And here’s me helping to decorate – the club let me finish decorating my wedding cake.</span> <span id="s490">And then these are our wedding pictures, our honeymoon and there’s our first daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: What was your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Milton Kanter.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Oh, precious.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: There, with a copy of Dr. Spock.</span> <span id="s495">And this was our wonderful, loyal Willie, who took care of my daughters the – the day I went to the office.</span> <span id="s496">I had special permission to come to the office only one day a week and work at home the rest of the time –</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Oh, nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: – which was very unusual in the late 50s, early 60s.</span> <span id="s499">But I did that for 13 years, until the children were 13 and 11, then I went back to work full time.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Where were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: At Harcourt Brace, which was the – one of the largest textbook publishers in the United States, and I was editor-in-chief there from 1980 to 1990.</span> <span id="s502">This was our house in New Jersey, and here’s daughter number two, and here they are, and then their growing up years and then their college and then our trips to Europe and Japan on –</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Wow, Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: – the husb – my husband had to go there on business and I was invited to go.</span> <span id="s505">And family birthdays and all kinds of pictures like this, and then, at the back of the book, I have pictures of my five grandchildren, to whom this book is dedicated and let’s see where they are.</span> <span id="s506">Here.</span> <span id="s507">This is the oldest, he’s now 21, from the time he was little until now.</span> <span id="s508">And here’s the next one, who’s 20, and now.</span> <span id="s509">And here’s the next one, who is just turned 18, and now.</span> <span id="s510">And this is my granddaughter, who is the gymnast, she became a junior Olympian last year, she’s amazing, and now.</span> <span id="s511">And the youngest, who’s 14, then and now.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Four boys and one girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes, four boys and one girl.</span> <span id="s514">And this is a picture of my husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: – without whom this book would not have been possible.</span> <span id="s517">He’s the one who kept insisting I write it and then many, many of these photographs are photographs that he took, he was a very good photographer.</span> <span id="s518">Anyway, that’s what this book is.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Well, it’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: And it’s called, “The Road I’ve Traveled: Its Ruts and Rainbows.”</span> <span id="s521">And that’s me at the age of three.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Oh, that is a wonderful photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: And this is my 1939 passport photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Oh adorable, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: And this is a picture of my husband in his usual pose with his camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: With the camera up to his eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yeah, always with that Nikon around his neck.</span> <span id="s528">Anyway, that’s what this book is, and these are the pages on which the grandparents who died, and my English families are.</span> <span id="s529">So that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: It’s wonderful that you know, you would be able to capture so many memories in photograph, but also to be able to write that all down in a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah, well, I put in all the photographs because fir – first of all, in a sense, all these photographs are my husband’s legacy to his grandchildren.</span> <span id="s532">And also because I knew that the grandsons probably wouldn’t read it for a while, but I wanted them to be able to see it, as well as read about it, and experience my life in, you know, a different way than just reading about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Well, I’m sure it’s something that they will cherish, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah, I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add before we –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, I’m really looking forward to this meeting because I’ve never gone to a convention –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Oh, you never – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: No, I didn’t know about it until this year, and so I’m really looking forward to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Well, thank you so much for talking to us today –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: – this has been wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: I’m so glad we were able to look at your book and share your story with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Very good.</span> <span id="s545">Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Thank you so much, Mrs. Kanter.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: You’re
