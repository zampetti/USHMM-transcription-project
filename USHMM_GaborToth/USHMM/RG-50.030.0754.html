big questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s41">I don’t know as much about my grandparents as I should know, but I will tell you what I know.</span> <span id="s42">My father was born in a tiny little town called Gensingen [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Okay, Gensingen [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: He, I think went only to Volksschule and then became an apprentice in a grain and feed, Getreide und Futtermittel business.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Which he then went into a-as – with a partner and as his own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: As his own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: As his own business, and did very nicely.</span> <span id="s49">His par – his fa – his father was also doing grain and feed sales, and he also occasionally sold a cow.</span> <span id="s50">He – he wa – in this tow – little town, did a little bit of everything.</span> <span id="s51">My grandmother, Fanny Simon was a lovely woman.</span> <span id="s52">She was still very beautiful when she was 80.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: They were lovely grandparents and I enjoyed vacations at their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Were they – were they well-to-do, your grandparents?</span> <span id="s56">Were they originally meltu –</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Were they well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: – well-to-do, or middle class, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I would say middle class, they were not very well-to-do, but they were not – I mean, they had a little house, you know, sort of a – very closely in almost like row houses in that little – little – very ancient town.</span> <span id="s60">And they were – they were fine, but they were not – I would not say they – they were well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What about your –</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My grandparents on my mother’s side I think were a little bit better off.</span> <span id="s63">My grandfather on that side had a – and a – and a [indecipherable] he made brandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: And I enjoyed visiting them, and they – they – they did, I think, pretty well.</span> <span id="s66">They had – they had the [indecipherable] where they lived, and it was a really fascinating place.</span> <span id="s67">I was very disappointed after the war to find that had been bombed, and it co – there was nothing left of their house or their factory, whatever you’d want to call it, and everything had completely changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Tell me, where – where were they?</span> <span id="s69">Were they in the same village?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They went Bingen am Rhein, not far.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Bingen – okay, Bingen am Rhein.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Bingen am Rhein, and my mother grew up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Her name is – maiden name is Meyer, m-e-y-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And her first name, your mother’s first –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Paula and Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Paula –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: My parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s82">Joseph Si – Simon.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Joseph Simon.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Simon.</span> <span id="s85">And Paula –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Paula Meyer Simon.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s88">And so she came from Meyers, who had the weinerei(ph), th-the wine –</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Right, right</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: – the brandy –</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: – factory there.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did they have – were they – did they have brothers and sisters, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: My parents?</span> <span id="s96">My mother had a sister, one sister, and my dad had that brother who died so young in an automobile accident, age – at 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: The one you were named after?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: And strangely enough, I was born exactly on his birthday, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: That’s quite a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: So, when my – I don’t know exactly how my dad and mother met, but they were very much in love, and they married in 1923, I believe, and honeymooned in Heligoland, and I think I was conceived there, because I – they were married in August, and I was born the next June second.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s104">So Heligoland, where is that?</span> <span id="s105">Tell me [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: It’s an island, I think in the – in the North Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I’m not a hundred percent sure of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Never been there, but I heard a lot about it, it was a very favorite place for honeymoons at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Oh, the Niagara Falls of Germany, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So, do you have any earliest memories –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: – as a small child?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I – I think so, because I –</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: – it’s hard sometimes to tell what – what – what do you remember, what were you told.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: But I remember vaguely my mo – when – that my brother came home, and very short – wh-when he was very small baby, he had some kind of infection on his face, which became a sept – septicemia, a blood poisoning.</span> <span id="s121">And he had to have an operation.</span> <span id="s122">I don’t know exactly what they did, I guess just maybe drained the – the – the sore that he had that was infected.</span> <span id="s123">And lu-luckily he survived, because that was almost always fatal.</span> <span id="s124">Had a big scar on – that never totally disappeared.</span> <span id="s125">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: And he still has a little bit of that.</span> <span id="s128">But the – he was fine, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Why does that stick in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: – I remember that – pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Why do you think that sticks in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, again, I – I don’t – I think it – it was dra-dramatic, and – and it may have been – it maybe have been really more been told to me than – than I really remember.</span> <span id="s133">But I think I remember – think that I – when I was three – se – three or four years old.</span> <span id="s134">We had, I think – this, don’t forget was – I was born in ’24, so we had a – our – our childhood were really quite happy.</span> <span id="s135">My parents were well off.</span> <span id="s136">We had – we lived in a beautiful, huge apartment in this –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Oh, describe it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: It had two or three bedrooms, it had at least one bathroom, I – may have been two, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s139">And I – or at least a separate toilet.</span> <span id="s140">A – and hamzimmer(ph), a – a what would call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Hanzimmer(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Hanzimmer(ph), a salon, a –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sort of a living room or a –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: – meeting room.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: – which was very large, and a dining room.</span> <span id="s147">Something called a [indecipherable], which was really a place where my parents got dressed in their – off their bedroom.</span> <span id="s148">And master bedroom, and I think two – two other bedrooms, and my brother and I usually shared a bedroom.</span> <span id="s149">I think the other bedroom was made into a study or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: But it was very large and it was very beautiful and we had a balcony, and was a quiet street.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: It sounds like a 19th century kind of building.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, it – it – I mean – and – and my grandfather owned that apartment building, so my dad and my uncle owned – owned the whole thing eventually.</span> <span id="s154">And it was qui – a nice place for the children to play, ride their tricycles and bicycles and –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Where would you do that?</span> <span id="s156">In the courtyard?</span> <span id="s157">Was there a courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Or even on the street, because there wasn’t a whole lot of traffic.</span> <span id="s159">So this was my early childhood and the next major thing I remember, and we can go back if something comes up from a question, was when I was about six, seven years old, I developed on my left eye, I believe it was, a – what looked like a – a serious infection or some inflammation, where I had a drooping li-lid, and it looked very angry.</span> <span id="s160">And my parents took me to an eye doctor in Wiesbaden, of all – of all names, Dr. Goering.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Oh, good God.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: He was a cousin or something of the field marshal.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: And he came out with a cockamamie diagnosis of TB of the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Tuberculosis of the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: And my parents got – yeah, I don’t even know if that exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: But my parents got scared enough so they sent me for the entire – when I was about seven years old, for the entire winter to a kinderheim, which I guess translates best to a chi-children’s camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: – in Samaden(ph), Switzerland, a village right outside of Saint Moritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Well, that’s not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, it isn’t bad except I was so homesick I couldn’t enjoy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: That time I think I was even without my brother, and I was there from before Christmas til after Easter, and I just cried myself to sleep many nights.</span> <span id="s175">Didn’t really appreciate, as I did la-later on, as I will tell you in a minute.</span> <span id="s176">So I was there for a very long time, the idea was that the mountain air is good for TB.</span> <span id="s177">And the following year they send me back again, I think also for most of the winter, to another – but this one – this – this one time was a much more pleasant, Jewish kinderheim in Celerina, which is the town between Samadan(ph), or Samadan(ph), and Saint Moritz.</span> <span id="s178">And that time I had my brother with me, an-and I was a little older and I had a very good time, and I learned how to ski.</span> <span id="s179">I mean, I learned the rudimentary –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: – aspects of it, snowplows and – and m-my dad came to visit, and show you how brothers can differ, I said – I ju – I was starting to run into his arms because I was so happy to see him, and my brother said, no, first we’re gonna finish the sled ride down the mountain [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s182">But we had a wonderful time –</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Kids are like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: – seeing him, we still enjoyed seeing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: And – and that was actually a very interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: – experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were you very close to your brother from the very beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Oh yes, we – you know, we had our fights, as most children, especially that close, two boys do.</span> <span id="s191">But we were always very close, we – we ch – shared a bedroom and we – we couldn’t go to sleep without saying [speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Oh, that’s sweet, that really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Right.</span> <span id="s194">So, and then I really became very interested in winter sports, and I – my dad, and then following when – as I became a little older, like 10 - 11, my dad to-took me with him.</span> <span id="s195">My par – my parents took separate vacations.</span> <span id="s196">I haven’t told you much about the business –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: I’d like to know about ma –</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: – my mother enjoyed working in the business.</span> <span id="s201">So she was basically office manager, bookkeeper, accountant, whatever, and in-in the – in the – in – in the [indecipherable] which was in our building, so she didn’t have to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s202">But they didn’t take vacation together, somebody had to be there for the business, so they – my mother went with his sister, my dad went pretty much by himself, but met some people he knew that came every year in Saint Moritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Oh, so is that – was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: So at that time it wasn’t quite as –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: – as fa – posh as it is now, but it was still a beautiful resort, and he took me with him for – from – I guess from the time – from what, 11 to 13.</span> <span id="s207">Thirteen was in 1937, and it was the last time we were able to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s208">Now, my dad waited a long time, and I’ll explain that, to emigrate, and I’ll explain that –</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: – very carefully.</span> <span id="s211">But he clearly knew it was coming, because one of the reasons for going on all these vacations was that – to smuggle money out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Absolutely, he started that very early.</span> <span id="s214">He would go to Switzerland – first of all, you had – the Germans gave you a certain amount of foreign money, they allowed you a certain amount of money to change to – so let’s say in the case of Swiss francs, or Dutch guilder, you had a couple of thousand dollars, whatever it was, he would live in a little cheaper hotel, save some money, put it in a bank in Switzerland or Holland, Belgium, wherever we went.</span> <span id="s215">He also took along a [indecipherable] or contacts, and sold it there.</span> <span id="s216">In addition, I found out later they bought a row house in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s217">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did they?</span> <span id="s219">Even before coming here?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: They really in – in the fi – the idea that we may go there, and we – or go to the United States.</span> <span id="s221">And so they – they were really quite foresighted in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Yeah, it’s true, it’s true, because many people –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: – didn’t know where to go, or how.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yeah, but he didn’t even apply for a – for a visa, but I’ll explain that in a minute.</span> <span id="s226">So my mother was made – mainly in the business, so she hired a both some – some help in the kitchen, and you know, like a – a maid – a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You anticipated one of my questions, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: But she also, from time to time hired a nursemaid for – for the two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s230">That’s one thing I wanted to ask, is whether she had any help in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, absolutely –</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: – since she ur – worked quite a bit.</span> <span id="s234">She almost always had a maid, as long as we were allowed to have them.</span> <span id="s235">And from time to time quite often had also, at least on weekends, a nursemaid for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So were these people – were they – did they change a lot, or did you have people come help her and – and th-that became part of the family?</span> <span id="s237">What kind of relation did you have with this –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I-In the beginning, yeah.</span> <span id="s239">Early on, as they were there quite a long time and – and became sort of a part of the family, I mean, really – even had Christmas trees for the maids, which we enjoyed too, at Christmastime.</span> <span id="s240">Later on, of course, these things changed a lot.</span> <span id="s241">When the Nuremberg laws came out, we had to have a maid over say 55 years old, and wa – while the lady was very nice, we never became that close.</span> <span id="s242">But I had, I-I remember, at least one young woman that took care of us on weekends when we were already a little older, when I was maybe 10 or 11, and my brother was a year and a half younger, whom I had a terrible crush on.</span> <span id="s243">She was very, very pretty.</span> <span id="s244">And so the reason my par – well, first of all, let me say something about the times.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: We – it was – as soon as the Nazis came to power, things did change pretty quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How?</span> <span id="s248">How did – did it – how did it affect your life?</span> <span id="s249">I mean, the – your family’s life, not just yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Actually, you know, clearly not as much as it did later on, but very quickly we couldn’t go to our swimming pool, our favorite swimming pool.</span> <span id="s251">We couldn’t go – my – my dad belonged to a luft bad –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So, a luft bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: – which was basically the German equivalent of an all male nudist colony.</span> <span id="s254">They went there to walk around in the nude and take sun baths in the nude.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And they couldn’t over – over there.</span> <span id="s257">There were – were signs [speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Jews are not allowed, yeah, not allowed in – not –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: All over, yeah, also some of the mu – movie theaters and theaters.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And that was pretty soon after the –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Even some park benches, I don’t remember for sure whether – if that was the case in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s262">But, I mean, those things became evident.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So, that soon after ’33?</span> <span id="s264">I mean, soon –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Very soon, I would say –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So you were nine years old –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: – ’34 - ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: And they made it more and more difficult for my dad to operate his business.</span> <span id="s270">He had a l – a – an [indecipherable] and wholesale grain business.</span> <span id="s271">He – he bought and sold, and he he had a – a – what do you call it, a –</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: A tire, a towel, a si – excuse me, a silo?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Not exact silo, a – a warehouse with a thing where you – where you can put – put – put the grain through into sacks and all – and all sorts of – even, I think, some milling.</span> <span id="s274">And this warehouse was taken away from him, and what we found out later is, it became a – an arms depot –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: – for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s277">And my dad went and took a picture of that warehouse, not knowing it was an arms depot, I don’t think he knew, and was immediately hauled in by the Gestapo, and questioned and told he was not allowed to take pictures at this.</span> <span id="s278">But they let him go that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So this is after it’s taken away from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, that was probably about ’36 - ’37.</span> <span id="s281">Between ’36 - ’37, I don’t remember exactly what year.</span> <span id="s282">And then, of course, it became more and more difficult for him to do any business.</span> <span id="s283">Luckily, he had savings, so he was able to live from about ’36 to – until the end of ’38, when we emigrated to United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: That’s actually – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: – and had enough left over for us to live a few months before he started to work there.</span> <span id="s286">But things got more and more difficult.</span> <span id="s287">If – if a Jewish had wanted to go to a gymnasium, there was a quota.</span> <span id="s288">And my parents wanted to send me to the orangienstrasse(ph) gymnasium, I forget, they had a form real gymnasium, something like that, and they couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s289">But I got into the Gutenberg gymnasium, which was a humanistisch gymnasium and a real gymnasium.</span> <span id="s290">About the only difference between the humanistic part and the – and the real part was that in humanistic part you took Greek as a second, after Latin – after Latin and French, then Greek, and the other one you took Latin, French and then English.</span> <span id="s291">And I went to the real part of it, and well, only about, I would say six Jewish boys – this was an all boys’ school, and I believe there may have been a girl – separate girl gymnasium as well, six or seven Jewish kids among about 300 students.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s293">That’s not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: And I had one very good friend, whom I already had as a friend in the Volksschule, whose name I would give you.</span> <span id="s295">His name was Vanna(ph) Kahn(ph); became Warren Kahn(ph) in the United States, and he now retired in Sarasota, Florida, and we still see each other occasionally, as I age.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Another Jewish person?</span> <span id="s297">He was Jewish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Jewish – Jewish as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I did, and I’m – the one I remember most vividly is a – a boy with the typically German name of Karl Heinz Mueller(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Oh gosh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: I can’t be get mi – more German than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: And he used to come to my house, I used to come to his house, played together, enjoyed each other, until one day he came to my house and said, Eric, my dad is an opera singer, he works for the Startz(ph) Oper, which is a government –</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Opera company.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: – o-operated, and he was told that if I see this Jew boy one more time, he doesn’t have a job.</span> <span id="s307">I said, you can’t come back.</span> <span id="s308">I absolutely don’t want to be responsible for that.</span> <span id="s309">And I’ve never seen him since, and I have no idea whether he alive or dead.</span> <span id="s310">I totally lost track.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What – how old are you when – when – when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Must have been 12 or 13, because we left when I was 14 –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: – and it happened a little before we left, so it – probably 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: How did – how did you feel about it when he said that, were you shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I was very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Very upset.</span> <span id="s319">I mean, I wasn’t shocked because I had a feeling this was gonna come.</span> <span id="s320">But I was very sad.</span> <span id="s321">He wa – we were very close.</span> <span id="s322">But also, around that time, I wi – we’d w – be walking down the street and – and people would yell dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s323">[speaks German] and things like that.</span> <span id="s324">People who didn’t know me at all, I – I mean, I don’t know that I looked particularly Jewish, but they seemed to know I was Jewish, an-and I didn’t – I didn’t let it bother me, but I mean, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: How could it not bother –</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: – sometimes very upsetting, you don’t know how soon they’re gonna start hitting and –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: – and attacking.</span> <span id="s329">And if they di – the eye – it’s interesting, the people who knew me in high school, in the gymnasium, were very nice to me all year long, except on one day.</span> <span id="s330">One day a year they were – th-they had to put on the uniform to come to school.</span> <span id="s331">It was called Hitlerjugend Werbewoche.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: It means –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: It means –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: – the Hitler youth, sort of like –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Hitlerjugend is the Hitler youth –</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: – recruitment year – recruitment week.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: – werbewoche means recruiting week, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah, recruiting week.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: There’s nothing to recruit, because every German boy who was not Jewish, had to belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: But they came to – they – they propagandized the Hitler youth by coming to school in the uniform, and they were suddenly, totally changed.</span> <span id="s342">And they were n-not very nice, and sometimes quite –</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Some kids –</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: – agress – aggressive.</span> <span id="s345">And one year we even ma – Warren and I ha-had to actually fight them off.</span> <span id="s346">We stood back to back so we couldn’t be attacked from the back and – and punched, until a very nice gentleman with a cane came along and shooed – shooed these guys away.</span> <span id="s347">We were very lucky –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: And this was in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: This was in the school halls?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, no, this was out on the street, yeah.</span> <span id="s352">This is near the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And were these your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No – well, a couple of them may have been, yes.</span> <span id="s355">I don’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Older than you, younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: There all in uniform – in Hitler you – youth un-un-uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Were they older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No, about the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: So, you know, things were beginning to go south, and you could tell that wi – things were not pleasant for people, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: I – I want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s363">I want to go back to your family life.</span> <span id="s364">The relations that you had with the hired help –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: With?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: With the hired help, th-the people who came to help your mother in the – in the home, either take care of you or in the kitchen on the weekends.</span> <span id="s367">Did those relations change?</span> <span id="s368">You said that the Nuremberg laws came, and so you couldn’t hire somebody who was younger than 55.</span> <span id="s369">But did the attitude of the people who were hired, did that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s371">I mean, it – not that I was aware of.</span> <span id="s372">They were all – I mean, they – first of all, even if they did, it didn’t show it, because they want – they wanted their jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Right, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: So I – I really can’t answer that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: What about conversations before Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s376">You would have been still a child that is 10 years old or younger.</span> <span id="s377">But were there conversations in the home about what there were – what kind of atmosphere was in Germany, what kind of economic troubles Germany was going –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I think there was some conversation about that they were very worried that Hitler might come to power.</span> <span id="s379">And I – my dad had read “Mein Kampf.”</span> <span id="s380">And I’d like to take that occasion to say that my parents didn’t have a lot of formal education, but they were amazingly intellectual.</span> <span id="s381">I mean, they had a huge library, they read all the classics, Schiller, Goethe –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: – Lessing.</span> <span id="s384">And they – they were very b – very mu – very much interested in education and in reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: My dad had read “Mein Kampf,” and so he knew what Hitler was saying about the Jews, and was worried that he meant it.</span> <span id="s387">And so, they were concerned, I mean, no question about it.</span> <span id="s388">And – but that was about the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did they wo – di – did they ever have conversations with you and your brother about life outside, about being careful, about possibly being attacked, or pi – ki – how kids – how you should react if kids call you names or things?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Not that much.</span> <span id="s391">I mean, it didn’t happen that often, and I – it may have been discussed, but I don’t have any – any real good recollections that I can give you.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s393">Would your family –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: But I think they were a little concerned about my being in a – in a school with so few Jewish children.</span> <span id="s395">And of course, I noticed the discrimination not from the children, but from the higher ups, immediate – very, very – very quickly.</span> <span id="s396">I was a pretty good soccer player, and was what you would call now a striker.</span> <span id="s397">And together with the center, whose name was Krempel(ph), I happen to remember his name, we scored a lot of goals.</span> <span id="s398">And one day my – the coach came to me and said, you can no longer play on the line, I’m gonna put you in the goal, because you’re not going to be playing in the interschool game, because you’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s399">And then I played goal for a while, and then I was out altogether.</span> <span id="s400">And the other time I was very uncomfortable is, they taught religion in school.</span> <span id="s401">So couple times I went along with – for – with the Catholic class, because I’d – I was embarrassed to drop out.</span> <span id="s402">And then th-the – our synagogue, the [indecipherable] in German it’s called liberale Gemeinde, a liberal exa – which is what – here – here would be called Conservative.</span> <span id="s403">We were members of that, and the religion teacher, also the cantor, is Herr Kappel(ph) would come to the high school, to the gymnasium and with the two or three of us, would have a master key, and look for an empty classroom, and give us religious classes.</span> <span id="s404">So that was a little uncomfortable being different from the rest of the – the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Were the classes at the – I mean, was it very visible and – and obvious when you would go for those religion classes, or were they held at the same time as –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: They were held at the same time and it was probably not that obvious, but I fel – I wa self-conscious about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: And probably other kids were too.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: But – and then I – I also did some track in – in gym and – and so forth, and running, and I was pretty good at that.</span> <span id="s411">I really worked hard at athletics, cause I felt I would be better – better off if I’m strong and – and athletic than if I were a weakling and bookish and –</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And wouldn’t be able to defend yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And – right, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: We belonged to a – since we couldn’t belong to the – to the re-regular ones, there was a Jewish athletic group called Schild Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Schild Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Also, the area [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s418">This was a very conservative Jewish group that were proud of the fact that they, or relatives had been front line soldiers in the first World War.</span> <span id="s419">And they ran this shi – this sports organization, where we did a lot of athletics ranging from Ping Pong to soccer to handball.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t know the – you know the German handball.</span> <span id="s421">It’s like soccer except you – you dribble the ball and throw it at the goal.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: And we – that was a great activity that most of us enjoyed very much.</span> <span id="s424">The Germans also had called – had something called an alliystoms(ph) medalia(ph), where you – you have to – it’s like a decathlon or something.</span> <span id="s425">You have to do – swim certain distance in certain time, you have ride your bike, you have to do all kinds of –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Measureable.</span> <span id="s427">Things that are –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Measure – measureable things that have certain minimum you have to do, and if you do them all, then you get a medal.</span> <span id="s429">And when the Jews couldn’t get that, so we had our own.</span> <span id="s430">Exactly with exactly the same metrics.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: But it sou – it sounds, you know, for – when you mentioned who was running this schild verein(ph), th-the youth orga – the Jewish sports organization –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: That it’s – it sounds very bittersweet, actually, in that if they were very proud of having been soldiers in World War I –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: – that that patriotism didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Didn’t matter wi – di – in fact, those people were probably the ones that are most likely to die because they thought they – they don’t mean us.</span> <span id="s437">We’re the – we’re the patriotic Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Happened to be of Jewish faith, but they were totally wrong.</span> <span id="s440">And of course, people who were only part Jewish were also very insecure, cause they had no belonging.</span> <span id="s441">My parents were never very religious, but when Hitler came, they became – I should say, I don’t know whether to say more religious, but more belonging.</span> <span id="s442">In other words, they went to the synagogue more and wanted to be part of the congregation.</span> <span id="s443">They felt a need for this, because of the persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: A sense of community.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s446">A sense of community, exactly, because of the persecution there.</span> <span id="s447">They had that basis, and I think that was very helpful, and it was people who were – didn’t have that who committed suicide, and who – who were very depressed, and – and had real problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you know any families –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Not that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: – that were mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did you know of any families that were mixed?</span> <span id="s453">That is –</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, we knew some families who were mixed, and – but I don’t – I can’t remember any names, but my parents had friends who were one – one party was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s455">And – and of course, people who were part Jewish, who had one Jewish parents, w-we knew some.</span> <span id="s456">My par – most – as I remember, my – most of my parents’ friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s457">I think they may have had some – well, they certainly had some – some Gentile friends on vacation in – in ca – Saint Moritz, all his friends were non-Jewish, and – most of them, most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s459">Were they like business partners, or they w-would have been people he knew from school, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: No, just – or – in – in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: They were people that you just met at the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s464">I see.</span> <span id="s465">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, there was a Dutch lady that I may come back to, because she helped him get out of Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: That will be interesting to –</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: – that he met every winter.</span> <span id="s469">There were a family, Zimmerman, who were not Jewish, but that’s a name that can be either.</span> <span id="s470">There was a – there was a family from Italy, I believe they were Jewish, but they – they – I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s471">But they – they made a lot of friends there, or my dad did and my – as I said, my mother went with her sisters.</span> <span id="s472">I don’t – and I was never with her, so I don’t know what kind of friends they made there.</span> <span id="s473">But my father had many friends there, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s474">And when I went with him, I went through my religious stage.</span> <span id="s475">I was 12 years old and wanted to be a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: And so I made a move to the Jewish kosher hotel, called the Hotel Edelweiss in Saint Moritz-Bad.</span> <span id="s478">And we had a very good time there, and that’s where I really learned how to ski.</span> <span id="s479">We took some more lessons.</span> <span id="s480">My dad and I skied together and I took some lessons.</span> <span id="s481">Learned to Christie into the hill, and it became a real passion with me, although I never skied again from the time we left Germany, twel – until – from ni-nine – from 1938 to 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: So the best years of my life in hi – you know, college – high school and college, graduate school, I did not ski, no-not really.</span> <span id="s484">So we took it up again when my oldest son was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: And we began again, and of course I had the liking of it and the – and no fear of it, so it –</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: So it helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: – it, very quickly –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: – and then since then we’ve been skiing some every winter until about three years ago when I more or less gave it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Well, that’s pretty impressive.</span> <span id="s492">That’s pretty impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: It was a real – a real [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: It was a real passion, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah, a real passion.</span> <span id="s496">I’ll come to my other passion later.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: My wife of almost 67 years I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s499">Well, we’ll come back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: So we es – we had a pretty good youth with – between the vacation – we had summer vacations too, we went to Kennorka(ph) and Bru-Bruges, Wuja(ph) in –</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Mm-hm, Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: – Belgium.</span> <span id="s504">We went to Santfort in – in Holland.</span> <span id="s505">Most of our vacations were outside of Germany and I think the – the fact that they wanted to leave money there was certainly a part of the reason.</span> <span id="s506">I did go to some kinderheims in Germany, but these were just –</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: – like a few weeks in – in the summer, and only for recreation, not for health reasons.</span> <span id="s509">One was in Oberowler(ph), I don’t even know where that is any more, and the other was in the Schwarzwald in Bad Dürrheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s511">The ones that you went to for health reasons, the kinderheim, you mentioned the first time you were seven years old.</span> <span id="s512">Would that have been your first year in school, in regular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yeah, well, second year.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Second year.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So you missed a lot of schooling that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s518">I never –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: And the – and the following year as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: I never thought of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s522">No, no, no, it’s just –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: – I wonder, you know, whether it –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Probably was some Christmas vacation, but I don’t – but I probably did, yes, yeah, I – I – unless I went earlier, before I went to school, but I – th – my recollection is that I was at least six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s526">Yes, I think you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: But I didn’t have a problem.</span> <span id="s529">At least I can’t remember any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s531">Or if there was one it long go – it’s long gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh yes, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: So my – my Volksschule was called the Hebbleschule(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Hebbleschule(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: I don’t know who Mr. Hebble(ph) was, but the Hebbleschule(ph) I was there for four years, and then I went onto the gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did you always feel different?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Did I al-always?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Feel different.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Feel different?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Or, did you not feel different at all, and it was other people who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I didn’t feel different at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s545">I – di-didn’t even occur to me until people started to –</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: – call me names or attack me or – or – or things happened that we’re not allowed to do.</span> <span id="s548">But I never felt different.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Did anybody come to your defense when you were attacked, either verbally –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: As I said, there was this gentleman with a cane –</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: A gentleman with a cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: – who – who shooed them away.</span> <span id="s553">I don’t remember whether any kids came – tried to come to my defe-defense.</span> <span id="s554">I don’t remember that too clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: How did the teachers behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: The teachers in general were very good to us, surprisingly.</span> <span id="s557">I mean, I had some very courageous teachers.</span> <span id="s558">In – in the Hebbleschule(ph) I had a mi – a – had Cantrow, c-a-n-t-r-o-w, who was an extremely fine human being.</span> <span id="s559">When I went back to Wiesbaden as an adult American, he had passed away.</span> <span id="s560">But his wife knew me.</span> <span id="s561">I cannot understand that.</span> <span id="s562">She knew immediately who I was.</span> <span id="s563">So apparently he took a special interest in us Jewish kids because of what was happening, or beginning to happen.</span> <span id="s564">And then I pa – went to this gymnasium in ray – the Gutenberg gymnasium.</span> <span id="s565">And there too, I had a history professor, or teacher [indecipherable] Herr Wesling(ph) who lived in our apartment house and was obviously very anti-Nazi, and every time he had a cold and was out for a day, I thought he was in a concentration camp, because he spoke up with incredible courage.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What are – what he – what are the things that he would say?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: He would say nasty things about the Nazis and about the axis, and made fun of the fact that the Japanese are not Aryans.</span> <span id="s568">He would – you know, you had to say heil Hitler at the beginning of every class.</span> <span id="s569">He would [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s570">Whereas some of the others would stand straight and make sure that nobody’s moving and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: – stick out their arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Did you have to do that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I never knew what to do.</span> <span id="s575">I f – I mean, I was damned if I did and damned if I – if I didn’t, so I usually di-did, because I didn’t know which was –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Well, you know, at that point you’re not –</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: – you’re in the powerless position.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: It was a – it was very – this was very difficult for – luckily nobody said anything, but I was worried that somebody would say, how come you, Jewboy, do this, you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: – desecrating the Deutsche kreuz.</span> <span id="s582">Didn’t happen, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: – fortunately.</span> <span id="s585">But it could’ve.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Were there any teachers who were not particularly sympathetic?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I’m sure there were, but I didn’t have any myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: But of course we’re – what did happen at that time, and it’s all – totally su – totally su-surprising now to anybody I tell it to, is that pe – that kids got hit, sometimes for really stupid reasons.</span> <span id="s590">I was actually a pretty hi – well – well behaved child, but I got hit with a bamboo stick on my rear end because of bad handwriting.</span> <span id="s591">If – if my essay or whatever, composition was written in bad handwriting, it w – I would get a – an – a grade – sometimes a good grade, but it was in red.</span> <span id="s592">And if it was in red, they had to come up and bend over and get two or three s – strokes with a bamboo stick.</span> <span id="s593">I mean, ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: The connection bet –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: It didn’t improve my handwriting one bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Di – was that meted out to everybody, that if you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Well, everybody had – I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Who had bad handwriting.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: – any – was other reasons for – for hitting kids.</span> <span id="s600">And – and there was one teacher who hit ki-kids wi-with this – with the stick across the hand.</span> <span id="s601">That was very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I didn’t have him, but my – my friend Vanna(ph) Kahn(ph), Warren –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: – he got some of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: But, the craziest times, from that point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: I want to go back a little bit, circle back and ask something I didn’t before.</span> <span id="s609">And that is, I’d like you to tell me a little bit about your parents’ personalities.</span> <span id="s610">Your father’s personality, his – whether he was open or gregarious, or more reti – reticent, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Okay, my – my father was extremely gre-gregarious and outgoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s613">A: He had a wonderful personality, and that’s why he was a very good salesman, and was able to start a totally different business in this country and do well.</span> <span id="s614">He was in the lighting business when he came over here, which he knew nothing about.</span> <span id="s615">But he had such a great personality that everybody liked him and bought from him.</span> <span id="s616">And he – he was very outgoing and very – loved people.</span> <span id="s617">My mother was more – also had a very nice personality, but she was much more reserved – while he was around especially, she kind of took the background, as was customary in German society.</span> <span id="s618">And once he passed away, she just kind of came out of her shell and became much more outgoing and more enterprising, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: That’s already here, in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: That was already here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s622">Who was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: But they – they ha – they were very lovely people, and I think Irene will second that.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s625">Irene is your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: My wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s628">What were their – what were the things that were important to them?</span> <span id="s629">In other words, what kind of values did they hold that – that you could observe and then also choose to either make your own, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: It’s – it’s a hard question to answer.</span> <span id="s631">I think they had very good values, as I mentioned before, they don’t – didn’t have a lot of formal education, but they really acted as though they were highly educated people.</span> <span id="s632">They read a lot, th – education was a number one issue.</span> <span id="s633">And especially for my dad, vacations were very important.</span> <span id="s634">He felt that was a very important part of life, and also he had so-some health problems.</span> <span id="s635">Lot of lower back pain, high blood pressure and so he felt he needed a vacation also for health reasons, but he loved vacations; whether it was skiing or whether it was in the summer, hiking, he loved go – an-and I kind of inhe – inherited that.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Well, that’s a good thing, because you know, here in our society, people say we don’t have enough balance in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s638">We’ve always, my family, Irene and I and our kids have always had wonderful vacations together.</span> <span id="s639">Of course now it’s – becomes much more difficult to go as a family, but we still try to – to travel when we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Were they – you mentioned that they were worried when all of these things were happening, when Hitler came to power, when his business were – was affected.</span> <span id="s641">And you mentioned also that other people fell into a depression, and some others would commit suicide because of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well this is really more hearsay than – than –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: – than personal experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s646">How did your parents handle these types of stresses in their pers – were they basically optimistic people?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yes, I would – I would say that.</span> <span id="s648">They were – they were optimistic people and that’s why I wanted to come back to it, why did we leave so late?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: My parents were very, very attached to their parents and very family oriented.</span> <span id="s651">That’s another ver – very important value.</span> <span id="s652">And my grandfather said point blank, we were born here, we’re gonna die here, we’re not going anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: This is your mother’s father, or your father’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Both of them.</span> <span id="s657">And they were not gonna leave them.</span> <span id="s658">Now, as I mentioned, my dad was fa-farsighted enough to [indecipherable] money, to – I’m sorry, to – to move out money to other countries to have something when he left.</span> <span id="s659">But he also, in 1936, made a orientierungsreise, an orientation trip to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Oh, did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: And visited our cousin, who had been writing letters since about ’33, why don’t you take my affidavit an-and come over here?</span> <span id="s662">And he visited her and looked around, and wanted to see what could do in – in a new country, with a new language, with a new culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Where did she live?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: She lived in Cleveland, Ohio, where we ended up.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: And a lovely lady – we were – our lives were really saved by the fact that my grandmother’s brother had enough sense to leave Germany in the late 19 hund – 1800s, move to the United States, and this was his daughter, who – a very generous, lovely lady who gave affidavits to something like 15 relatives.</span> <span id="s667">And you know, if any of them had been bad apples, she could have been in serious trouble.</span> <span id="s668">She was well-off, she had no children and [indecipherable] husband, and she had good – good positions.</span> <span id="s669">And she was well-off, but she was not really wealthy, and so this is an hero – courageous thing to do.</span> <span id="s670">But my dad came over here and then came back and we still didn’t leave.</span> <span id="s671">That was like two years before we actually left.</span> <span id="s672">And finally in – round that time – and I was like 12 years old, and my moth – and you – you – you – you get – you mature fast under these circumstance, and my mother and I sat my dad down and said look, Papa, why don’t you apply for a visa, you have – you have also an affidavit.</span> <span id="s673">You can always let it –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Expire.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Expire.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: And he finally did.</span> <span id="s678">And my – both my grandfather’s then passed away during – during the – actually during those years, ’36 - ’37, in their 70s.</span> <span id="s679">And my grandmothers immediately said, we’re going.</span> <span id="s680">If we – if we’re going anywhe – if we – if you’re going anywhere, we’re coming.</span> <span id="s681">And at that point, ma – we got – we got notified in 1938 that we were getting a visa, if we passed the physical examination at the American consulate in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s682">And on November seventh, two days before Kristallnacht, we got our American visa.</span> <span id="s683">And that was – we took – my br – and at – the people who were on that visa, as far as I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: – were my brother and I, my parents and my paternal grandmother, Fanny S-Simon.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: My aunt, my mother’s sister and her husband, Elsa and Gustav Natan(ph) – Elsa and Gustav – Gus Na-Nathan, and their daughters, Charlotta and Mariana, they took along my maternal grandmother, Amindia(ph) Meyer, and they came separately, on a separate visa, and I don’t remember exactly what year, I – they may have even been a little later than us.</span> <span id="s688">I don’t remember exactly the – the circumstance of their emigration and where – whether they stop wher – somewhere else first, and – but you can find that out from my cousin –</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: – in Cleveland, who still survives, Marian.</span> <span id="s691">So, one other thing that I didn’t mention, and maybe I should, my – I told you my paternal grandparents lived in nav – in the little town of Gensingen –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: – and things were getting very rough in small towns.</span> <span id="s694">People throwing rocks through the windows –</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: All this we should talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: – and – and putting – and si – and painting signs on th – on – on the walls, but nobody knew who it was.</span> <span id="s697">But my parents finally found a si – a – an apartment on a very same street, Rudis(ph) Hammerstrasse fünf.</span> <span id="s698">We were 14, and it – they were five, and they moved my paternal grandparents to Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So that had been happening to their house as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes, it did, it did.</span> <span id="s701">And the – that’s finally what scared my dad enough to –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: To move them.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: – to insist that they move.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: And then they lived across the street from us, practically, and that, of course, very, very pleasant for us children to visit.</span> <span id="s706">Although we enjoyed ka – going to Gensingen wa – to that lovely house with the stable and a cow in the back and a yard where we used to do searches for our Easter eggs at Easter time.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So, when – when people were talking of leaving, was it a sense of a temporary move, or was this a se – that is, we’ll move until that Hitler, you know, that – that fool Hitler gets, well, voted out of office, and then we’ll come back.</span> <span id="s708">Or was it a sense of, we’re really leaving, and we’re not coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: When – when we were still in Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: – when we still in Wiesbaden, I think there was a sense – although I think it was a rationalization that it might be temporary, but became more and more evident that it wasn’t so temp – temporary and that it was extremely dangerous, although nobody thought about a – a systematic killing.</span> <span id="s712">I’m – if anybody says that, I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s713">I mean, it just simply not something that people imagined, and in ik – so-called civilized country.</span> <span id="s714">But once we’re ready to go, and by that time, I – we had some experiences which I haven’t come around to yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I think we knew it was permanent, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: But that’s a very important –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: It certainly was permanent to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I mean, I didn’t expect that we would come back, except to visit maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: But we – so let me tell you a little bit about our –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Right, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: – the time when we – so we, as I mentioned, I was still in the gymnasium on November 10th, the day after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: My – I wa – we were lucky, nobody came and – in-into our apartment.</span> <span id="s727">That’s the advantage of a bigger city, there’s so many of us, and in – in apartment houses where the – you’re not quite sure where people live and – I mean, people did get, some of – but it was a little bit safer than in a smaller town.</span> <span id="s728">But my grandmother and my grandfather – well, by that time my grandfather was dead.</span> <span id="s729">My grandmother in Bingen –</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: – she had all her – her glasses and gristal – crystal-wear and dishes destroyed.</span> <span id="s732">Th-They had a real attack on her house.</span> <span id="s733">And – so we didn’t have that, but the following morning, when I was in school, one of my classmates said, Eric, did you know the synagogue’s on fire?</span> <span id="s734">I said, what?</span> <span id="s735">I did – I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s736">It’s – first of all, it’s a berg – huge stone structure, I didn’t even think it would burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: And I thought he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Pulling your leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: – crazy, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: So, then I discovered, when – when school was over, my mother was at the door picking me up.</span> <span id="s743">My dad’s ca – had the – the car there, and my mother said, come with me.</span> <span id="s744">I – of course, I was upset that a big boy of 14 years old we – picked up from school, and I had no idea what was going on, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: – and so I went to the car.</span> <span id="s747">And it turns out my dad didn’t want to go home because he had heard of friends being picked up by the Gestapo and put in concentration camps that day.</span> <span id="s748">They picked up many, many able-bodied Jewish men.</span> <span id="s749">They did – they left the women and children still alone at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: But the men were picked up and put in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: What I want to – excuse me, I know you have a train of thought, but it – I – I want to ask you before, did you know of people disappearing before Kristallnacht, of somebody being arrested –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s754">I mean, people were arrested for all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s755">We had, for instance, a friend who – who was arrested and put in concentration camp for rassenschande, which is, he was dating – he was supposed to be dating a Christian woman, or maybe he was married to a Christian woman, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s756">You know, this was a – a doctor friend, if I remember correctly, who was put in a concentration camp because he was seen with a Christian woman.</span> <span id="s757">Now, they finally let him go, but he was pretty emaciated, and ill when he got out.</span> <span id="s758">Now absolutely, there were people arrested for all kinds of reasons, or – or drummed up reasons.</span> <span id="s759">And some were let go, and some were not so fortunate.</span> <span id="s760">So the question of ca – disappearing to c – to concentration camps, that was already going around for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s762">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Fortunately in our town, we didn’t see too many people just kind of beaten up or – or shot in the street.</span> <span id="s764">That went on in some cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So you didn’t s –</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Although on Kristallnacht I understand that happened, although I didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So tell me, where were you and your family on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s768">How did – how –</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Well, that’s it, I mean I – my mother picked me up in school – I mean, not during the night, I – during the next day, the 10th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Yes, well, that night – that night is what I’m asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: That night we were in our apartment, nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s772">We were lucky, we were not one of the ones that were –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And you didn’t hear people in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: – attacked in the pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: You didn’t hear people in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, we didn’t know anything that was going on until I was picked up from school by my – by my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: By your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: And then we drove around Wiesbaden because my dad was afraid to go home, he thought he would be picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Finally, my mother and I said this – you can’t keep doing this, because th-they probably know your license plate, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s783">So we hit upon the idea, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Where was your brother – excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: My brother?</span> <span id="s786">That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s787">I think – he went to a Jewish school –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: – and he may have been in school that day.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s791">Him – he – you can ask him.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: But I – I really don’t remember wa – he wa – he wasn’t in the car, that I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: We had [indecipherable] a very good friend of ours, Mr. Fritz Steckelmacher(ph) was a British citizen.</span> <span id="s796">He had worked in a bri – he was a banker for Deutsche Bank, but he had worked for several years, much earlier I think, just after World War I or something, in England, and long enough to be – to get British citizenship.</span> <span id="s797">And we felt that the Germans were still legalistic enough to maybe leave a British citizen –</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: – alone.</span> <span id="s800">At least not to search him in – without a warrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: He is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: He was Jewish, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And hif – his father was a famous rabbi and writer – author in Mannheim.</span> <span id="s805">Anyway, the – my dad hid out at a – of course first, oh, he doesn’t want to make any kind of umstände mache.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s807">Inconvenience anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: But he hid out at his house, and he had dogs, and the dog could give him away too, that – another problem.</span> <span id="s809">But he hid out in his house for about four or five days.</span> <span id="s810">At that point, he did not fail – feel very comfortable there.</span> <span id="s811">I mean, he was worried that somebody would come.</span> <span id="s812">And we got this lovely lady, Miss Schraeder(ph) from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s813">Blonde, Aryan looking.</span> <span id="s814">The wife of the com – police commissioner of Amsterdam, who was his friend from Saint Moritz, who came to Wiesbaden, stayed with us a couple of days, and then took him to the train station, chattering loudly in Dutch.</span> <span id="s815">And she got on the train, kissed him goodbye and then he jumped on, and she jumped off, because they were arresting Jews at the train station that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: And he managed to get across the border to – to Amsterdam and to – to Holland.</span> <span id="s818">And a day after he got there, the Gestapo came to the house, two as – two or three people, searched the house from top to bottom.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: You were at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: And my – we were home.</span> <span id="s821">My mother actually locked my brother and me into the bedroom because there were – she was worried were close enough to puberty to –</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: – count as men.</span> <span id="s824">And my mother at that time had incredible courage.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, she really talked – one guy came at 11 o’clock at night, and she’s, what kind of business is it, come to woman who’s alone at 11 o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: And – and had the guy apologizing.</span> <span id="s828">But basically they – they searched the house, and finally she said, why don’t you call the telephone [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: – telephone office, and you’ll fi – you’ll see that he ki – he called me, and he is in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s831">And finally they did that.</span> <span id="s832">And they stole the car.</span> <span id="s833">They stole the typewriters out of the office, too-took whatever wasn’t attached.</span> <span id="s834">Told my mother, you have a month to pack up what you want to take, and get you and your children out of here.</span> <span id="s835">And since we had the americ – they – since we had the American visa, they’re willing to just let us go.</span> <span id="s836">And at that time, the-these things are so gradual, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Incremental, in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Right, a-at that – at that time they left women and children alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: That didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s841">So basically we – that was on the 12th or the 13th of November, and we left about the 10th of December for – for Holland, reunited with our dad.</span> <span id="s842">And took the boat S-Statendam, in the Holland America line –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Before –</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: – to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Okay, before we get to that, when you left Germany, did you leave all your belongings?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: We left everything except a lift van full of some furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: And some clothes.</span> <span id="s849">But all money had to be left.</span> <span id="s850">They give you like a hundred dollars or something, I don’t know, you can take with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: So whatever – whatever liquid assets you had in Germany, you lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: We lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: That’s why my parents took first class tickets on the boat.</span> <span id="s855">They couldn’t – they couldn’t use the money anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s857">Had they bought those tickets before?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: They bought the tickets earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Before they –</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I mean, my mother bought them when – when she knew that they were – that we were going to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Leave.</span> <span id="s863">And they a – almost lost it because on kri – on Kristallnacht, they plundered this –</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Travel agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: – travel agency, and luckily he had – had them in a safe, and he still had our tickets, but my mother was plenty worried that they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: I can imagine.</span> <span id="s867">All right, the point is I can’t imagine, but – but wou – di – one question I wanted to make sure; did you live in a mixed neighborhood?</span> <span id="s868">That is –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Okay, so it wasn’t just known as a Jüdisches [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No, not at all –</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: – or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: – not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: It was a very mixed neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Okay, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I mean, most of the people in our building that ow – my dad owned, were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s878">There were very few Jews.</span> <span id="s879">In fact, I don’t remember any.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: No – yes, the ti – Hannah Natan(ph), a friend of ours called Nathan, not – not related to our Nathan, and she was married to Herr Forte(ph) and they lived in our building.</span> <span id="s882">I think they’re the only Jewish family that I remember living in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: And so that means that the con – the real estate, had that already been confiscated, the building itself, or is it – you lost that when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Lost that when we left.</span> <span id="s885">My father lost – lost another – I think another – wa – something called [speaks German], which is some kind of mill and – and warehouse, and he lost the apartment building, and later on got some restitution.</span> <span id="s886">But that’s another story that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: He didn’t get a whole lot because it turned out that – they claimed that there was a – what are these insects that eat wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Termites.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yeah, termites, which were not true, and there were all kinds of things said about that house, so he got the very minimal amount for it, but he got something for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: You’re talking about the apartment house?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So, it had been made of wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Was it built from wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s897">The whole thing was nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s899">So le-le-let’s go – we’re – we’re jumping a bit, but let’s go to that – that section.</span> <span id="s900">We’re talking now after the war.</span> <span id="s901">When did – when – what was the process of trying to get some sort of restitu – you know, recompense?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: That dragged out oda – over years.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: When did it start?</span> <span id="s904">When did – when did he find in –</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Probably in the 50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: And I really don’t recall.</span> <span id="s908">I don’t have a really good sense of the years.</span> <span id="s909">But my parents, as I said, got some restitution for the apartment house they shared with my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s910">And I think for some other things.</span> <span id="s911">I wanted to get – get restitution for interruption of education.</span> <span id="s912">Now, I didn’t have a lot of interruption, but I did have interruption.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: And most of my friends, including my brother, got the restitution.</span> <span id="s915">It was like a thousand marks or 2,000 marks.</span> <span id="s916">And I got a letter from Wiesbaden saying I should be grateful that I was Jewish, otherwise I would end up in the German army, and who knows where I would be.</span> <span id="s917">And besides, I have a PhD degree.</span> <span id="s918">What am I complaining about?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: So I went to court, and lost.</span> <span id="s921">And once you lose in the local court, you have to go to a court of appeals, where you have to pay a percentage, or a – actually have to pay a – not a percentage, you have to pay a fee to the lawyer, and even the lawyer said, don’t gamble 20 percent of what you might get, for the fact that you might get, because you might not get it.</span> <span id="s922">And so we gave it up.</span> <span id="s923">And then when – when – when the people who got the restitution for the interruption of education got a second round – of course, I didn’t get the second round, because I didn’t get the first round.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: But that wasn’t too serious because it really wasn’t a huge amount of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: No, it’s the point of the thing, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: But the point is that – that whole premise that I should be –</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: – write a thank you note to Hitler or something because I wasn’t drafted into the German army, were sort of ridiculous, but the re –</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: I can’t imagine you –</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: – the courts held that.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s933">I can’t imagine that somebody would have had the audacity in the postwar years to write that.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well, you know – what apparently happened is that the Wiesbaden court, or – or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Authority?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: – government –</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: – was very generous for a while, and suddenly realized they were being too generous and they kind of had a backlash and g-got – got the other way.</span> <span id="s939">But the fact that the judges would write a stupid thing like that, i-is really hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And this took place th – in which decade?</span> <span id="s941">When, you know, that process happened, where you got rejected for your restitution claim?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: That whi – whi – while I was in – already – I already had, I think finished my education here, and had a PhD in chemistry.</span> <span id="s943">So I had a good education, but I s – I said anything, which was true, that I had thought about going to medical school, and that I couldn’t do, and well, I mean, it wasn’t – I didn’t do because of a change in country, and they didn’t pay any attention to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Especially since, I think, a PhD in – in Germany the PhD is considered somewa – somewhat higher than a – than an MD.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: I know, I know, it’s that, Herr doctor, doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: System.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: And Frau doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Frau doctor, yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s951">So this must have been in the 60s or 70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Ah, yes, yeah, 60s, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: It must have been a –</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: It may have started a little earlier, but I – I can’t be sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s958">The – the Dutch lady who came to kind of escort your father out of danger, when you said goodbye to him, was that something that you remember, or was it, oh, we’ll see you soon in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Well, I didn’t go to the – to the station with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I mean, we said goodbye at home –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: – but I – we felt pretty confident that we would be reunited pretty soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Since we had this one month – well, at that time we didn’t know that, but I don’t remember be-being too upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s967">And – and wh-what’s more, you had both affidavits and visas, which a lot of other people did not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s969">In fact, at that time, and – D-Dutch did not leave – let Jewish people without visas to go somewhere else into the country.</span> <span id="s970">He would not have been able to get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s972">So tell me a little bit about the trip when you left your home.</span> <span id="s973">Do you remember what it was like to close the door for the last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I – I remember being excited about traveling and probably not so upset about leaving –</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: – my home, because of all the – what wa – that was going on, and looking forward to seeing my dad, and looking forward to having a boat trip, and there was so much going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Did you by train or by car to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I think we went by train.</span> <span id="s981">Yeah, oh yeah, definitely went by train.</span> <span id="s982">My mother didn’t have her license, didn’t drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: In fact, my dad didn’t have a license until probably in the mid se – se – or late 30s, because he had a chauffeur for a good deal of his adult life, until he couldn’t either afford, or have it any more, and then he finally learned how to drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: What kind of car was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: He – he drove a number of cars, he drove an Audi, he drove Mercedes Benz and he drove, I think, an Adler, which was a car that hadn't exist in a long time.</span> <span id="s987">I had a Adler bicycle, with three gears.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: At that time, that was huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s991">So the car that was confiscated, which one – which one of those –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: I think it was a Mercedes Benz, but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s998">The time when you were driving around, when your mother picked you up from school, and your father didn’t want to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: No, no, my father wa – picked – picked – I mean, my father drove, my da – my – my mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: – my mother never drove, actually, she – she got a license in this country, but she used it for cashing checks.</span> <span id="s1002">She never –</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1004">So I mean – I misspoke.</span> <span id="s1005">What I meant is, you were picked up from school by your mom, but your father was driving around in the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Yeah, he was sitting in the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1009">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: What did you see in the streets?</span> <span id="s1011">This is what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1012">If you were driving around Wiesbaden, did you see damage in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: No, I actually did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: It was mostly in the homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: There was not much going on in the street.</span> <span id="s1018">I didn’t even see the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1019">I mean, we – we didn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1021">In –</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: So I didn’t know about the fire until I – until much later – I mean, I knew it was – that it had burned, but I didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1024">In the month that you were there, after your father had gone, did you have contact with other people from the community, and discussions with them, or were you able to gauge –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Certainly with our relatives, I think we had discussion.</span> <span id="s1026">I don’t remember what friends we had discussions with.</span> <span id="s1027">I mean, many of our friends had left, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Like this wa – Vanna(ph) Kahn(ph), Warren Kahn(ph)?</span> <span id="s1030">His family had already emigrated, I think they left about ’36 - ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: And another very close friend, Heiner(ph) Stend(ph), or Henry Stern, he left also, much earlier than his fa – well, he wa – he went with the Kindertransport to the United States.</span> <span id="s1033">And a funny thing is that when we arrived in Cleveland, Ohio, it turned out we were closer – Henry and I lived closer together than we did in Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Oh, isn’t that funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I mean, could have gone anywhere in the United States, he went to a very wealthy man called Sam Wise(ph), head of – head of a big paint company, Albro(ph) Paint, and lived with them for a while until his parents were able to get – get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1036">And we were only a few blocks apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: When you got to Amsterdam, how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Only a few days, I don’t remember exactly, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: – a few days and then we – on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: You sailed from when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: – 13th or 14th December, we took the shi – th-the boat from Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s1043">And we, being December, we got into lots of storms, and I remember distinctly we were – there was an SOS apparently from the Queen Mary.</span> <span id="s1044">And so we were supposed to go to their aid.</span> <span id="s1045">By the time we got close to the Queen Mary, everything had been taken care of and they were okay.</span> <span id="s1046">But it was so stormy that most people in the boat were so seasick that they didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1047">My dad and I – for some reason I’m not subject to motion sickness, and we were often the only people in the dining room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: My mother, my grandmother and my brother were all sick.</span> <span id="s1050">But – and I infuriated my father, and this is a totally minor nonsense-sensical comment, but I ate spaghetti every night at dinner when I could have had filet mignon and lobster, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: First class tickets, great food –</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: – and you want spaghetti.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: So that’s what – that’s what sticks in your memory from the trip over –</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: – the storms and the spaghetti.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Yeah, and occasionally, when the things died down, playing a little Ping Pong.</span> <span id="s1059">And I remember seeing my first two American mu – movies, and I remember to this day what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: What were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Walt Disney’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” and “Love Finds Andy Hardy.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did you understand them?</span> <span id="s1063">Was your English strong enough to understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I think I understood part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: My – I had English in school for one semester or two, and my da – my parents gave me some private lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: But, my English was very weak, to say the least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1070">But interesting that that’s what – that you remember that, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: – th-those movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah, oh yeah, and a – it’s funny, but I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1075">Well, it’s interesting with “Snow White,” because there have been other people that I’ve spoken with who recall seeing “Snow White” in the theaters in Europe before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: It came out in the late 30s, and – and that makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: It’s funny, in th – in the – in the theaters in Wiesbaden, I saw – I don’t think I saw any American picture.</span> <span id="s1079">I think they were all German pictures that I saw, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: I have one more question, I forgot to ask.</span> <span id="s1081">You know, here we are in the Atlantic and we’re coming to the States –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: – and I thought I’d asked them all.</span> <span id="s1084">No.</span> <span id="s1085">I didn’t ask you about the news and the propaganda.</span> <span id="s1086">How much new – what newspapers did you read, and did you listen to the radio, and how – what was – what was going on, what kind of information would you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Well, I can answer it this way, we – we were at the Wiesbadener Tagblatt, that thing, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1088">We listened to the radio, and we tried to get British stations, which wasn’t always successful and I’m not sure that we cou – wouldn’t have been in trouble if it – we’d a been caught.</span> <span id="s1089">And the thing was very upsetting is the – the – “Der Stürmer,” the anti-Semitic newspaper was in boxes all over the – the streets of Wiesbaden, people standing in front of it, reading about those horrible creatures, the Jews, and all the misery they brought to Germany.</span> <span id="s1090">And that was really very upsetting.</span> <span id="s1091">And the history books in – I – I should add – in my school, they – they substituted all of the history books with Nazi edited –</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: – Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: – version.</span> <span id="s1094">On the – on the bottom of every page of the history book would say, Die Juden sind unser Unglück.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: The Jews are our un – un –</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Our misfortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: – our misfortune.</span> <span id="s1099">Every page.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And – and the stuff in there, I mean – luckily I had this wonderful history professor, this Dr. Wesling(ph), who didn’t really use it, and gave me a decent grade in – in the subject, even though I didn’t read this nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: So in other words, he was a history teacher, he’s give a text, and he puts it to the side and he just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Oh he – he had incredible courage, I don’t know what happened to him after we left, but – he was still okay, but – but he – he was one of the few who were really willing to open their mouth and speak up and that was not healthy at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1105">So I-I – this is the first I hear that there – that sentence would have been on every single test –</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Every page.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1108">And so what kind of – what kind of broadcasts would be over the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Well, we listened to news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I also listened to the – at three o’clock in the morning, the prize fight between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: It didn’t last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: But, you know, we tried to get information about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did you hear about the Olympics for example?</span> <span id="s1117">Do you remember hearing, or anything about the ’36 Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: You know, I don’t remember hearing much about it.</span> <span id="s1119">What I really remember is the Leni rieshen – Riefenstahl movie about the ’36 Olympics.</span> <span id="s1120">I saw that at least once or twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Fantastic black and white movie featuring Jesse Owens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: That was – I saw when I was in this country.</span> <span id="s1125">But I don’t remember what I did at the time.</span> <span id="s1126">I must have – I must have listened to some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1128">Yeah, I mean, certainly Jesse Owens being –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Just yeah, I mean – I – I seem to remember it, but I can’t remember how much I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: – I mean, from afterwards and from the movie, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: – how much I knew from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: – at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Did you hear Hitler’s over the radio?</span> <span id="s1137">Okay, but – [interruption] All right.</span> <span id="s1138">So, we were talk – did you hear Hitler’s speeches over the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I did, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: And do you remember anything about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: I – I even – and I – and of course saw the SR and the SS marching by.</span> <span id="s1142">I still know the Horst-Wessel song in German from beginning to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Do you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And of course, the words to Deutschland [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1145">I don’t know why I know – I remember this nonsense, but – but you know, you absorb all this when you’re there, and yes, we were pretty aware of some of the things that were going on, I mean, you couldn’t help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1147">Any particular speech in mind?</span> <span id="s1148">I mean, the – there were the rallies that were in Nuremberg –</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: No, I – what I remember very, very vividly is when Neville Chamberlain came to Munich, and appeased Hitler f – to peace in our time.</span> <span id="s1150">And I know, even I was only 12 years old, it was 1936, I was extremely upset.</span> <span id="s1151">I knew enough to know that that couldn’t be good.</span> <span id="s1152">And to be Jews in – in a country at war that doesn’t like you, I knew was worse than just being at war.</span> <span id="s1153">And I was at that time really, really worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: So [indecipherable] interest –</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: And discussed it, I’m sure, with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Disgusted as were your parents, is that what you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Hm?</span> <span id="s1160">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: You said you were disgusted?</span> <span id="s1162">Oh, you discussed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: I – we discussed it.</span> <span id="s1164">No, no, I discussed it with my parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: And the other thing I want to tell you, I was a – I was a very avid reader, but reader mostly of, you know, novels and one very – one of my favorite author was Karl May –</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: – who wrote about the American Indians and Indian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: – and cowboys.</span> <span id="s1171">And he was never here, but – but he – he wrote some very exciting stories and I read – they were 600 pages long and I read almost all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Well, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: And sometimes at night, when my parents wanted me to go to sleep, I had a little nightlight and I read in bed.</span> <span id="s1174">And I read, of course, some of the you – b-books for children, that are for young people, that I just loved.</span> <span id="s1175">[indecipherable] I don’t know if that means anything to you.</span> <span id="s1176">But an advertising contest that the kids were engaged in.</span> <span id="s1177">And Pe-Peter Maktasarenin(ph) what was about a people – children bu-building – racing cars and winning a race, and al-all kinds of fun stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Well, I remember that when I moved to Germany, people would find out I’m American and they’d talk about Karl May, and I had never heard of him, you know.</span> <span id="s1179">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No, I mean, he was really very popular with German kids of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1182">So, okay, so we talked a little bit about the overall media situation, and the newspapers that you mentioned, Frankfurter Allgemeine and Wiesbadener Tagblatt, were they more or less news oriented, or did politics and propaganda end up in their pages as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: I don’t have a clear recollection of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: But they were news ori – hopefully news oriented on the front page.</span> <span id="s1186">What – what they did on the editorial page, I don’t re – I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: But, I think they were still fairly straightforward at that time, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Because German journalists were under a great deal of pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Oh, enormous pressure, and I’m sure that as time went on that they wen – became more and more –</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: – propagandist.</span> <span id="s1193">But I don’t recall whether, you know, in ’36 or so, what things were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1195">So let’s go back to the boat.</span> <span id="s1196">Aside from the – the storms, the spaghetti, the movies, any other memories from traveling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: When the – when the weather was a little better, we would play Ping Pong on deck, and it – it was a fun trip.</span> <span id="s1198">I mean, I – they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1199">I enjoyed it enormously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Did your parents seem worried or relieved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: They seemed relieved.</span> <span id="s1202">They seemed relieved.</span> <span id="s1203">I’m sure they were worried about what they gonna do to make a living here, but they didn’t show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: And we had a really very good time.</span> <span id="s1206">When we arrived in New York, my dad immediately said, I’m not staying here.</span> <span id="s1207">I – life is too hard in – in this big city, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: – as he put it, too many refugees from many – from many countries.</span> <span id="s1210">And so where do we go?</span> <span id="s1211">It’s a huge country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: We went where we had a cousin, Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1214">Not to be any kind of – to get to – you know, to give her any kind of problems, but to – at least somebody we can ask a question if – if we’re not familiar with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: – what goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: She actually helped us find our first apartment, and we became very close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: My parents became very close.</span> <span id="s1221">My mother and Sophie, who – who lost her husband where – when we were there a very short time.</span> <span id="s1222">And – but sh – but she and my mother became very close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Did your parents speak English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: They actually became – they – they became very good at it.</span> <span id="s1227">They – I mean, they had a strong accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: But they spoke it very well.</span> <span id="s1230">Now, my dad also – you know, my parents also, I think, took some lessons, but how they picked it up so well, I don’t know, but we ca – of course spoke a lot of German at home, especially since my grandmother never learned it.</span> <span id="s1231">And in fact, Irene, when – when we got – when we got engaged, learned how to speak to my grandmother in – well, both grandmothers for that matter, in German – German Yiddish – Yiddish German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: And got along very well with both my parents and both my – my – my parents and my grandmothers.</span> <span id="s1234">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: So what was your li – how did – how did your life change, specifically –</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Well, I mean, it changed because it was a different culture.</span> <span id="s1237">I went to my first coed school.</span> <span id="s1238">When we arrived, very quickly we arrived in when, early January.</span> <span id="s1239">And then we were in New York, we arrived – we arrived in Hoboken on the boat, on the thir – 23rd or 24th of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: So th-the pier was at Hoboken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: The pier was at Hobo-Hoboken –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: – not Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: And stayed in New York a few days and then went to Cleveland about the fourth or fifth of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: So I went to school almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1248">But the 31st of January was graduation day, and I was in school in the – in a – in a junior high school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: – ninth grade, and my friend Henry Stern was there, and they were going to promote him in January, the fir – the mid-year, to the high school.</span> <span id="s1251">And the principal said he would like me to be there to learn some English before I went to the high school, and I said no, I want to go with my friend.</span> <span id="s1252">So after a short discussion, he said okay, Eric, I’m going to send you to high school, but this – you’re going on probation, and if because of your language difficulty you don’t make it, you’re coming back here.</span> <span id="s1253">I said yes, sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: And I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: You made it, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: And I had the chutzpah, and I think you know the – the – the term, when I got my report card at the end of the first semester, I had two As and a B and a C plus in English.</span> <span id="s1260">And I went up to my English teacher and I said, couldn’t you change that to a B minus?</span> <span id="s1261">What – what’s the difference between a C plus and a B minus so I can get on the honor roll?</span> <span id="s1262">And she sat me down and give me one lecture.</span> <span id="s1263">And I didn’t get the B plus, but it was the only time I wasn’t on the honor roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: And I had a very good experience in high school except I was very shy when it came to girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: As you can imagine that I’d never – I had no sisters and I didn’t have any classmates that were girls.</span> <span id="s1268">I didn’t know any girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: No cousins or anything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: What were American kids, compare – you know, you had gone from a German school in a – in a – in an totalitarian state –</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: – and all of a sudden you’re in American high school.</span> <span id="s1274">Was there – wasn’t there a culture shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Oh absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1276">I mean, it was totally different attitude, teachers were nice to you and tried to help you, and – instead of hitting you.</span> <span id="s1277">And – and no, I wou – it definitely was a culture shock.</span> <span id="s1278">And di – in general it was a very good experience.</span> <span id="s1279">My high school had a maybe – at that time maybe 20 percent Jewish student population.</span> <span id="s1280">And there was a little bit of cliquishness tha – there.</span> <span id="s1281">In other words, there were fraternity like groups.</span> <span id="s1282">I wouldn’t call it fraternity in high school, I don’t think there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: No, there aren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: I think the junior YMCA [indecipherable] or something, there were really no Jewish kids there, and there were no Jewish groups that sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Were there refugee – aside from your friend Howard Stern – Henry Stern, were there any refugee kids there, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Not many.</span> <span id="s1287">No, I – I think we were actually sort of stood out.</span> <span id="s1288">There were very few – I mean, in Cleveland Heights, who – who ga – what refugees went to Cleveland Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: No, we were pretty much celebrities in that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Celebrities ra-rather than, you know, high school kids can be pretty –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Well, I – curiosity –</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: – I don’t know if you would call it celebrities, but we were si – we were different, and – but a – people were nice to us, don’t get me wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: That’s what I was after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: We were not discriminated again – no, not at all, no.</span> <span id="s1297">But you know, as I said, we had a couple of Jewish cliques and some Christian cliques and that was a little bit – I – it didn’t bother me too much, but you know, it was something that bothered me a little.</span> <span id="s1298">But in general it was a very good experience, and in high school, had a wonderful chemistry teacher and he was largely responsible for me to – for m – for going on in – in c-college and graduate school, in – in chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: That’s what I wanted to ask, is that where your interests first became –</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: That’s where my interest developed, and then when I started to apply to colleges, it – World War II had started.</span> <span id="s1301">Well [indecipherable] in fact, let’s see, I didn’t go to college until 1944, so – I’m sorry, 1942, I graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s1302">But still, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: – the war – it was after Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: And the war was in – much in progress, in-including American participation.</span> <span id="s1307">And I discovered, or my parents discovered, I don’t know which, that if I went to Case Engineering School, Case School of Applied Science it was called then, and then later Case Institute of Technology, I would be deferred until I got my degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: And if got into Western Reserve and studied chemistry, I would get drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: You wouldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: You would get drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: And I would much rather have gone to Western Reserve, gotten a real, good, general education, beca – where they have much more in terms of history –</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: – and civics and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1316">But I went to – to Case because I thought it would be nice to get my bachelor’s degree before going in the army.</span> <span id="s1317">Not that I didn't want to go, I was very an – patriotic, but I thought it would be good to have a bachelor’s degree.</span> <span id="s1318">So I went to Case, even though I didn’t like engineering courses one bit.</span> <span id="s1319">But I li – I took what’s called the chemistry option of chemical engineering, the basic – more the more basic [indecipherable] option of chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s1320">And loved all my theoretical courses, I hated all my applied courses, but I did okay, and it was a bit of a – a pain, because – because of the draft and the situation with the war, we had to go on what’s called the rapid program; all summer –</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Oh, the wis –</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: – no vacations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: I see, so it was a comple –</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: And we me – did the four years, a bachelor degree, in two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: And because almost no offerings in – in the – the liberal arts, I took one cour – one – one semester I wanted to take psychology or – they didn’t have anything, that was full.</span> <span id="s1327">So I took one semester of Spanish and one – one year I took History of Western Civilization.</span> <span id="s1328">That was about the only non-science courses I ever got.</span> <span id="s1329">And many of the people were in the v – VA program, which is the navy reserves, and I couldn’t join that, I believe, because I wasn’t an American citizen then.</span> <span id="s1330">And – and we – we rushed through all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1331">And then ra – as soon as I got my bachelor’s degree, I was drafted.</span> <span id="s1332">And I’ll tell you about the army experience if you’re interested in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: – a little while, but I want to go back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: – and tell you about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Meeting your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: – meeting my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Oh, please do, please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Okay, so we’re gonna circle back a little bit, because this happens often.</span> <span id="s1343">Sometimes when we have an interview –</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: – that thoughts come up that weren’t mentioned while we were on topic.</span> <span id="s1346">And this is something about what happened with your father –</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: On the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: – as he was on the train from Wiesbaden to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1349">So this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: He had a very scary moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Okay, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: The passenger sharing his compartment seemed to be breaking into a sweat.</span> <span id="s1353">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Because he was in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: – when – when they got to the border, especially –</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: – when the customs officials came on.</span> <span id="s1358">And everything went okay, but once they got into Holland, he asked the man why he was sweating like that, and he said, well, he had wanted to bring some money out, so he pay – he – he pay – he’s – he glued it under the toilet seat, and if the Nazis had found that, not only would he have been in trouble, but since he probably wouldn’t have admitted it was him, every Jewish person in that – on that train might have been in trouble.</span> <span id="s1359">And my father really ha – really, really lashed into him and says, how can you do this?</span> <span id="s1360">I mean, now you jeopardize your own life, but everybody else on the train.</span> <span id="s1361">Luckily they didn’t ask a question –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: They didn’t find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: – didn’t find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1365">But it is – I-I’m glad you brought that up because it is a moment of – that tells a lot.</span> <span id="s1366">It tells a lot, you know, peop –</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Oh yeah, there were so many, you know, dangerous and horrifying moments, of course.</span> <span id="s1368">I mean, even though we were extremely lucky that we never end up in camps and we didn’t end up in gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1369">But we experienced some pretty –</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Sounds like close calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: But – well, coming back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Sure, coming back to America, and you regre – and you’re drafted.</span> <span id="s1375">So you finish in two and a half years and that means 1944 or ’45 now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Nineteen – I graduated in the summer of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Okay, so the war’s still on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: And when I wanted to go back to is that summer of 1944, early summer, my brother came to me and said, there’s a weekend at Camp Wise(ph), which was a camp, I guess at that time largely Jewish children, who paid according to their ability to pay.</span> <span id="s1379">Was a – was actually organized or – and the money was given by this Sam Wise(ph) who was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Oh, the paint guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: – millionaire with whom my friend Henry Stern(ph) was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: And why don’t you come – they’re having a weekend to train people to be counselors, and then if you want to, you can go up there for two weeks as a counselor, or [indecipherable] m-more, if you want.</span> <span id="s1384">I said no, I’m not interested.</span> <span id="s1385">Unbeknownst to me, Irene went exactly through the same process, her girlfriend wanted to take her that weekend and she di – wasn’t interested.</span> <span id="s1386">Finally both of us gave in – she to her friend Esther, and I to my brother Walter, and we went to – to that weekend where the staff was training the counselors.</span> <span id="s1387">And I was in a taxi from the train to the camp, sitting in the back with a young woman I have never met on my lap, cause we were so many people.</span> <span id="s1388">And all of a sudden, this very beautiful young girl got into the front seat next to my brother.</span> <span id="s1389">I take one look at her and I – I said to myself, I – I want to get to know her better.</span> <span id="s1390">And that turned out to be Irene Rannis(ph).</span> <span id="s1391">And when I got out – out of the ca-cab, I ta-talked to her and we looked at each other and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: That was it.</span> <span id="s1393">You were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: I was 20, a-and she was 19.</span> <span id="s1395">And she was engaged to somebody else, but we fell for each other immediately, and didn’t eat anything that whole week, we kept staring at each other and being together, and – and the rest is history.</span> <span id="s1396">We’re now married almost 67 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Congratulations to you both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: As of August ninth, we will be married 67 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: August ninth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: August ninth.</span> <span id="s1404">So you’re gonna have many things to celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Your birthday and your wedding anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: We – we already amply ceb – celebrated my 90th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Oh, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: And my retirement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1411">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: So, we ha-had a very good weekend –</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: – and then we dated, then I went in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: What was your –</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: And we wrote each other every day, and when I came home, I went to graduate school the University of Chicago in organic chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: When you were drafted in the army, how long were – was your military service, and what did it comprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: I was only – I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1419">I went into the army in 19 – in September ’44, and was sent immediately to infantry basic training in Alabama.</span> <span id="s1420">I forget, Fort McClellan, I think.</span> <span id="s1421">And I had a really rough basic training.</span> <span id="s1422">They put me in heavy weapons, which means artillery, and it was a very rough basic training, I mean, but we did other – we shot rifles, we did bayonet training and the whole bit.</span> <span id="s1423">And we were spec – I found out later we were supposed to be sent – in fact, our – the – our whole troop was sent to the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1424">But they pulled me out because I had a college degree.</span> <span id="s1425">I mean, I really had a lucky life.</span> <span id="s1426">Because I had the degree in science – engineering, they pulled me out and sent me to Ohio State University, which was very convenient because my girlfriend lived in Cleveland, and I was in Columbus, which wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s1427">So we actually dated on weekends, I either went to Cleveland or she came to Columbus – you came to Columbus once.</span> <span id="s1428">And then I found out later I was supposed – I [indecipherable] enter, because they wanted to send me to either Oak Ridge or Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: I didn’t know that then.</span> <span id="s1431">I knew they were going to send me to one of these places, but I didn’t know for what.</span> <span id="s1432">But when they found out, even though I had been naturalized in the army as an American citizen during my basic training, they wouldn’t send me because I was still considered an enemy alien, even though I was a citizen and a Jew.</span> <span id="s1433">And I said, well – I – I s – I asked them later, why didn’t you try to find out more about me?</span> <span id="s1434">He says, no, we didn’t have money or time to investigate, so we just won’t – wouldn’t take you.</span> <span id="s1435">So they sent me basically, to another basic training, which was in combat engineers, and that was almost worse than infantry because you had to f-fire rifles while you were building houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Oh good God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Or bridges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: And I got a little fed up with that.</span> <span id="s1440">I mean, I was very patriotic, but I – that was a bit much, and so I went to what was called classification and looked to see whether I could do something more useful.</span> <span id="s1441">And they actually sent me to Rhode Island, where I was asked to teach English to German PWs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1444">These were so called specially picked reliab – quote, reliable PWs, although some of them were as high as colonels, so I’m not sure how reliable they were, how anti-Nazi they were, but I taught a Berlitz type English, which was very interesting because one – two of my friends, one was from Brooklyn and one was from the south, they didn’t take – they didn’t speak a – a general – general enough English – Midwestern enough English, they took me.</span> <span id="s1445">So my – my – my accent was already pretty good, but it was fun to do, and I did that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: What ki – well, you said POWs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yes, they were ger –</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: So POW – so, did you speak with them, did you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: I – I didn’t – I wasn’t allowed to tell them that I spoke German, because the-they wanted them to have the entire class conducted in English and nobody lapse into German.</span> <span id="s1450">So they didn’t know I was German.</span> <span id="s1451">I overheard a few things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Well, that’s one of the thi – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: They didn’t know I could understand.</span> <span id="s1454">So I was there about a year or so, I think, and then they shipped me to another POW camp in Virginia, where I taught – they had several very distinguished lecturers on American democracy and the two party system, and you know, the whole American –</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: The whole nine yards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: – politics and history and civics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: And I was one of the discussion leaders, as a – after that lecture, we would ha – break up into smaller groups, and ha – and we would lead – and those I did in English, because they really didn’t understand enough German to conduct that in German.</span> <span id="s1459">So they – I was allowed speak English with them, because they were – presumably knew some ger – I wasn’t teaching English at that point, I was leading discussions on American democracy and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Do you remember any of those discussions and how they would –</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: No, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1463">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: I remember the professors who gave lectures.</span> <span id="s1465">They had one called Homer Smith – not Homer Smith, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1466">I don’t remember his first name.</span> <span id="s1467">I think from Northwestern, who was a very distinguished philosopher.</span> <span id="s1468">And also a – a Professor Jones, who’s also, I think, University of Chicago, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1469">Also a very distinguished philosopher, and they gave many of the lectures.</span> <span id="s1470">By the way the – my boss, my o – ca – officer in the first camp where I taught English was Henry Lee Smith, I think that was the name, who had a program on the radio where he would guess where people were born and where they were brought up.</span> <span id="s1471">He was a – like a linguist who didn’t speak too many languages, but he – incredible at knowing accents and learning accent and knowing how to distinguish accents.</span> <span id="s1472">So he would say, oh you were born in New York, but you grew up in Pennsylvania and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Oh my gosh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: And I never heard too many of them, but he was on the radio for – for a very long time, and very nice guy, he was my – my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Well, what are some of the things that you overheard in that first POW camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Tell you the truth, I don’t remember very much.</span> <span id="s1477">I – the only – the only little thing I remember was when I was in – in – I – I don’t think I heard any real anti-Semitic remarks or anything like that, but when I was in Virginia, I accidently yers – used to work meshugah.</span> <span id="s1478">Do you know the word, that Yiddish word meshugah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: And I said to them, anybody know what that means?</span> <span id="s1481">And somebody raised their hand and said, that’s Berlin dialect for verrückt.</span> <span id="s1482">Berlin dialect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: I mean, there were some Yiddish words that had gone totally into the German language.</span> <span id="s1485">Schmirastand(ph).</span> <span id="s1486">The Hitler youth said schmirastand(ph) for – for standing guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Schmirastand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1489">And the Nazis like the Konidra(ph) tune so much that they played it on the radio and called it a Chinese melody or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: The crazy things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: But – I don’t remember too many details, but what – one of the prisoners was a – an artist and he painted my portrait.</span> <span id="s1492">Somebody in my family has it.</span> <span id="s1493">I think one of my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Well, what was the – what – what was the – did they know by that point – in the second camp, did they know that you were German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: The ones in Virginia knew because they knew I – they – I mean, they asked me how come you speak German so well, I couldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: – really deny it.</span> <span id="s1498">And actually, one of these people came to me one day and told me about the ho – Holocaust, and I didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s1499">I said ha – where da – people don’t do things like that, to – killing – killing millions of people systematically.</span> <span id="s1500">I mean, I di – I literally did not believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: This is so ironic.</span> <span id="s1502">An – a German POW – prisoner, comes to you and tells you about the Holocaust taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: And y – and that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Not only that, almost every one of these PWs managed to find a Jewish anc-ancestor in his family.</span> <span id="s1506">They were all – at that time they wanted to be – they wanted to be anti-Hitler.</span> <span id="s1507">And some of them, I’m sure were all their lives.</span> <span id="s1508">I mean, there were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: – in fact, in th – in the first group, where they really wanted to get them ready for – for u – for u – for use in military – in – in go – in govering – governing Germany, there were some very liberal people.</span> <span id="s1511">The trouble was they didn’t always get very far because if they were social democrats, the ger – Americans unfortunately se – though they were communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: But, it was a very – it’s somewhat very interesting experience, it’s there, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1516">The – no, I mean, was totally shocked and I really – I didn’t – which brings me back to Germany for a – for a minute, if you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1518">Oh, this is exactly what I – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: What I – I’m say da – but not when I was there, but actually when I was visiting.</span> <span id="s1520">We were invited back to germ – to Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s1521">You know, they invited – most of the cities invited their former surviving Jewish citizens back to visit.</span> <span id="s1522">And we were invited, my wife and I and my brother and his wife were invited back to Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Can you count – tell me a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: I believe in the – in the middle of late thir – 90s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: And I went to – as I mentioned, I think, earlier, I went to speak to the Gutenberg gymnasium where I had gone to school.</span> <span id="s1527">And the kids were very interested, and I spoke in German, which I was fortunate to be able to do.</span> <span id="s1528">And the professor was a friend of mine, whom I had met – previously had come to our house with his wife, stayed with us a few days.</span> <span id="s1529">I believe that was before – or after, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1530">But anyway, the – he mentioned to me that he had a so – given them a list of books to read.</span> <span id="s1531">And the kids were about for – 15 or 16, picked a book on Holocaust, called [speaks German].</span> <span id="s1532">It was by a German boy, non-Jewish boy called Friedisch(ph) – I believe it was Friedisch(ph).</span> <span id="s1533">I think he was the – the Gentile boy, who lived in the same apartment building with a family that had a Jewish boy his age, and they became very, very close friends.</span> <span id="s1534">I read that book in one night, it was an incredible book.</span> <span id="s1535">And it gave the – the Jewish situation in Germany from the point of view of this Christian boy with – who had this close Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s1536">And the one scene I remember so vividly, is the Christian dad talking with the Jewish dad and saying, why don’t you get out of here?</span> <span id="s1537">Y-You see that they’re not very nice to you and that it could get worse –</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: – and more dangerous, and leave.</span> <span id="s1540">Take your family with you.</span> <span id="s1541">And the Jewish dad said look, if this were the Middle Ages, and I would have to fear for my life, I would leave tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1542">But this is Germany in the 20th century, a civilized country.</span> <span id="s1543">I don’t have to fear for my life, and eventually Hitler will be gone and things will be normal again.</span> <span id="s1544">This was such a common –</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Refrain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: – frame of mind for – for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1547">Whether they believed it or not, they certainly rationalized that – that they would – nobody would harm them physically, because it was a civilized country.</span> <span id="s1548">And to some extent my parents, I’m sure used that argument as well.</span> <span id="s1549">But it was really strike – and we discussed that book when I spoke to the class, and of course they asked me questions about my experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Was there anything that they said in those discussions that also stay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: One thing stayed with me is that I really couldn’t answer very well, and when a – a boy said, we’re paying restitution to our former Jewish citizens, who were clearly badly hurt.</span> <span id="s1552">But why should we, the third generation, who had nothing to do with this, why should we – should we pay this?</span> <span id="s1553">And I didn’t have a good answer.</span> <span id="s1554">I don’t remember what I said.</span> <span id="s1555">You can argue this both ways, you could say look, your gra – your grandparents did this, and so our – some of your grandparents, and so you’re still paying for what they did, just as – as in this country some people are advocating restitution for the slaves.</span> <span id="s1556">And we’re certainly not responsible for slavery.</span> <span id="s1557">And some argue that they’re really not guilty.</span> <span id="s1558">They – they weren’t born.</span> <span id="s1559">Something that’s very difficult to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: For you to come down on one side or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1562">Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Well, tell me a little bit about – I mean, where – again, we’re – we’re skipping certain topics, but this sounds like an appropriate moment to ask, so what are your feelings about Germany?</span> <span id="s1564">Many people who left never went back, never have any contacts, never engaged –</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: And I know many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: And I understand perfectly.</span> <span id="s1568">And especially when if you were in a concentration camp, or you were close to being gassed, or you have relatives that were murdered, I could totally understand.</span> <span id="s1569">But having not had these horrible experiences, I would – didn’t feel quite that strongly, but it took me a very long time to want to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Did it really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: It did.</span> <span id="s1572">When we finally were invited back, I think that was the first time we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1573">No, we were there once before.</span> <span id="s1574">I was on a sabbatical in Paris, and I took my family to Wiesbaden to see where I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: But that would have been [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: We were very uncomfortable, because we didn’t know anybody, and the kids even were uncomfortable, and so we stayed about a day or two days and drove to Basel and went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1577">Well, when I was invited back, it was already the third generation.</span> <span id="s1578">The second generation was terrible.</span> <span id="s1579">In other words, the people who were the children of the people who did some of these things, were t – didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1580">They were embarrassed, they were ashamed, and they wouldn’t bring it up in school.</span> <span id="s1581">The Holocaust simply wasn’t discussed.</span> <span id="s1582">And we, of course, resented that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: But the third generation was totally different.</span> <span id="s1585">They wanted to know the answers, they wanted to ask questions, they wanted to know what happened.</span> <span id="s1586">How – how were their families involved and not involved.</span> <span id="s1587">So that was something that made me feel that it’s time to forgive these chil – these children who – who had really basically nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1588">They might be in – I might have parents who anti-Semitic – who brainwashed them, that I can’t – but I can’t exclude that in any country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: But I felt that this generation deserved at least a little bit more of an – of a rapprochement than the previous generations.</span> <span id="s1591">And that’s why I was willing to go there, and went back for scientific purposes.</span> <span id="s1592">In other words, for visiting fellow scientists in Germany, for going to ger – meetings in Germany.</span> <span id="s1593">In fact, my first visit to Berlin was for a scientific meeting, maybe 10 years ago or something, first time [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Yeah, it sounds like when this happened, as this developed, it was pretty late.</span> <span id="s1595">That is, it’s decades after you’ve left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Oh yes, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: It’s not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: – it was in the 90s that that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: I’m quite sure.</span> <span id="s1601">So it was like si – 60 years in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Fifty or 60 years after I left.</span> <span id="s1604">Yes, because by that time the people who – who purp – perpetrated all this were ei-either dead or extremely old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: The second generation was also getting older and the third generation really was making an attempt to know and to make up for what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: When you talk about the second generation, is that what you experienced when you went back to Germany?</span> <span id="s1608">That first time was a family visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Actually, not directly, too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: I mean, I – we went to – I was at a laundry mat, I think and told the people that I – they asked why – why I spoke German so well, and she told them I was born there.</span> <span id="s1612">And she basically said, why did he come back?</span> <span id="s1613">I – if I were – if I were a Jew I wouldn’t – I wouldn’t come back, I mean, after what happened.</span> <span id="s1614">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1615">And so we actually got people who were decent and didn’t have a direct experience, I heard a lot of things where people went to school and – and – friends of ours, who said their parent were basically Nazis.</span> <span id="s1616">This – this family where the – where the husband was the teacher where I – where I spoke –</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Her parents were real Nazis and left and fled to South America, and at home she couldn’t open her mouth, because her parents were so pro-Hitler and anti-Jewish and everything else.</span> <span id="s1619">And she became exactly the opposite, and her husband and she were extremely – in fact, that brings me to a very important –</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: – thing about why – another reason why I became a little more pro-German, or pro-German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Or engaged, and less anti-German, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: And that is, in Wiesbaden is a group called the f – the [speaks German here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: And in the English translation that would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: English translation a – ferdechai(ph) is a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: An association of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: – an association to further –</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: – the hit – a – the history of the Jewish community of Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s1632">They built a Jewish museum [speaks German] and they collect documents from, and invite – they were in – they were also involved in our invitation to Wiesbaden and I gave them actually my mother’s passport, and a few of the documents that I had left from – from Germany, and they set up a museum.</span> <span id="s1633">And they had – constantly doing work to recognize people who hi-hid Jews, people who did heroic things, and Jews who – who perished.</span> <span id="s1634">And they have stolpersteine, have you ever have stolpersteine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: It means stumbling stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: But it really means that they take stones out of the sidewalk and put – put a name – put a name –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: – on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: In Wiesbaden and in many cities for people who perished, and have a pla – a – a – a monument where the da – where the synagogue used to stand, and things like that, all done by this group, none of whom – maybe one was Jewish, but most of them were not.</span> <span id="s1643">And they’re still very active.</span> <span id="s1644">And then I mentioned, I think earlier, in Limburg they have a group co – a Christian – a Christian Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: – society, that works together.</span> <span id="s1647">And I was very impressed with these people.</span> <span id="s1648">And I can tell you, only one instance that really impressed me enormously.</span> <span id="s1649">They persuaded the mayor of Wiesbaden, and the governance of Wiesbaden to change the name of this street, which had some nondescript name, Kurnigstrasse(ph) or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: – to the Gebruder(ph) or the Geshvista(ph) I don’t remember the name, Stoltz(ph), something like that, a Jewish brother and sister.</span> <span id="s1652">And underneath it says, ermordet – murdered on July so and so, 1942.</span> <span id="s1653">And the street has that on it in – in permanence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: And I thought that was an extremely courageous and very decent thing to do, is to actually have a street named after two Jew-Jewish children who were murdered in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1656">And they did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Maybe they lived on that street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: – many other wonderful things.</span> <span id="s1659">Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Maybe they lived on that street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: No, I don’t think they did, but they lived in Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: They didn’t – ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Yeah, I think they picked the street cause it didn’t have a particularly important name, but I don’t know that for sure.</span> <span id="s1664">But that was – and the ceremony that we were at when this was done, I mean, the mayor was there, th-the members of the c – city council, whatever and all kinds of – of somebody – I think somebody from the government of hess – Hessen was there, and it was really a big deal.</span> <span id="s1665">So I – I thought that was – and that was done in the 90s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Well, you know, wa – in order for someone to see these things, a first step has to be taken –</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: – to become engaged again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: And it’s taking that first step, which is usually the hard part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Exactly, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1672">I mean, I still have some feelings, obviously, that that could happen in a co – in a country as quote civilized as Germany, that produced the Beethoven, that produced the Einstein, that produced people like that, and that that could happen is still incredible to me.</span> <span id="s1673">And when there’s a sports contest, I often root against Germany.</span> <span id="s1674">It’s just something, and I – while I buy German – some German product – I – I can’t get myself to buy a German car, even though they’re very good.</span> <span id="s1675">And so there’s still some of these prejudices left, and I’m – it’s not surprising.</span> <span id="s1676">But I can see when people have direct loved ones that perished, and – are going to be much more anti than somebody like me, who was fortunate enough not to have any close friends or relatives that perished in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Well, I think in – in these things, it’s – it’s very individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: It’s ver – you know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Of course, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: And it’s very hard, and – and I don’t think it’s possible, nor should it be, that there’s a prescription of how –</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: – at – at what point should one say this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: You can’t.</span> <span id="s1685">You can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: You can’t.</span> <span id="s1687">People –</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: It’s a totally individual thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Let’s – let’s talk about a little bit your further life in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: My professional life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Tell me about your career, your professional life, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: – who will see this – the people who will see this interview will know about some of your work and accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1697">Well, first of all, I mentioned that I went to college –</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: – and I just wanted to give credit to my parents because they paid for their college, and made it possible for me to give – to get a profession.</span> <span id="s1700">And I told you I got a – a degree essentially in chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s1701">When I came back from the army – and by the way, I just mention briefly, because I had a bachelor degree, because I – I worked briefly on a research project at Ohio State while I was waiting to be assigned –</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: I was able – there was a technical bulletin in the army bulletin that allowed me get – get out of the army early.</span> <span id="s1704">So I got out February or March, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: And in – I had to be accepted either in a defense job or – well, war was over, but in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: – essential job or in a graduate school, and I was accepted at graduate school at Case actually, but I went to the University of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: That was my choice.</span> <span id="s1711">But I had to be accepted somewhere, so I went to ca – I – I – I got the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: – acceptance.</span> <span id="s1714">And the-they discharged me.</span> <span id="s1715">And I went to the University chica – Chicago and took a master’s and PhD degree in organic chemistry.</span> <span id="s1716">Now this is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1717">I didn’t take any biology courses, but I audited biochemistry.</span> <span id="s1718">And I came to the realization that while I enjoyed organic chemistry to a degree, I didn’t enjoy reading the literature.</span> <span id="s1719">I mean, I would look at the Journal Organic Chemistry and it would say, a new synthesis in the anthraquinone series.</span> <span id="s1720">And I said, who cares?</span> <span id="s1721">But when I learned something about biochemistry, and at that time was the time when it – what was called [indecipherable] very, very much in the research area.</span> <span id="s1722">In other words, how the body metabolizes food to create energy, to create growth.</span> <span id="s1723">And that was so exciting, and I made up my mind right then and then, as I was a graduate student, that I wanted to get into biochemistry.</span> <span id="s1724">And when I finished my PhD thesis, which was a strictly organic chemistry thesis, with a prof – very famous professor called Professor Morris Kharasch, who almost got the Nobel Prize because he – he developed a new – brand new field in organic chemistry, the field of – of free radicals in solution.</span> <span id="s1725">When I received my – finally received my degree, and I was in graduate school almost five years, that was because he was very demanding, and the – there wasn’t this – a closed project, it wasn’t finish – finished, he would – he would say now finish this, okay, I’ll give you another project.</span> <span id="s1726">But I mean, eventually got out and di-did fine.</span> <span id="s1727">I actually applied for a fellowship.</span> <span id="s1728">At that time the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Polio Foundation, gave a fellowship specifically for people who were in the hard sciences like physics and chemistry and wanted to get into biology.</span> <span id="s1729">And so I took a – I – I – I ge – I got this, and it was – I was one of the winners, and I took a postdoctoral fellowship for two years at Columbia, and at that time Irene and I – and I haven’t said anything about my family life, but I will –</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: – at least briefly – decided we’re going to go to New York, but we’ll be there for two years and then we’ll move to a nice, small college town, where I can walk or bicycle to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Famous last words, as we’re still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: At any rate, I had a very good post-doctorate [indecipherable] with a young scientist called David Shemen(ph) and became very excited about being a biochemist.</span> <span id="s1736">Then I got my first real job at Cornell Medical School.</span> <span id="s1737">I kept moving downtown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Where I worked on a – on a project on muscular dystrophy.</span> <span id="s1740">It actually was a project on vitamin E metabolism because the only model of muscular dystrophy that was known at the time were rabbits that got flabby muscles by not eating enough vitamin E, having a vitamin E deficiency.</span> <span id="s1741">And we made some interesting discoveries in that area.</span> <span id="s1742">But I didn’t stay in there.</span> <span id="s1743">What happened was I – my boss, Dr. Millrat(ph) was the medical director of the muscular dystrophy foundation of America, and they built him – Cornell built him an institute for muscle disease.</span> <span id="s1744">And of course, as usual, not ready when it was supposed to be ready, so I took a sort of sabbatical at NYU in a friend’s lab, Werner Maas(ph), also a German refugee.</span> <span id="s1745">And spent a year there.</span> <span id="s1746">And during the year, Professor Louis Thomas – you may have heard his name, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1747">He was not only an outstanding scientist and physician, he was author of a number of books.</span> <span id="s1748">Li – “The Lives of the Cell,” An evening with – with – with Moller(ph), I think, a medicine [indecipherable] signs were – by the way, I have a paragraph that he wrote about me to his – that sort of autobiographical book.</span> <span id="s1749">Anyway, Louis Thomas approached me about coming to NYU and gave me a very nice position as assistant professor at NYU in department of medicine.</span> <span id="s1750">He wanted me strictly – I mean, I’m – I’m a PhD, I’m not an MD, so the only thing I could do was research, and I got a teaching appointment in – at that time spa – microbiology, cause that’s where my – that’s where I was with Werner Maas(ph).</span> <span id="s1751">So I had an appointment for – do research in medicine, and – and – and a teaching appointment in microbiology.</span> <span id="s1752">And after I was there a fairly short period, maybe a year, I – my – my boss, Dr. Thomas came to me and said, the city of New York is setting up a – something called the Research Council of New York.</span> <span id="s1753">And one of the purposes, the main purpose of this organization is to give what they call career awards to young, promising scientists to keep them in the city.</span> <span id="s1754">I’d like for you to apply, and if you do that, I’d like you to think about maybe – even though I don’t want you to give up what you’re doing if you’re so interested in it.</span> <span id="s1755">But I’d like you to think about something you could do that might interest a city, that might make it easier for you to get the fellowship, the research career award.</span> <span id="s1756">To make a long story short, I chose drug addiction as something would interest a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: It certainly would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Basic science of how the brain interacts with opia – opiate – opiate drugs.</span> <span id="s1759">And that’s how I got into my eventual real field, and I got into neuroscience by the back door.</span> <span id="s1760">I knew nothing about brain anatomy, nothing about brain physiology.</span> <span id="s1761">I edit – I audited some courses at Columbia when I was post-doc, and I order – audited some more at NYU, and I read.</span> <span id="s1762">It wasn’t easy, but it was fun.</span> <span id="s1763">And I got the fellowship, obviously.</span> <span id="s1764">I had it for 15 years, I didn’t lose it, I – we lost the research council, it went belly up.</span> <span id="s1765">The city decided it didn’t have the money –</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: To fund it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: – to continue it.</span> <span id="s1768">And for 15 years almost – and my entire salary came from the city of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: But you were si – you – but you were at NYU, so NYU –</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: I was at NYU, in fact about 20 or 30 professors at NYU had – had these, and equal number at Columbia and quite a number at Cornell, and Albert Einstein, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1771">So they gave out – I don’t know how many, but they gave out a – maybe a hundred a year or something.</span> <span id="s1772">And we had annual meetings where we reported our results.</span> <span id="s1773">And then they went belly up, and I had to put at least part of my salary on my grant.</span> <span id="s1774">But I – I stayed at NYU the rest of my career.</span> <span id="s1775">I had a couple of possibilities of becoming chairman, but I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1776">And I – what I accomplished was I published about 270 papers, basically in the area of opiate – opiate research, how does the brain react to opiate, what do – what do they do when they get there.</span> <span id="s1777">And the major be – discovery we made was discover the so-called opiate rezept – receptors in the brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Tell me a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: These are protein molecules –</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: – to which these drugs must bind in order to perform what they perform, namely –</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: The high?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: The highs, the lows an-and you know, the dysphoria in some cases.</span> <span id="s1784">The pain relief.</span> <span id="s1785">All the things they do, they do many things.</span> <span id="s1786">The respiratory depression, which kills you within – when you get – when you have an overdose.</span> <span id="s1787">All these can only be done – can only happen if the drug binds to the opiate receptors, to these protein molecules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: And is it ams – in my very layman’s terms, because as I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: – said before our interview, I’m not very versed in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Right, may – you’re not a scientist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Does this mean that the discovery was how the drugs actually affect the brain in its – in – in its most –</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1794">Yes, and how it affects, on a basic biochemical level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: It binds to this molecule called the receptor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: As we call it, the receptor – and by the way, just to be fair, there was three laboratories that made the discovery si-simultaneously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1801">One was Pert and Snyder at Hopkins, Johns Hopkins.</span> <span id="s1802">One was a very nice gentleman at U-Uppsala, Sweden, called Lars Terenius, and my lab.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: And a little bit better than a year later, maybe two years later – yeah, that was in ’73, a group in Scotland, but also a German Jewish refugee, Hans Kosterlitz and his [indecipherable] John Hughes discovered the endorphins, the substance in the brain for which th-the receptors were there.</span> <span id="s1805">They were not there for people who shoot up heroin, or take morphine for pain; they were there for the su-substance which we call er – endorphins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: And it may interest you to know that I coined the term endorphins.</span> <span id="s1808">I didn’t fa –discover the substances, but I named them.</span> <span id="s1809">I’m the godfather.</span> <span id="s1810">And wish I had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: I’m impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: – a dollar for every time it’s used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: That would be not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: No, it wouldn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: That would be not bad at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: At any rate, and that – well we – we did a great deal of work on what’s called signal transduction, which means what happens between the time these drugs, or the endorphins, bind to the receptors in the time the drug is abused or euphoria happens, a high happens, or pain is relieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: And while we still don’t know the whole story, we know a great deal of what some of the biochemical steps are between the binding of these drugs, or the endorphins and subsequent events.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: You mentioned earlier that your – you would have wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s1820">Is that something that you knew that you wanted to do when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: No, not – you know, actually, while I did think about that, and I wrote – and I was – I actually got excited early about medical research when I read things like “The Microbe Hunter,” by de Kruif.</span> <span id="s1822">I actually, partly because my dad kept saying to me – and I don’t want to blame him, but oh, you don’t ne – you don’t like to see the sight of blood, you’ll never be a doctor, I never applied to medical school.</span> <span id="s1823">I just made up my mind I wanted to do re – scientific research.</span> <span id="s1824">Had I – had I to do it over, I think I would have, because I think you get a – a little wider horizon by – by taking the medical courses.</span> <span id="s1825">And I only audit – e-edited – audited –</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Audited.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: – some of them.</span> <span id="s1828">But even then you don’t get, you know, you don’t do – do the homework pr-properly.</span> <span id="s1829">And – and some of them I never took.</span> <span id="s1830">I never took a course in histology.</span> <span id="s1831">I never took a course in anatomy.</span> <span id="s1832">I had to learn it – all my [indecipherable] course I didn’t learn as well as if I had formal courses.</span> <span id="s1833">So it would have been good to have at le – at least a more biological approach.</span> <span id="s1834">But for some reason I never applied, and this is how I got there, via degree in organic chemistry [indecipherable] in biochemistry and then tr-transferred to different areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: But it’s such a – it has such implications for human well-being, to be able to understand that that’s what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1837">And you know, this is not that unusual.</span> <span id="s1838">For instance, you’ve heard of Watson and Crick –</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1840">DNA, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: – who discovered the double helix.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: But Watson was a – was a student in biology or biochemistry or something, but Crick was as physicist.</span> <span id="s1844">He didn’t know any biology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: And there are many cases like that, biochemists, physicists, psychologists, got into the field of neuroscience and did remarkable things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Well, thank you for sharing that with us.</span> <span id="s1848">And you wanted also to talk a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: So I told you how I met Irene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1853">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Which year did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: – I – I can honestly state that sev – 67 years later we’re still – well, 70 years after I met her, we’re still in love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Congratulations to both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: So while we were still – when I was still in graduate school, we had our first son, Martin, who is now a professor of math education at NYU.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: And three years later, in New York, right, we had our daughter Faye, who is – was for many years a very fine early childhood schoolteacher, whom – when I say fine, I mean the parents loved her, the children loved her, and – and her fellow teachers loved her, so sh – it must have been something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: – she did right.</span> <span id="s1865">She doesn’t do that any more, and what she did do is she set up a foundation in Irene and my honor, called the Irene and Eric Simon reser – be – Brain Research Foundation.</span> <span id="s1866">And we raise money to give scholarships – research fellowships to spend a summer in a famous scientist’s laboratory, to st – very bright students, to see if we can interest them in a reser – in a research – brain research career.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: How cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: And it’s – so far I’ve given out, I think 65 of those in the past 10 years.</span> <span id="s1869">Each one gets about 2500 dollars to – to expenses, living expenses [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: And this is – this is for high school kids, or for graduate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: No, this is for college, college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: – college, college kids, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Now it’s jor – we’ve had as young as sophomores in college, but usually juniors, seniors in college, or possibly beginning graduate of medical students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1875">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: And many of them have ended up in – in neuroscience, and – or be – ac – starting to study neurosciences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: That must be so exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Now, how many of them would have done it anyway, I can’t tell you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: – but I think we – at least we confirmed their –</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: – suspicion that they would like it, and I think we’re doing something good.</span> <span id="s1883">So that’s what she’s doing now, but she does other things.</span> <span id="s1884">She does – some – sometimes she does some parent conference – conferences, she does some tutoring.</span> <span id="s1885">Her husband Len is also a consultant, and very successful.</span> <span id="s1886">He had more work than he can use.</span> <span id="s1887">He works with people in companies that have financial difficulties, try to straighten them out, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1888">Set up websites.</span> <span id="s1889">Anyhow, so that’s my daughter.</span> <span id="s1890">My youngest son is Larry.</span> <span id="s1891">He is a graduate in psychology, but then a master’s degree at the suggestion of his mother, and a very good one, in neuros – in – in computer science, and he is – has a very responsible position in the IT department of NYU Medical School.</span> <span id="s1892">And his job is like – like a doctor’s job, he gets – he gets called in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: We’re having a problem with a computer, our EKGs are not showing up –</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: – and so he – and – but he enjoys it very much.</span> <span id="s1897">And – so that’s our children: Marty, Faye and Larry.</span> <span id="s1898">And my daughter never had any children.</span> <span id="s1899">She married late.</span> <span id="s1900">Marty had one daughter, who is now 27 years old, beautiful, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: And she just announced her engagement to her boyfriend with whom she’s been living for some time.</span> <span id="s1903">And my youngest son Larry had three children: Leron(ph), who is now 31, Darlene and Andy, who are twins, and who are 29, I think.</span> <span id="s1904">And Andy – A2: They’ll both be 29 in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: They’ll be 29 in December, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: December, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Yeah, they’ll be 29 in December</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1909">And the twins, let’s see, Darlene had no children.</span> <span id="s1910">She was married –</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: – she is now divorced, and with a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1913">She lived in Minneapolis for many years.</span> <span id="s1914">All of them lived in Israel for a while, all of them have dual citizenship.</span> <span id="s1915">I me – my – my youngest son’s family.</span> <span id="s1916">Because he married an Israeli lady called Leah – Leah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Marty was married a couple time, but he is currently single.</span> <span id="s1919">Larry has the three – these three children, Le-Leron(ph), Andy and Darlene.</span> <span id="s1920">Andy and Darlene and th – Darlene has no children yet, but Andy has two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: So you’re a great-grandpa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: We are four times great-grandpas.</span> <span id="s1923">Leron(ph), who lives in Israel has two great-grandchildren we have not yet met – met in person, but only in pictures.</span> <span id="s1924">And Andy lives up in Monsey, New York, in Spring Valley, New York, and he has two adorable children who we see about ev – once a month or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: What a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: So – a-and there – they are the joy of our lives and one of the few good things about aging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Oh, that sounds wonderful.</span> <span id="s1928">That sounds wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Yes, we – we are ver – as I’ve said at my 90th birthday party, we are – we – we’ve led a very charmed and lucky life in many ways.</span> <span id="s1930">First escaping from Germany, then meeting my lovely wife, whom I ha – wouldn’t have met if my parents had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: – [indecipherable] in Cleveland, my parents doing well enough set up a new existence, a new decent income in the United States, being able to send my brother and me to college.</span> <span id="s1933">My brother became a – a – a meta – metallurgy [indecipherable] and start his own smelting business and did very nicely, melt – smelting old automobile – well, you’ll hear from him –</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: – personally, but he – smelting old – melting old grills from cars and various things that have a lot of zinc in them, and then producing virgin zinc for – as – as good as anything you get from actual zinc ore.</span> <span id="s1936">And he did very nicely, and he’s been long retired, and we try to get together as often as possible, though.</span> <span id="s1937">He’s in Philadelphia, it’s not that far, but somehow [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Oh, when you have a busy life –</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Yeah, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add to our – what we spoke about today to our interview with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Let’s have a short pause and then let me think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Do you have any ideas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Questions that I wanted to follow up on and sort of like to tie up loose ends from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1945">You’ve mentioned that when you were a young boy, and during one of the trips to Switzerland with your father, you stayed at a kosher hotel because you wanted to be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1946">And tell me, what was it about being a rabbi that attracted you?</span> <span id="s1947">That – that – what appealed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: That’s a difficult question to answer, except I – I was impressed with our rabbi, Rabbi Paul La-La-Lazarus(ph) in Wiesbaden who – who spoke at my – who – who Bar Mitzvahed me essentially, taught me my lessons – some of my Bar Mitzvah lessons and gave the – the sermon, and he was a very good speaker, and I admired him a great deal.</span> <span id="s1949">That may have had a lot to – and I went through a – a religious period in my life, which for better or for worse, disappeared pretty quickly after I found out about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Well, here was a question, yes, do you consider yourself religious today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: No.</span> <span id="s1952">I mean, I consider myself as a very positive, cultural Jew, a-and ethnic Jew.</span> <span id="s1953">I’m very proud of anything that the Jewish community does that I like, whether it’s sports or science or medicine or anything.</span> <span id="s1954">And I – I – I like to belong to a Jewish congregation because it gives me a feeling of belonging.</span> <span id="s1955">As for a belief in God, I’m afraid that’s gone.</span> <span id="s1956">I wish I did.</span> <span id="s1957">It would make life much easier, would make dying much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: But I can’t believe in it personally.</span> <span id="s1960">I mean, I – I can believe in a – in a – some kind of super power.</span> <span id="s1961">I cannot believe in a personal God that would answer que – prayers or punish you or reward you.</span> <span id="s1962">Simply, the evidence is not there.</span> <span id="s1963">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: – maybe I shouldn’t have said this, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: No, no, I asked, I asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: – this is how I feel.</span> <span id="s1968">So then that – that idea.</span> <span id="s1969">And then of course, I got excited about science, so that kind of went by the wayside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Tell me a little bit about how your accomplishments have been received.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Well, yes, I – they’ve been, of course, received very well.</span> <span id="s1972">I mean, we – publishing 250 - 300 papers doesn’t go unnoticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: And many of them were ve – were very good, and very useful.</span> <span id="s1975">And they led to some rewards.</span> <span id="s1976">I not – I’m only going to give you two or three that are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: – remarkable.</span> <span id="s1979">One is that – and one of my favorites was that I got an honorary doctorate from the University of Paris and the Sorbonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Not only was that a very nice honor, but it was also a very nice occasion.</span> <span id="s1982">And ma – my wife, my son – oldest son, and my mother, and my brother and my sister-in-law were all at – in Paris for the occasion, and we had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s1983">And as soon as we’re finished with the wonderful time in Paris, and an extremely moving ceremony with a chamber music group playing music, and with a – walking in with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: – the academic garments and with my – my godfather, mon parrain making a speech as to why I deserve it, there were six others, all in different fields: philosopher, mathematician, biologist and s – and so forth.</span> <span id="s1986">And I have lovely pictures of them.</span> <span id="s1987">As soon as we got f-finished with all this and sent all the relatives home, except my brother and – I think my brother and sister-in-law, of course my son – my – well, we sent my mother home.</span> <span id="s1988">We went to s Zermatt, Switzerland, our fave – our favorite ski place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: And you skied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: – and we skied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Well, we did that from the early seven – 70s to about 2010.</span> <span id="s1993">Almost – almost every winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: How wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: And the – then I got a very nice prize from the New York Academy of Science, and I don’t recall the – it was the name of two brothers and it was distinguished in the way that it was given by New York Academy of Sciences, and the fact that, I think foreign people before me had won the Nobel prize.</span> <span id="s1996">So it was given to some pretty good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: And I got an award from the nation’s drug abuse as one of their outstanding researchers, called the – oh, I’m blocking out the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: People who – who make discoveries, I – and I got a number of other awards and name lectures, in other words, lectures in high memory of people who had died, in honor of people who were being honored.</span> <span id="s2001">So i-it’s – it’s been a very, very, very gratifying to ha – be recognized by one’s peers.</span> <span id="s2002">My – my medical school has also been very generous.</span> <span id="s2003">In 2005 they did an all-day symposium in my honor.</span> <span id="s2004">Oh, by the way, in 1997, I believe, a journal called Neurochemical Research did a – a whole volume in my honor, with my picture with an article by a colleague, Dr. Huda(ph) Akeel(ph), a Syrian born, lovely lady with the University of Michigan, who wrote an article about why I deserved the honor.</span> <span id="s2005">And in the – the s-symposium at my university was – all day symposium with very outstanding people lecturing and saying nice things about me.</span> <span id="s2006">And then about two or thr – three or four years ago, the medical school set up a annual lecture, called the Eric Simon lecture.</span> <span id="s2007">And so far, thank goodness, it’s not in memorial, it’s in my honor.</span> <span id="s2008">But hopefully it’ll be continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Any final thoughts?</span> <span id="s2010">You – that – this is quite an impressive roster.</span> <span id="s2011">Thank you for – for sharing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Final thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Final thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: No, I just think that compared to so many of my friends and so many of my fellow Jews, I’ve been extremely lucky and some of what I’ve told you may be almost – not seem very – very, very important compared to what all these people went through.</span> <span id="s2015">I guess these are my own [indecipherable] for not having been murdered or having been hurt in a serious way, as have the others coming out.</span> <span id="s2016">But I think these experiences are still important to remember how life was in Germany, and here, for that matter, during the – during that – that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Well, I – I couldn’t agree more.</span> <span id="s2018">People had different experiences, but this entire – this entire historical epoch didn’t leave anybody untouched.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: No, I – that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: And – and – and part of what our job is, is to try and collect some of those fragments.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Right, and to create the atmosphere, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: And – yeah.</span> <span id="s2023">And to – to se –</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: – make – make people understand –</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q:
