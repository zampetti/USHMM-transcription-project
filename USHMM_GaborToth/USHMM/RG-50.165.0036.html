GOODFRIEND</span></p> <p><span id="s11">June 19, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">BG: In a small town outside of ?</span> <span id="s14">Kovno?</span> <span id="s15">...in Lithuania, as it was (called)Vilkija...when I was a baby... my parents went to another city...they lived on the German border in Menel...and it’s known as Klaipeda...the Russians came in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">BG: ...12 and a half...</span></p> <p><span id="s18">WH: ...which camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">BG: ...I was in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s20">I was in the (?</span> <span id="s21">Kofnov?)</span> <span id="s22">ghetto...and then I went to a forced labor camp...in ?</span> <span id="s23">Gerdan?</span> <span id="s24">...and it was a group of 400 Jews...I had my brother and sister in the Ghetto...we were nine children...I was the seventh...Orthodox families had a lot of children...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: How many made it through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">BG: Four of us survived, and now we are only two...one brother...escaped and he was hidden...one sister was with me in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s27">I was with her in the ghetto...one sister survived in Paris...I was in the ghetto and then I was in ?</span> <span id="s28">Kadan?</span> <span id="s29">in the forced labor camp...from the 400, they- there was only 50 left...very few people survived from Stutthof because besides crematoria, they had a hanging method, they also would take people on the boat, we were not far from the Elbe, the water there, and they would drown them, throw them just into the sea, into the Baltic sea.</span> <span id="s30">They would take them on the boats, besides burning and hanging, so very few survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: How were you able to make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">BG: The war was over, what happened was, they chose me into a group to go and dig and dig trenches, and, first of all two things.</span> <span id="s33">I was lucky I was only with Lithuanian Jewish girls, of course we went through in the camps all this horror which is familiar, and one day we stood like a vase, all naked, they choose 400-500 girls- that time I was 15 or so, (her voice softens and lowers) and um, my hair was shaved off by then.</span> <span id="s34">We did not get a number, it was already late, it was in July ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: How long were you in Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">BG: Almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: Why did you say you were lucky that you were only with Lithuanian girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">BG: ...because when you come in such a situation when you are with people who speak the same language, you have the same signals of survival, and I’ll give you an example, and you watch out for each other.</span> <span id="s39">You come from the same background and you stick together.</span> <span id="s40">We got together with groups, my sister was with a group, my sister by the way died in Israel of a sickness (inaudible) who was with me in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s41">She was with 1,200 Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s42">Not one of them spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s43">Not one of them spoke German.</span> <span id="s44">They stuck together.</span> <span id="s45">And the 50 Lithuanian women, suffered because of that.</span> <span id="s46">How so?</span> <span id="s47">And it’s a pity that it happened that way, but we are human, and that’s why what it is.</span> <span id="s48">Like even dogs protect their own dogs that they know.</span> <span id="s49">And especially you can’t communicate.</span> <span id="s50">We can put together a whole (inaudible) of words, with signals of survival, that we gave each other...when something happened, and the Nazi, the S.S. men- would come and say, ‘Who did this and this?’</span> <span id="s51">Nobody would say a word in our group.</span> <span id="s52">At one point, that what they call a kapo, the concentration camp police, which was really only like a supervisor, who had to answer to the Nazis, and we were all- when this girl, somebody came and said, ‘who did this and this?’</span> <span id="s53">and nobod y answered.</span> <span id="s54">They put us all in a circle, all 420 by then, in a circle and they said ‘you are all going to get 25 lashes.</span> <span id="s55">[ Nobody said ‘Boo.’</span> <span id="s56">We just stood there.</span> <span id="s57">So they picked out one of the supervisors and they said, ‘This was somebody from your group,’ we were divided into six groups.</span> <span id="s58">And she didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s59">And she got the 25 lashes...she would not give out the name...well, if the Hungarian girls did something wrong, and the question would come up, they would point to one of the Lithuanian women...we had only one kapo who we were afraid of, that we didn’t trust.</span> <span id="s60">She would go and tell- tell the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">BG: Yah.</span> <span id="s63">Jewish girl, of course!</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WH: Doesn’t this hold over today, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">BG: No, I personally never would hold that.</span> <span id="s66">To me, a Jew is a Jew is a Jew.</span> <span id="s67">Doesn’t even matter- if he’s Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, when it comes basically as one nation, as one people, I always wish when people say, ‘Oh they are terrible, ahh, this and that,’ I always say, ‘Wish we would have a few million more.’</span> <span id="s68">(?</span> <span id="s69">all listen to the Galiceaner, listen with his?)</span> <span id="s70">- see, I don’t see it that way.</span> <span id="s71">Never did.</span> <span id="s72">Except that in this particular time, like let’s say, we used to have a signal, (needs translation): ya levi yova ye levi?</span> <span id="s73">- part of the davening- we from the Kovno ghetto...we built an airport (in Kovno) that they desperately needed as the crossroad between Germany and Russia...among the thousands of workers with all the problems, we had the people who observed, who davened three times a day.</span> <span id="s74">So, in midt ‘n drin, it was mincha, so they got together a minyan, and one would stand- not just one, all four corners, the women would stand and watch- that nobody is coming...they grabbed a minute to daven mincha.</span> <span id="s75">So here they came to ya vel a yova, and midt ‘n drin, we hear them they say, ‘ya vei a yova.’</span> <span id="s76">And the women screamed out ‘ya vei a yova’.</span> <span id="s77">And they knew that somebody was coming.</span> <span id="s78">So when we used to say to each other, ‘ya vei a yova,’ we knew that a big shot, a Nazi is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: In other words, you had your own language, communication?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">BG: Oh yeh, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: ...what year did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">BG: We came to Canada...1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">WH: Where did you live between ’45 and ’52?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">BG: We live first in Berlin, I met my husband in Berlin, I got married in Berlin, ’45 I met him, ’46 we were married.</span> <span id="s85">Couldn’t stand the Nazis!</span> <span id="s86">Couldn’t look at their faces.</span> <span id="s87">Ran away.</span> <span id="s88">Maybe we’ll be able to get to America...first we wanted to go to Israel, it was far to Israel...I must empathize this, I was afraid to stay in Berlin because Russia is all around.</span> <span id="s89">And I used to call it, we are on the tip of the tongue of the lion, if he wants he swallows us, if not, he spits us out.</span> <span id="s90">So anyway, we went to a big D.P. camp near Frankfurt...(?</span> <span id="s91">Salzheim?)</span> <span id="s92">...from there we couldn’t find a place where to live in there, so we went to (?</span> <span id="s93">Felderphing?)</span> <span id="s94">... a lot of Lithuanian Jews from the survivors lived in (?</span> <span id="s95">Felderphing)...why didn’t we go to Israel?</span> <span id="s96">We started to...very simple, at that age, I understood that I am not strong enough physically, or mentally to go to a country that was even harder at certain points than the ghetto.</span> <span id="s97">I absolutely physically, and especially mentally, (her voice drops low) I was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">BG: - my parents died with the shtetl six weeks after the Nazis took over...that was in ’41.</span> <span id="s100">So then, what we did from the D.P. camps, through a certain way my husband found my sister in Paris, and my oldest son was born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: ...(NEEDS TRANSLATION:) talking about ?</span> <span id="s102">Felderphing?</span> <span id="s103">...books...and collections...IN YIDDISH... what happened when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">BG: What we did, when we came to America...once we got to Canada in 1952...we went back from Paris to Berlin and we came to Canada.</span> <span id="s105">After two years we finally had a chance to leave Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: Did you have to apply for a visa to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">BG: Yah...on the Polish quota...we heard that Canada takes in...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: ...you came...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">BG: ...in Paris we could immigrate to Australia...we didn’t want to go to Australia... we came to Montreal Four and a half years we lived there in Montreal (illegible to transcriber) and my husband became a cantor after a while, he was- cantor in Berlin.</span> <span id="s110">So he became a cantor in Montreal, and I became active with what we call now the ‘Golden Agers’.</span> <span id="s111">I was sisterhood head of branch of activities for the elderly, and in those days of course Jewish parents didn’t live in old homes, they lived with the children...</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: When you came to America, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">BG: We came to Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">WH: Why Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">BG: That’s where my husband got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">WH: Brookline?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">BG: Brookline, and so we lived in Brookline for a very short time...did not take to the Jews in Boston, because I found them as empty snobs, and if somebody becomes snobby, that’s okay...I found them very snobbish and I had a time adjusting there...I was not happy there.</span> <span id="s118">In Montreal we found (needs translation): (?</span> <span id="s119">unsa regedden?)</span> <span id="s120">besides survivors, the people were warm, and outgoing and the society, being that we both spoke French, it was so easy for us.</span> <span id="s121">Between Yiddish and French, we didn’t have any problems without knowing English,</span></p> <p><span id="s122">WH: When you came here, how did the American Jews react to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">BG: To us?</span> <span id="s124">Beautifully.</span> <span id="s125">I didn’t have any problems.</span> <span id="s126">Never, wherever we were.</span> <span id="s127">In Cleveland, we came from Boston to Cleveland, in Cleveland, I was Torah Fund Chairman of my sisterhood for two years.</span> <span id="s128">I couldn’t write always my speeches in English, so I had a very dear friend...she knew Yiddish very well, so I would tell her, what I want to say in Yiddish, and she would write it out all in English, and I would get up and make my speeches</span></p> <p><span id="s129">WH: Did they ever ask you about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">BG: Oh, yah, very little, though.</span> <span id="s131">They would.</span> <span id="s132">American Jews were not interested in that...No, it was far removed and I felt I should- in those days, it was very hard for us to talk, anyway, and besides, they didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s133">They didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s134">Every so often, I would mention, like in Torah Fund, I told them that you must provide the money for teachers and rabbis and cantors because all those who used to come before the war from the shtetl are dead!</span> <span id="s135">From Auschwitz, no rabbis and no teachers for your children, will come.</span> <span id="s136">These type of speeches I used to give them.</span> <span id="s137">And it worked!</span> <span id="s138">They gave me money.</span> <span id="s139">And they gave money- money went to the seminary...so I used to tie in into my talks.</span> <span id="s140">In order to hit home...and then we both became very active in the Jewish National Fund.</span> <span id="s141">In Cleveland, we had the women’s division that did a lot of good work for (?</span> <span id="s142">Kaneh Kiyim?</span> <span id="s143">Israel) and I became very active and I was President.</span> <span id="s144">And while I was President, my husband accepted the job here.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: Do you ever find yourself asking how G-d could let this all happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">BG: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s147">I ask it many times, but on the other hand, I found strength in talking to G-d in the camps, when I would come from work.</span> <span id="s148">When I would come from work and it wasn’t too cold, I would take off my dress, shake out the lice, that used to eat me up alive, I was the only one, and you sleep- on dust anyway, and I would say, (needs translation) and this would give me an oomph.</span> <span id="s149">I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s150">But give me an oomph to go on.</span> <span id="s151">I ask questions, I don’t think it was a deed of G-d, it was the deed of people, and I blame the silence of Americans and the leadership of the Jewish agency in those days from Israel, or Palestine at that time, ALMOST as much</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: Why do you think they were silent?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">BG: First of all, it’s easier to hide your head in the soil, in the ground, in-in-in the sand, in the everything whatever it is.</span> <span id="s154">Not to rock the boat, just protect me and my family.</span> <span id="s155">.</span> <span id="s156">uhh, hope we have not so long ago the similar experience with the happening in the community, and our Jewish leaders...truly, the city father’s some of them two generations, they did not want to have anything to do with that, because they were afraid it might hurt THEM, to push away other Jews because there were Jews of a country that is not accessible right now!</span> <span id="s157">But they didn’t look that you don’t push away another Jew.</span> <span id="s158">He is your brother!</span> <span id="s159">No matter where he came from!</span> <span id="s160">If he’s green, yellow, communist, apartheid, whatever it is, he is still your brother!</span> <span id="s161">You don’t push him away!</span> <span id="s162">You help him...(inaudible –who?)</span> <span id="s163">and the Jews in the community didn’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s164">The leadership did not want.</span> <span id="s165">The Federation leadership did not want.</span> <span id="s166">The American Jewish Committee, did not want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s167">We went ahead and did- yah, we going to head and did want we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s168">So I feel that American, the American Jewish leadership- first of all, the leadership in that time, were very far removed from what we would call a (needs translation: Yiddishe nisnomer?)</span> <span id="s169">to me, those people didn’t have a (yiddishe nisnomer?)</span> <span id="s170">.</span> <span id="s171">They were Judeo-Christian Jews.</span> <span id="s172">They did not feel the pain uhhh, I call it (needs translation: sa-aham b’lebam?)</span> <span id="s173">.</span> <span id="s174">They did not feel it.</span> <span id="s175">So how could they help us?</span> <span id="s176">And they didn’t want to rock the boat with Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s177">Roosevelt was a very fine masked anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s178">And he got what he wanted.</span> <span id="s179">So, uhh, I-</span></p> <p><span id="s180">WH: ...( with reference to previous discussion about Jewish Community Leaders)...what was it that that they didn’t want to do for them?</span> <span id="s181">That they didn’t want to help them...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">BG: ...they didn’t want to have anything to do them, they told us in very plain words.</span> <span id="s183">We don’t need them here!</span></p> <p><span id="s184">WH: Are they afraid of the Black community?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">BG: (inaudible)...they afraid of their own skin.</span> <span id="s186">And the same thing happened with us.</span> <span id="s187">They did not want to go to rock the boat of the Congress, of the Senate, to tell them, in their own state, the President- they had an ‘in’!</span> <span id="s188">- they had an ‘in’ to the President!</span></p> <p><span id="s189">WH: ...if that’s the case, what does all this education do?</span> <span id="s190">What did they learn from the Holocaust, if anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">BG: NOTHING!</span> <span id="s192">That’s exactly what we were talking- and I said, and I repeat it that again and again, THEY DIDN’T LEARN A THING FROM THE HOLOCAUST!</span> <span id="s193">AND G-D FORBID THAT YOU REPEAT YOURSELF AGAIN!</span> <span id="s194">In Germany, the German Jews said when there were pogroms, I’ll never forget that my mother- oval shalom- she used to repeat it all the time.</span> <span id="s195">She said, ‘And don’t always trust the German Jew.’</span> <span id="s196">Why?</span> <span id="s197">Because she used to talk to her friends and she- and she would say, ‘why?</span> <span id="s198">Because when there were the pogroms, and they went to the German Jews, to ask for help, and they said, (needs translation: vas numverdent tu midt de aust student).</span> <span id="s199">Hitler made one, no more (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s200">east?)</span> <span id="s201">no more west, everybody was Juden’ And that what it was, And this is what American Jews cannot understand.</span> <span id="s202">We are the biggest, largest Jewish community in the world.</span> <span id="s203">We take more Jews, they are more affluent, for a longer time in this era, more than before in Jewish history.</span> <span id="s204">And the German Jews didn’t want to believe that it will happen to them.</span> <span id="s205">They served their Kaiser, they gave money for the Nazi party, they couldn’t believe it that it would happen there.</span> <span id="s206">They got everything.</span> <span id="s207">They didn’t-you see, what happened there, is happening now, here.</span> <span id="s208">When Fritz Goldberg becomes more goy than Fritz Schultz, the goyim don’t trust the Jews and this is what’s happening now.</span> <span id="s209">And this is what the Nazi’s did.</span> <span id="s210">When they saw how, how, uhh, a Christian the Jews came, became, including of changing their names, and went over to the Christian side than as Jews, they didn’t trust the Jew.</span> <span id="s211">They trusted the Jew, when he was with a beard- when he comes with an accent then they knew he’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s212">But when Fritz Goldberg becomes more Christian in dealings and achievement, and coming to, to, a, in politically and in this- art, in professors, if he became more than Fritz Schultz, he cannot be trusted.</span> <span id="s213">THAT’S WHY they didn’t give us an opportunity to convert.</span> <span id="s214">That’s what I wanted to bring out.</span> <span id="s215">Because when- in the time of the Inquisition...in the pogrom times, if you wanted to convert, you survived.</span> <span id="s216">This time, Fritz Goldberg, is too- he’s a big danger to Fritz Schultz.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">BG: Because he’s more Fritz than he is.</span> <span id="s219">That’s why they didn’t give us an opportunity to convert.</span> <span id="s220">That’s what I see.</span> <span id="s221">And we are living on the time.</span> <span id="s222">That’s going back four generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WH: Jews here in Canada, they don’t convert- they assimilate, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">BG: That will not save their lives, because Hitler went back four generations.</span> <span id="s225">And all this conversions aren’t worth that much, if the husband is not an observant Jew.</span> <span id="s226">The Christian girl, who grew up believing, and go to church, said suddenly says to herself, Why do I have to be Jewish, my husband doesn’t observe anything.</span> <span id="s227">I don’t want to go to hell.</span> <span id="s228">I have to believe in something!</span> <span id="s229">And she says, I don’t want to be converted any more.</span> <span id="s230">I’ll be a wife, the mother of your children, but I’ll go to my church, because I don’t want to lose my soul.</span> <span id="s231">How do you blame a woman of that- like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">WH: Do you think that people like that could also turn on Jews, in their marriages?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">BG: Oh, yeh, we saw what happened during the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WH: Do you think what happened in Europe could happen here?</span> <span id="s235">:</span></p> <p><span id="s236">BG: I believe that it may happen again- I believe very much, because I do not trust Christianity for their humane behavior.</span> <span id="s237">We- it might happen here in a worse way than there.</span> <span id="s238">The only difference is, that here we have a mixture of groups of different religions.</span> <span id="s239">The different hates, and, and, and greediness towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s240">There, we had Christians with one religion, and one bond.</span> <span id="s241">When the priest led the services on Easter, in the church, he would say to the congregation at one point during the day, ‘Go and kill the Jews!’</span> <span id="s242">and they would all turn towards the door, start to march at the door, and when they were at the door, he would say, (needs translation: greesht taug gall) which means in Lithuanian, ‘Come back!’</span> <span id="s243">But if he didn’t call them back, they would go out and make a pogrom.</span> <span id="s244">You see what I am saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">WH: And here?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">BG: Here.</span> <span id="s247">(needs translation).</span></p> <p><span id="s248">WH: Of course we don’t have too many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">BG: Ahm, we don’t have too many of them, we don’t have too many Catholics here, that I’m talking about the Catholic country where I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">WH: Is it your impression that Blacks here see Jews different than the Whites?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">BG: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">Definitely</span></p> <p><span id="s253">WH: In what way</span></p> <p><span id="s254">BG: They hate them for double.</span> <span id="s255">For being Jewish and being white.</span> <span id="s256">I believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">WH: We help them, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">BG: Because we are human beings, we are- we grew up, it’s part of our religion, those of us, and besides American people believe in fair play.</span> <span id="s259">And Jewish people especially, we grew up not- not with the saying of America, ‘Mind your own business!’</span> <span id="s260">but ‘Live and let live’ Still charge ahead.</span> <span

simple.</span> <span id="s630">I went to Moscow two years ago with my son, and I learned Russian quite a bit, you know, I spent with them two years in Berlin, and in Poland, and my son and I decided to go to Russia for Chanukah, This was before glasnot, before they opened up the doors and they (inaudible) refusniks.</span> <span id="s631">And I went for a – (inaudible) purpose.</span> <span id="s632">They called me, the- the Russian...conference...(inaudible) my son and I go to Moscow, Leningrad.</span> <span id="s633">And I carry along stuff, believe me.</span></p> <p><span

teach a rabbi in Moscow how to write a Jewish get.</span> <span id="s639">‘Cause I’m a sofer, I know how to do it, and I do it, so I- I was called from New York to be prepared, be ready.</span> <span id="s640">And, I was not afraid (illegible to teanscriber) 50 pounds of salami I had (illegible to transcriber) 50 pounds of glatt kosher cheeses, and all the rest of the stuff.</span> <span id="s641">This didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s642">What bothered me, was the four sheets of the (Hasnoves?)</span> <span id="s643">of the- that the husband has to write, to sign, giving permission, on asking to sofer to write a get, and the paper, I’m talking about 25 sheets of special parchment, that a get has to be written on.</span> <span id="s644">And the ink, and a quill.</span> <span id="s645">Nothing else bothered me.</span> <span id="s646">But this.</span> <span id="s647">If they find it.</span> <span id="s648">‘Cause I know this is a question of life and death, for some people, some person.</span> <span id="s649">He cannot remarry, she cannot remarry, in case they want to get married, they want a get.</span> <span id="s650">And this was a very desperate thing, the way it was put to me.</span> <span id="s651">So, that’s what I was afraid of.</span> <span id="s652">I had seven suitcases.</span> <span id="s653">And I come through customs, I was very cool.</span> <span id="s654">I told my son, don’t bite your nails.</span> <span id="s655">Don’t act like you are nervous.</span> <span id="s656">You may be nervous inside, but we have to show that you’re relaxed, and don’t make jokes, because if you make jokes, they’ll interpret- ‘You’re a wiseguy, huh!’</span> <span id="s657">Can’t make jokes.</span> <span id="s658">Very serious, no child, you’re a tourist, they’ll ask you if you speak Russian, the answer of course is ‘no’.</span> <span id="s659">I did the same thing, understood every word they talking about among themselves, but I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s660">And before he asked me, ‘What are you bringing?’</span> <span id="s661">I was ahead of him.</span> <span id="s662">It- just on the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s663">‘Cause I saw what happened to the guys before me, how they took them apart.</span> <span id="s664">I said, ‘which suitcase would you like me to open?</span> <span id="s665">Be my guest.</span> <span id="s666">Which one did you want me to open.’</span> <span id="s667">So, suddenly (inaudible) ‘I’m not afraid!’</span> <span id="s668">I was totally afraid, believe me.</span> <span id="s669">‘Which suitcase?’</span> <span id="s670">He picks a little suitcase where I have all the stuff for the get.</span> <span id="s671">He picks it.</span> <span id="s672">It’s a little handbag...so I said, ‘Oh, my G-d,’ I didn’t say it, but I felt it.</span> <span id="s673">And he starts digging into the side pocket.</span> <span id="s674">I didn’t hide the paper.</span> <span id="s675">I left it right in the pocket that he should see the sheets of paper, (inaudible) ah what is this?’</span> <span id="s676">...(inaudible)...so I tried to put my hand in, to see that nothing comes with it, pulled out the sheet of paper and this paper, ‘what for?’</span> <span id="s677">I said, ‘I like writing music, writing lyrics, I get inspired when I am on vacation and I like Russian folk music.’</span> <span id="s678">Which is emes, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">WH: Something has to be emes...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">IG: So I have (inaudible) paper, I don’t know how I’ll be able to get this kind of paper.</span> <span id="s681">This paper holds the ink- it is good, I have special ink...nobody told me what to say...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">WH: Being a hazzan is a Jewish occupation.</span> <span id="s683">Is there any way that being a survivor made it different for you in being a hazzan?</span> <span id="s684">I know you have to sing, so you sing in Hebrew, but was there any-.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">IG: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s686">The answer is positive.</span> <span id="s687">The answer is positive because certain prayers that I do, they touch me personally.</span> <span id="s688">Referring to (inaudible) referring to family, or referring to (?</span> <span id="s689">torres am yisrael?)</span> <span id="s690">...this is an obvious prayer that we talk about that I’m involved in, you know, the Holocaust (inaudible) but, I’m talking about prayers that are standard prayers, and they’ve been recited through the ages, for pogroms, prayers that were written in the middle ages, prayers that were written in the 16th century, you know, there were always prayers, ( a haov?)</span> <span id="s691">for instance, when I recite Tisha b’Av, I always sort of cry, when I (inaudible) chant it.</span> <span id="s692">Even at home.</span> <span id="s693">When I said to my father on the (inaudible) but now, when I recite (illegible to transcriber) I have a replay, of what happened, not 2,000 years ago- but what happened 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s694">Because the words hit in.</span> <span id="s695">You know, the desolate, how desolate Jerusalem is.</span> <span id="s696">How desolate the city is.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">WH: Is there ever any conflict, if you become a Hazzan in a Conservative shul that you had, I suppose you had probably a pretty Orthodox upbringing...Alexander Hassidim...you can deal with the ambivalence.</span> <span id="s698">There are other ways to make up for it...but I’m saying, is there ever any- like a person who is born in America, goes to a Conservative seminary, maybe he went to Camp Ramah as a kid, he doesn’t have these problems.</span> <span id="s699">But if a person grew up in a hassidishe background...</span></p> <p><span id="s700">IG: I understand.</span> <span id="s701">But it’s not a question of feeling guilty.</span> <span id="s702">In a way, I said, if my father would be here, seeing what kind of shul that I have, and that I- don’t have the peyas anymore, and I don’t- my tzitzit don’t hang out, so, he’ll probably be disappointed, because this is not what he expected of me.</span> <span id="s703">On the other hand, look at the greatest writers, Hebrew writers, if they became later on, you know, atheists, non-believers, once upon a time they went to yeshiva.</span> <span id="s704">If not, they wouldn’t be able to write as they did...like Isaac Bashevis Singer...(inaudible)...the editor of the Forwards, he’s a (inaudible) yeshiva bochur.</span> <span id="s705">He is a genius, is when I remember him from Paris.</span> <span id="s706">But he was the editor of the Zionist paper...(inaudible) it was the paper for the Zionist movement when Israel became a state...all the greatest writers, once they had this background...Elie Wiesel is a hasid...(inaudible)...(inaudible-dubakos?)</span> <span id="s707">which is an ingredient of a hasid.</span> <span id="s708">If he wouldn’t have the (inaudible-dubakos) he could not pour it out his heart with a pen and put it on paper.</span> <span id="s709">The same thing with me, when I chanted, interpret a prayer, I have to have this type of feeling.</span> <span id="s710">It has to come from here...(inaudible)...G-d wants the heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">WH: If at that time, there was a position in an Orthodox synagogue, you would have taken it?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">IG: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">WH: There aren’t that many opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">IG: Yes...correct.</span> <span id="s715">When I cane to Montreal, and I took this Conservative shul, and I felt that- you know, this something that I can live with.</span> <span id="s716">It was a pretty Conservative shul, men and women separate.</span> <span id="s717">I like that we have reading in English, because I felt that the people have to participate, instead of mouthing out, (bla-bla-bla).</span> <span id="s718">I said, ‘You don’t want to be prayed, he doesn’t want to be prayed,’ but here you have (inaudible) congregation where the rabbi reads in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">WH: It means something to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">IG: It means some- (inaudible)...I was very impressed with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">WH: I think you understood American Jews better than a lot of Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">IG: By the way, I Americanized very, very, fast.</span> <span id="s723">Extremely, extremely fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">WH: How come?</span> <span id="s725">How come you did it so fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">IG: I guess- I didn’t come down, you know, right from the camps, into the civilization.</span> <span id="s727">- I had a gradual indoctrination into the civilized world.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">WH: To France...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">IG: Paris, Paris did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">WH: ...when you came as a Hazzan, if you came from Europe, did it mean anything to people who were employing you?</span> <span id="s731">Did it mean anything to other people...was it a disadvantage or an advantage?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">IG: It was an advantage, yes.</span> <span id="s733">It was an advantage.</span> <span id="s734">But they wanted to see.</span> <span id="s735">My first interview, with the President, Vice-President, of the congregation, when he asked me to stand up, he didn’t ask me what do I know.</span> <span id="s736">Stand up.</span> <span id="s737">And he sized me up, from top to bottom, and then he ask me how tall (laughing) I am.</span> <span id="s738">So I said ‘Is this the way you hire someone?’</span> <span id="s739">‘How tall are you?’</span> <span id="s740">And then he said, ‘How old are you?’</span> <span id="s741">I was young, I was very young.</span> <span id="s742">28 years old...</span></p>
