<p><span id="s18">A: -- depending on where you are or where you want to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Heinz Goldstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Heinz -- Heinz Goldstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Did you have a middle name?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: No.</span> <span id="s26">And you changed your name much later, to Henry?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: That’s a long story.</span> <span id="s28">That -- that’ll take us from one point to another point.</span> <span id="s29">I changed my name -- at first I used the name of Henry Gallant, I did not change the name officially until past certain events in the U.S., and --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So we can come to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: -- we’ll come to that -- we can come to that later, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: So I’m going to call you Henry now, is that okay, instead of Heinz?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: That’s perfectly all right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Is that okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Perfectly all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Tell me about your mother and father.</span> <span id="s37">Tell me about your father.</span> <span id="s38">What -- what did he -- what was his profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father -- my father’s family was a typical German Jewish family, with the emphasis on German.</span> <span id="s40">They were a very good family, very loving family, but they -- as was the case in Germany with the -- with Jewry, the -- they were German first, Jewish second, perhaps.</span> <span id="s41">As opposed to Jew first and -- and German second.</span> <span id="s42">They were very patriotic.</span> <span id="s43">My father was in the military at -- during World War I, and his picture tells a whole story.</span> <span id="s44">I mean, his composure, the way he sits.</span> <span id="s45">That picture is in the -- in the Jewish heritage and Holocaust museum in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s46">He sits on a -- on a horse in a -- in a very Prussian way, very erect.</span> <span id="s47">And he was very proud of his origin, in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And he’s wearing a uniform in that picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s52">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: You know, Henry, I forgot to ask you, when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What was the -- the month and the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: October 30th, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And you were born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: In Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: In Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did your father come from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No, my father’s family came from Westfalia and they lived in a small town in -- called Iserlohn and my grandfather was a veterinarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: And not in the sense that he was treating cats and poodles, but mainly he served the community.</span> <span id="s65">They were farmers, so he was more into treating horses and cows and so fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So he did the big animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah, he -- they were integrated into -- into a small town community in Westfalia.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And that was your father’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: That was my father’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: And he had four brothers, one of whom died in World War I, for his then country and he had another brother who saw things coming in 1933, befo -- when Hitler came to power and he emigrated to Palestine.</span> <span id="s72">And another brother who lived in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s73">So anyway, he had four -- four brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Was he close with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: It was a -- yeah, yeah, it was a close-knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Although my -- my grandfather married twice, really.</span> <span id="s78">His first wife died and as is -- it’s really a Jewish custom, you marry a sister of -- of your -- of your wife.</span> <span id="s79">I don’t know if that was the reason, because on the one hand they were not that -- they were not really Orthodox, so it might just be a coincidence, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s80">But he did have two wives, and my father and his -- and two brothers came from one wife, and the other from second wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And your father came from which wife, the first or the second?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: From his -- from the first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: From the first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: So he was one of the -- the older ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s88">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And he worked for a bank, initially, as a -- I don’t know really in what capacity, but he worked for a bank.</span> <span id="s90">Later on he -- later on he worked for my mother’s brother, who comes from a well-to-do family and they -- th-they were more -- they were more Jewish oriented.</span> <span id="s91">They -- they were -- in fact, my grandfather on my mother’s side was Orthodox and they orig -- originally came from the east, meaning Poland.</span> <span id="s92">And -- and so my grandfather wasn’t born in Germany.</span> <span id="s93">My mother already was born in Germany, but that was the other branch of the family, and he had a couple of factories and my father worked for my mother’s brother and he introduced my mother to -- to my father.</span> <span id="s94">And that’s how it all came about, that’s -- so there are two branches to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s96">And what was your father doing in that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And my father then later on became a chemist.</span> <span id="s98">He manufactured perfume -- perfume.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Was he trained to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s101">He -- he studied chemistry and he tied up with a professor who -- and they be -- they made their own perfume, which was quite successful, really.</span> <span id="s102">And my mother was also very enterprising, she had -- she dealt in -- in silver, on a wholesale basis --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: -- silverware.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Was that unusual for women to be doing that at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I wouldn’t really know, because I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Because you were a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: -- I was rather young then, so I g -- I don’t know the background of it all.</span> <span id="s109">But that was life until -- until I was born, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: And by the time wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Was Herman.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: First name.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: And my mother’s name was Recha, R-e-c-h-a, Recha.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Rachel, per se.</span> <span id="s120">And -- and -- but she called herself, or they called her Rita, she was known as Rita, Rita Goldstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s122">So when -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: And his name was Herman.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s125">Do you remember wi -- in your childhood, was it a very religious family, in spite of the fact that your father wasn’t raised that way, but because of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: My father adjusted to -- I would -- I would have to put it that way, my father did a good job adjusting to -- to my mother’s orientation, religious orientation.</span> <span id="s127">And she did keep a kosher household.</span> <span id="s128">And that would take me to -- to the comment that kosher, I -- later in my career I became very much -- I became very knowledgeable along that line and th -- kosher can be -- can be many things.</span> <span id="s129">Some people keep kosher inside their home, while not paying very much attention to the law of kashrut, if you will, on the -- on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: So -- and -- and -- and that’s where I would -- that’s how I would characterize my mother’s orientation.</span> <span id="s132">My father --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: -- didn’t care, no.</span> <span id="s135">He really -- he really didn’t.</span> <span id="s136">That whole part of the family really did not care about the dietary laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So w-would you say that your mother’s -- your mother wasn’t really that religious, she kept a kosher home but she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well, she considered herself quite religious because she came from a r-rather -- rather religious home, and -- but i-i-if for example she were to take a cruise, she would not miss out on -- on taking part in the buffet, and so she could -- she had the capability to bend the rules of -- on occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: And the reason I emphasize that is because I -- la-later on in my career I became a caterer and I took over a catering business, which had been known as a kosher caterer.</span> <span id="s141">I changed that somewhat in branching out to a more secular orientation, I did -- but when doing something in the -- in the -- in the synagogue where lifestyle or lifetime events took place, I had to work with a mashgiach under -- under religious supervision, per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: So I know all about -- about that -- I know a lot about that -- that particular aspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So, when you were born and growing up, do y -- do you remember your very early years?</span> <span id="s145">Was it -- how far --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, I do --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: -- how far -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I do -- I do have a pretty good recollection of a very good home life and a very normal life, up to the time that -- that Hitler came to --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: -- take over the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So, did</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: That’s when things changed --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: -- drastically --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: -- and they changed very rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So you do remember your years before five -- cause you were five years old when he took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">Ye -- when he took over, yes, but things -- i-in my life, things th -- were fairly normal until -- until the -- until past the Olympics, which were in the -- which took place in Berlin in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And that is where you began to see the signs of -- in front of restaurants, Jews and dogs not permitted.</span> <span id="s162">And Juden [indecipherable] per se.</span> <span id="s163">And -- and that became quite obvious to me.</span> <span id="s164">Also the place where -- parks where I was accustomed to playing had yellow and green benches, park benches, the -- the ones who were -- where Jews were permitted to sit were painted in yellow, and they were also inscribed with the sentence of Nur für Juden, only for Jews.</span> <span id="s165">And the Gentiles had green benches.</span> <span id="s166">So these -- these little things that started around that time were very obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Tell me a little bit beforehand, w-were you -- were you close with your mother and your father, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Y-Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Do you -- or did you feel closer to one more than the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, due to circumstances I became very close to my mother as -- as history marched on and as things developed in Germany, as we will find out a little later in this conversation, I -- I became much closer to my mother because I was separated from my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s172">But in -- when you were a kid and you were together at home until ’39 --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I made no -- I -- there was no distinction --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: There’s no distinct --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: -- between my mother and my father, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I was close to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters, you were a ch -- only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: The only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: So did you eat lunches and dinner with your par -- I mean, how -- how did meals go with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: It was a very -- it was a very normal home life.</span> <span id="s186">We did -- we -- yes, we did eat meals together.</span> <span id="s187">Lunch during the week, from Monday to -- to Friday, lunch was at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: You would take your lunch to school in a -- there was the German custom, in a little leather pouch, you had your sandwich or what -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s190">And w-with beverages dispensed by the school.</span> <span id="s191">But lunch was at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And so you ate dinner at home --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: -- with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Did your mother cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Was she a good cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes, I liked --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: When did you start go -- when -- how old were you when you started going?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Probably I would say six or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: That was first grade, right.</span> <span id="s210">I in fact remember my first day in school, and I don’t know if I have it here or not, but they just did a project in -- in Berlin of the fate of -- under the heading -- it-it was re -- you would call it a magazine or you could call it a pamphlet, or a little booklet that they put out, that the Berlin senate really put out, with the caption, the fate of Jewish schoolchildren in Berlin.</span> <span id="s211">And there’s a picture of me on the -- on the title page.</span> <span id="s212">And it was a German custom on your first day of school to get a cone b -- about three feet bi -- long, a cone filled with sweets.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: That was a German cus-custom.</span> <span id="s215">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Right, and you bring that to school, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And you brought that to school and you were photographed with that, every -- every child.</span> <span id="s218">And the first picture on page one -- first of all I am on the cover with an unidentified young fellow, but the second page had a picture of the sister of Ann Frank.</span> <span id="s219">And her name was Margaret Frank, and she held onto one of those -- they -- th-they were called -- they were called su -- zuckertuete sugar -- sugar cone, in translation.</span> <span id="s220">And next to her stood a boy -- mind you that that was already past 1933, so Hitler had already been in -- firmly entrenched in -- in the leadership of the government.</span> <span id="s221">And that boy that stood next to her had that sugar cone also, and it distinguished that -- it distinguished itself by the fact that it had the swastika on the cone.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: So it’s a quite interesting picture.</span> <span id="s224">The one was like with flowers, flowers and gold painted and the other cone was a plain white cone with a black swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: So -- and that was about the time the Jewish teachers were kicked out of the schools and one law followed another.</span> <span id="s227">The Nuremberg laws came about and a-all professionals were -- were not allowed to practice.</span> <span id="s228">Jewish lawyers were disbarred, judges were kicked out of the court system and dentists and doctors were only allowed to treat Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Henry, what do you rem -- what do you yourself remember as a kid during that time?</span> <span id="s230">Do -- do you remember the first time you realized that these Nazis were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">It -- it all -- events were developed very, very rapidly in the -- in the -- the segregation of the Jewish community, not only in Berlin, but all over Germany.</span> <span id="s233">But Berlin -- I emphasize Berlin first of all because I lived there.</span> <span id="s234">I was born there and I lived there, so I was closest to my hometown.</span> <span id="s235">But the events of discrimination happened so fast that a great many tried to escape, to get away, to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s236">Some couldn’t, and then there were those who were optimists by -- by their very nature in -- and hoped that things would eventually change for the better, which of course, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s237">And there, at that very time, you had -- first of all you had Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, which I remember at that time I was ig -- in a -- in a Landschuleheim which means a country school, outside of Berlin.</span> <span id="s238">And we were a bunch of kids playing soccer then the Hitler youth came in on that fateful day and besides screaming the terrible ep-epitat, or -- or wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Epithets?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yeah, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: -- that -- cursing us Jews and wi-with such things as did you -- I don’t want to use any four letter words, but did you -- did you not think we would come to you and they chased the kids away, walked into the dormitories, threw the furniture out of the window, and created massive disruption, which resulted in those kids running away, and so did I.</span> <span id="s243">What struck -- what -- what I recall vividly, when -- struck me as noteworthy is the fact that I -- when I made my way back to my home, my parents’ apartment, but I would be unable to tell you how I did it.</span> <span id="s244">I-I do not recall it -- having taken a public means of transportation, I could not tell you in which way I actually -- the -- the -- that country place, that country home that si -- vry -- that was in Potsdam --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Yeah, that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: -- which is 20 miles from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: And how I made it back --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s251">And I can only say that today I have an idea that it must have been traumatic event, a -- a very serious disruption in -- in -- in my -- in my way of life, or in my li-lifestyle.</span> <span id="s252">And it -- it must have touched me in a way that I forgot everyth -- it just didn’t da -- the -- the details did not exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And my father spent that night on the subway because that very same day they had painted all the stores with a huge J, meaning Jew.</span> <span id="s255">And it also became apparent that along the Kurfurstendamm, the main boulevard running through Berlin, that every second store really was Jewish owned.</span> <span id="s256">Every second retail store was Jewish owned, which in -- which again -- I mean, which points to the fact that there must have been among the population, a fertile ground for hatred, jealousy, or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s257">And the massive amount of glass on the streets, as evidenced by the name for that particular night, called Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, if there hadn’t been so many stores that were affected, the department stores, you -- you could surmise that yes, they were the Jews, German Jews were in Berlin were among the middle class or upper middle class.</span> <span id="s258">They were -- they were doing well.</span> <span id="s259">They were thriving.</span> <span id="s260">And following that event of the attack on the Jewish community, that particular which fol -- which is known as Kristallnacht, the -- they arrested 20,000 men, deported them to Buchenwald, Dachau, Sachsenhausen, the surrounding camps.</span> <span id="s261">And my father, to avoid arrest, spent the night on the subway, the entire night.</span> <span id="s262">And the Gestapo came to every home and they had -- they knew where the Jews lived and arrested many.</span> <span id="s263">And we were among those who desperately tried to get out of Germany, and realizing that -- that it was a matter of life and death, that you -- that what would follow would be just terribly unbelievable.</span> <span id="s264">And so we managed to get a landing permit, they were sold by -- by the Cuban government at the time and we -- our destination had -- had been projected to be Cuba -- Havana, to be precise.</span> <span id="s265">And that occurred, and that -- that began the well-known, documented voyage of the damned.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Damned because we were not allowed to disembark, we were turned back.</span> <span id="s268">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: And from that point --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Right, you -- your life changes, clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Let -- let -- let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s274">When -- when you left that school, however you got home --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: -- I-I understand, you not -- did you knock at the door, did you have a key to get in, was your mother home, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I remember absolutely -- I really could not tell you any other details.</span> <span id="s278">All I know is that I was reunited with my --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: With your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: -- parents, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: With your parents</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: With my mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s284">Now that -- that was the turning point for your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Oh absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: It wasn’t ni -- it wasn’t 1933, it wasn’t 1935 --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, it was ni --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: -- it was 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Is there -- I-I -- I’ve been told that there was an incident with an SS who painted a J on your forehead, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: It was not an SS, it w -- it -- I had had my birthday around that time, in -- in 1938, and prior to -- to that date, on or around that date, I -- my playmates were -- were Gentile vo -- largely Gentile boys in my neighborhood, which was a street running off the Kurfurstendamm, it was a good middle class neighborhood and we were a group of kids who played.</span> <span id="s294">And one of the kids -- I -- I had gotten a ball point pen, which I’m not sure if it was a Montblanc, or what type of pen, but it was a ball point pen, which at the time had the -- and was called in Germany an Tintenkuli.</span> <span id="s295">And that’s the wa -- the name they had for this new innovation, a b -- a ball point pen.</span> <span id="s296">Prior to that time ball point pens were relatively unknown.</span> <span id="s297">It was something that just oc -- developed at -- at -- around -- on or around that time.</span> <span id="s298">And he took -- one of the boys took that pen and wrote on my forehead not only a J, but the entire word, Jude, J-u-d-e.</span> <span id="s299">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And this was one of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: One of my playmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: One of your playmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Was this shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I -- my sentiment or my precise emotions or my feelings, if you will, I -- I -- I do not recollect.</span> <span id="s306">I -- I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s307">But I could assume that it was very shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I mean my -- my guess would be that -- that it was extremely shocking, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Did the -- did the Gentile friends that -- you had mainly Gentile friends, wa -- playmates --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: I had ca -- I had Jewish friend and I had Gentile friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: In my immediate neighborhood I also had -- we were quite -- th-the -- there was no great separation between the racial background of the -- the kids.</span> <span id="s314">It -- it wa -- wasn’t very obvious.</span> <span id="s315">As a matter of fact there was a -- there was a fine rapport between Gentile and Jew up to the propaganda that was ril -- that poisoned the minds of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And when --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: And there was a propaganda that was directed by the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: In a -- in a way that the youth in particular, that the school system used propaganda to poison the minds of the people in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Do you remember when it seemed to change, when the kids seemed -- when the Gentile kids seemed to not want to play with you?</span> <span id="s321">Was that very late?</span> <span id="s322">Was that 1938, or do you think it happened earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: That was rather -- I would say it was around that time, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: It was around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: But shortly thereafter we were -- it wasn’t very long before we actually embarked on the SS Saint Louis, the -- the well known ship --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: -- that carried 937 German Jews to the intended destination --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: -- which was Cuba and -- and resulted in a -- in a dramatic voyage, really [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Do -- do you remember it -- wi -- did your parents talk to you about they were getting these landing visas, the visas for Cuba or did they just say pack your little bag and we’re going?</span> <span id="s331">Was it -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, I think that it was a -- a policy by most parents to avoid involving children in -- in the pressure or in the tension that -- that existed at the time.</span> <span id="s333">And so the details of the -- of what went on is -- is not foremost in my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s335">We’re going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Tell me about your schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, as I was saying, upon returning from that country school where -- where I had been while my parents were -- went through the very serious emotion of liquidating our household --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: -- to the point where -- to the point they were permitted to -- to take some things along with them -- and the businesses were confiscated anyway before that, they were -- your personal wealth already by that time had been confiscated by the -- by the Nazi government.</span> <span id="s342">And the school I went to was also in the same neighborhood, so to speak.</span> <span id="s343">It was a Jewish public school adjacent to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s344">And -- so you could say that the school and the synagogue were one and the same.</span> <span id="s345">It was a parochial school, if you will.</span> <span id="s346">And on that very same day of Kristallnacht that -- they burned that synagogue to the ground.</span> <span id="s347">And so was the school.</span> <span id="s348">So we actually were without a synagogue, we were without a school, and the -- the holy -- like the Torahs were piled up on -- and the prayer books were piled up on the street and set on fire, burned.</span> <span id="s349">And -- and that happened all over Germany.</span> <span id="s350">On that particular day 600 synagogues were burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s351">And I might add for accuracy and historical detail that it was in response -- it was a fake response, a fabricated response, because they probably would have done it anyway, that -- that those terrible, anti-Semitic acts were government orient -- were instigated, but it happened that a young Jewish man assassinated a German councilor official.</span> <span id="s352">And by the end -- by the end -- his name was bi -- his name was Greenspan.</span> <span id="s353">And -- and so the German government to -- in retaliation, quote unquote, in retaliation set these events in motion.</span> <span id="s354">And -- and that’s so much for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Did I hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Then, then.</span> <span id="s358">Or did you only hear about that later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I -- it is hard to differentiate between what I heard and what I read.</span> <span id="s360">That’s an evid -- that’s self evident.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: It is an inevitable truth that some details were perhaps too heavy and too -- too farfetched for a 10 year old to fully comprehend.</span> <span id="s363">So my guess would be that -- that I read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: It’s a historical fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: But the information, per se came to me through the media.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So your parents did not say to you you were going to Cuba, as far as you remember, in terms of the preparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, I -- I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Do you remember anxiety in the house?</span> <span id="s373">Do you remember people doing all sorts of --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s375">Oh yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s376">Everything was being packed, the overseas, the cert -- certain thing we were allowed to take some things with us and -- and th-that we were about to leave became apparent.</span> <span id="s377">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Were you able to pack a little bag for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Do you remember what you packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, I don’t exactly remember, but I probably -- I could only guess that I packed the things that were, at that time, at that point in time, important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: But you don’t remember what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: No.</span> <span id="s385">So did you have a little bag, a satchel, what did you have?</span> <span id="s386">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s387">It was a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Could have been a rucksack --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: -- a backpack --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: -- most likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Were your parents fairly wealthy at this time, so they could afford this?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I would not characterize them as wealthy, but compared to the general population, they were certainly middle class, or upper middle class.</span> <span id="s395">In those days everything was a little bit -- I would -- I wouldn’t hesitate to say low key.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: And in no way comparable to -- to what is commonplace today.</span> <span id="s398">And that pertains to -- to sports, to just about everything, I mean -- Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: -- we have the means of communication, it -- i -- those were two, not only -- we’re not only talking about 50 or 60 years, we’re talking about two different worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s401">Did you take a taxi to the boats?</span> <span id="s402">Do you -- do you remember how you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I remember that we went to the station by train and traveled to Hamburg on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And so all this stuff that was being taken was -- was shipped separately --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: -- so you just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: -- it was taken -- it was taken -- it was moved by -- transported to -- to the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: How -- how exactly the -- the details of how there were suitcases -- it wasn’t really a whole lot --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: -- that you were permitted to -- to take along.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did you have to say goodbye to anybody, or did -- was this all in secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, no, you could say -- you could say goodbye to just whomever you -- you pleased, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And did you?</span> <span id="s417">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, no, no specific recollection, really.</span> <span id="s419">The -- the only thing that I, from that period that stands out is the fact that we arrived in Hamburg and -- and went into a big hall where tables were set up with custom officers who would stamp your passport as -- as surrendering your citizenship and so forth and so on, and boarding the ship, which was a former cruise -- cruise liner.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Cruise liner.</span> <span id="s421">Your -- did you live in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: In an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Was that rented, or you just -- your family just left it?</span> <span id="s424">Did they own it?</span> <span id="s425">Do you -- do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No, I do not know if they owned it, but most apartments I believe were rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So you think they just left and then whoever was the landlord just took over again.</span> <span id="s430">You didn -- but you’re not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah -- no.</span> <span id="s432">I went back there some -- many, many years later.</span> <span id="s433">I was invited by the city government as a guest.</span> <span id="s434">I was invited in Berlin and -- and of course I took a stroll to -- it was within walking distance.</span> <span id="s435">We stayed in the -- they put us up in the Hotel Kempinski, which was one of the better hotels, to say the very least, and gave us the royal treatment.</span> <span id="s436">They kicked us out in 1939 and invited us with -- with every kind of amenity to visit and showed us the city and the approach to Judaism, which had sa -- changed 360 degrees, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So you went -- you went back to your old neighborhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: And I went back to my old neighborhood and -- and I went to the old apartment, which had a balcony and -- and I knocked on the door, rang the house bell.</span> <span id="s439">And of course the response of the owners was quite -- was quite interesting, they demonstrated a kind of -- I would a -- I would say a kind of fear -- unfounded, totally unfounded fear that I came back to reclaim my former home.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Because all of the homes that were -- that were vacated by Jews who either left Germany in -- in the nick of time -- war broke out and after that there was n -- emigration was totally impossible.</span> <span id="s442">Anybody who was still caught in the trap was ultimately deported to -- to the a -- to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: To -- to Theresienstadt, which was in Czechoslovakia, a camp where a lot of German Jews were housed, and -- or -- or sent to Poland to -- to -- to the death camps.</span> <span id="s445">And so these hi -- these apartments and all of the property that Jews once owned was stolen, if you will.</span> <span id="s446">And so were the what -- who -- who -- and the apartments were -- and the houses and the villas and the homes were auctioned off to anyone who was permitted to take part in the auction.</span> <span id="s447">Books were written on the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So these people, when you went to visit, were afraid.</span> <span id="s449">Did they let you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Exactly, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s451">Yeah, they let me into the foyer and -- and I pointed out that they had this -- through this hallway you come to the kitchen, and off the hallway is the living room, to your left.</span> <span id="s452">And they were quite stunned by my memory as to their own home, the layout of their own home.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: And it was -- to me it was a slightly -- it wasn’t so very dramatic, it was more a -- more amusing in -- in a -- in a -- in a certain sense.</span> <span id="s455">Although I was touched emotionally la -- in seeing my old home.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Yes, I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Naturally, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did they let you get beyond the foyer, or did they -- did they not want you --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: I made no effort and they did really not invite me to --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s461">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: -- on the -- on the grand tour because their house or their apartment, their residence was not on the market for -- for --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: They had no intention of selling it --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: -- and I had no intention of buying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Henry, what was your first impression when you saw the luxury liner, the Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Oh, that was amazing.</span> <span id="s469">I was 10 and a half years old and I’d never seen a huge ship like that, and it was a very big ship.</span> <span id="s470">And, in fact it was owned by the Hamburg-America line and it -- it -- it had been used for pleasure cruises up to that time.</span> <span id="s471">And the captain, Gustav Schroeder was his name, turned out to be a very civil and -- and ya -- a wonderful human being, to say the least.</span> <span id="s472">He demonstrated a -- a feeling of humane -- he did not return a -- a -- upon our -- our attempt to find a place to -- to -- where we could la -- where -- disembark, and when that didn’t come to be, he delayed the departure for Europe as long as he could.</span> <span id="s473">And finally, ultimately, at the end of it all, he -- he -- they pronounced him as one of the Righteous Gentiles and that’s history, and planted a tree for him in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s474">So he was quite a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What was your room like?</span> <span id="s476">You -- did you st -- you stayed with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yeah, in a cabin.</span> <span id="s478">In a very, very --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Was it nice -- it was nice?</span> <span id="s480">You remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Yes, it -- it -- it was as nice as tourist class was, economy class was during that period.</span> <span id="s482">We did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Did you have a good time on the ship, or was the sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Excellent.</span> <span id="s485">No, I -- w-we played.</span> <span id="s486">We played games.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: A lot of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s489">Th-There were quite a few children on board.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: And we played games.</span> <span id="s492">It was a -- it was a -- a joyful occasion.</span> <span id="s493">For the adults I would say it w -- they -- they tried to make the adults as comfortable as the -- as the -- th -- as -- as they could.</span> <span id="s494">The-There were movies on board and there were -- there was a gala dinner, festivities of ca -- some kind.</span> <span id="s495">Th-That was on the way over, on the way back it was traumatic.</span> <span id="s496">But the first half of the voyage was one of pleasant anticipation.</span> <span id="s497">Although I must say the adults were -- had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s498">The -- as an adult, to leave your home behind, your culture and all that you were accustomed to beside your possessions, it was a -- th-they -- they were touched in a totally different way than the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: This affected you, I gather.</span> <span id="s500">You could feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: You could feel the tension that --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Among the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: -- that prevailed, yes.</span> <span id="s504">Those were not normal times, by any means.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Did you a -- you as a child, with the other kids that you were playing with, did you ever talk about it, or -- or this was not part of the discussion?</span> <span id="s506">Do you remember ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Among us children?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, but from what I -- I was told that there wa -- there were games which related to the times that we were living in.</span> <span id="s510">One particular game was one where they separated th-the kids into two groups.</span> <span id="s511">One was a Gentile group, the other one wa -- all the -- all of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s512">They separated them and they created a scenario by way of which they -- they -- the -- they reflected what was going on in -- in -- in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: In the -- in the way of drastic separation of the -- of the races.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: So that must have been difficult.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, even the game wasn’t funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No, it was not really -- it was not really funny.</span> <span id="s518">There were --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Which -- which --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: -- I didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: -- do you remember which side you were at?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: You know -- you know -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: No, no, I -- well, not really.</span> <span id="s525">And we -- we did other things.</span> <span id="s526">There was a swimming pool, we -- we swam it.</span> <span id="s527">There were lots of games for kids and the -- the -- the first half of the voyage went -- until we arrived in Havana, it was quite interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: And where did you eat?</span> <span id="s529">Did you eat with kids, or did you eat with the adults?</span> <span id="s530">Did you eat with your parents?</span> <span id="s531">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I sat at a table with my parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- and we ate in groups of families, just as a -- just as a cruise ship would be operated, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: There was no school -- there was schooling for kids on the ship --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: -- that was just fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s539">And the trip over lasted, I believe, 10 days --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And when you -- and did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: -- from Hamburg to Atlanta.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: -- did you understand that you were supposed to get off at Havana?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: You did understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Cause you were old enough by then, you were 10 and a half, so you had something --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yeah, well, it wasn’t so much the age as -- as the fact that suitcases were being packed and they were put out in front of the cabins for removal.</span> <span id="s548">There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that this was a point of debarkation and --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: -- and the entire events that took place supported that idea that we were at our dest -- point of destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: The people stood on the deck, on top deck, looked down at the -- at the ocean, at the water and from the shore of -- of Havana, little boats with family members who had preceded the Saint Louis, they came to greet their relatives on -- on board.</span> <span id="s553">And ma -- I had an uncle and an aunt and my cousin, who left Germany two weeks prior to the Saint Louis on a ship called the Iberia.</span> <span id="s554">And that ship carried 250 passengers.</span> <span id="s555">And their life and their future turned out to be completely different than -- than ours, which was named the voyage of the damned.</span> <span id="s556">They were far from damned because they --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: They disembarked?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: -- lived -- they lived -- they disembarked, they lived a year in Havana and waited for their -- their quota.</span> <span id="s559">America had a quota system for new immigrants and when their number came up, they immigrated to the United States in a perfectly legal manner.</span> <span id="s560">And so they stayed just shortly here in Havana, and then -- then moved the -- the 90 miles to the shores of the United States.</span> <span id="s561">And their life then turned -- my cousin joined the army, and he became an American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: And my uncle, who had been in the jewelry business in Germany, he became a representative for a watch company.</span> <span id="s564">They lived in a small town in Beaumont, Texas -- Beaumont, Texas, and -- and later on they moved to New York.</span> <span id="s565">And my cousin, who had been under the G.I. Bill of Rights became a watchmaker.</span> <span id="s566">And so they had a very normal -- normal future ahead of them, until we ourselves were reunited with them in 1947, at the end of World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So what was that like, that sort of suspension in Havana on the Saint Louis --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: -- where -- where you couldn’t get off, although there’s -- there’s one suicide, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, that was -- that was a dramatic turning point.</span> <span id="s571">To begin with there was the hope, the persistent hope that if we don’t get off the ship today, due to some administrative technicality, we would be -- we would be allowed to get off tomorrow.</span> <span id="s572">It -- it should be -- I should not fail to mention that the Hapag-America line, the Hamburg-America line, the shipping company did compel the passengers to pay for a return ticket, because we did not have authentic visas, as the -- the entry permit is known --is -- is known today.</span> <span id="s573">We did not have a -- a resident visa, we had a landing permit.</span> <span id="s574">And -- which was sold by a Minister of Immigration.</span> <span id="s575">And that, in the political arena, resulted in a jealous confrontation between various segments in the Cuban government, and the ultimate rejection of -- of the -- of the passengers to disembark.</span> <span id="s576">And so when then went past another day, and the American Jewish organizations used their -- tried to use their influence to somehow have Franklin Delano Roosevelt, F.D.R. as he was known, to -- to admit the passengers, which he failed to do, had he known that two-thirds of the passengers would end up in gas an-and g -- be gassed in -- in the death camps of Poland and Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka and so on, he may have -- in my view, he may have had -- taken a different sort of action.</span> <span id="s577">As it was, he -- he refused.</span> <span id="s578">In fact he marked a note with the comment, no action.</span> <span id="s579">He turned back every effort to allow these people to disembark.</span> <span id="s580">He and his administration sent the 937 victims to -- for most of them, to their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: And the ship ultimately appealed to Canada, to -- to every country in the world for asylum and the response throughout the world was the same, in th -- terms of not allowing these people into their respective countries.</span> <span id="s583">And this is precisely the reason that the Saint Louis became a -- a world event.</span> <span id="s584">Not in the same way as the Titanic, because the Titanic was sunk by an iceberg and the Saint Louis was sent back to Europe for an uncertain fate of their passengers by reason of politics and racial -- racial confrontation and discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: There’s a -- a report that the children wrote a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt from the ship.</span> <span id="s586">Were -- were you part of that, or you didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Not that at -- not that I, in all honesty, not that I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: -- but it was quite possible, but I do not remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s591">And she also didn’t answer, as far as --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I met Mrs. Roosevelt [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, I met her personally, which was -- since you mentioned that, and had you interviewed me at that time, or had you pushed the clock -- were we able to push the clock back --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: -- a number of years, I probably -- I may have just asked her that question.</span> <span id="s597">But I did not speak to her about the Saint Louis, but I met her.</span> <span id="s598">And I met her and she had an apartment in the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: And she stayed in the towers, and during my stay in -- which is probably going to come here and we’re going to probably going to touch on that, in switzer -- we ended up in Switzerland ultimately.</span> <span id="s601">Not being able to do -- to disembark in Cuba, the ship going back to Europe, we ended up ultimately by -- by way off other events, we ended up in Switzerland and I attended -- somewhere in time I attended hotel school.</span> <span id="s602">And having had this hotel experience, I went to the Park Sheraton Hotel in search of a position.</span> <span id="s603">And the general manager told me that it is the policy of the hotel to promote people from within the hotel, from within ranks of the hotel, and then -- then he asked his assistant, the assistant manager, he asked him, he says, how did you start here, to refresh his memory.</span> <span id="s604">So he said well, I started as an elevator operator.</span> <span id="s605">And this resulted in my working at the Park Sheraton Hotel as an elevator operator, and my passenger in that -- in -- in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Was Eleanor --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: -- was Eleanor Roosevelt, because she lived on top of the 25th floor and I had a job to take the elevator from the 25th to the 30th floor, consequently I saw her every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So did -- you never told her you had been on the Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No, I did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So she never knew your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: No, I did not do that because I felt that as an employee of the hotel, you just did not -- you did not create a personal relationship of that kind with your -- with your passengers.</span> <span id="s614">I -- I met many famous people and -- throughout my career, and -- and I met the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Soda Springs, where I had worked as a -- as a sous chef, as a cook, if you will, and I did not ask the Duke of Windsor if he really was a friend of Adolf Hitler, which later on reading books it became --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: -- apparent that he was a great sympathizer of the Nazi regime, prior to Britain entering the war, of course.</span> <span id="s617">But he was, and the House of Windsor, the -- and -- and -- and the -- and the [indecipherable] that was a relationship between the German aristocracy of the -- of the time and so on.</span> <span id="s618">But I did not discuss any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s620">What was it like on the trip back?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, in Havana one man jumped overboard.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: He lost his head, he lo -- he despaired, and in desperation he jumped overboard, cut his wrists.</span> <span id="s624">So you can imagine that panic ensued.</span> <span id="s625">When -- when it became apparent that we could not disembark, that the ship may ha -- may have to go back to Europe, back to Germany.</span> <span id="s626">Some people already had been in concentration camps and the feeling was one of utter panic.</span> <span id="s627">And the return voyage was very -- even -- even I as a young child realized the tension that existed.</span> <span id="s628">They wanted to capture the bridge -- and when I say bridge, I’m not talking about a card game, I’m talking about th-the -- the place where th-the command of the ship took place, where the captain and -- and his first and second officers and the instruments were located, that guided the ship to its destination.</span> <span id="s629">And the ship was a -- was on course for Europe.</span> <span id="s630">And organizations were still -- on a daily basis there were announcements that came over the ship radio that this and this occurred, this and this happened, and hope was given to -- to the passengers that they would find a country that would ultimately admit them.</span> <span id="s631">And so it was that just shortly be -- they had even planned to scuttle, if that’s the right word, to run the ship aground in the English channel, and thus set the ship on fire to -- to save -- to prevent people from having to return to Germany, and perhaps find -- find England receptive to -- to take these people in.</span> <span id="s632">And it wasn’t necessary to do that because shortly before entering the North Sea, German territorial waters, four countries -- four countries accepted the -- gave asylum to 200 and some of the passengers.</span> <span id="s633">And those four countries were, Belgium, Holland, France and England.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: We -- I’m afraid we have to stop, and we’ll continue it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Do you know who -- who negotiated with these four countries to allow --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes, there was one fellow, as a matter of fact the Holocaust Museum has a picture of it, his name was Troper, T-r-o-p-e-r.</span> <span id="s640">He was one of the negotiators.</span> <span id="s641">And then the various organizations like the Joint, J-o-i-n-t, Joint.</span> <span id="s642">Th-The -- we’ve got HIAS, ORT and [indecipherable] ORT, O-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Various Jewish organizations that operated in New York and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s645">They -- they all tried to motivate countries and governments to -- to accept.</span> <span id="s646">And then we were given asylum and -- and then of course the times, everything turned into a disaster, into a pathetic set of circumstances that resulted in the gassing of two-thirds of the passengers and a total disruption for the remaining people.</span> <span id="s647">It -- it was just simply too -- too much to even reflect upon.</span> <span id="s648">It -- we -- the French history throughout World War II was a sorry state of affairs.</span> <span id="s649">France was partitioned in the va -- France granted asylum, and the -- the French government quickly changed with the -- war started shortly after our de-debarkation.</span> <span id="s650">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: What -- let me ask you something, i-if I can interrupt.</span> <span id="s652">Why did you decide -- did you decide to go to France, or were -- was that a decision made for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: You could -- you could give a preference.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Which in some cases was adhered to, or was met, and in other cases they just -- you were just assigned to a country.</span> <span id="s656">If I’m not mistaken, my mother spoke some French, and my father, having been a chemist and created a perfume, and France being a le -- a -- a leader in the world of perfume, in -- in that particular [indecipherable] of -- that it could be possible that -- I do not know for sure whether we requested, or whether we got there by chance.</span> <span id="s657">All I know is that we finally th -- that people -- the boat went to -- to -- to Holland, Belgium, and we debarked in Bologne, which was Bologne, well, which was -- which was France.</span> <span id="s658">And my father never saw freedom again, he was interned as an -- as an alien, and he was interned in one or two different camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You mean he was interned by the French?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: By the French.</span> <span id="s661">France was split into two parts, into -- one part was under German occupation and consequently a very early and fast policy of seclusion, der -- of anti-Semitic decrees, one after the other [indecipherable] th-the telephone booth is -- you were not allowed to make long distance telephone calls, and you had to wear the jew -- by that time you had to wear the Jewish star and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s662">And -- and the other half was the non-occupied zone, run by the Vichy government, under the leadership of Marshal Pétain, who was a hero in World War I.</span> <span id="s663">He -- he distinguished himself at the Battle of Verdun.</span> <span id="s664">He -- in -- in world -- ’14 - ’18, the world -- first World War.</span> <span id="s665">He was a hero during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: You mean 19 -- 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, I mean, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: You said 1418.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yeah, 14 --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: -- to 19.</span> <span id="s672">1914 to 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Ah, really, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: And -- and he -- he was anti-Semitic, that -- that regime, with Laval, L-a-v-a-l Laval, they were fascist.</span> <span id="s675">They were without any question of a doubt of the same sentiment as Mussolini, they were definitely allied -- allied with the axis with -- with Germany, and enforced decrees that completely isolated and separated Jew -- the Jews.</span> <span id="s676">And -- and what followed was just a total disaster.</span> <span id="s677">They arrested the Jews in 1942 in conjunction with the s -- with the solving, quote unquote of the Jewish question, the -- the -- the big problem as to what to do with the Jews, the Final Solution.</span> <span id="s678">And anyone who ever has the opportunity to -- to hear that phrase, the Final Solution, need only put it into the internet browser and th -- you get 20 pages detailing the conference on Wannsee, which is outside of Berlin, a villa where the SS big shots, Eichmann, Himmler, Heydrich and Rosenberg and all these people, 15 in total, met, who were in charge of ultimately transporting and killing those Jews who were still alive, and eliminating Jews from the face of Europe, which -- which -- which indeed happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: And -- and my father was sent to Gurs, a hellhole.</span> <span id="s681">If there ever was a hellhole, that was one, on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Now he’s in southern France, southern --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: In si -- in -- near the Spanish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s685">And you and your mother go --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: And we and my mother were free.</span> <span id="s687">My mother was completely free by French or by fren -- by the -- by the French rules of the time, she was free.</span> <span id="s688">And I was sent, with all of the kids from the Saint Louis to a children home run by the ORT and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s689">And that children home was outside of Paris, about 25 kilometers from Paris, and they had a big banner, welcome to the children of the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s690">And to me, it was one of the worst times in my life, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Why now?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: -- I had never been separated from my parents, not even during the worst times in -- in Berlin prior to immigrating, and I was separated from my parents, which to me was very painful.</span> <span id="s693">And I stayed a few months in that home, along with the other children.</span> <span id="s694">And then my mother managed to get me to join her.</span> <span id="s695">My mother and I lived in a very, very small hotel.</span> <span id="s696">I had the occasion as a tourist to see that place a number of years later, and I was appalled because it had not been in my memory, what -- what I -- what I saw.</span> <span id="s697">It was like a -- a little dump.</span> <span id="s698">A very, very small hotel in the -- not far from the Follies Bergère, in the -- in Bon Nuvella, that’s a si-si -- a -- a [indecipherable] in the -- in the opera in -- in -- in Paris.</span> <span id="s699">And we lived in Paris for a few months, and my mother managed.</span> <span id="s700">I wished I had the opportunity -- well, I lost her, she passed away and why -- I would -- would have loved to ask how she managed to get us the papers to -- to go to the non-occupied zone, which we were able to leave Paris for Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: So we have done the French Riviera.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s704">Was sh -- was she in Le Man, or was she actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: In Le Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Now, that’s fairly far from Paris, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: 200 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: From Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: We stayed there, in a small house.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You stayed there -- that’s where you were staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: That’s where we were staying until we -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Left for Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: And still that’s now -- war had already started.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: The Germans has already occupied half of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Right [indecipherable] 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: And that happened right around the time -- overnight you had Dunkirk and the English who had been in Le Man disappeared in the middle of the night, abandoned their barracks and headed for Dunkirk, part of World War II and -- and went to -- and then escaped.</span> <span id="s720">Hitler was slow in making up his mind, he missed the boat, so to speak, and -- in more ways than one.</span> <span id="s721">He missed many boats because the troops, the English troops, by any means, went from Dunkirk back to -- into the mainland, to England, and thus escaped.</span> <span id="s722">And there were more than 250,000 of them.</span> <span id="s723">And that turned the war into the battle -- and that turned the war into the battle for England.</span> <span id="s724">Ultimately what followed was Pearl Harbor and the entry of America into the war.</span> <span id="s725">We went to Nice, to the French Riviera and lived there for a little more than a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Let me go back.</span> <span id="s727">Now wi -- did -- you -- you were only at this school, the Ozay sker -- school for a few months --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: -- before your mother got you.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Di-Did you have classes there, or you didn’t have classes?</span> <span id="s732">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: As I recall, we had classes, yes.</span> <span id="s734">We had classes and -- and we lived a fairly -- fairly normal life except it was war and we carried gas masks.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: And there were air raids.</span> <span id="s737">The German bombers -- the -- the -- there was a war on and Paris was declared an open city and consequently it was occupied.</span> <span id="s738">France surrendered.</span> <span id="s739">Belgium, Holland and -- Belgium, Holland capitulated in 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: And the passengers who had been assigned to those two countries fell into the Nazi hands, which -- which marked them -- which guaranteed -- sealed their -- their fate, marked them for extermination.</span> <span id="s742">That was as good as --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: But that didn’t happen with you and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, that didn’t happen, because we went to the non-occupied zone, and in the aftermath of the so-called Wannsee Conference, the solution of the final question, of the Jewish question, they -- from that point on, the speed with which European Jewry was arrested and sent to the camps, that went so fast, a-as -- as to reflect the -- the industrial talent and the great capacity of Germany to -- to manufacture the best of the best in terms of cars, that’s how they managed to deport the -- and with the cooperation of the French.</span> <span id="s745">The -- the French co-op -- would -- not only cooperated, but they were instrumental in -- in the shipping of their own native -- 70,000 native Jews were arrested and shipped to Auschwitz, along with all of the many immigrants who had found refuge and so-called asylum.</span> <span id="s746">They were all sent to -- and this fellow, just as we -- most of us know of Simon Wiesenthal, there was a counterpart in France, Serge Klarsfeld who documented the fate of -- of the French -- of the Jewish immigrants and the French and so forth.</span> <span id="s747">My father would di -- would -- became a -- I have a letter here that states in detail that my father was last -- he’d seen -- deported from Gurs, they liquidated that camp as -- that I had described as a hellhole because it -- you walked in mud.</span> <span id="s748">You -- the food was insufficient.</span> <span id="s749">If there was any food, it was insufficient.</span> <span id="s750">And you slept on straw, th-the hygiene, the circumstances were awful.</span> <span id="s751">And the transport -- my father was deported on the 10th of August 1942, to Auschwitz, and on French trains.</span> <span id="s752">And it was later established that the SS paid a certain amount of money for each passenger on those trains, on the French cattle wagons that took their -- their passengers to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: So this --</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: And there was all ste -- a hundred people to one car, without seats, standing room only, resulting in the death of a -- of quite a few people

Nice.</span> <span id="s798">But let’s go back to the beginning when you were in Nice, cause you were in Nice for a -- two years, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: About -- a little more than a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Little more than a year, I see.</span> <span id="s801">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Of which part of the time I was in hiding at

multilingual.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s849">And how did your Bar Mitzvah happen [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Well, my Bar Mitzvah, as I told you later on in -- much later, I -- I became a caterer, and I can tell you one thing, my Bar Mitzvah, from the Bar Mitzvahs taking place in the year 2000, or in the late 19 -- oh, a -- 19 whatever, th-that -- it was not a theme party.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: No, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: No, it was a -- but, the -- the -- with emphasis on -- on shall we say, the law,

id="s858">A: My mother was very, very -- oh, my mother was very -- she was determined to have me Bar Mitzvahed at the age of 13.</span> <span id="s859">And right here I got letters that she wrote to the camp in Gurs to ask that my father be given -- maybe call it naïve or call it whatever, I don’t know what you would call it, but she wrote a letter to the camp commander begging him to allow him to attend what she called the Holy Communion, as it is known in Christianity.</span> <span id="s860">And -- and she has these letters right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: And -- and of course they turned it down.</span> <span id="s863">So -- and she wrote these letters up to she still -- and then she wrote a letter -- I have that correspondence, part of which I gave to the Holocaust Museum, where she wrote she will never forgive France for not allowing my father to -- to attend that --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: -- most important of events in the life -- in the life cycle of a Jewish boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Was there a -- a little party?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: For those 20 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: In that little hotel, in that little dump.</span> <span id="s870">In that little hotel, in that little room, there was some herring, and I could recite the menu, it was very basic.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: But there was a kiddush, the re-reception.</span> <span id="s873">And not to be compared with what you have today.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: But it was a kiddush and my mother did her very best to make it memorable.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: And so it was.</span> <span id="s878">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Did you have friends who came?</span> <span id="s880">Kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s882">A couple of boys and their parents and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s884">So you have good memories of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s886">What I remember most of all however, was the fact that it had been my fervent wish to get a bicycle and my father wrote from Gurs to my mother that she should get that bicycle, and he wrote a letter to me that -- that I -- now my wish is fulfilled and I could take those trips, and indeed I did.</span> <span id="s887">I took trips from Cannes to Monte Carlo --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: On your bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: -- on bicycle, yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: -- yes, long trips on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s892">That was -- I lived for that, it’s beautiful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s893">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: So your father was allowed to write to you some?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: My father was allowed to write until his deportation.</span> <span id="s896">The correspondence, it was censored --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: -- by the French, Vichy government.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Tho -- ther -- those letters were -- the-they had these three lines across in yellow, green and blue, and th-they were cen-censored letters.</span> <span id="s901">But they were allowed, and my mother was allowed to send packages, food packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s904">And she did send packages and some of his letters indicated th-the wonderful bliss, the -- the pleasure he had for -- to eat a challah, after not having had a slice of bread in a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: So -- so -- and he shared this with his fellow inmates, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: So she never saw him either?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: But she was able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: And one day a parcel came back, letters came back, [speaks French here] left without leaving a forward address.</span> <span id="s911">And that was when he was sent to Drancy, a -- a -- another hellhole.</span> <span id="s912">An unfinished building de -- de -- designed to become a camp.</span> <span id="s913">It had no facilities, no hygiene, no toilets, nothing.</span> <span id="s914">And no electricity.</span> <span id="s915">It was completely unfinished.</span> <span id="s916">And people stayed there two and three days and then were shipped in those famous cattle wagons to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s917">And the story has it that a hundred women who were separated from their children jumped out of the windows and killed themselves.</span> <span id="s918">It’s all part of the legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Did you -- did you understand, did your mother understand what might happen, or that was -- that came much later?</span> <span id="s920">To your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: We understood the separation, we understood the deportation, and the hope, however, never left us until much, much later, that awful things were going on, but the details of the massive -- massive killings, leaked through much, much later, through some sources.</span> <span id="s922">The Germans were very, very good in keeping their activities, their murderous activities a secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: And -- but however, even A-American embassy officials and -- and -- with -- in conjunction with Raoul Wallenberg and other people of that kind, ga -- became knowledgeable that horrible things were occurring.</span> <span id="s925">And whereas American planes bombed the rail lines to I.G. Farben, which had slave labor, they used the camp inmates to operate their factories, it -- it -- it is said and it is remembered and it is a part of history that they did not bomb the rail lines leading to Auschwitz, because it would delay the war effort.</span> <span id="s926">Can I use a handkerchief [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Yes, absolutely use a handkerchief.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: It -- it -- followed that -- that -- that the -- the death machine roared day and night, and the crematoriums that --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: But that’s not something that you knew at the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: -- so that you -- you hoped that he would be okay</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, we did not know it.</span> <span id="s935">There was hope that he would be seen again or returned, almost up to the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: It only became known at the very end that he did not survive, that he was the victim of the persecution.</span> <span id="s938">And that is why I make it a point, the words to me have always had and always will have a significant meaning.</span> <span id="s939">Words stand for something, they stand for events.</span> <span id="s940">They describe events and words are very pertinent to -- to -- they go far beyond just the spelling of a word.</span> <span id="s941">The work Holocaust apparently did -- did -- did not come to be un-until the -- the -- the mid -- mid-70’s, because this letter that I have from the Red Cross ends with, it must be assumed that your father was a -- became a victim of the persecution.</span> <span id="s942">The word holocaust did not -- was not mentioned in that letter.</span> <span id="s943">They called it the persecution.</span> <span id="s944">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So a-after your father is sent -- oh, I guess maybe we should stop, since we don’t have too much time.</span> <span id="s946">So I won’t ask another question, we’ll stop the tape at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And go to the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Henry, what -- when did you have to go into hiding in Nice?</span> <span id="s952">This is wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: As they -- as they were picking up -- arresting the people on the boardwalk and searching for us, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: This is aft -- after the Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So does your mother find a place, is that what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Evidently these were Gentile acquaintance -- acquaintances who -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: And what was that like for you?</span> <span id="s959">The two of you went into hiding, you didn’t have -- y-you didn’t have much stuff anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Oh, it’s a little primitive, but they were very -- they were good people, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And where did you hide, in their attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: In the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: And were you able to come down at any point, did you just have to stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Stayed mostly in there.</span> <span id="s965">I -- I once ventured outside by myself, and in -- in an attempt to retrieve some of our more valuable possessions in that hotel where we stayed, but I was only partially successful.</span> <span id="s966">And we got then a -- we managed to get a guide who drove us to the foot of a mountain, from whence we were ultimately able to walk over farmland in the middle of the night, into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So how long did you stay in hiding in -- in Nice, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: It seemed like -- it seemed like a very long time, but I don’t know exactly how long it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Were you alone or were there other families there?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: There was one more family which then left, came and left.</span> <span id="s971">It was like a -- a hiding place that was organized by some knowledgeable people.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Were there children there as well --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: In the -- knowledgeable in the resistance movement or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Were there other children in the attic with you, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Much older than I. Children, I wouldn’t call -- call them children.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Children.</span> <span id="s977">And you were 13 at this point, or over 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yeah, I was over 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: So you understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I was 14 when I came into Switzerland --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: -- so now I must have been there for several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: So you understand much more of what’s going on by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes, yes, I came to understand what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Does your mother talk to you more about it, or if -- or is -- are you still sort of left in the dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Well, my mother passed away in 1970 --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: No, no, I mean then, in Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: We were preoccupied with how to make our way into Switzerland, how to save ourselves.</span> <span id="s989">And we crossed the border on a rainy night, the -- as expected the border guards had retreated into their huts.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Because it was raining?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: That was a bad night.</span> <span id="s994">And we managed to get literally to walk into Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Without being stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Well, where we were stopped, taken to a soccer field, to a dugout, that’s where, and met other refugees there.</span> <span id="s997">And a couple of days later we were taken to a -- a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s998">A very primitive camp that was our first point of -- of sanctuary in -- in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s999">What followed was a period of time that I spent with the various families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So you separated from your mother again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Cause she stays in the refugee camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: She was sent to a more permanent camp, and that camp consisted of a -- a resort hotel, which was transformed into a refugee camp because there was no tourism in Switzerland during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: So what the Swiss government did, they requisitioned all of those resort hotels and turned them into reception camps for their many refugees, of varied background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Was there a problem with your getting in, or not?</span> <span id="s1007">They didn’t have -- they didn’t have any issue with the fact that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: I did not encounter any anti-Semitism --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: In Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: -- in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Here is a -- an item in this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And that book is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yeah, this -- it -- it has here, it -- page --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: What’s the name of the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: “Swiss Wartime Work Camps.”</span> <span id="s1021">And here is has Henry Gallant, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A..</span> <span id="s1022">And it gives you a short synopsis of my relationship with Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1023">It said, “My mother and father and I left Germany May 13, 1939, bound for Havana, Cuba on the S.S. Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1024">That episode became known as the voyage of the damned.</span> <span id="s1025">My family and I disembarked in France, the other passengers were admitted in

<span id="s1028">My mother and I lived in Nice until September of 1942.</span> <span id="s1029">French collaborators arrested thousands of Jews and we found a hiding place in an attic and stayed there a few months until my mother arranged for false identification papers and a guide to take us to the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1030">We walked over pastures at night and entered at Switzerland illegally.</span> <span id="s1031">We were not sent back.</span> <span id="s1032">We were taken to a football field near Geneva, having crossed the border at Annemasse.</span> <span id="s1033">And after several days were sent to a Aufangslager reception camp at Ayresfield, Berner Oberland.</span> <span id="s1034">The camp was primitive, or rustic, as you would expect in basic training.</span>

That would have been a much longer journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: And more difficult to cross the Pyrenees, the mountains.</span> <span id="s1060">The Alps.</span> <span id="s1061">Switzerland was the logical place and besides, we had that family that had supported us partially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: They lived in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span

point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Up to the -- where we got out.</span> <span id="s1074">And he just said, walk over this field and you will come -- go straight and you will see ahead of you a mountain.</span> <span id="s1075">Try to make yourself -- try to make it possible to cross that -- that mountain.</span> <span id="s1076">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: That must have been

You’ve got a good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: So who -- yeah right -- so who was -- who was on your passport, if it was a fake paper?</span> <span id="s1159">What was the name?</span> <span id="s1160">It was still Heinz Goldstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: I would imagine.</span> <span id="s1162">Or it was a totally different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: It would have to be a different name --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: I -- I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: -- you couldn’t be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: -- no, I have -- I have --

of fact, we were stopped by a gendarme, that’s just a side incident.</span> <span id="s1175">We were, the -- the car was stopped by a gendarme who looked at those papers.</span> <span id="s1176">My mother spoke some French, in fact, she spoke good French.</span> <span id="s1177">And -- and the gendarme, this I remember distinctly, the gendarme saying in a certain voice, Sa sont vous papier?</span> <span id="s1178">These are your papers, and my mother said, oh, oui, bien sur.</span> <span id="s1179">And o -- and -- and he -- and he said, [speaks French here] he said -- and he made no -- he -- he -- in my view, in my recollection, he left no doubt at all that -- that he was aware these papers were -- were faked.</span> <span id="s1180">And -- but he also seemed to indicate that he knew the times we were living in, and he -- we were just fortunate in running in -- ther -- there were people like that throughout the history of World War II.</span> <span id="s1181">People who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Who just turned and looked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: -- yes, there were people like that.</span> <span id="s1184">There were people like that in

things that could have cost them dearly had -- had -- you know, had it become known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: So what does this -- what does this gendarme say to your mother?</span> <span id="s1187">This -- these are your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: [speaks French] -- if you believe these to be your papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: -- then you may proceed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: I see, so it was clear that he was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Clear, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1193">Left no doubt in my mind whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1195">And that happened before you came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: And I hear that as if it -- as if you were talking to me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1198">And that was before Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: This is way before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: That was midway.</span> <span id="s1204">We were just stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: There were roadblocks at th -- that was one of those roadblocks.</span> <span id="s1207">As it was leading to the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: The border of Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1211">So this is a French gendarme --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: An -- absolutely, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: -- or border --</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: -- certainly a French gendarme.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: La gaul si ville --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Right.</span></p>

as you start to go because you have no idea what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: I wa -- yes, I -- that is what I would -- would -- would call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: So when you were -- when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: That was one of those moments, one of those terrible moments of -- of stress and anxiety and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1224">And then you got over it, and then you just kept going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Do you remember that the weather changed?</span> <span id="s1227">That the -- that it didn’t stay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: The last thing on -- on my mind during that period was the weather.</span> <span id="s1229">I ma -- I don’t know what transpired exactly in my thoughts, but the weather was not part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Did you hate this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Did I hate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Were you angry that you had to go through this, or was this just a normal time somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I think my entire life I just take things as they come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: There are always moments that you -- that one dislikes and that one does not find terribly amusing or exciting or enjoyable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: But I guess that’s part of being here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Better being here than not being here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Than not being here.</span> <span id="s1241">Did you complain to your mother as your -- as this -- because your change starts when you’re seven, eight years old.</span> <span id="s1242">I mean, your -- you’re not a grown person.</span> <span id="s1243">So do you complain to your mother, or do you fee -- do you feel as a kid that things are so bad, they’re happening for everybody, they’re so bad that I shouldn’t complain?</span> <span id="s1244">Do you have any recollection of what that was like for you as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: That’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s1246">I -- I don’t think that -- that -- complaining really was not par-part of my -- my psychological make-up.</span> <span id="s1247">I -- I do not complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Did you ever cry, when you were alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I cried -- I cried terribly when I was separated from my mother in -- upon disembarking in -- in France --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: In France, when you went to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Yeah, that was -- that was a horrible -- that was one of the most horrible time, cause I had never been previously separated, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Right, right, so that’s when you cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: That separation was, you know, in the -- not knowing which and what was going to happen and so forth.</span> <span id="s1254">That went on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Did anyone talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: N-No, because I did my crying in the solitude of my own person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I -- to be -- to be precise, I would not -- it -- it wasn’t in my nature to cry in public.</span> <span id="s1259">I did not -- I had enough sense of awareness that I went to the bathroom and cried.</span> <span id="s1260">But I was very unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Yeah, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yeah, I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1263">I was very unhappy, it was the epitome of loneliness at that very moment in time and place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: And do you think your parents knew that about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Well, my father wasn’t -- was not bothered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: He’s not there, right, but your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A:

--</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Except she very quickly tried to get you out of that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Yeah, a few -- it -- I think -- not a -- weeks, or a couple of months transpired, more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Oh, so maybe she knew, but you didn’t know that she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I think the French, if I’m not mistaken, if I remember correctly, the French instit -- set into motion a law that women with children could -- could have their children with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: And I think it was in context with that ordinance, or with that new law that -- that we were reunited.</span> <span id="s1278">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: -- pretty much as I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Okay, right.</span> <span id="s1282">So how long were you in the soccer field in Switzerland, do you remember?</span> <span id="s1283">Days, weeks, hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: And they gave you sufficient food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1287">Th -- it was like camp style --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: So you were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah,

--</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: You never remember being hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: N-No, no, they took care of us.</span> <span id="s1294">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: And that was -- that’s been true throughout this whole circumstance, that you were not hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: And I was not very demanding either, you know -- you know, I think continental breakfast was invented in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s1297">That consists of a slice of bread, marmalade and a piece of margarine or butter and a glass of milk.</span> <span id="s1298">This is breakfast, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: And that was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Or in -- in Switzerland it was also commonplace, I spent a -- a certain amount of time on a farm because the Swiss men were -- they had to serve in the army, so they took -- by that time I was already -- I was no more a child in that sense and I worked on a farm.</span> <span id="s1301">And breakfast consisted of the typical Swiss Rösti, you know, like potatoes that -- not potato pancakes, but like hash brown potatoes.</span> <span id="s1302">They would grind them and then fry them and this -- this, and bread --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Were they good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Oh yeah, excellent.</span> <span id="s1305">This and bread and milk and so forth, o -- coffee au lait, you know, touch of coffee with a lot of milk was breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: So, you -- are you -- you’re very adaptable as a kid.</span> <span id="s1307">You -- you keep [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah, I was -- I found myself to be adaptable to a -- to a lot of different circumstances.</span> <span id="s1309">And my -- the time I spent in Switzerland, these families, I think I mentioned it, they were of a different background.</span> <span id="s1310">I spent a year with a secular Jewish family, one that was not religious.</span> <span id="s1311">I mean, it was nothing extraordinary to have a pork roast for dinner.</span> <span id="s1312">And -- and then I spent a little over a year with a secondary Gentile family, secondary teacher.</span> <span id="s1313">And lo and behold, I ended up with an Orthodox family, a very religious Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: That was the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: That was the last family, right, that’s when I attended the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: So what are the circumstances of your staying with a family?</span> <span id="s1317">Are you sort of like a foster kid, they get money from someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Exactly, exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: We -- the Swiss -- the Swiss organiza -- they were organized and -- and th-they -- they had a -- a branch of c-call it the Red Cross or something, administer the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the so-called youngsters, teenagers and so forth, they were kind of separated from the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Were there other children in the family, I mean, in these families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: In one family there were two boys wi -- they were a little older than I, and in the Gentile family there were two -- two girls.</span> <span id="s1323">One is -- I think is 20 or 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Sounds nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Very interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Why was it interesting?</span> <span id="s1327">Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Well, it was -- it was interesting that we -- difficult to go into -- in -- into details, but it -- it was a novelty of sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: For you to be around girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: The environment for me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1333">I mean, I was in, call it puberty, or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1334">And they were also very curious, these -- th-th -- that family was very curi -- there were questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: So they wanted to know about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: They knew about the Jewish lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1337">Probably their knowledge -- their Biblical orientation.</span> <span id="s1338">And whatever it follows the -- the -- the varied traditions of -- I’m trying to be as diplomatic as I possibly can.</span> <span id="s1339">But they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Do you want to be less diplomatic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: I said, do you want to be less diplomatic?</span> <span id="s1343">A: I-If your curiosity compels you to -- to do -- do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: I’ll ask, yes, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yeah, well, they had never seen a circumcised boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: And it was quite a new experiment, you know, a new experience, rather, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: And th-they -- they -- they wanted to -- to see what this thing looks like you know?</span> <span id="s1350">And of course I wasn’t -- I wasn’t about to disrobe, if you will --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- under these -- in -- in this particular circumstance.</span> <span id="s1353">But, I said, if you accidentally -- I said, I’m going to take a bath or a shower and if you happen to walk in, that won’t bother me one bit.</span> <span id="s1354">Something along that line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Was that uncomf --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: -- a -- but there was nothing new, really, they -- they -- that was nothing -- nothing new.</span> <span id="s1359">I remember seeing a -- a film where -- with -- where Jews were in jeopardy and the only way that these guards could ascertain the -- the religious, you know, that they had caught up the Jews or not would be exactly through this ritual which -- which by the -- in -- in -- in -- among Jews is commonplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Were you seeing your mother at this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yes, they had a -- they had a rule that the Swiss government -- I call it the government but it was a branch of the government in charge of imi -- affairs of immigration.</span> <span id="s1364">And they had a rule that children, or teenagers or whatever, family members may be reunited for a period of three days every six weeks.</span> <span id="s1365">So while I was with this family, I actually saw my mother every six weeks for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: And that -- that was true for each of the three families that you were with, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1368">And they even paid the expense of the guesthouse where you were staying and the -- and the meals and so forth.</span> <span id="s1369">That -- that they did, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Was this difficult for you to see your mother and then have to go away for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Well, it wasn’t exactly easy, but you know, th -- I can remember it.</span> <span id="s1372">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1373">We were close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: You know, and due to the conditions that existed at that time.</span> <span id="s1376">And -- and then la -- three days go by, and you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And then she’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Yeah, but you look forward to the next six weeks, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: I mean to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: She --</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: And she was in a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s1384">And what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Well, they called it a camp.</span> <span id="s1386">They can’t call it a resort hotel, you know?</span> <span id="s1387">So a camp can mean -- can mean two things.</span> <span id="s1388">A camp need not be -- need not be a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: After all.</span> <span id="s1391">But a camp is not a home either, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: So the word camp could -- could imply anything, you know?</span> <span id="s1394">Children in the summer go to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Was she living in bad conditions, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: No, she wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s1401">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: So do you correspond with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: So in between the visits --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1406">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: So it must have been important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Quite frequently as a matter of fact, yeah.</span> <span id="s1409">Both ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Did you end up saving those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: There are some of those letters, a couple of letters are floating around among ma -- among hi -- literally hundreds of pictures, which I have never bothered, throughout the years to -- to catalog in a picture album.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: They are in boxes [indecipherable] and they really come from every -- from every stage, I always -- I would say every era.</span> <span id="s1414">I have pictures from our life in Berlin before the war.</span> <span id="s1415">I have pictures of our time spent in Nice, on the French Riviera.</span> <span id="s1416">I have pictures that were taken in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1417">And beside having stayed with these families, I spent the little -- a little more than one year in a boarding school, which was known by the name of Ecole d’Humanité.</span> <span id="s1418">Ecole means school and Humanité means humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: The school of humanity.</span> <span id="s1421">And the professor and his wife, who ran that school were two German Gentiles who left Germany at the onset of Hitler taking the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: I think we have to stop there.</span> <span id="s1423">So why don’t we start there, when you talk about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: That’s a good point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: -- boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Excellent point to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1431">We ended and you started talking about the boarding school, Ecole d-Humanité.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Yeah, Ecole d’Humanité.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s1434">This was in Switzerland, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1436">In Switzerland, not far from Zurich.</span> <span id="s1437">And it was operated by a fellow whose name was Paul -- Paolos -- Paolo -- Paul Geheeb.</span> <span id="s1438">He had a very famous school in -- in Germany, which was, I would say, 50 years ahead of its time.</span> <span id="s1439">He -- it was very classic.</span> <span id="s1440">He -- he was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi.</span> <span id="s1441">He knew intimately Rabbi Don Attagori, the famous author.</span> <span id="s1442">And if you went up to the dormitories along the stair what -- what do you call it, the stairs, you had pictures from Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Maxim Gorky.</span> <span id="s1443">And it was all about the classics.</span> <span id="s1444">And on Saturday they -- they would have what they called andoch, a certain evening of spiritual -- spiritual -- spirituality or something.</span> <span id="s1445">And they would play Beethoven’s Fifth, or Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Mozart, Beethoven, Hayden, Bach, Brahms and Handel and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1446">And my entire th -- wa -- culture was written with a capital C. And I went to this school along with a lot of other children who were refugees in Switzerland during that time, and among the student body were two brothers and that’s a very interesting item.</span> <span id="s1447">There were two brothers, the nephews of the chief of staff of the German -- German army, whose name was Walter von Brauchitsch.</span> <span id="s1448">And their name was Hans and Matteas von Brauchitsch.</span> <span id="s1449">And we were very close, we were friends.</span> <span id="s1450">And in the issue of “Life” magazine of May 1946 there’s a caption where German general’s nephews went to school with Jewish -- the Jewish immigrants.</span> <span id="s1451">And there’s one picture of me and -- and the Brauchitsch brothers.</span> <span id="s1452">And we have kept in touch all throughout my stay here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1453">And I went to that school for about a little more than a year.</span> <span id="s1454">And in 1947 I came to America.</span> <span id="s1455">Immigrated legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: So was that school -- was it -- it good for you to be in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Well, I think it was very good, it -- in retrospect it was very good because the emphasis on culture is basically where even today I -- I developed the -- the taste or a liking for classic music, for example.</span> <span id="s1458">And had I not gone to that school, well I’m not saying that -- that the Stones or the Beatles or whatever are not wonderful to listen to, or that it’s not part of -- e-each age has its sed -- has its own music, so to speak, but classic music is forever and I came to appreciate it and then even today have an appreciation for classic music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: And it was developed in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: In that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Did you work at that school also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Well, I -- my skill that I acquired in hotel school, I did pretty much run the kitchen there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: When did you go to hotel school?</span> <span id="s1466">I don’t think we spoke about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: To hotel school, when I stayed with my last family, that Orthodox -- I think I mentioned the Orthodox Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Well, I spent the -- I went to school in the daytime, to hotel school and in the evening I would come home, to what was then home, a foster home, if you will, to -- to those people that I stayed with.</span> <span id="s1470">But that was the period that I went to hotel school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: And is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: And that was in Lucerne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And is that before the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: That was before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: So what was it like to have the war end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Excuse me, I have to change that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: It was at the end of the war, because the school occupied one half of the building and the other half was a hotel.</span> <span id="s1479">And our guests at the time -- it was just at the end of the war, our guests at the time were G.I.s who were on a seven day rest trip to Switzerland, what they called, R and R, rest and relaxation.</span> <span id="s1480">They came there to spend seven days in Lucerne and that was my first experience with real Americans and th-their lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1481">And when I say lifestyle I’m referring to the meals that they ate.</span> <span id="s1482">And they ate the apple pie and left the crust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: They left the crust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: For the most part, yeah.</span> <span id="s1485">At the end of the meal there were -- you could see -- that was, to us was completely strange because it is a European custom to finish what you have on your plate, unlike the way we live.</span> <span id="s1486">If we’re not crazy about something we certainly don’t eat it, we just leave it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: So what did you think of these guys leaving the crust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Oh, they were terrific -- oh, the gu -- they were terrific.</span> <span id="s1489">The -- in -- in those days, I -- they will never come again, 1945, everything that was American was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: -- was great.</span> <span id="s1492">From a Parker 51, which were the fountain pens, to -- to Chesterfield or Camel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1494">A: -- cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1495">The -- the very plain, G.I. issued raincoats -- anything that was American was fabulous.</span> <span id="s1496">And the guys, the soldiers were -- really, they were kids.</span> <span id="s1497">They were in their -- 20 - 21 - 22.</span> <span id="s1498">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: But your se -- you’re about 17 when the war ends, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1501">And they were about 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: And -- and they were -- I met them in night clubs, they -- doing the jitterbug and all that was American, you know.</span> <span id="s1504">It was very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: And is it because you met them that you wanted to come to the United States, or did you want to come anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Oh no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1507">We had -- we had wanted to come to America in the -- in the late 30’s.</span> <span id="s1508">Our trip to -- that -- the voyage, the so-called voyage of the damned was a prelude to entering the United States.</span> <span id="s1509">Our trip to Cuba was -- was part of waiting out the -- the quota number to come up.</span> <span id="s1510">So that was -- we had intended to go to America all along.</span> <span id="s1511">Cuba was not our -- was not to be our final destination.</span> <span id="s1512">Our quest was to enter the United States, come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: So what was the end of the war like in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1514">Was it very happy, or -- I mean it -- was it -- did you mark it, or did it just sort of pass you by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: No, it was a transition, it was a transition.</span> <span id="s1516">It was also the time that we were to find out that our father would never return, you know?</span> <span id="s1517">And it was the beginning of -- of a new -- of kind of a new life.</span> <span id="s1518">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: How did you find out about your father?</span> <span id="s1520">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: I got that -- that letter from the Red Cross, that who -- they researched this and their findings indicated that he was deported to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: And did you and your mother ask for that information?</span> <span id="s1523">Was that how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1527">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1528">And that was the response.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: So, there’s a great sadness at the same time that you’re happy the war is over, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yeah, the -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s1531">Surprisingly, the way I s -- remember it today, tha -- when you have a loved one whom you haven’t seen for six or so years, the -- the shock is somewhat diminished.</span> <span id="s1532">As they say, the time heals all wounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: The what?</span> <span id="s1534">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Time heals --</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Heals all wounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: -- all wounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: That’s what they say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: I know, but I’m asking you whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: You -- it -- I -- I’d -- I would a -- I would say that that is ma -- very much so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: I would [indecipherable] to that.</span> <span id="s1544">Maybe not all wounds, you never forget.</span> <span id="s1545">But of course you don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1546">But the intensity of losing a loved one is stronger in the early stage of absence than after a number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: And you think that was true for your mother, or you think it was different?</span> <span id="s1548">A: It’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s1549">I don’t know how my mother felt.</span> <span id="s1550">I wouldn’t know how, but you don’t know what -- in -- in -- intimately you don’t know what another person is really feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: So I can’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: You miss a person that is close to you, perhaps forever.</span> <span id="s1555">I’m merely referring to the intensity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: The shock, the drama.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Right, right, it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: You know?</span> <span id="s1560">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: So, when the -- the war is over, do you go -- you -- you leave the foster home and you go to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: When the war was over I had -- I lived with my mother for a period of time until we actually came over on the S.S. America, one of the ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Was it difficult to get -- to get a visa to come to the United States or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Well, it took a number of years.</span> <span id="s1565">As you know, we were refused admission in 1939, and at the end of the war it was very easy, the sympathy for -- for the victims of the -- now known as Holocaust was -- was very much -- was very acute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: So it was not difficult to enter the United States at the end of the war for victims of the -- of the period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: But you then had to make another change.</span> <span id="s1569">Did you know English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yes, I had learned English and I was rather good at it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Oh, you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: You -- and your mother spoke English fluently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: She did also, mm-hm --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: -- mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: But -- all right, so the-there’s not a linguistics problem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: So I came to America, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: -- and I had relatives who had preceded -- I had more than one relative who had preceded us in -- in their quest to live in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: And they -- I -- we spent a couple of days in New York, then I went to Philadelphia, where I had an uncle, an aunt and two cousins.</span> <span id="s1583">And I worked in a Swiss pastry shop as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: In Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: -- in Philadelphia for a few days and then they also had a pastry shop in Atlantic City, so they transferred me to Atlantic City, and that was my first experience, so to speak, after arriving in New York and in New York I spent a few days.</span> <span id="s1586">My aunt took me to see a musical, my first musical, which I still remember distinctly was Oklahoma with Gordon MacRae.</span> <span id="s1587">And -- and then I went to Atlantic City, and Atlantic City wasn’t a very exciting place in -- at that time.</span> <span id="s1588">It went through several transitions.</span> <span id="s1589">At the time I got to Atlantic City was in 1940 -- in 1947, and you had the boardwalk --</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: -- and the old part of the -- of Atlantic City.</span> <span id="s1592">It was a highlight, it was the time when Saratoga, the horses, they -- the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs.</span> <span id="s1593">I mean, America was something different, totally different and much different than it is today.</span> <span id="s1594">Atlantic City in particular went through different stages.</span> <span id="s1595">You know, from that era -- from that time it -- it got completely run down until gambling came to Atlantic City.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: And then you had a different -- you had a different place again, you know, the old people got chased out of their homes and they built fabulous hotels like in Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s1598">So after Atlantic City I visited my cousin in Beaumont, Texas and I stayed there for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s1599">And then returned to New York and worked in -- as a cook in a couple of hotels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: And did you come back to New York because you didn’t want to stay in these other places?</span> <span id="s1601">I mean, why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Well, Beaumont, Texas was not really my -- my first choice.</span> <span id="s1603">It was a wonderful place, it has m -- great -- at that time a great little town, today it’s a great big town.</span> <span id="s1604">But it wasn’t where I wanted to be and also in my -- in -- in my -- in the pursuit of my career, I -- I was a chef at the time and worked at the old Astor Hotel, which meanwhile has been torn down.</span> <span id="s1605">I worked in the Hotel New Yorker and at a later stage I worked at the Waldorf Astoria for about 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1607">As a chef?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: No.</span> <span id="s1609">I didn’t know wa -- there’s a chef.</span> <span id="s1610">I worked in the -- in the nightclub, in the Empire room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1612">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: And that was the -- it was the showroom -- I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: I was a captain.</span> <span id="s1616">That is the closest to the maitre’d.</span> <span id="s1617">I had a section of the -- of the room that was under my direction, the service, per se.</span> <span id="s1618">And I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s1619">The showroom -- we had one act following another.</span> <span id="s1620">We had Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee, Dinah Shore, the Pointer Sisters, Diana Ross and the Supremes.</span> <span id="s1621">Maurice Chevalier and Gilbert Bécaud, a French singer.</span> <span id="s1622">And Charles Aznavour, another French singer.</span> <span id="s1623">And we had -- and the guests that attended these performances, we had Liza Minelli and so forth.</span> <span id="s1624">And I enjoyed that very much, it was very entertaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Did you mind not being a chef, or you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: No, when I went to hotel school I took two courses, actually.</span> <span id="s1627">I became a -- a -- I -- I took a -- in -- in -- I took a course in the culinary art, but I also took a course in a -- a service course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: And in -- in my career, I -- I was a maitre’d for a number of years and not just in the Empire room, but I also worked -- the Empire room closed -- actually the Empire room was a seasonal affair.</span> <span id="s1630">It closed in July and reopened in late September, which to me was -- was very beneficial.</span> <span id="s1631">It was not only benef -- it was very convenient, because I used those two or three summer months to -- to work in the Catskill mountains.</span> <span id="s1632">And I got a great deal of experience in the Catskill mountains.</span> <span id="s1633">I worked in some of the great hotels, of which most of them are closed.</span> <span id="s1634">It’s all part of an era that is history long forgotten, but at that time the epitome of elegant living.</span> <span id="s1635">A -- I would say a culture that just simply, like so many other things, a culture that disappeared.</span> <span id="s1636">Of the approximate two million Jews living in New York, you could safely say that 99 percent of them spent their summers in -- in the Catskill mountains, if not for the whole summer, then for a weekend, or -- or for a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: So what hotel did you work at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: I worked at Grossingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Which is an -- an icon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: I worked at The Concord, another icon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: I was the maitre’d in The Pines in South Fallsburg.</span> <span id="s1645">I was the maitre’d in a place called Gibbers, and The Evans in Loch Sheldrake.</span> <span id="s1646">And I also was the maitre’d for two seasons -- you must remember that this was seasonal, so when you say, well, you’ve worked in so many different places, the answer to that is simple, it -- these were seasonal hotels that opened up for Passover in -- generally in April, around April, closed again after Passover and reopened in June, around Memorial day and stayed open until the high holidays, the Jewish holidays, like Sukkahs and Simchas Torah and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1647">And I worked there on th -- for the entire summer, until the Empire room opened up in late September and that’s when I went back to the Empire room.</span> <span id="s1648">So I spent 10 years in the Empire room, with the exception of the summers, which I spent in the Catskills.</span> <span id="s1649">And these hotels in the Catskills had -- each had their own -- its own identity.</span> <span id="s1650">The Grossinger and the Concords were family hotels.</span> <span id="s1651">A place I worked at was called Shavunge Lodge.</span> <span id="s1652">That was a place for singles.</span> <span id="s1653">The Waldameer was a place for singles, but older singles.</span> <span id="s1654">So each of these hotels had their own clientele.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: And it was a pleasant -- pleasant time.</span> <span id="s1657">And -- but all in the past, because 90 percent of all these hotels do no longer exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: So how long were you in this business?</span> <span id="s1659">A: In this business I was until the major change occurred in 1975 when we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span id="s1660">And th -- what happened is that the acts that I had mentioned in the Empire room, Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis, Dinah Shore and the Pointer Sisters, they all -- and Liza Minelli and all of these people had a salary of approximately six to 7,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1661">Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé was another, and Ed Sullivan.</span> <span id="s1662">These were the days th-that -- Jack Benny and George Burns -- not only is that time gone, like -- like gone with the wind, but it has disappeared and so -- and -- an-and it ex -- it precisely happened at a time when the salaries of these e-entertainers went sky high.</span> <span id="s1663">And the Empire -- and then it became a matter of -- strictly of economics.</span> <span id="s1664">The Empire room had 500 seats and the cover charge, meaning the -- meaning the cost of simply getting a table to sit down, it did not even cover a drink or anything to eat, that way the cover charge was a so-called entry ticket, if you will.</span> <span id="s1665">And the cover charge went from five dollars to 15 dollars per person.</span> <span id="s1666">And then it went to 25 dollars.</span> <span id="s1667">At the same time the salaries from 7,000 dollars went to 35,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1668">So high that at one point it got to -- it became a reality that Barbra Streisand got one million dollars to appear in the room for one week.</span> <span id="s1669">And it was logical that the hotel could not sustain, even though the -- the nightclub was not designed to make money, it was mainly designed to attract conventions and people to fill the rooms.</span> <span id="s1670">That was the idea, to fill the rooms.</span> <span id="s1671">But those salaries were unsupportable, so the only place that you could have that kind of entertainment would end up to be Las Vegas, where the profit and the money came from the gambling tables.</span> <span id="s1672">And in 1975, the Empire room closed.</span> <span id="s1673">It -- it -- and it became just a banquet facility, and the nightclub as such, as it was known, no longer existed.</span> <span id="s1674">And -- and the only place that you could have the kind of entertainment would be in a facility where three or four thousand people would cor -- would congregate, would sit.</span> <span id="s1675">And that was Las Vegas and a place in New Jersey and vary -- some venues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: So what -- what did you do in Atlanta?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: In Atlanta I worked through my connections at that time in the hotel industry.</span> <span id="s1678">I came close to the management of the Fairmont Hotel company, which was based at the time in San Francisco, in Denver and in New Orleans.</span> <span id="s1679">And they had a t -- a hotel in -- in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1680">But that was in 1975, and Atlanta had not as yet become what you would like to call an international city.</span> <span id="s1681">And they were not used to -- and the -- they were not used to those prices.</span> <span id="s1682">And so when I said that I -- first hand experience, I -- I came to manage the Venetian Room, which was the nightclub in the Fairmont Hotel.</span> <span id="s1683">And Tony Bennett appeared there and -- and well, and a number of other entertainers.</span> <span id="s1684">And when the phone rang for someone to make reservations, they would say, well how much does it cost to get in?</span> <span id="s1685">So I would say, well the cover charge is 15 dollars.</span> <span id="s1686">And the response on the other end would be, and what do you get for that?</span> <span id="s1687">And without trying to -- without -- trying to avoid to sound sarcastic, I would say well, you get a table, and you get to sit down.</span> <span id="s1688">But how else -- what else would you say?</span> <span id="s1689">Th-That was the logical answer.</span> <span id="s1690">And consequently the entertainment of that -- that caliber of entertainment again went the way they did it in New York.</span> <span id="s1691">And so Richard Swig, who was owner of the hotel decided that Atlanta -- the only thing that would work in Atlanta would be western entertainment.</span> <span id="s1692">And so they brought in Loretta Lynn and a couple of other -- and Alison Krauss, some people with a [indecipherable] with a reputation in the area of western music.</span> <span id="s1693">And so you had a lot of -- I don’t want to use the term -- I -- I think that to say rednecks, you know, would probably not take -- take too well, so let’s say country folk, or whatever you will.</span> <span id="s1694">But they -- the western music in -- in that -- that kind of caliber of western music didn’t do it either.</span> <span id="s1695">And del -- later on, a number of years later, Atlanta got very fine restaurants and it built tremendous hotels and what was expensive at tha -- at that time turned out to be cheap because prices went up and -- and Atlanta grew to be an international city, and they built a new airport and it is what it is today, you know, a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: When -- when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: In 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: And how did you meet Ilsa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Well, I had worked in -- in upstate New York, in a place -- in a -- I was still in the Empire room and I connected with the owners of the Marcie Hotel which was located in Lake Placid, which is close to Canada.</span> <span id="s1700">And at the end of the season -- it was a seasonal operation al-also, the Marcie Hotel.</span> <span id="s1701">It closed around September when the Empire room opened.</span> <span id="s1702">But I had a few days off and I went to Montreal because having lived in France and speaking French, Montreal was the ideal place to spend a couple of days, and I went to Montreal for a three day weekend and I met Ilsa, my wife for -- who would become ultimately my wife, met her in -- in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1703">And -- and the rest is more or less history, we -- she came to visit me in New York and we became very good friends and ultimately --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: But how long did it take you to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Well, I -- that’s a very fine question -- that’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s1706">I must have un -- unconscio -- unconsciously had -- I ha -- I had without knowing it, I -- by that time I was in my very, very early 30’s and I had become accustomed to -- to -- I was -- probably I -- I was a bachelor of sort, and I used to spend the summer in Europe and the -- the wer -- and th -- on one of those -- and in -- Ilsa and I, we were -- she was in Miami, and I was in Miami, but we were not married at the time.</span> <span id="s1707">And then one nice summer, she went to Las Vegas and returning from Europe, I called her up.</span> <span id="s1708">But I noticed that her voice was slightly distant, there was a kind of change of sorts had taken place.</span> <span id="s1709">And naturally after we had been -- we were friends for four years, you know.</span> <span id="s1710">So she must have said to herself, enough is enough, this guy’s got to make up his mind.</span> <span id="s1711">And she had met other friends.</span> <span id="s1712">And I decided right then and there on the spur of the moment that this is it, my time has come, I’m getting married.</span> <span id="s1713">And we spent a few days in San Francisco and returned to Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s1714">So we got married in Vegas.</span> <span id="s1715">In Vegas.</span> <span id="s1716">Was a gamble, but it turned out -- turned out to be a winner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: It [indecipherable] a gamble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: We’re going to have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: What did you do in Atlanta after 1975?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yeah, I had connections in the Waldorf, in the -- in the Empire room and at -- wh -- in which I had been a assistant maitre’d.</span> <span id="s1725">I had connections of people who -- who were connected to the Fairmont Hotel chain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: And wa -- one became food and begeda -- food and beverage director at the San Francisco Fairmont and from there moved to -- to Denver, to the -- and opened up the Denver Fairmont and ultimately ended up in Atlanta in -- and entertained the position of resident manager.</span> <span id="s1728">And he called me in New York a-at which time the Empire room was on very thin ice because of the rising -- the ra -- the scale of the entertainment compensation, which the room could not sustain, with its limited amount of seating.</span> <span id="s1729">And so we di -- he asked me if I work -- if I would be considering taking over the Venetian room as a manager.</span> <span id="s1730">And I went to -- to Atlanta and stayed in the hotel for about two weeks and looked the situation over.</span> <span id="s1731">It appealed to me and I kind of took the bait and not shortly after that -- that period, we -- my wife and our son -- meanwhile, we had Mark, our son, and we moved to Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1732">Got a wonderful apartment at a significantly lower expense than the prevailing rent in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: And so much for that.</span> <span id="s1735">I retained that job for, I think, something like four years.</span> <span id="s1736">No, excuse me, two years, at which time the Venetian room closed, just simply closed from one day to the next because of m -- more or less the same problem that had preceded in New York, the high cost of entertainment.</span> <span id="s1737">The -- we had a real kind of setback in the economy and the room was a not -- was not profitable.</span> <span id="s1738">The hotel -- the occupancy in the hotel was less than -- than 50 percent and that’s very, very bad for a hotel.</span> <span id="s1739">Less than 96 percent is scr -- is going down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: So the hotel -- the -- the -- the entire hotel left Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1742">And I got -- my next job, I got a job at the Atlanta Hilton in the banquet department and I worked there for four years.</span> <span id="s1743">Four years, until 1975 -- until 19 -- excuse me, until 1980.</span> <span id="s1744">From ’75 to ’80 I worked in the -- in the Hilton.</span> <span id="s1745">And then I followed -- I -- I met a -- someone who had a catering business.</span> <span id="s1746">And he wanted to join his two daughters in Baltimore and he was ready to sell the business for a very s-small amount of money.</span> <span id="s1747">He just wanted somebody qualified to carry on and so I took over his employees and bought into a established business that wasn’t doing a great volume, but it was established in the sense that it was incorporated, and the name was Prestige Caterers.</span> <span id="s1748">And it turned out to be the golden goose.</span> <span id="s1749">It -- it was a very successful operation.</span> <span id="s1750">I -- and I fit right in, due to my experience in the kitchen and my connections in the dining room.</span> <span id="s1751">I branched out what had been a strictly kosher catering business, I branched out and advertised in the yellow pages and -- and became known in Atlanta as a -- I made a name for myself there and it wa -- it was very, very good for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1752">For a good number of years.</span> <span id="s1753">In fact, it -- it lasted until -- it lasted until I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: And when did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: I retired in -- I think it was ’86, at which time Ilsa, my wife, ran the place for another two years, but -- and then we closed it for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: When did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: We closed it for good, actually, I’m wrong on my dates.</span> <span id="s1758">We closed it, we -- we still were in business during the Olympics, which was a major boost.</span> <span id="s1759">The Olympics are, for us in our catering establishment, was a -- was a kind of revival of -- of the nor -- of numbers.</span> <span id="s1760">We did -- we did quite well for the Olympics.</span> <span id="s1761">I had a customer who took over the -- whatever we had to offer that is wa -- in terms of volume, we did quite well.</span> <span id="s1762">But it wasn’t very long there after that we closed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: When did you become Henry Gallant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: When did I become Henry Gallant?</span> <span id="s1765">I -- my time in the -- in the hotel school in Switzerland was a -- whe-when you speak of cooking, when you speak of food, it -- it has many different outlet.</span> <span id="s1766">Just as you have Italian and Chinese and German cuisine, Austrian, Swiss and so forth and so on, ea-each type of -- of cuisine, each type of food has its own -- its own quality and its own reputation and so forth, and -- and the chefs -- that entire industry was -- was led by chefs from Switzerland, from Germany, from France and from Austria.</span> <span id="s1767">You might safely say that those four countries, th -- Wolfgang Puck, who’s very well known, his name is a household word, not only in advertising for food, but also in advertising for the food equipment.</span> <span id="s1768">You go to -- to a department store and all of a sudden up pops his face.</span> <span id="s1769">The Georgia Aquarium, he runs the -- the catering department and food department of Georgia Aquarium.</span> <span id="s1770">So his -- there are few people who don’t know Wolfgang Puck.</span> <span id="s1771">He’s Austrian, just like another fellow from Austria, very successful, Arnold Schwarzenegger, he’s Austrian.</span> <span id="s1772">And he wasn’t always a movie star, or he wasn’t always a governor.</span> <span id="s1773">He was at one time, a weightlifter and made his name as Mr. Universe, if I’m not mistaken.</span> <span id="s1774">So anyway, I, with a name like Goldstein, it -- it identified with professions that you would like to, or would not like to associate with, perhaps with law, with -- with furriers, with tailors, with textiles, with medicine, with dentistry and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1775">In the kitchen, Americans in the 19 -- in the late 40’s and early 50’s, you would have traveled the entire country from one ne -- from Buffalo to -- to San Francisco and you would not find an American -- an American chef.</span> <span id="s1776">It just simply was not an occupation that Americans, native Americans would -- would embrace.</span> <span id="s1777">They just wouldn't.</span> <span id="s1778">Unlike today, where the situation has turned 180 degrees, where you have this -- the California cuisine and -- and from the -- the TV shows featuring Julia Child and -- an-and Emeril -- E-E-Emile -- what is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Emeril?</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: Emeril, right, correct.</span> <span id="s1781">They -- they -- they -- you see them everywhere.</span> <span id="s1782">And tha-that happened probably in that -- began to happen after World War II or something.</span> <span id="s1783">There was a field that Americans became -- came to like and enjoy and -- and thrive in.</span> <span id="s1784">But the name Goldstein was a li -- a strong liability and also there was a great deal of anti-Semitism here in America.</span> <span id="s1785">The -- the -- I worked -- for example, I -- the s -- New York Culinary Federation sent me to the Greenbrier at White Sulphur Springs.</span> <span id="s1786">And the Greenbrier is a -- an institution.</span> <span id="s1787">It is a hotel that, like the Homestead in Virginia, it is a hotel that was the home to senators and presidents and -- and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and what have you.</span> <span id="s1788">It was the elite, the so-called 500 and chief executive officers of the major American corporations, they all spent their summers in the Greenbrier with Ben Hogan and -- and the top golfers, the golf tournaments.</span> <span id="s1789">Anybody who was anybody went to the Greenbrier.</span> <span id="s1790">But the Greenbrier was owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway company, by a fellow whose name was Young.</span> <span id="s1791">His last name was Young, the first name I do not recall, and the hotel was notably restricted.</span> <span id="s1792">It did not have Jewish employees and it did not have Jewish clientele, simple as that.</span> <span id="s1793">Clear and simple.</span> <span id="s1794">And I already had been there and in the office they categorically told me that -- an office girl, a very nice girl told me that the -- if I were smart I would change my name because with a name like Goldstein you wouldn’t last in this hotel.</span> <span id="s1795">And I took her advice and I changed my name at that time.</span> <span id="s1796">I did not change my name legally until a number of years later.</span> <span id="s1797">I had replied to an ad in the New York Times which read -- I had always had the desire to travel.</span> <span id="s1798">Traveling was an -- a -- I would say it was a passion.</span> <span id="s1799">It -- maybe because I traveled in the early stage of my life, I don’t know, but I enjoyed traveling and so when I saw that ad by Pan American Airlines, which meanwhile has -- doesn’t fly any more, but -- they joined Eastern Airlines, it doesn’t fly either.</span> <span id="s1800">But Pan American had an ad in the paper, wanted, young man between 31 and 35 as flight attendant, capable of talking two languages.</span> <span id="s1801">Well, I said to myself, I speak French, I speak German.</span> <span id="s1802">I’m ideal -- a -- an ideal candidate as flight attendant.</span> <span id="s1803">I submitted my resumé and at -- was called to a meeting in -- with the executive flight board.</span> <span id="s1804">And 10 days later I got a letter, dear Mr. Goldstein -- I was so shocked that I still remember the wording of the letter, dear Mr. Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1805">As we told you upon your interview, your qualifications are not best suited for our specialized requirements and this however is in no way to indicate your scope of ability and wishing you every success for the future, we remain cordially yours, W.J. Parrot, superintendent of flight service.</span> <span id="s1806">Now, it happened that in nine -- that was in 1956, and it happened that wa -- Israel was at war with the -- with the Arabs, and Lebanon -- and I was supposed to fly Beirut, Rome, Paris, London, Beirut.</span> <span id="s1807">I was supposed to be stationed -- they -- they asked me, are you ready to stay one year overseas and -- and live in Beirut?</span> <span id="s1808">I said, that’s no problem.</span> <span id="s1809">But I didn’t know that the -- this -- I -- I -- in other words, I was a victim of the political situation at the time.</span> <span id="s1810">And I was not a candidate to live in Beirut.</span> <span id="s1811">And so I got this letter, which did no diminish my desire to travel and I worked -- began working on resort -- on cruise ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: I worked initially on cruise ships.</span> <span id="s1814">But that was not the easiest thing to accomplish, because in order to work on cruise ships you had to have a certificate of marine -- you had to have a Coast Guard document.</span> <span id="s1815">And you could only get a Coast Guard document if you had a job.</span> <span id="s1816">And you could only get a job if you had a Coast Guard document.</span> <span id="s1817">And the only way to come to a document like that was to accept a job for the military sea transport service, which I did and I traveled between New York and Bremerhaven for a few months, and then joined the National Maritime Union and worked for Grace Line.</span> <span id="s1818">And that took me to -- to New York, Cristóbal, through the Panama Canal, to Guayaquil, Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1819">From there to Buena Ventura, Columbia, with the destination of Kayahu, Lima, Peru.</span> <span id="s1820">And I did this until I went to the Empire room, the rest was history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: How do you think the Holocaust affected you?</span> <span id="s1822">Well, your experiences, I shouldn’t say the Holocaust as a whole, cause it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Well, the Holocaust -- the Holocaust affected me, the Holocaust wasn’t a -- I can only answer that it was a disaster for the Jewish people, and whatever affects the Jewish people affects me.</span> <span id="s1824">I mean, we lost six million -- five million of our brothers and sisters and so it affected me a lot.</span> <span id="s1825">It -- it made me think, it made me -- it had a lot of consequences.</span> <span id="s1826">I speak on matters of the -- of the Holocaust at the Bremen Museum of Jewish Heritage and Holocaust History.</span> <span id="s1827">I speak to students.</span> <span id="s1828">I am a speaker at -- under the jo -- jor -- Georgia Commission of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1829">I’m a speaker to educate young people that division and -- and rejecting diversity and for minorities is -- is a very bad thing, and to be a bystander is equally bad, and that we all have an obligation to -- to be active in preventing the onset of the result of discrimination.</span> <span id="s1830">Pure and simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: So you feel you have an obligation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: I -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1835">I think I have an obligation, I -- it’s a kind of miracle that I’m alive, I -- that I managed to be five minutes ahead of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1836">And if not for that good fortune or that luck, or call it whatever you will, if not for that I would have ended up in the crematorium of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: How does that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Well, it makes me feel -- it makes me feel as -- as a lucky guy, chosen for something, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1839">Maybe to speak to these young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Do you like speaking to these kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: I do it out of the sense of responsibility, to what extent I am -- I’m not sure that -- that -- I like to do my -- the things that I have to do, that I feel I have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: So not necessarily like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: No, not necessarily, it’s not my vocation, I -- to be a public speaker.</span> <span id="s1844">I don’t like to see myself necessarily standing on the stage and -- although sometimes it’s enviable, depends on -- on what you speak about, to whom you speak, who your audience is, I mean, in some aspect I think it’s -- it could be a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: The subject matter is not so very entertaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: As it is a responsibility and a necessity, but not so very enjoyable.</span> <span id="s1849">But if the subject changes from evening to evening, as it does for Bill O’Reilly, if you will, it could be fun to -- it could be fun to talk to different people, interview them, speak to them, exchange ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Is there anything you want to say that we haven’t been able to talk about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1852">I thank you for the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1853">I enjoyed speaking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Well, I enjoyed speaking with you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: And I was keenly attentive to your questions and I did my best trying to answer them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Well, I think you did very well.</span> <span id="s1857">I thank you very much for talking with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: A pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1861">[tape break] -- the result is going to be less than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">[tape break] Q2: Can you tell us about this picture?</span></p>
