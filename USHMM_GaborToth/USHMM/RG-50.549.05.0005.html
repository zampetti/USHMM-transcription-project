Tachau in January 1982.</span> <span id="s28">And that interview is now in the collection of the University of Louisville, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s29">And the second interview was a Survivors of the Shoah Foundation interview that was conducted on April 22nd, 1996.</span> <span id="s30">So, we’re going to start out by summarizing, more or less, what was said in those interviews, which were very thorough, particularly the Mary K. Tachau interview.</span> <span id="s31">And filling in on a few questions and then we’ll go on and mostly focus on Ms. Klein’s life in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s32">So, I’m going to just read this summary and you tell me if I’ve gotten anything wrong.</span> <span id="s33">Actually, first of all before we start, you were born in October ninth, 1921 in Eger, Hungary.</span> <span id="s34">I was interested in hearing before we go on from there, something about your family history.</span> <span id="s35">Do you know anything about your family history?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes, as much as I know.</span> <span id="s37">People in those days didn’t go into a lot of details.</span> <span id="s38">But my father was born in 1880 and my mother was born in 1879.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Can you give their names, including her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s41">My mother’s maiden name was Frida Weisz and my father’s name was Béla Löw.</span> <span id="s42">In Hungarian we would say Löw Béla and Weisz Frida, you know the last name comes first.</span> <span id="s43">My father worked in a bank that was a chain.</span> <span id="s44">The main office was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s45">And then different cities would had branches.</span> <span id="s46">It was called at the time, and I don’t know whether you want to know it in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s47">It was called the Magyar Atolanos Hitel Bank.</span> <span id="s48">Magyar means… and the Hitel Bank was the name of the outfit.</span> <span id="s49">My father became, first he probably was a clerk and I would not remember that.</span> <span id="s50">And actually married my mother, who was working in that bank before.</span> <span id="s51">That’s how they apparently met.</span> <span id="s52">This was a second marriage for my father, because his wife, the first wife, died maybe after two years of marriage, and then he married my mom.</span> <span id="s53">And she was born in Fegyvernek, Hungary and my father was born in a little town called Tiszafured, Hungary.</span> <span id="s54">Now, my father became the manager of the bank and so those are the years I would remember.</span> <span id="s55">In Hungarian, they were called the izgazgato (ph) of the bank, but here you would call the manager, I think, or the director of that bank.</span> <span id="s56">And he did work there for a while.</span> <span id="s57">We lived in a house, a little bit away from downtown.</span> <span id="s58">And when I was four years old we moved into the same building where the bank was, above the bank there was a nice big apartment.</span> <span id="s59">And we were very comfortable in my house.</span> <span id="s60">I remember we had pretty gardens and so on and so forth, up to the age of four.</span> <span id="s61">And after that we lived downtown.</span> <span id="s62">So all I remember that toward the end, I think my father was supposedly had to retire, already maybe at age sixty, where people here maybe retire only in sixty-five.</span> <span id="s63">They had a lovely and very nice ceremony for him.</span> <span id="s64">In fact, I owned—but unfortunately I don’t own anymore—they gave him a silver wreath, which the employees, all the employees’ names were signed on.</span> <span id="s65">And they gave a lovely, nice speech at his retirement.</span> <span id="s66">I do have a picture of that, by the way.</span> <span id="s67">You know, I was really lucky that either relatives or maybe it was left in the house.</span> <span id="s68">I have more pictures than many other people who lost everything.</span> <span id="s69">We lost everything, but still for example, and if you would be interested toward the end, I would show you that picture.</span> <span id="s70">He’s sitting at the desk and that was the time he retired from the bank.</span> <span id="s71">And my mother, after… she had three children, so she didn’t work, so that was before they got married, I think, that she was like a secretary, maybe, in the bank.</span> <span id="s72">So, that’s what my parents… except then he had a very good friend, who lived in Budapest.</span> <span id="s73">He wasn’t a Jewish guy, who had vineyards in our hometown.</span> <span id="s74">Because our hometown, Eger is very famous of its wine and vineyards.</span> <span id="s75">And as a friendship, that wasn’t really a paid job, he helped that friend to take care of the vineyard.</span> <span id="s76">I mean, not so much take care, because he had employees, but look after it a little bit.</span> <span id="s77">And they had an apple orchard and he was doing that.</span> <span id="s78">So, we went out to that vineyard many times.</span> <span id="s79">And it was a pleasant way that I remember my childhood.</span> <span id="s80">You don’t want to know much about my childhood, no more like about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: You talked a fair amount about your childhood in the other…</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: See, I don’t remember what I did.</span> <span id="s83">So, that’s about really about my father.</span> <span id="s84">And then in one of the interviews, I did tell them that when the Germans came in, he was the head of that five member committee.</span> <span id="s85">So, I don’t want to repeat myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: So, this is about all I can tell about my parents.</span> <span id="s88">And I might have talked about my brothers, but this is the answer that what my father did, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: I wondered if you knew about your grandparents and about your family’s history in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I have pictures of them, but very little.</span> <span id="s91">I really don’t…I have a picture of my grandfather and grandmother on my father’s side and no pictures on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s92">I know absolutely nothing of the family history on my mother’s side, except that she had two sisters and we were close to the sisters.</span> <span id="s93">But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died.</span> <span id="s94">Nothing.</span> <span id="s95">My father’s mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because, you know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black casket, and we were… but when my grandfather died, I do not remember that.</span> <span id="s96">I think he died, might have died before I ever was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you know what brought your parents both to Eger?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s100">Going on with the summary of your experiences.</span> <span id="s101">So, you did talk some about your brothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944, you were moved into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s102">Lived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a brick factory, called Kerecsend.</span> <span id="s103">And there for a few days, then from there, loaded onto cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz, where you were separated from your parents.</span> <span id="s104">You worked in the kitchen in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Not right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Not right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: First I was in Birkenau for a month.</span> <span id="s108">And then from Birkenau in a lager, which was called A Lager.</span> <span id="s109">And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work.</span> <span id="s110">So that had to be, we were taken out in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: In January of 1945, you were forced to leave Auschwitz to go on a Death March towards Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s112">And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of become close with, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the kitchen, who I still keep contact with, who lives now in Israel.</span> <span id="s114">She was from Yugoslavia, actually, from the town of Isad (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news.</span> <span id="s115">And she’s really the one, who I kept close.</span> <span id="s116">If you would ask me what were the other girls’ names, I do not remember, and I do not know, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Do you know what became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s119">I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our hometown.</span> <span id="s120">And I don’t even believe we worked in the kitchen together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other.</span> <span id="s121">She was older than I am.</span> <span id="s122">She used to be a seamstress.</span> <span id="s123">And in my stories, I think it’s mentioned that on some of the train rides, after we were already liberated, we were together.</span> <span id="s124">And I do know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s125">And she lives, she remarried.</span> <span id="s126">She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s127">And he died in the meantime.</span> <span id="s128">I think he was an artist.</span> <span id="s129">And although I never thought I want to go back to Germany, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in Germany, which took us to Berlin, too.</span> <span id="s130">And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number.</span> <span id="s131">And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the hotel.</span> <span id="s132">That’s the first time I have seen her after Auschwitz times.</span> <span id="s133">And she still lives in Berlin.</span> <span id="s134">She’s much older than I am, so at times I’ve heard that she’s kind of ill.</span> <span id="s135">So, I don’t know what she’s doing.</span> <span id="s136">I have a feeling her husband was originally from Berlin and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their home there.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Rosenfeld, Bözsi.</span> <span id="s139">Bözsi’s like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name.</span> <span id="s140">That was actually her name from the first marriage.</span> <span id="s141">That’s the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband’s name was.</span> <span id="s142">So, we called her Rosenfeld, Bözsi and she was from Eger.</span> <span id="s143">So.</span> <span id="s144">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s145">I never kept up with anybody else.</span> <span id="s146">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s147">But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my hometown.</span> <span id="s148">And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good.</span> <span id="s149">Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened.</span> <span id="s150">So, I can’t give you any names.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How did you become so close with Ilus?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: She worked… yeah, I remember, she worked in the kitchen and we met.</span> <span id="s153">And she’s exactly my age and somehow we liked each other.</span> <span id="s154">And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband’s two sisters were in Auschwitz, but they were taken away to Germany.</span> <span id="s155">And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in factories or whatever.</span> <span id="s156">But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so-called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn’t know exactly what happened to them.</span> <span id="s157">We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other.</span> <span id="s158">And we did become good friends to the last minute.</span> <span id="s159">And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me.</span> <span id="s160">But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March.</span> <span id="s161">She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in Auschwitz, and they were… ?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume.</span> <span id="s164">But I do not recall it.</span> <span id="s165">Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don’t even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not.</span> <span id="s166">So, I cannot give you any information about that.</span> <span id="s167">Then later she got married and they moved to Israel.</span> <span id="s168">And we kept up.</span> <span id="s169">In fact, last year I was in Hungary and she came to Hungary, to Budapest and spent a week.</span> <span id="s170">So we saw each other then.</span> <span id="s171">And unfortunately now, she lives in Netanya.</span> <span id="s172">Have you ever been in Israel, yourself?</span> <span id="s173">And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a car.</span> <span id="s174">And she doesn’t have any family anymore, because she never had any children.</span> <span id="s175">Her husband died years ago.</span> <span id="s176">She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during concentration camp.</span> <span id="s177">And she was first in the hospital for a long time.</span> <span id="s178">Then she was in some sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever.</span> <span id="s179">And in that age, she’s very little and fragile.</span> <span id="s180">And then she is now back in her apartment.</span> <span id="s181">She doesn’t like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write.</span> <span id="s182">I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot… but she’s somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation.</span> <span id="s183">Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the place.</span> <span id="s184">And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have?</span> <span id="s185">And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn’t looking forward to.</span> <span id="s186">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: You mentioned about that time that you were in Auschwitz, that you didn’t fully believe what was happening there.</span> <span id="s188">And as far as… as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was she more informed than you were on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work.</span> <span id="s190">Later, because I worked first in one part of the kitchen, then in another part.</span> <span id="s191">And I think we met a little bit later.</span> <span id="s192">But I don’t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don’t know whether I’m just so naïve or I was so naïve at the time.</span> <span id="s193">Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel.</span> <span id="s194">Have you read that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: I actually have only read parts of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, it’s a very easy.</span> <span id="s197">And I read that just in Nashville, while, you know, I had a little time to read it.</span> <span id="s198">And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is.</span> <span id="s199">Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it.</span> <span id="s200">Well, I am either very naïve… I could never have believed anything like that.</span> <span id="s201">We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s202">They were from Poland or Russia and they would tell us.</span> <span id="s203">But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war.</span> <span id="s204">See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s205">And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean.</span> <span id="s206">Because a lot of the kapos in the barracks were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back.</span> <span id="s207">And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable.</span> <span id="s208">So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn’t believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well, I hope so.</span> <span id="s211">It could be.</span> <span id="s212">And we didn’t read about this that much, you know like I listened or read different kind of stories about people.</span> <span id="s213">Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in Hungary they did not know anything about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s214">We did not know anything about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s215">And I don’t think my parents did.</span> <span id="s216">At the same time, my parents were very protective, too.</span> <span id="s217">They were the type of people that they didn’t want to scare you.</span> <span id="s218">Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that.</span> <span id="s219">And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what’s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling.</span> <span id="s220">The concentration camps were not… we did not know anything about it.</span> <span id="s221">Like when we’re in the train, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it’s going to be Auschwitz, because I did not know anything about that.</span> <span id="s222">And I am talking only about myself.</span> <span id="s223">You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different… and you want to know my feelings.</span> <span id="s224">We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what Auschwitz meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I mean, later in… when we would have believed that they really…?</span> <span id="s227">I can’t remember when that came to our mind, you know.</span> <span id="s228">For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another camp and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people.</span> <span id="s229">Well, I was the youngest, and I didn’t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister-in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old.</span> <span id="s230">Well, they wouldn’t have imagined that they were burned in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s231">They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a camp.</span> <span id="s232">When did we came to the realization?</span> <span id="s233">Toward the very end.</span> <span id="s234">I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe.</span> <span id="s235">But it wasn’t that it just happened one day.</span> <span id="s236">And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore.</span> <span id="s237">It is just… everything was so gradual that I couldn’t recall anything like that.</span> <span id="s238">And I wanted to get back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s239">By then, I kind of knew that I’m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s240">Of course, I didn’t find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews.</span> <span id="s241">But when did that happen?</span> <span id="s242">I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s243">(Doorbell rings.)</span> <span id="s244">Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you cried for them?</span> <span id="s246">That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it is, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that camp and so many horrible things were going on, I don’t remember really ever crying.</span> <span id="s248">You know?</span> <span id="s249">The shock was so great.</span> <span id="s250">And afterwards, see, when I got back to Hungary, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once.</span> <span id="s251">And so, I don’t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn’t find my brothers.</span> <span id="s252">But it’s funny, I wasn’t… it’s not funny at all, but I apparently didn’t cry that easily.</span> <span id="s253">I mean I might have held it back more.</span> <span id="s254">And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little… I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I… I didn’t… like that we go to the cemetery when we are in my hometown, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids.</span> <span id="s255">My family’s names are on it.</span> <span id="s256">And it’s just, you know, you’re just under, it’s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know?</span> <span id="s257">Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not.</span> <span id="s258">But I don’t want to jump ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s259">You ask me the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Okay, well I’m not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about…We’ll just get back to the chronology when…</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I don’t know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough.</span> <span id="s262">Or maybe I was brought up in a nice family home and I didn’t have any upsetting situations.</span> <span id="s263">But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong.</span> <span id="s264">And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it.</span> <span id="s265">So, it must be my personality that I was able to… to survive, no.</span> <span id="s266">No?</span> <span id="s267">Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you.</span> <span id="s268">But maybe the feeling that you don’t give up easily.</span> <span id="s269">Or it’s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s270">Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to… then I was lucky that I didn’t get really sick.</span> <span id="s271">I mean, that I don’t think has anything to do with one’s personality.</span> <span id="s272">You may be stronger, and I’m a pretty strong person.</span> <span id="s273">But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s274">And that I considered luck.</span> <span id="s275">I don’t think that it’s a personality.</span> <span id="s276">Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that.</span> <span id="s277">So I’m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe… I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things.</span> <span id="s278">I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s279">That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can’t believe and can’t understand how in the world somebody can survive it.</span> <span id="s280">And then talk about it later in life.</span> <span id="s281">It’s… I have a hard time understanding that and I still feel that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: And somebody pretty young…</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I was not that young, you know.</span> <span id="s284">I really not a 15-year-old kid.</span> <span id="s285">I was in my 23s or 24s.</span> <span id="s286">So, I was mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about… see after the… and as of today, I’m going to say something to you, I just thought about that.</span> <span id="s287">They died the way, you know how they did.</span> <span id="s288">And at the same time I tried to compromise with it.</span> <span id="s289">I mean, I’m not trying to forgive Hitler ever, or what happened to us.</span> <span id="s290">But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same things I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know?</span> <span id="s291">Just the thought of that for me would have been horrible.</span> <span id="s292">So, the way I think now that they suddenly were killed and they didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s293">That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone with them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died.</span> <span id="s294">Because they were in their sixties, they weren’t young.</span> <span id="s295">Some people were only maybe in their forties.</span> <span id="s296">But when I was born, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old.</span> <span id="s297">And in those days those were already old people, but they were healthy people.</span> <span id="s298">I never seen them sick or, you know, in bed, in fact, with a sickness.</span> <span id="s299">So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have been almost worse.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, I don’t know if anybody ever felt that way.</span> <span id="s301">Because if they could have survived the whole thing, that’s a different story, but at that age, not many older people could survive it.</span> <span id="s302">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Ann Löw Klein.</span> <span id="s305">Well, let’s, I have some questions about the things that you brought up, but let’s try to get back to them later and we’ll get back right now to the summary, to just finish saying what happened to you during the wartime.</span> <span id="s306">I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March.</span> <span id="s307">You were forced to go to Ravensbrück with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about what had become of them.</span> <span id="s308">So, you were in Ravensbrück for about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Ravensbrück for three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: And then to Malchow for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s311">And then there was a lot of traveling around to various places.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well, either walking or in open trains.</span> <span id="s313">The open train was right after the Auschwitz, the evacuation of Auschwitz, because I remember it was very cold and the trains were open.</span> <span id="s314">And I have already told that story, so I don’t want to really repeat myself.</span> <span id="s315">The camps, unless you really would want to, I haven’t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my friend, Ilus.</span> <span id="s316">Because she remembered names very well.</span> <span id="s317">But Ravensbrück really was the most famous one, but nobody… it wasn’t really a camp for us anymore.</span> <span id="s318">It was gathering places.</span> <span id="s319">And wherever, like what you mentioned near Dresden, this Malchow, it wasn’t that we were supposed to be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there.</span> <span id="s320">It was just a stop during the wandering around or the trains and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s321">So, the last part of it, which I (coughs) excuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open field, where I ran into a lot of the… even some people from my hometown, by then there were no camps, it was just… but by then the weather was a little bit better, because it was springtime.</span> <span id="s322">So we wouldn’t suffer from ice and cold and so on.</span> <span id="s323">But our main and worse situation was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop and sit down and possibly freeze to death.</span> <span id="s324">Is where my friend, Ilus and I kept ourselves from trying to avoid that if possible.</span> <span id="s325">Because we were told that, that can happen.</span> <span id="s326">But after that I couldn’t tell you any of the real camps because then we ended up in Wurzen and that was…</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And then finally you were actually liberated during that time of wandering, the last two weeks of the war, you were liberated by American Army in Wurzen, Germany, where you stayed for about three weeks.</span> <span id="s328">And you were recovering from an infection to your arm, to your finger.</span> <span id="s329">Oh yeah, that finger nail is still…</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: It’s still gone forever, yeah.</span> <span id="s331">And so those were the start, and I show that to you.</span> <span id="s332">This scar was my tattoo number and this where my hands are very worked up, there is a little scar.</span> <span id="s333">And a little scar right here, where the pus had to be taken out, because I would have… okay that was another way you could have died.</span> <span id="s334">I had blood poisoning, but with that surgery, since by then we were liberated, and they did it.</span> <span id="s335">If the war would to have gone on further, longer, I don’t know what would have happened to that arm.</span> <span id="s336">But I never thought about it then either, except that was very painful.</span> <span id="s337">And that was taken care of in Wurzen.</span> <span id="s338">And after that, it took a while for that to heal, I assume.</span> <span id="s339">And I never did get my finger nails back, but that should be my biggest problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: You described going to a Czech parachute camp, where British soldiers wanted to take you to England, but you went to Hungary instead because you were hoping to find your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, because, yeah, well, we were, they wanted to help us and that was only this friend of mine and myself.</span> <span id="s342">And yes, I remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s343">They gave us real good food, I mean really food what we had never had before.</span> <span id="s344">Because, as I told you before, in Wurzen the first thing was I would eat the bag full of sugar and I would eat pickles.</span> <span id="s345">I mean that’s alone a reason too, not to survive, I think, but then again, maybe I was strong or I don’t get sick that easily.</span> <span id="s346">But after we heard about a transport, maybe from that area, leaving toward Hungary, we left them a note and we told them “Thank you very much, but we’re going to try,” and we got on the train.</span> <span id="s347">And that was a few more weeks of Czechoslovakia and all over the place.</span> <span id="s348">If I would look at my notes, I might even get some ideas around Bern, for example, but I don’t think it’s that important and that would really stretch it out.</span> <span id="s349">But the train was going slowly at different places.</span> <span id="s350">Now, my friend, the reason she remembered more, first of all, she spoke languages better.</span> <span id="s351">She spoke French, she spoke German.</span> <span id="s352">She was from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s353">She spoke the Slavic languages, so in Czechoslovakia she could understand some of the Czecho… so, she found out a lot of little things, exactly where we were.</span> <span id="s354">And I was immobilized because of that surgery on my arm.</span> <span id="s355">So my arm was all tied up, so I didn’t run around as easily as she did.</span> <span id="s356">Like, the train would stop and then some people would bring up some food.</span> <span id="s357">That was, of course, after the war was over.</span> <span id="s358">Or she would go down, they asked her down to a kitchen and they give her something to eat and then she would bring some.</span> <span id="s359">But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get around with that.</span> <span id="s360">And that was painful, because those things had to heal.</span> <span id="s361">But you know it’s ___________ because that’s the way I remember, and any other questions I’ll be glad to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Just on the subject of your strength and being strong enough to survive that and also having the luck to survive it.</span> <span id="s363">I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you remember yourself before the war.</span> <span id="s364">You mentioned that during the war you just didn’t cry and that now you can cry at little things.</span> <span id="s365">But before the war was your personality that way?</span> <span id="s366">Did you ever cry then?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, I don’t remember that I was… I wasn’t pampered really, by my parents, although they had the means.</span> <span id="s368">But I remember… I don’t think I was really spoiled.</span> <span id="s369">I was spoiled by them not to share bad news.</span> <span id="s370">So, that’s one thing I remember so well.</span> <span id="s371">Like my older brother was ill, had some sort of a lung problem in his high school year.</span> <span id="s372">They took him to Budapest and the lungs had to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated.</span> <span id="s373">They never scared me with all that.</span> <span id="s374">Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than I am.</span> <span id="s375">He once, he lived in another town, worked also in a bank.</span> <span id="s376">And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a so-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn’t quite understand the whole thing.</span> <span id="s377">And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think they were worried about what was going on, but then he got well.</span> <span id="s378">But they never, ever shared the worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point.</span> <span id="s379">You know?</span> <span id="s380">My parents lived together and my brother… we were… it was a close-knit family, but not a spoiled.</span> <span id="s381">You know, like my father had probably enough money, but I made a big deal of asking for money.</span> <span id="s382">I remember I would say and that they laughed about that.</span> <span id="s383">That’s not important to the interview, but I would say, “I have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real big favor to ask.”</span> <span id="s384">And they didn’t know what it was I wanted, ten cents or 25 cents.</span> <span id="s385">I mean, I made a big deal about it, you know?</span> <span id="s386">So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought up.</span> <span id="s387">My bad parts was my Catholic high school at the last year, which also was in my interview, because one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much.</span> <span id="s388">But there again, I didn’t cry.</span> <span id="s389">I couldn’t object to it.</span> <span id="s390">It wasn’t like nowadays, people protest.</span> <span id="s391">So, I had to kind of swallow it and live with it.</span> <span id="s392">So, I don’t remember ever being very upset or that I got hurt easily, you know, like some people get hurt over everything.</span> <span id="s393">I had friends and they liked me and I liked them and somehow that’s the way I was brought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: So it wasn’t as if the war came and you became a different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, I think my personality was kind of strong all my, but I didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s396">It was easy to be strong when I had all the comfort.</span> <span id="s397">It’s different.</span> <span id="s398">From ghetto time on, it hit us.</span> <span id="s399">It’s just like for everybody else.</span> <span id="s400">But you might have had interviews with some people, maybe they had a bad childhood or maybe somebody was abusive.</span> <span id="s401">And who knows?</span> <span id="s402">I didn’t have any of that.</span> <span id="s403">It hit me at the time when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s404">And I read that other places, too, people didn’t imagine it could happen to you.</span> <span id="s405">And we never imagined that it could happen to us, whatever was happening, everything was gradual.</span> <span id="s406">You know, the giving up your whole place, the ghetto, the brick factory.</span> <span id="s407">It just… it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any crying, temper or fighting it.</span> <span id="s408">The only upset points I would have, and would see again my parents sitting in front of our ghetto home, where it was raining and they had to leave their stuff.</span> <span id="s409">I always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there.</span> <span id="s410">So, I always felt more sorry for them than for myself at the time.</span> <span id="s411">That’s the way I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What about when the war ended and you started trying to just go about your life?</span> <span id="s413">Did you feel as if you were transformed?</span> <span id="s414">You were a different person than you had been before?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well I was in a way like, by the time I got back to Hungary, to Budapest and I realized that I don’t have… I really realized that my parents are gone and my brothers are gone.</span> <span id="s416">And I have mentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don’t want to repeat myself to that.</span> <span id="s417">But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing, because I remember that people wanted me to meet friends and get together with them.</span> <span id="s418">And I was just like, like blindfolded.</span> <span id="s419">I did what I was told.</span> <span id="s420">I didn’t have my own personality, you know.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t remember much about the time, you know.</span> <span id="s422">And I was in Budapest for a whole year before I came out to this country.</span> <span id="s423">And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some people I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s424">I just really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t know if I ever mentioned it, before the war they wanted me to marry somebody.</span> <span id="s426">Did I say that?</span> <span id="s427">I don’t know whether that’s important, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family.</span> <span id="s428">He was a lawyer and they were rich people.</span> <span id="s429">And their nephew got married to a girl in my hometown, who is still alive now somewhere.</span> <span id="s430">I never see her anymore, but she lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s431">And that person who was marrying the girl brought his cousin.</span> <span id="s432">And they lived somewhere in the Yugoslavian area and they were big farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people.</span> <span id="s433">And they all decided that that would be a great situation for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Who decided that, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: That’s… no, the couple, whose nephew was marrying the one girl and brought his cousin.</span> <span id="s436">And they had a big dinner, a get together.</span> <span id="s437">And I don’t know that should be in the Holocaust Museum, but… briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited me to go to where he lives and meet his parents.</span> <span id="s438">And my mother and I took a train and we went with this guy… can’t even remember his name anymore.</span> <span id="s439">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s440">They waited for us with a sleigh.</span> <span id="s441">So, I liked, only thing is the sleigh rides in the snow.</span> <span id="s442">And at that time, of course, I knew my husband by then, because we were growing up together.</span> <span id="s443">We came to the United States and I liked him.</span> <span id="s444">And I certainly didn’t like that guy.</span> <span id="s445">He was like about ten years older than I am.</span> <span id="s446">And so on the way back, on the train, I used my personality, where I might have cried, and told my mother, “I absolutely don’t want anything to do with this situation.”</span> <span id="s447">And they accepted it.</span> <span id="s448">They didn’t force me to do that.</span> <span id="s449">But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then.</span> <span id="s450">On the train home I kind of said, “No way do I want to do that.”</span> <span id="s451">But then after the war, people wanted me to meet a friend and so on.</span> <span id="s452">And it’s very vague in my mind.</span> <span id="s453">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s454">I love music and somebody, my husband’s wife, they got married just before the war.</span> <span id="s455">Not my husband’s, I’m sorry, my brother.</span> <span id="s456">And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the time, it’s a season ticket.</span> <span id="s457">And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn’t have my heart in it.</span> <span id="s458">You know?</span> <span id="s459">It was just something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I might have said that.</span> <span id="s460">She was my good friend, who is still a friend of mine and I still see her all the time.</span> <span id="s461">She sometimes comes to the United States and I have been visiting her.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Her name is, her maiden name was Fleischman, Ibi.</span> <span id="s464">And the very interesting thing is that my friend from Yugoslavia, her maiden name was Fleischman, too.</span> <span id="s465">Isn’t that strange?</span> <span id="s466">And then she married, the woman in Budapest, married a furrier and his name was Fischer.</span> <span id="s467">And they had a furrier business and when I arrived back to Budapest, I went down.</span> <span id="s468">And I remember one thing, that I stood against a wall and of course, they never knew what happened to me.</span> <span id="s469">And I think it was very vivid in my mind and I told my story to her.</span> <span id="s470">Then she hired me.</span> <span id="s471">She gave me a job, and I worked in that place.</span> <span id="s472">Oh, I don’t know, just help out and they taught me how to make patterns for fur coats.</span> <span id="s473">You know there is a way to do that.</span> <span id="s474">And I worked in that furrier place until it was time for me to leave Budapest to come to this country.</span> <span id="s475">And I might have, you remember my tape?</span> <span id="s476">I must have told in it that I got a letter, letters from my sister-in-laws, where they were happy that I’m going to becoming a member of the family.</span> <span id="s477">And then I got a letter from my husband where he asked me to come out.</span> <span id="s478">But my Budapest time, that year and a half, I had to go back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s479">I had to give up my apartment.</span> <span id="s480">I had to sell things which were so dear to my parents and cost, must have cost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s481">I practically had to just give it away.</span> <span id="s482">It was inflation time.</span> <span id="s483">And so, I got rid of all that.</span> <span id="s484">I got some money out of it, not very much, very little.</span> <span id="s485">And then I…</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Yeah, you did talk about that in the interview with…</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: …with Mary K.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: …Mary K.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah, I must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: But I thought it would be a good time too, for you to say something that you haven’t talked about in either interview, which is how you met Sandy and how long you’ve known him.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Well, I’ve known him from the time he was a little boy.</span> <span id="s492">He’s a year older than I am and we lived just a block away.</span> <span id="s493">And at that time, he used to play the violin and I used to play the piano.</span> <span id="s494">And we belonged to the same music school.</span> <span id="s495">And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe fourteen and he might have been 15 and a half.</span> <span id="s496">And we had some pieces that we played together and then there would be a recital, and we did… so those are the ways that we really… and then we played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is… in fact, she’s coming August the 5th.</span> <span id="s497">She now lives in Argentina.</span> <span id="s498">She was one of them who had a little child and lost the child, and she’s coming to visit.</span> <span id="s499">And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know, you’re 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s500">And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he’s going to marry me.</span> <span id="s501">And of course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the United States.</span> <span id="s502">So, all kind of things could have happened.</span> <span id="s503">But I remember we went to Budapest at one time because I had to… no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in Washington, D.C., who brought him out with a student visa.</span> <span id="s504">And then he went to school in Washington.</span> <span id="s505">And so, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently.</span> <span id="s506">And like, I think I might have mentioned that for my birthday, he would ask his mother and she would send a bouquet of a hundred red roses, which at that time… she paid for it.</span> <span id="s507">And I think it wasn’t as expensive as it is now.</span> <span id="s508">But then the war came in ‘41 and after that, I never heard from him.</span> <span id="s509">First of all, you couldn’t get letters.</span> <span id="s510">He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually.</span> <span id="s511">So, that was about, but we played ping pong together.</span> <span id="s512">I mean, Eger is a small town and the Jewish community wasn’t really that big.</span> <span id="s513">And by then when I graduated from high school, we really didn’t keep up with our non-Jewish friends that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Had you, did you feel about Sandy the way that he felt about you, in those early days?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah, I did, but I was a little bit, I remember at one point, I mean, I don’t know why that Holocaust Museum has to know about it, but I remember I was telling my friend, the one who still lives in Budapest and who I’m close to, he was very much after me.</span> <span id="s516">And then you know how sometimes you get tired of it, you know.</span> <span id="s517">He wanted to be with me a lot and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s518">And then my friend said, “Just stay away, pretend that you’re not interested,” and then he will change being after me like that.</span> <span id="s519">And he did just that.</span> <span id="s520">So, he stayed away and then I suddenly thought to myself, well it’s more than… you know, I really didn’t want to stay away.</span> <span id="s521">So, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a Catholic high school, and we had friends after that.</span> <span id="s522">And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but differently than Sandy.</span> <span id="s523">Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry.</span> <span id="s524">And he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one.</span> <span id="s525">But he was that type, you know, that it was more like being impressed by he was somewhat after me, but at the same time I would know that he would be after a divorced woman and have two other girlfriends here and there.</span> <span id="s526">So, he wasn’t very stable.</span> <span id="s527">So I would have never, ever have considered…</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: That was after Sandy left.</span> <span id="s530">It had to be after 19… between 1939 and ’41, and then I guess, I’m not sure what happened to him.</span> <span id="s531">Then of course, he never survived either.</span> <span id="s532">But I would have never… it wasn’t a serious situation.</span> <span id="s533">I would have never considered…</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What about after the war when you were in Budapest, were you thinking a lot about Sandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: See, then, in concentration camp and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about boys.</span> <span id="s536">And after I got back, it wasn’t very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from my sister-in-laws.</span> <span id="s537">And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which he asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come… I think I mentioned that he went to Bergen-Belsen to get his sisters.</span> <span id="s538">And he took them to Casablanca, because he was stationed in Casablanca at that time.</span> <span id="s539">And then he wanted to have the girls come to the United States, which didn’t work out, because one went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s540">The other one stayed and married somebody there.</span> <span id="s541">But he kind of thought that I could come out and we all could live together.</span> <span id="s542">We would get married.</span> <span id="s543">If it works, fine.</span> <span id="s544">If it doesn’t, we could always separate.</span> <span id="s545">See that was ten years after and you know a lot of things happen during ten years.</span> <span id="s546">So, when I got that letter, you know, I never had a second thought that that ought not to work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: So, you weren’t afraid that maybe you’d both changed in that almost ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I wasn’t afraid of it, but it helped me not to be afraid of it, that I didn’t have to leave anybody behind, and that’s very important.</span> <span id="s549">If my parents would have been alive, I don’t know whether I could have that easily leave.</span> <span id="s550">Because at that time, you know, America was pretty far.</span> <span id="s551">And… or my brothers, I didn’t have anybody to leave.</span> <span id="s552">I mean I didn’t have that feeling that, “Oh my God, what would be my choice?”</span> <span id="s553">So, when I got that letter, I right away thought I’d like to come.</span> <span id="s554">And not because I wanted to come out to the United States, but I knew him well and I felt like… you know I never had a second thought that I ought not to do this.</span> <span id="s555">But I didn’t have my parents anymore to leave.</span> <span id="s556">I didn’t have my brothers to leave.</span> <span id="s557">I had maybe a friend or so, but I didn’t mind leaving her.</span> <span id="s558">So, it was a test again that I was hoping that it will work out.</span> <span id="s559">I wasn’t absolutely sure about that, but I wanted to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: What were your ideas about the United States or preconceptions about it?</span> <span id="s561">What had you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Well, Sandy has written to me while I was Paris for six weeks, practically every day, and gave me a lot of ideas of what’s going on.</span> <span id="s563">And two things were interesting…</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Maybe I should just interrupt you to point, to say that, for the sake of the tape, that after the war you spent a year or so in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Between Eger and Budapest, but I stayed in Budapest with an aunt and an uncle, who took me in.</span> <span id="s566">And to Eger I only went because I had to give up my apartment and I had to deal with that.</span> <span id="s567">I had an uncle, my father’s brother, who moved into our apartment after… and he was the first who came back.</span> <span id="s568">So a lot of stuff that I have left, that I found maybe pictures or something like that, it could be that it got into his hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What was that like, to return to Eger and have to deal with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help in our house, when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help a little bit.</span> <span id="s571">I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife.</span> <span id="s572">I think all mothers like to do that.</span> <span id="s573">And I remember that one day she was making me dust the furniture in the bedroom, although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main street walking.</span> <span id="s574">And I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s575">I could have done dusting the furniture in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be down with my friends.</span> <span id="s576">So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many other kids, I didn’t want to maybe do what my chore would have been.</span> <span id="s577">After I came back and I had that big apartment, and I remember I worked like a dog.</span> <span id="s578">You know, we had hardwood floors.</span> <span id="s579">And at that time, you know, you didn’t have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the vacuum cleaners like they have them now.</span> <span id="s580">I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I waxed the floor.</span> <span id="s581">And under your other foot, you have a rag.</span> <span id="s582">I mean, you never saw anything like that, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Had anyone lived in that house during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, yes, different people lived in it and then they moved out and when I came back, my uncle was there.</span> <span id="s585">But I tried to get the house back in the shape like I remembered that it was before.</span> <span id="s586">And all I could, always, and I think I cried at that time, if my mother just would see now, how I’m trying to take care of the house, when earlier I wouldn’t even want to dust the furniture.</span> <span id="s587">So, I was very proud of myself.</span> <span id="s588">And you know, I mean, I don’t remember the crying spells, but I would get very emotional, even now that I’m talking about it.</span> <span id="s589">If she just could have seen now what I’m doing, when I really didn’t have to, but I did it for myself or maybe to just the way the place looked like before.</span> <span id="s590">I wanted to put it back into that same shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: It sounds like, over the years, it’s kind of been, that your parents have been with you and a lot of times, you think about them looking on the things you’ve done.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I do, I even could cry, see, right now.</span> <span id="s593">But when you’re in the middle of it, you know, I think I just took it the way I had to.</span> <span id="s594">But yes, of course, I mean I do think about them a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Did you sell that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: That house wasn’t owned by us.</span> <span id="s597">Our first house what we lived in, which was very pretty and very big, with a big garden, that was sold.</span> <span id="s598">This apartment, I think, belonged to, as I said, it was above the bank.</span> <span id="s599">And I think that was rented.</span> <span id="s600">So, I didn’t sell anything there.</span> <span id="s601">I had to sell furnitures.</span> <span id="s602">And I had to get rid of all that, but the apartment didn’t belong to us.</span> <span id="s603">And I wrote, I gave, I talked to Mary K. about that, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Yes, you did.</span> <span id="s605">So you were talking about when you came to the United States or I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s606">You were talking about how, well I wanted to say for the sake of the tape that when you were leaving, heading toward the United States, you spent six weeks in Paris first, and that was in 1947.</span> <span id="s607">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: 1946.</span> <span id="s609">I left in November and arrived to the States in 1947, January.</span> <span id="s610">So, I left in November and by the time I arrived here, I mean to New York, it was January the 20th.</span> <span id="s611">That was very hard six weeks for me, because I was alone.</span> <span id="s612">It was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Ann Löw Klein.</span> <span id="s615">Since you talked about your experiences in Paris when you did the interview with Mary K. Tachau, I wanted to focus on, you also talked about arriving and what happened once you arrived in the United States and the scary experience that you had being detained before you were let off.</span> <span id="s616">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s617">You did talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah, so I don’t want to repeat that.</span> <span id="s619">That was just for one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: One thing that I was particularly interested in was that it looked like… let me check my notes.</span> <span id="s621">But it looked like you arrived, you arrived in the U.S. on January 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And then you were married on January 29th?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: The 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s626">So, how did you, was it difficult to… and also you mentioned that Sandy was in finals at that time.</span> <span id="s627">So, he was extremely busy when you arrived.</span> <span id="s628">How did you… when did you have time to catch up together?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well, I have also managed… I must have told in the interview that he had an uncle in Washington, so I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s630">And that was very hard for me too, as I mentioned, because I couldn’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s631">And they were friendly and nice with me, but when you can’t communicate… I mean, everything is so strange when you are at a new place.</span> <span id="s632">But what I must say now, and I don’t know if I ever said it.</span> <span id="s633">That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a feeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation.</span> <span id="s634">And I always used to think that’s very hard, but how much better it is than it was then.</span> <span id="s635">So, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it to, lots of times.</span> <span id="s636">That if I was able to take that, my God, I should be able to take this.</span> <span id="s637">It wasn’t that easy, but he, after school he would come over and then we would go out.</span> <span id="s638">Then we would try, it wasn’t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it was… you had to adjust to that, too.</span> <span id="s639">Plus I don’t think I talked too much about my experiences then.</span> <span id="s640">And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small wedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust to things, easier I think than maybe many other people.</span> <span id="s641">And if something is a hardship or like, you could say, “My God you haven’t been with him for a long time, that must have been hard.”</span> <span id="s642">Must have been hard to be in a home, a nice home in Washington, D.C. with an American woman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this country since age 14, children who wanted to be nice to me, but it’s hard.</span> <span id="s643">And it was hard, but I adjusted to that too.</span> <span id="s644">And I mean I didn’t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better.</span> <span id="s645">And I always compared things like that, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know?</span> <span id="s646">And so I adjust to things easier, I think.</span> <span id="s647">See I don’t know whether I told Mary K. about my Bloomington experiences or did we talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Just a little bit.</span> <span id="s649">You mentioned that you were living in a trailer with no running water and Sandy was in Graduate school at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah, yeah, so I don’t want to repeat it again, but to me that’s a hardship.</span> <span id="s651">I mean not… I had a nice home at home, we always had running water in bathrooms.</span> <span id="s652">In Auschwitz, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s653">In the Bloomington campus, living in a trailer, in a tiny, little place, where I had to bring the water in at night and go to the john and take a shower.</span> <span id="s654">And not many people who were brought up in this country with all the comfort would accept that.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did you talk with Sandy about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh, I’m sure I did, but I don’t recall it exactly when.</span> <span id="s657">I’m sure.</span> <span id="s658">And, you know, but I don’t think that I talked about it all the time.</span> <span id="s659">And as I mentioned, I didn’t talk to other people for a long time about it, till the opportunity arose that I would, maybe this subject matter would come up.</span> <span id="s660">But that was years and years after.</span> <span id="s661">But I don’t think this was my topic of conversation that I would talk about that all the time.</span> <span id="s662">I probably thought about it a lot, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s663">And when my kids were growing up, I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to make a big emphasis on that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s664">They knew it.</span> <span id="s665">I mean, we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s666">But because you are Jewish, something like this could happen.</span> <span id="s667">I didn’t want them to grow up like that.</span> <span id="s668">My older daughter was, later on in life, objecting to it that I was holding many things back.</span> <span id="s669">I did not want them to feel that they would be persecuted just because they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s670">They knew I was Jewish and Sandy was, but I didn’t make a big deal about it.</span> <span id="s671">So, I was holding back.</span> <span id="s672">I didn’t tell them stories about it till they got much, much older.</span> <span id="s673">Now they all have the tape and they know about it.</span> <span id="s674">But I didn’t feel that, that should be important.</span> <span id="s675">I didn’t want to make them worried and unhappy as time would go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Did you feel safe in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I did, except in my interview I might have told you that I got a job.</span> <span id="s678">Did I say that in Washington, D.C. to do alteration at Garfinkel Department Store.</span> <span id="s679">And you had to fill out the application and they asked what religion you are.</span> <span id="s680">And I think I wrote down, or I might put a dash, but I was very worried about that.</span> <span id="s681">You know, I thought to myself this country is a safe country and it’s a free country and why do they want to know?</span> <span id="s682">What could be the result of it?</span> <span id="s683">So, for a very long time, for years, and I told that in one of the interviews, I worked in that place and I was afraid that they were going to ask me what church I go to.</span> <span id="s684">I wouldn’t have lied to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: But it concerned me that this should be a topic of conversation and what could be the result if they find out that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s687">And that worried me for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s688">I thought that in this country, everything is free.</span> <span id="s689">And I also told you that when I… in my interview, I’m sure, that when I arrived to New York and we were waiting for a cab to go to the railroad station and my little suitcase was stolen.</span> <span id="s690">Did I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Uh uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Okay, well my uncle in Budapest gave me a lovely, nice black patent leather, little overnight case with red leather lining.</span> <span id="s693">And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe jewelry and I can’t remember, as presents or Sandy’s sister has given me certain things from her mom, was in that.</span> <span id="s694">And I held onto it in Paris.</span> <span id="s695">I took care of all my belongings.</span> <span id="s696">And when we arrived in New York and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s697">And by then I felt I don’t have to watch that much anymore.</span> <span id="s698">I think I just didn’t take care of my things as much.</span> <span id="s699">And when they were putting the things into the cab… I didn’t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing.</span> <span id="s700">So somebody as we were talking right next to the, on the railroad station waiting for a cab to come, must have picked it up and they stole it.</span> <span id="s701">And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this country is very safe.</span> <span id="s702">Things like that, it would not happen.</span> <span id="s703">Because Sandy always used to write to me that they put a 25 cents down near the newspaper and nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get your paper.</span> <span id="s704">So, I thought no crime is happening in this country.</span> <span id="s705">And that was one of my disappointments.</span> <span id="s706">The other one was the Ellis Island and I had to be there.</span> <span id="s707">And he also wrote to me that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid.</span> <span id="s708">And he said to me that, you know, you gotta be, if you are going to meet her… because I’ve never seen black people.</span> <span id="s709">And he just kind of tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and Sandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a white.</span> <span id="s710">And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever seen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice.</span> <span id="s711">They’re just like whites and they can’t help that they’re persecuted and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s712">So, I was prepared for all that.</span> <span id="s713">And I tell you, in this country, in Louisville, Kentucky, I was terribly disappointed at one time.</span> <span id="s714">I met a young couple, Jewish couple, who invited us to their house.</span> <span id="s715">And I don’t know where they are now and they seemed like they were prejudiced against blacks from their talk.</span> <span id="s716">And I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s717">I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many Jewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks.</span> <span id="s718">Now, I know.</span> <span id="s719">I couldn’t believe that anybody who is persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else.</span> <span id="s720">And that was another disappointment in my life that I couldn’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: That was the first time you had been confronted directly with that kind of person?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: That was already in Louisville, so that was several years after.</span> <span id="s723">At the Bloomington campus there were black people.</span> <span id="s724">And… but when somebody would make a remark like that, it was some sort of prejudice remark and I was very surprised.</span> <span id="s725">I didn’t know that Jews could be prejudiced, but I know they are.</span> <span id="s726">I mean they could be, but it surprised me very much.</span> <span id="s727">When you said, “How did you take, were you satisfied with everything in the United States?”</span> <span id="s728">Mainly, yes, but little things like that.</span> <span id="s729">That it’s not as free and not as honest as I thought the way they were described to me at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Let me ask you, you had, you had come to this country and begun to kind of settle down and live more of a normal in quotes, life…</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Well, not very normal.</span> <span id="s732">In Washington, yes, we had couple of apartments and we worked hard to get it.</span> <span id="s733">Little apartments.</span> <span id="s734">But when we moved to Bloomington, Indiana, that’s when we had the trailer, because he would have liked to get housing for married couple.</span> <span id="s735">But they were hard to get.</span> <span id="s736">They were not available all the time.</span> <span id="s737">So, I stayed in Washington with a friend of his for a few weeks after he already had to be in school by September.</span> <span id="s738">And I had a baby by then, my son, Andy, was born May the 4th, 1948.</span> <span id="s739">And when did you come to talk to me last time here?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: It was maybe a couple of months ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Was it after January or was it before?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Did I tell you that my son died?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: No, I don’t think you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: My oldest, this one, I’m just talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Oh, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: That was, that’s why I wondered if it was after January, then you had to be here before January, because I would have mentioned it to you.</span> <span id="s748">But I’m not sure when you were here.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I don’t remember either.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: So, anyway my son was born.</span> <span id="s751">His name was Andy.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Was he named after your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes, kind of, because my brother’s name was András.</span> <span id="s754">In our family, cousins and so on, I don’t know why, but so many people name their children… in Argentina it’s Andres, in Hungary it was András and in the United States it was Andrew.</span> <span id="s755">But I started it.</span> <span id="s756">I named him Andrew.</span> <span id="s757">His middle name was Allen.</span> <span id="s758">So, I stayed with a young couple for a few weeks in Budapest, and Sandy had to be already, not Budapest, in Washington.</span> <span id="s759">He had to be in Bloomington.</span> <span id="s760">And the only thing he could get was that trailer.</span> <span id="s761">So, he didn’t want me to stay in Washington that long, and so I think I took the train, at that time trains were more popular, with my baby, who was five months old when we moved to Bloomington.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: And you lived in this trailer with a five month old baby and no running water?</span> <span id="s763">How did you manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well, that is where I am tough.</span> <span id="s765">I never thought that a baby should not have a bath, so every single day I would go and get the water, put it in that little bitty sink… that whole trailer was not as big as this porch.</span> <span id="s766">Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: And this porch is about 20 feet long…</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: It could not have been that big.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: …by 15 feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And I don’t know whether the Holocaust Museum is even interested in that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s771">I just tell you.</span> <span id="s772">One section of it was that if you opened the studio, gosh that made a bed.</span> <span id="s773">That’s what we slept on.</span> <span id="s774">Then the middle part was just a little sink, a tiny, little sink and some sort of a cooking facility, tiny.</span> <span id="s775">And the third part of it was, it was kind of those round top of the trailers.</span> <span id="s776">The campus, I heard, bought them all from somewhere for a dollar apiece.</span> <span id="s777">And we paid 25 dollars for that.</span> <span id="s778">The third part was just big enough for a little crib, so I don’t think it was as big as this.</span> <span id="s779">Might have been half of the size.</span> <span id="s780">I was very… I accepted that, too.</span> <span id="s781">And you know, I used to think, well now I’m free and I’m not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s782">Some people wouldn’t have lived like that, they rented an apartment maybe, housing place.</span> <span id="s783">Then they complained all the time that the landlady told them that they use too much water and they have the lights on too long.</span> <span id="s784">And we were kind of feeling that we do whatever we want in that little trailer.</span> <span id="s785">And so that was somewhat our own, 25 dollars, all utilities included.</span> <span id="s786">You couldn’t go any better.</span> <span id="s787">And Sandy was making, getting some kind of a, you know he was on the G.I. Bill.</span> <span id="s788">And then in graduate school he did some sort of a little extra work.</span> <span id="s789">So, the G.I. Bill paid his tuition.</span> <span id="s790">Maybe he got a hundred twenty-five dollars or whatever, 150 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s791">So the 25 dollars was for rent and then we lived on the rest of it.</span> <span id="s792">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s793">But again I just accepted things better than a lot of people.</span> <span id="s794">My God, if I would see my friends’ children now living under that condition, they would think, “My God, I can’t live like that.”</span> <span id="s795">But we did.</span> <span id="s796">Then we moved into another trailer which was a little taller and we didn’t bump our heads all the time.</span> <span id="s797">Might have mentioned it, too.</span> <span id="s798">And then we got a Hoosier Court apartment, where we had two bedrooms and a kitchen and it was normal, for $42.50.</span> <span id="s799">And that’s where we lived then all during the time we were in Bloomington.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: A couple of questions, one is you talked a little bit about how you felt, and there were a few examples of how you were kind of hiding your Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s801">You had your number removed, your Auschwitz number removed from your arm.</span> <span id="s802">And you talked about how when you were working at Garfinkels you didn’t, you didn’t want to talk…</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I worried because I, see now I can talk to anybody and I don’t care, you know, that I would be denying my religion.</span> <span id="s804">At that time, I worried, you know, what could be the consequences of that?</span> <span id="s805">Or I mentioned that, maybe in Mary K.’s interview, but I will say when we moved to Louisville, Kentucky and we lived in the South end, so that was in 1953.</span> <span id="s806">And I was in concentration camp in ‘45, so that was almost eight years after.</span> <span id="s807">And we had a neighbor next door, she took me around, showed me the Iroquois Park.</span> <span id="s808">It’s a pretty city.</span> <span id="s809">They had a child my son’s, Andy’s age.</span> <span id="s810">And she asked me what church I go to.</span> <span id="s811">And I told her, “I don’t go to any church, I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s812">And I said it without any worry.</span> <span id="s813">But I thought to myself, if she still will speak to me after this, I’m okay.</span> <span id="s814">If not…?</span> <span id="s815">See, and that was eight years after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What about your own relationship with Judaism?</span> <span id="s817">Did you do anything to, any, go to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I’m not, not in Bloomington, Indiana.</span> <span id="s819">It went through my mind a lot of times, what so many other refugees might have told you, maybe not, some people might have gotten more religious.</span> <span id="s820">Some people might have had some doubts.</span> <span id="s821">Where was God when all this happened?</span> <span id="s822">So that went through my mind a lot.</span> <span id="s823">Now, Sandy’s family was Orthodox and they were very religious.</span> <span id="s824">When he came to this country, he asked his uncle, the first Rosh Hashanah, that he would like to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s825">And the uncle, since he was married to a non-Jewish person, said, “I’ll ask a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s826">He’ll pick you up.”</span> <span id="s827">Well, in Hungary, when you went to the temple, you first of all didn’t go by car.</span> <span id="s828">You couldn’t drive on that day.</span> <span id="s829">So, somebody picked him up and took him to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s830">It was not a, it was not a Conservative one.</span> <span id="s831">And maybe the men did not wear hats, maybe they did.</span> <span id="s832">The men and the women were together, not like in… even where I belong to… his family was, they were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s833">Mine were not.</span> <span id="s834">But in our synagogue, the women sit upstairs and the men sit downstairs.</span> <span id="s835">So, he was very, very disappointed.</span> <span id="s836">An organ in the synagogue, music, I mean everything, just what he never had before.</span> <span id="s837">And somehow it didn’t remind him of anything he remembered.</span> <span id="s838">And that turned him off somehow.</span> <span id="s839">I mean, maybe shouldn’t have, but it did.</span> <span id="s840">So some people could be considered very religious and they keep it up.</span> <span id="s841">He didn’t.</span> <span id="s842">When I came out to this country, we did not belong to anything, at all.</span> <span id="s843">And I somehow didn’t miss it, but when my kids were getting to be Sunday school age, and that was already in Louisville, Kentucky, then we did join a synagogue at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Which one did you join?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: At that time it was called B’rith Sholom.</span> <span id="s846">It was not a Conservative.</span> <span id="s847">But we did, because I felt like the kids ought to have some Jewish background.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: It was not Conservative?</span> <span id="s849">Is that what you said?</span> <span id="s850">Or it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Let’s see, which is the least religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Oh, Reform?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Reformed.</span> <span id="s854">It was Reformed.</span> <span id="s855">Conservative is more religious.</span> <span id="s856">But there you would go and it was the type, again, it reminded me more of a Protestant type of church.</span> <span id="s857">You know, it was just so strange to me and of course everything was in English and very little in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s858">But we belonged there and I went to the holidays and took the kids.</span> <span id="s859">But since we did not observe it, the way some, and I don’t know how religious your family is, so I’m not comparing myself to anybody else.</span> <span id="s860">I’m just telling it to you.</span> <span id="s861">Therefore I didn’t expect my children to become that religious either.</span> <span id="s862">I took them to Sunday school, because I felt like they should have that background.</span> <span id="s863">But the Sunday schools at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything that I would think desirable.</span> <span id="s864">The teachers were just volunteer people.</span> <span id="s865">The discipline was not very good.</span> <span id="s866">The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they walked over to an ice cream place and they came back.</span> <span id="s867">I would hear stories like that.</span> <span id="s868">And that disappointed me, because it didn’t leave any impression on them.</span> <span id="s869">Now, the Sunday schools now that, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is married to a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s870">And they do belong and I do too, now, to Temple Shalom, which is actually one branch of the B’rith Sholom, which long time ago closed up.</span> <span id="s871">And Adath Israel and B’rith Sholom merged and it became the Temple, which is a big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there.</span> <span id="s872">And the Temple Shalom is a lot more Reformed and we do like our rabbi very much.</span> <span id="s873">And I go on High Holy days.</span> <span id="s874">I don’t go that often, but he’s a real nice guy.</span> <span id="s875">And Linda’s kids go to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s876">And the teachers are nice.</span> <span id="s877">They learn a lot more and they like to go.</span> <span id="s878">My kids didn’t like to go, because they just didn’t get anything out of it.</span> <span id="s879">And I’m sorry about that, but that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s880">Now, my son-in-law here, Mark, actually even teaches Sunday school at that same place.</span> <span id="s881">And I felt like I wanted to join.</span> <span id="s882">Sandy wouldn’t have cared either way.</span> <span id="s883">I said, now in my older age, I kind of felt like… because I’m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can never ever get out of your system.</span> <span id="s884">So, it’s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays in Europe.</span> <span id="s885">Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my family while they were sitting, all day long at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s886">We were not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s887">We didn’t keep kosher, so… and I like that.</span> <span id="s888">Because I knew a lot of religious people who… like in Sandy’s family maybe they didn’t eat in their home, but they would go out and eat stuff that they really shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s889">Or Mark’s family in Brooklyn, they were very religious.</span> <span id="s890">They kept kosher.</span> <span id="s891">When they come to visit to Louisville, we would go out for dinner and absolutely never failed that the father would not order maybe bacon or ham or that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s892">And I felt like that’s kind of, you know, it’s not really true.</span> <span id="s893">Either you keep it or you don’t keep it.</span> <span id="s894">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s895">They’re both dead now and I liked them very much.</span> <span id="s896">But my family wasn’t like that.</span> <span id="s897">We ate anything and we weren’t… and I kind of like that.</span> <span id="s898">I don’t know whether you’re religious or not, very religious or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: How did you get from Bloomington to Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Well, we were living in Bloomington from 1948 to 1951.</span> <span id="s901">My daughter, actually she’s coming tomorrow from Seattle.</span> <span id="s902">She was born in 1950 in Bloomington.</span> <span id="s903">Andy was born in Washington, D.C. ‘51 we moved to Marion, Indiana and spent one year there.</span> <span id="s904">And I might have told that to Mary K. Sandy was having to do his internship in Psychology at the VA Hospital, so we lived there for one year.</span> <span id="s905">The rents over there were a lot more expensive now than in Bloomington on the campus.</span> <span id="s906">And his pay was a little bit more, but not very much and I had two kids by then.</span> <span id="s907">And many of the wives of the people who were there on internship, did some work at night.</span> <span id="s908">And I wanted to do some work myself.</span> <span id="s909">And there was a glass factory, the Forbes.</span> <span id="s910">They manufactured all kinds of bottles, just beer bottles, little bottles and so on.</span> <span id="s911">And I got a job there.</span> <span id="s912">I never done that kind of work, but I did it.</span> <span id="s913">And I went to work at six o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s914">He came home from the VA at 4:30.</span> <span id="s915">So, he took care of the kids and I went to work at six and came home at midnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: And that was kind of hard work, but again I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s918">And the only reason I wanted to do it because I wanted a couple of things that I felt like I can’t afford.</span> <span id="s919">I wanted an ironing board, which happened to be the Mary Proctor ironing board, which was expensive at the time and actually not very long ago it finally broke on me.</span> <span id="s920">And Sandy would have liked to have a good camera, so I decided I would work, because nothing extra like that we would have had enough money.</span> <span id="s921">I’ll work for a month or two, I thought, but then I couldn’t leave the work.</span> <span id="s922">And I worked all the way until it was time for us to leave.</span> <span id="s923">I can’t remember what the pay was.</span> <span id="s924">I do know that it was really cold in winter time, because you had assembly lines and close to a door and it was freezing.</span> <span id="s925">And it would have, have you ever seen a Charlie Chaplin movie, you know?</span> <span id="s926">Like where the best part of my work was when there was something wrong with the assembly line and the machine stopped.</span> <span id="s927">And there would be a space.</span> <span id="s928">Otherwise you just had to constantly pick up the bottles, check them for a minute, like this, and put them in a box.</span> <span id="s929">And you could not stop.</span> <span id="s930">Then somebody would be coming and relieve you in order to go to the restroom.</span> <span id="s931">And I did that from all the way till the end of our staying there, which was sometimes in the middle of summer.</span> <span id="s932">And we went back to Bloomington, Indiana, because he had to get his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s933">See that was just a year internship.</span> <span id="s934">Not much to be told about that year.</span> <span id="s935">You know, I had two kids and I worked and he worked, so not much was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: No, not there.</span> <span id="s938">But I don’t think in Marion, yet, I talked to anybody about that.</span> <span id="s939">First of all, we knew a few people, but we didn’t make too many friends.</span> <span id="s940">And the subject never came up.</span> <span id="s941">And I was so busy with the kids that, you know, I didn’t talk about it, or… I remember we were renting in Marion, a National home for 92 dollars.</span> <span id="s942">And I was sick one time with strep throat.</span> <span id="s943">And Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something.</span> <span id="s944">And he got so excited and he was doing the laundry.</span> <span id="s945">And we had some sort of washing machine that you had to stop it in between all the periods.</span> <span id="s946">And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over the whole National home, you know, it’s… I don’t know if you know what they are like.</span> <span id="s947">They are pre-fab houses, so they’re not very super, but it was nice.</span> <span id="s948">It was like a two or three bedroom little house with a modern kitchen.</span> <span id="s949">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s950">So then not much happened in Marion and we went back to Bloomington, Indiana.</span> <span id="s951">And we bought a car.</span> <span id="s952">That was our first time that we had a car already in Marion.</span> <span id="s953">And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the VA, because it was just a nice big campus that no traffic.</span> <span id="s954">But my real experience for learning how to drive was still in Bloomington, Indiana.</span> <span id="s955">For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to drive, but since we didn’t have a car, I couldn’t practice it.</span> <span id="s956">So, in Marion we did have a car and I practiced how to drive.</span> <span id="s957">And I went back to Bloomington, Indiana, I got my license.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: So then we… how did we get to Louisville, your question was.</span> <span id="s961">A friend of Sandy’s heard about a job and he was offered that job.</span> <span id="s962">It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Child Guidance Clinic here in Louisville.</span> <span id="s963">And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist.</span> <span id="s964">And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy.</span> <span id="s965">And so he came to Louisville and he applied for it.</span> <span id="s966">And he got that job at the Child Guidance Clinic, which was for one year only.</span> <span id="s967">And that was kind of very nice.</span> <span id="s968">We lived in an apartment in the South end, it’s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s969">Now that was many years later.</span> <span id="s970">And the people at the Child Guidance Clinic were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s971">They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists.</span> <span id="s972">They practically took us in like a family.</span> <span id="s973">They had lot of family get-togethers.</span> <span id="s974">And we didn’t go out otherwise.</span> <span id="s975">Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954.</span> <span id="s976">So we moved to Louisville in ‘53 and we still lived in the South end when she was born.</span> <span id="s977">And our assignment was only for one year.</span> <span id="s978">And now my story is really important here, but I couldn’t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September.</span> <span id="s979">And we didn’t have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little.</span> <span id="s980">And our apartment at the Washington Park apartments was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so.</span> <span id="s981">We had to pay utilities, too.</span> <span id="s982">So I told Sandy just anything he could do.</span> <span id="s983">And by then I could walk to the grocery, because it was right behind our apartments.</span> <span id="s984">I could walk, we had one car, I could walk to the pediatrician.</span> <span id="s985">And I never did anything else, like go to town or do that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s986">And I said, “I wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don’t have to move just exactly in September.”</span> <span id="s987">Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job opportunities.</span> <span id="s988">So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job.</span> <span id="s989">And we would have had to move.</span> <span id="s990">Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the Child Guidance Clinic gave him a part time job.</span> <span id="s991">And at Norton he worked part time and in one other hospital it was part time.</span> <span id="s992">I mean, just very little, here and there.</span> <span id="s993">Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our friends, too.</span> <span id="s994">And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them.</span> <span id="s995">And they offered him to try and see if he would like that.</span> <span id="s996">And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that’s how we stayed in Louisville.</span> <span id="s997">He worked with them for a long time.</span> <span id="s998">And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people.</span> <span id="s999">We’re still friends.</span> <span id="s1000">And Linda was born in ‘54, so I didn’t have to move away.</span> <span id="s1001">And then we stayed in the apartments until 1957.</span> <span id="s1002">And we were looking for a house and we found this and we have been here ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: What year was that, that you moved here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: 1957.</span> <span id="s1005">So, from ‘53 to ‘57 we lived there.</span> <span id="s1006">At that time, I didn’t have my fourth child, yet.</span> <span id="s1007">Now there is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me.</span> <span id="s1008">And then… but you ask me, because I don’t know what you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: I wondered about when you first arrived and you talked about, you mentioned a little earlier, you had a taken a walk through Iroquois Park and so forth, and it occurred to me that at that time, Iroquois Park was segregated and black people, I think, were not…</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Yeah, I read something about that.</span> <span id="s1012">I was wondering if you noticed segregation in Louisville and whether that, because you had mentioned earlier that it made an impression on you that black people were treated differently than whites.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when… you know I’ve been watching those programs all the time, but I don’t remember the dates.</span> <span id="s1014">When was it that finally, really, for example, black people didn’t have to sit on the back of the bus and all that?</span> <span id="s1015">Do you remember dates like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: It was different in different cities, and I’m not sure exactly for Louisville.</span> <span id="s1017">But probably mid-1960s, early 1960s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the ‘60s.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn’t, it didn’t leave any special impression with me.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn’t go anywhere much, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">I was very busy with the kids.</span> <span id="s1022">And I didn’t even watch, well we didn’t have any television at that time, I remember.</span> <span id="s1023">It was later.</span> <span id="s1024">And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved.</span> <span id="s1025">But I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do.</span> <span id="s1026">By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just… I was very, very busy.</span> <span id="s1027">And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn’t really that much of a help.</span> <span id="s1028">He couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1029">In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year.</span> <span id="s1030">Because his uncle in Washington had a summer home in Annapolis, Maryland and he offered for us to go there.</span> <span id="s1031">So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to Annapolis by next day.</span> <span id="s1032">And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not.</span> <span id="s1033">It wasn’t really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn’t a luxury.</span> <span id="s1034">But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a boat ride.</span> <span id="s1035">But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation.</span> <span id="s1036">So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that place.</span> <span id="s1037">But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that.</span> <span id="s1038">And when we come to schools maybe, you might like to… and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who… the school was nearby us here, where we live even now.</span> <span id="s1039">That’s where he went to elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What was the name of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Belknap, Belknap Elementary School, which is no longer existing, the building is there, but no more.</span> <span id="s1042">And all my kids went to that school.</span> <span id="s1043">Then, we, well in the South end, I’m sorry we lived.</span> <span id="s1044">Andy went to, isn’t that funny, I forgot the name of it, now.</span> <span id="s1045">There was an elementary school there.</span> <span id="s1046">And he was in fourth grade when we moved here.</span> <span id="s1047">And my youngest daughter, I mean Elizabeth was two years younger, so she went to kindergarten over there.</span> <span id="s1048">And the name would come to me later, but I don’t think it’s that important.</span> <span id="s1049">So in here, since we lived all our life here, let me just talk about that.</span> <span id="s1050">They went to Belknap Elementary School.</span> <span id="s1051">And then to, and Andy finished here.</span> <span id="s1052">He was in sixth grade.</span> <span id="s1053">And he met some really nice friends on our street.</span> <span id="s1054">Then they went to Highland Junior High School.</span> <span id="s1055">Now, the friend, who we met here and became friendly with Andy was two years older.</span> <span id="s1056">Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type.</span> <span id="s1057">And he started a club.</span> <span id="s1058">I don’t know how much you know about social clubs.</span> <span id="s1059">We belonged to the Jewish Community Center, too.</span> <span id="s1060">Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they would ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know… because he had problems, you know, as a child psychologist with kids, they’re so upset and depressed over that they were not included in one of those clubs.</span> <span id="s1061">And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed.</span> <span id="s1062">So, my kids were invited to it, but they weren’t terribly active at the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1063">For example, they had those, it’s really not important to even talk about.</span> <span id="s1064">But Andy’s friend started a new club.</span> <span id="s1065">It was called the Princeton.</span> <span id="s1066">And there was no question that blacks should not be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: You mean there was no question, that of course blacks should be part of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: They should be part of it.</span> <span id="s1069">I mean his was an integrated club and that was his main concern, that anybody, Jews or blacks should be able to… whether they did or not, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1070">But Andy was Jewish and he was part of that club.</span> <span id="s1071">So, he finished, that was junior high school and I cannot talk forever about anything.</span> <span id="s1072">Then he went to Atherton High School and he finished that.</span> <span id="s1073">And he was in the marching band, but he never liked to wear uniforms.</span> <span id="s1074">He had had to, would have, but they were just kind of… that psychiatrist’s son, who gave Sandy the job, he had a son Andy’s age.</span> <span id="s1075">And they were together in the marching band.</span> <span id="s1076">And they would carry their uniform.</span> <span id="s1077">They wouldn’t be caught dead putting it on and go like that.</span> <span id="s1078">I’ll try to make that all brief.</span> <span id="s1079">He graduated from high school in 1966 and went away to college to Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1080">He left in September.</span> <span id="s1081">I got him all ready, with clothes and everything else.</span> <span id="s1082">By then I had my youngest one, who was six years old, because he was born in 1960…</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Robert, the younger one, who is now living in Nashville.</span> <span id="s1085">Well, my big tragedy comes now, that in September he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1086">Friday before Thanksgiving in November, Sandy left, went to Atlanta to a psychological meeting.</span> <span id="s1087">I was just cleaning up all the leaves in the yard, got a call from Appleton that Andy was in an accident.</span> <span id="s1088">Well, what happened, that they lived on the dorm… and there was a church, which was already barricaded and people didn’t go in there, but sometimes they did, with the idea boys will be boys.</span> <span id="s1089">One of Andy’s friends asked him if he wouldn’t mind coming up there.</span> <span id="s1090">And Andy says, “Oh, I’ve been there last week.</span> <span id="s1091">I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s1092">“Oh, come on, I don’t want to go by myself.”</span> <span id="s1093">That kid wanted a light bulb.</span> <span id="s1094">I mean silly thing, it doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1095">They went up into the place.</span> <span id="s1096">It was barricaded, but people went in all the time, because it was kind of like a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1097">And they were way up high and he stepped on a false ceiling, that was… he was in the front and the boy was behind him and he fell through, 35 feet.</span> <span id="s1098">And I got the phone call.</span> <span id="s1099">They wanted me to say that anything they can do, that I should give my… I said my husband was out of town.</span> <span id="s1100">So I want to make that story kind of short, but it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: It was in 1966 in November.</span> <span id="s1103">So, I got into my car, quick went over to that psychiatrist friend of ours, who was just recuperating from pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1104">I told him quick what happened.</span> <span id="s1105">He was trying to reach Sandy in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s1106">He called the hospital.</span> <span id="s1107">He told them, they do whatever they need to do.</span> <span id="s1108">(Coughs.)</span> <span id="s1109">Stop it now for a minute, I’m going to get some…</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the Holocaust was enough.</span> <span id="s1112">And I didn’t expect to have another something like this to happen.</span> <span id="s1113">But I handled that pretty well, too.</span> <span id="s1114">But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my friend’s wife offered that she’ll come with me to Appleton.</span> <span id="s1115">And I said, well maybe that’s not necessary.</span> <span id="s1116">We left John Bell, Dr. Bell is the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the Atlanta airport and he turned right back around on the airplane.</span> <span id="s1117">So my friend, his wife, took me to the airport and we felt if he will be on that plane that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy would not come with me.</span> <span id="s1118">In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and Elizabeth was twelve.</span> <span id="s1119">But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from high school, who was Andy’s age.</span> <span id="s1120">And she came to stay with us for a whole year.</span> <span id="s1121">And that was the year that she was staying here, from Buenos Aires, Argentina.</span> <span id="s1122">And she had a hard time to adjust, too.</span> <span id="s1123">She was very homesick.</span> <span id="s1124">But at that time she already decided she’s staying.</span> <span id="s1125">Now, she was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was… well, I had a help in the house too, not all the time, but a couple times a week.</span> <span id="s1126">So, I just packed my stuff.</span> <span id="s1127">I remember the kids all standing next to me.</span> <span id="s1128">And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my suitcase.</span> <span id="s1129">And with her, with Kathy being here, who is 18.</span> <span id="s1130">No, I’m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was twelve and Robert was six.</span> <span id="s1131">So, anyway, I said, “I just have to leave.”</span> <span id="s1132">And I was hoping that everything will turn out okay.</span> <span id="s1133">And I’m still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know, of course terribly worried.</span> <span id="s1134">And I went to the airport.</span> <span id="s1135">Sandy was on that plane coming back from Atlanta and we flew to Appleton, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1136">It was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1137">We didn’t know what we were going to find.</span> <span id="s1138">And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we… somebody took us into the hospital and Andy was under all kind of wires.</span> <span id="s1139">And he was in a coma actually for about three days, completely out of it.</span> <span id="s1140">And Sandy stayed with me until he was coming to, and… not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore.</span> <span id="s1141">And one very important story I must tell you.</span> <span id="s1142">The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the Appleton paper.</span> <span id="s1143">And somebody called the hospital and wanted to meet the parents of this young boy.</span> <span id="s1144">And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they were already older and out of the house.</span> <span id="s1145">And they came to the hospital and not even knowing me or Sandy, they offered their house.</span> <span id="s1146">They lived pretty close to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1147">That I could stay with them.</span> <span id="s1148">And they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1149">And now see, something like that makes me cry.</span> <span id="s1150">I was there for six weeks and I could walk from the hospital to their home.</span> <span id="s1151">The kids were out of her house already, so she had a place.</span> <span id="s1152">I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going.</span> <span id="s1153">And otherwise I spent the whole day in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1154">See the result of all this was, that eventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic.</span> <span id="s1155">But we didn’t know that for a long time, you know.</span> <span id="s1156">I don’t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick, that for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing.</span> <span id="s1157">It doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1158">But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time.</span> <span id="s1159">See Sandy stayed for a little while and then he went back home.</span> <span id="s1160">So, I talked to them on the phone all the time and eventually I got, and I still have that, I never wanted to throw it away.</span> <span id="s1161">I thought now when Andy died, then maybe I will throw it away.</span> <span id="s1162">I can not.</span> <span id="s1163">I have letters and letters and letters people wrote to me, to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1164">And I still have them.</span> <span id="s1165">In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them.</span> <span id="s1166">I never, never could open those letters until just recently.</span> <span id="s1167">And they were helping with the kids and they were bringing food for them and you know, they were… the kids were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1168">They were behaving very nicely.</span> <span id="s1169">And so, I was there for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1170">At Christmas time or holiday time, they came, all of them, to Appleton.</span> <span id="s1171">And that’s the only time we stayed in a hotel, because this family, named Alice and Art, children came home for the holidays and there was not enough room.</span> <span id="s1172">But that made it so much easier for me.</span> <span id="s1173">And of course, I couldn’t sleep well and I got some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor.</span> <span id="s1174">Which even maybe even two pills couldn’t make me relax enough.</span> <span id="s1175">But I there again was… I don’t think I cried.</span> <span id="s1176">I was under tremendous tension all the time, and not knowing what the outcome will be.</span> <span id="s1177">Appleton was finished.</span> <span id="s1178">Finally we decided that we can bring him home.</span> <span id="s1179">So, with an ambulance we brought him home to Louisville.</span> <span id="s1180">And of course, he couldn’t sit up or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1181">I mean, it was… he was paralyzed from waist down.</span> <span id="s1182">But at that time he wasn’t absolutely sure about it, but they gave him a final test.</span> <span id="s1183">And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so injured, and that doesn’t look like, you know, it can be ever… but making the story short, we put him here in Louisville, into a hospital, which at that time was the St. Anthony Hospital.</span> <span id="s1184">We had a friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except… he was a wonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn’t know enough about the whole deal.</span> <span id="s1185">Because I remember we were very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1186">The hospital, like the orderly put him, in the bathroom, put him on the toilet and left him there.</span> <span id="s1187">I mean his back was… he shouldn’t have done that.</span> <span id="s1188">He was there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at the Rusk Institute in New York City.</span> <span id="s1189">That they can transfer him there.</span> <span id="s1190">Which they did, and just very briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend, before Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come home for the weekend.</span> <span id="s1191">Well, that woman was absolutely, she should have never been a nurse.</span> <span id="s1192">She tried to show, she said that she had a daughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while.</span> <span id="s1193">She kept on telling Andy, if you have faith, you will be walking again.</span> <span id="s1194">Well, she should have never said that.</span> <span id="s1195">And then we were over here in that weekend in my house.</span> <span id="s1196">She made him, with crutches and braces, stand above behind the wheelchair.</span> <span id="s1197">And Kathy, who is a big, heavyset girl, sat in the wheelchair.</span> <span id="s1198">And he wanted to prove something, that how much he advanced.</span> <span id="s1199">Well, with the braces, he couldn’t walk, but she made him stand up.</span> <span id="s1200">So, then he sat in a chair in the living room and he says, “Boy that feels good.”</span> <span id="s1201">And the nurse says, “Maybe it feels good for you, but it’s not… maybe it feels good, but it’s not good for you.”</span> <span id="s1202">And Andy says, “Maybe it’s not good for me, but it still feels good.”</span> <span id="s1203">And the woman got so angry, that came out to the kitchen and says, “I’m leaving.”</span> <span id="s1204">And I went out to the kitchen… yes, I did cry then.</span> <span id="s1205">I gave her the check, what I owed her.</span> <span id="s1206">And I couldn’t believe it, he was sitting in that chair upstairs.</span> <span id="s1207">And Sandy calls home, “How is everything going?”</span> <span id="s1208">And I says, whatever the nurse’s name was, she left.</span> <span id="s1209">“I’ll be right home.”</span> <span id="s1210">So, he came home and we had some real good friends, who are still our friends.</span> <span id="s1211">He used to be our family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew Andy’s going to leave.</span> <span id="s1212">And they wanted to say good-bye to him.</span> <span id="s1213">And Andy’s sitting in the chair.</span> <span id="s1214">I tell them the whole story.</span> <span id="s1215">They couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1216">And finally Sandy and Harold Eskind help him down… we have all those steps… helped him down to the bedroom.</span> <span id="s1217">And Harold says, “I’ll come over tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s1218">See she was supposed to be here and help us getting him ready.</span> <span id="s1219">I mean, you know, with a paraplegic, it takes a long time to do that.</span> <span id="s1220">And Harold said, “I’ll come over early in the morning, because I’m not sure when the plane was leaving.”</span> <span id="s1221">And we said, “Oh don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s1222">We’ll just get up an hour earlier,” or whatever.</span> <span id="s1223">And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the TV room right opposite of our bedroom.</span> <span id="s1224">I mean, he was upset and he was worried.</span> <span id="s1225">And he woke up with a hundred and four fever.</span> <span id="s1226">And so, as I said, loud, I said, “God, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now.</span> <span id="s1227">And as I said that, apparently our living room was open and he did come anyway.</span> <span id="s1228">And he was walking in and he says, “Here I am.”</span> <span id="s1229">That was, you know, like an angel coming from heaven.</span> <span id="s1230">He helped us get, he helped us getting Andy ready.</span> <span id="s1231">He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed.</span> <span id="s1232">I didn’t go with them.</span> <span id="s1233">It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to… the Ruskin Institute did marvels.</span> <span id="s1234">He was there for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1235">Luckily his mind was completely well.</span> <span id="s1236">They taught him how to drive.</span> <span id="s1237">They taught him how to get dressed.</span> <span id="s1238">They taught him complete independency.</span> <span id="s1239">And Andy used to be a very stubborn kid as a young person.</span> <span id="s1240">When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do it right then.</span> <span id="s1241">And that helped him tremendously in his accident.</span> <span id="s1242">Of course, he decided and I have a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then later he… I don’t want to jump ahead of myself, but he learned how to do all this.</span> <span id="s1243">He got a car.</span> <span id="s1244">It had a hand control.</span> <span id="s1245">And he was home the first year.</span> <span id="s1246">He used to have a girlfriend from Myrtle Beach from before his accident.</span> <span id="s1247">He says he wants to visit her.</span> <span id="s1248">And we begged him, it’s too early, yet.</span> <span id="s1249">I mean he… all by himself to go to North Carolina or wherever the girl lived.</span> <span id="s1250">He says, “If I would know that I’m going to walk next year, I would wait, but since I know I’m not going to, I want to do it right now.”</span> <span id="s1251">He got in the car, he drove over there.</span> <span id="s1252">I said, “Please call us the minute you get there.”</span> <span id="s1253">He did.</span> <span id="s1254">So, anyway he was really unbelievably… you know, I still say that.</span> <span id="s1255">Then he went back to Lawrence, he went back to Lawrence University for a semester.</span> <span id="s1256">And he did very well, but it got very cold there in Wisconsin and the snow was so high, that he couldn’t even get out of his dormitory to get to the, like to the classes.</span> <span id="s1257">So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, who moved him back and he was transferred to Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s1258">To the University where the climate is different.</span> <span id="s1259">So, he went back there and he finished college in three and a half years, instead of four.</span> <span id="s1260">I mean, he made up.</span> <span id="s1261">And in summer time, he went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent summer school there.</span> <span id="s1262">And one summer he went to Boston, to Harvard, just for a semester.</span> <span id="s1263">So, he made up all his lost time.</span> <span id="s1264">He finished and then he moved out to California.</span> <span id="s1265">He was very independent.</span> <span id="s1266">He did everything on his own.</span> <span id="s1267">And in the beginning, he didn’t really want to come back that much.</span> <span id="s1268">I think the memories and all that.</span> <span id="s1269">For example, he was fighting that we shouldn’t put an elevator in the house.</span> <span id="s1270">He didn’t want us to move and we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1271">We tried to put an elevator in, but with this split-level it wasn’t that easy.</span> <span id="s1272">And when he would come home, he was so matter of fact of anybody who wanted to help him, lift him up.</span> <span id="s1273">I mean, he got used to the idea.</span> <span id="s1274">Then he decided he’s going to go to Social Work school.</span> <span id="s1275">And he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and that’s when he wrote… I could give you that, I mean just for your own fun.</span> <span id="s1276">When he applied to the school, he wrote a beautiful paper, which now after he died, Sandy made a bunch of copies of them.</span> <span id="s1277">And just since you’re interested and all, I give you a copy of that and also a newspaper clipping after he died.</span> <span id="s1278">He got interested in California and don’t ask me why, with a Lyndon LaRouche political group.</span> <span id="s1279">I don’t know if you ever heard of him or not.</span> <span id="s1280">But he met tremendous amount and good friends through all those years, who became so close to him, that in the beginning, I wondered what they are like.</span> <span id="s1281">But then later on we met them.</span> <span id="s1282">They became, besides the political adventures, they were interested in poetry.</span> <span id="s1283">And Andy also loved music, became more and more so.</span> <span id="s1284">He had a selection of CD’s bigger than we have.</span> <span id="s1285">And he, first they lived in San Francisco, then they moved to Livermore, California and I visited him there.</span> <span id="s1286">I met some of those people.</span> <span id="s1287">And then they moved to Los Angeles and I was there.</span> <span id="s1288">Now just a year and a half ago, couple of years ago, he had to have a surgery, a bladder surgery.</span> <span id="s1289">The doctor recommended him, that if he wouldn’t do it, then eventually his kidneys would become infected by it.</span> <span id="s1290">He decided, we asked a lot of informations whether is that a good thing to do.</span> <span id="s1291">And everybody recommended.</span> <span id="s1292">And I went to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1293">I stayed with him for three and a half weeks, while he had the surgery.</span> <span id="s1294">When… Sandy and I went together and then after Sandy had to leave and I stayed.</span> <span id="s1295">And the people were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1296">They gave a big party.</span> <span id="s1297">And they were singing and they read poetry before he went into the hospital.</span> <span id="s1298">Then after that they kept on coming all the time.</span> <span id="s1299">They enlarged the bladder, took a part of the intestine and made the bladder bigger.</span> <span id="s1300">So, anyway, that was the… whatever they had to do.</span> <span id="s1301">_________.</span> <span id="s1302">In fact, both of his doctors were Jewish, just so happened that from the name I could tell.</span> <span id="s1303">Nice, nice people, very nice.</span> <span id="s1304">And he was in a hospital in Los Angeles, in a Mexican, you know, there were a lot of Mexican and Spanish speaking people there.</span> <span id="s1305">And I worried a little bit, because he didn’t have to pay a penny.</span> <span id="s1306">It was, you know he was… since he was a handicapped person, he had all the facilities there, which were paid.</span> <span id="s1307">And they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1308">So, I was pleased with that.</span> <span id="s1309">He recuperated.</span> <span id="s1310">We went home and he worried that his appetite is not as good as it used to be.</span> <span id="s1311">I said, “Don’t worry, I mean, they messed up your stomach.</span> <span id="s1312">You’ll be all right.”</span> <span id="s1313">So, my big job was cooking for him, plus showing him the CD’s, which one he wants first.</span> <span id="s1314">And we played all day long.</span> <span id="s1315">The people he lived with, he had two roommates.</span> <span id="s1316">Andy never got married, two guys.</span> <span id="s1317">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s1318">Then I came home.</span> <span id="s1319">Then I have never seen him afterwards, but he was all right.</span> <span id="s1320">He was going to come back.</span> <span id="s1321">And one day, on a Sunday, January 24th, I get a phone call from his roommate.</span> <span id="s1322">And Chuck says, “I have very sad news for you.”</span> <span id="s1323">And I said, “What?”</span> <span id="s1324">I thought he might have gotten sick again and then I would have gone out to be with him.</span> <span id="s1325">Well, he died in his sleep.</span> <span id="s1326">He didn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s1327">It was a Sunday morning, from Saturday to Sunday.</span> <span id="s1328">Saturday night, he was in the office and they were doing some kind of an experiment.</span> <span id="s1329">They were really bright, intelligent people.</span> <span id="s1330">How they got involved with Lyndon LaRouche… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: And I dealt with it, but I remember when I got this news I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1332">And I still right now, when I say to you that Auschwitz seems like a dream and it wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s1333">Sometimes I think of this and I said, “Is it really true that he’s no longer alive?”</span> <span id="s1334">But then again, I measure certain things.</span> <span id="s1335">We used to worry, what will happen to Andy when we die, and this group falls apart?</span> <span id="s1336">My daughter, Linda, she’s a nurse and she says, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1337">I’ll take care of him.”</span> <span id="s1338">Well, Andy didn’t like to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s1339">He could do everything in the world on his own.</span> <span id="s1340">Anything.</span> <span id="s1341">Driving, shopping.</span> <span id="s1342">I mean you wouldn’t believe it, if I give you something about this, you wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1343">Like we have a friend here, who took him on a Sierra weekend, canoe trip.</span> <span id="s1344">And in the mud, she pushed the wheelchair and he would get into the canoe.</span> <span id="s1345">I mean, there was nothing that he would not want to do.</span> <span id="s1346">He was just brave.</span> <span id="s1347">And when I got this note, I mean I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1348">And we didn’t know quite what to do.</span> <span id="s1349">We had Sandy’s sister here from Hungary for three months, who was eighty-four years old.</span> <span id="s1350">She took this very hard, plus she was too old to travel.</span> <span id="s1351">So, my youngest son, Robert, offered that he’ll come with me to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1352">And we flew over there a week later.</span> <span id="s1353">That was the end of, it was January 31st that they had a memorial service for him.</span> <span id="s1354">And it was really very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1355">When I went into that room… and I know Jewish funerals, well that wasn’t a funeral, just a memorial.</span> <span id="s1356">They had some flowers.</span> <span id="s1357">They had a big poster of Andy.</span> <span id="s1358">He was very involved with… he loved Shakespeare, and they were very intellectual, but at the same time they were just nice, nice people.</span> <span id="s1359">And we had a lovely… the whole memorial service lasted for three and half hours and about 11:30, well everybody decided, it’s time to quit.</span> <span id="s1360">But there were speeches and people were sending letters and all the letters were, some people read poems.</span> <span id="s1361">The day when this happened, in Andy’s house, they were meeting for a poetry reading group, at 11 o’clock, every Sunday.</span> <span id="s1362">And Andy didn’t get up on time, so they were kind of thinking that he went to bed late, maybe he just didn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s1363">But they… and they wondered why, but they weren’t going to wake him up.</span> <span id="s1364">And later on, a few hours later, when he still wasn’t up, Chuck opened his door and he was in bed, asleep.</span> <span id="s1365">And he had died maybe about maybe three, four o’clock.</span> <span id="s1366">So, he did not take good care of his eating habits, I think.</span> <span id="s1367">He loved all the things which are really not that good for you, butter and salami.</span> <span id="s1368">He exercised, but only in the wheelchair, naturally.</span> <span id="s1369">And he just, it had to be a, it was his heart, you know, like he must have had clogged-up arteries.</span> <span id="s1370">Although when he had that surgery, they checked him out and he was okay then.</span> <span id="s1371">I mean, there were no problems, but that was a year and a half later.</span> <span id="s1372">And that’s really what happened.</span> <span id="s1373">Now you can ask me all kinds of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Did you ever feel angry after that, at that point?</span> <span id="s1375">You talked about…</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I felt angry when he had his accident, but not really angry.</span> <span id="s1377">I just could not accept, I thought that one… you know, just there is so much one person should take.</span> <span id="s1378">And I felt to myself, it’s not fair.</span> <span id="s1379">But in the meantime, I realized that it’s nothing fair, you know, this friend of mine, who was going to take me to Annapolis and who was very sympathetic and they had four kids and one of them was a good friend of Andy.</span> <span id="s1380">Their older son was coming home, not even a year afterwards that this happened, coming home from college, and was in a car accident and died in a car accident.</span> <span id="s1381">So, Nancy said she always, she… at that time, I talked about this at the airport.</span> <span id="s1382">We were waiting for the plane to come.</span> <span id="s1383">I told her the same thing I’m telling you, that I thought that, you know, that I had my share and it’s just not fair that now this had to happen.</span> <span id="s1384">And Nancy after that realized, it’s nothing is fair.</span> <span id="s1385">There is no… whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Justice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Justice.</span> <span id="s1388">Whatever is assigned for you, it will happen and you cannot say, just because this happened, nothing else would happen.</span> <span id="s1389">So, I’m now prepared and I hope nothing else would happen, but after he died, I wasn’t angry about that, I was more angry about his… well, not angry, but sad when he had the accident.</span> <span id="s1390">Because no matter how he accepted it and he was great by it.</span> <span id="s1391">And I will give you that, I really will give you, because you seem interested in it.</span> <span id="s1392">The way his friends talked about it all.</span> <span id="s1393">That he never married.</span> <span id="s1394">If he would have been old in the wheelchair, he would have needed help, you know.</span> <span id="s1395">Those people were his friends, but they were not the family.</span> <span id="s1396">If we would have died, we would have wondered.</span> <span id="s1397">So, I used to think about that, what will happen to him.</span> <span id="s1398">And he lived on the absolute minimum, you know?</span> <span id="s1399">Like my youngest son, Robert, he has a big house, he has a boat.</span> <span id="s1400">And he’s an administer, I mean a hospital administer, administrator.</span> <span id="s1401">Andy, nothing, he didn’t, you know he was in the 1960s.</span> <span id="s1402">When the Civil Rights movement was… he was paralyzed… from Texas, he took a bus to Washington, D.C. when they had the march.</span> <span id="s1403">And in the bus, his toes got burned, because his foot was close to the heater and he could never feel it.</span> <span id="s1404">And Sandy was saying, “Do you think you have to go or you want to go?”</span> <span id="s1405">I mean, he was there.</span> <span id="s1406">He said, “If everybody would feel like that they shouldn’t go and use all kinds of excuses, then nobody would be there.”</span> <span id="s1407">So, he just… causes were terribly important to him.</span> <span id="s1408">And now you have to just ask questions.</span> <span id="s1409">I can’t talk to you about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Well, I asked about the anger, because it’s striking to me that you came out of the war and you had lost, your whole family had been killed.</span> <span id="s1411">And that was, of course, a terrible, terrible blow, but my impression of you, from what you’ve told me, is that you were very calm throughout.</span> <span id="s1412">And then you jumped right into marriage and you had kids and you moved and you settled down.</span> <span id="s1413">And then losing your son to such, to this…</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Well that’s, as I said, that can, if I think over all that six weeks in Appleton and now, you know, I mean we got hundreds… well, then we had a memorial service in Louisville, after we came back.</span> <span id="s1415">And I told you that we now belong to Temple Shalom.</span> <span id="s1416">And when this happened, we got the news of Andy dying.</span> <span id="s1417">Linda and Mark, my daughter and husband came over, and I said, I would like our rabbi to know this.</span> <span id="s1418">And Mark called, his name is Stanley Miles.</span> <span id="s1419">He’s a very nice guy, turned out that he’s Andy’s age, lives around the corner.</span> <span id="s1420">And he says, “I’ll be right over.”</span> <span id="s1421">That was at night.</span> <span id="s1422">And I said, “You don’t really have to come, but I wanted you to know it,” because I was thinking then, that I would like to have some sort of a memorial service or something for him in Louisville.</span> <span id="s1423">And he came over and he was visiting with us.</span> <span id="s1424">And he really didn’t know, he knows my daughter and her husband, better than he did us.</span> <span id="s1425">Because as I said, we’re not such a, that we go constantly to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1426">But I was terribly impressed with him.</span> <span id="s1427">And he was so nice and he learned a lot about Andy’s life, because we told him.</span> <span id="s1428">We said we would like to have a memorial service and we did, in the Temple.</span> <span id="s1429">February 28.</span> <span id="s1430">See, that was January, but then we wanted… my daughter from Seattle came home.</span> <span id="s1431">And Sandy has three cousins that, psychiatrist’s kids, who were in Washington when I arrived.</span> <span id="s1432">And we keep, you know, in touch and they like us very much.</span> <span id="s1433">Without us asking, they all wanted to come and I was very touched by it and they did come with their families.</span> <span id="s1434">And we had to get all that put together, so it was February twenty-eight.</span> <span id="s1435">And it was in the newspaper and then it was in the Jewish Post, you know we have a community paper with the community center.</span> <span id="s1436">And there must have been over two hundred people at that.</span> <span id="s1437">I don’t even know, because I sat in the first row.</span> <span id="s1438">I never looked back.</span> <span id="s1439">And the rabbi was… and we played some music, the kind of things that he liked.</span> <span id="s1440">And it was like a string quartet of Schubert.</span> <span id="s1441">The name of it is, “The Death of a Maiden,” and I used to joke with him.</span> <span id="s1442">I said, “When I die, that’s what I want them to play.”</span> <span id="s1443">And he liked it too, so we did that.</span> <span id="s1444">And the rabbi was very nice, talked about us, talked about Andy, as much as he learned from us.</span> <span id="s1445">He met him, actually, once, because my grandson had a Bar Mitzvah two years ago.</span> <span id="s1446">He’s now 15, when he was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1447">And Andy came for that.</span> <span id="s1448">And then the rabbi asked him to read something at that occasion.</span> <span id="s1449">So, he met him.</span> <span id="s1450">He knew he was in the wheelchair, but otherwise he didn’t know that much about him except what we told him.</span> <span id="s1451">That I’m not angry… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1452">I’m not that type, I think.</span> <span id="s1453">I don’t get really, I don’t have many people that I don’t like or that I get angry with.</span> <span id="s1454">I just accept things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: What about, you mentioned earlier, that you’ve taken trips back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1456">Have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Oh, a lot of times.</span> <span id="s1458">The first time, I didn’t want to go back, maybe ever.</span> <span id="s1459">But in 1971, I decided I go back.</span> <span id="s1460">The first time a friend wanted to take me to the house where I was living up to the age 12.</span> <span id="s1461">It’s… the houses in Europe are closed up, you know, the big doors and you can’t see inside.</span> <span id="s1462">So, that person rang the doorbell and I was very reluctant to do this.</span> <span id="s1463">And somebody came to the door and he says, “Well this young lady lived in this house long time ago.”</span> <span id="s1464">They took me in.</span> <span id="s1465">Of course, nothing was the way it was at the time, because in the meantime there was a war.</span> <span id="s1466">There were chicken and pigs, you know like.</span> <span id="s1467">We had flower gardens then.</span> <span id="s1468">But what I appreciated, they wanted to know if I wanted to go inside and I said, “No thank you.”</span> <span id="s1469">I really didn’t want to go back, because it was just, I remember those years so much and I just didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1470">And during the communism, you know, they divided the house.</span> <span id="s1471">That was a big house, so that house was divided into about three or four different sections.</span> <span id="s1472">I didn’t want to go in.</span> <span id="s1473">And then the next time… that was in ‘71.</span> <span id="s1474">Of course it, I mean the first time, it was really hard.</span> <span id="s1475">I didn’t want to run into anybody who I used to know from olden time, but luckily they died.</span> <span id="s1476">You know like, I would have never wanted to run into a police official person, who was in charge of making us go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1477">The Germans gave them the orders, but somebody had to carry it through.</span> <span id="s1478">Well, I never, never ran into them.</span> <span id="s1479">I never saw anybody.</span> <span id="s1480">Old friends of ours, who we really liked, we kept in touch with.</span> <span id="s1481">And we had a very, very, very good friend… this year was really hard for us, not only that Andy died.</span> <span id="s1482">And we had a real good friend in Hungary, who was from our hometown, who was a musicologist.</span> <span id="s1483">And all our trips we took in the last few years… we were in Spain and in Italy and in Sicily and in Greece, several times.</span> <span id="s1484">We did that with that couple.</span> <span id="s1485">He was a few years younger.</span> <span id="s1486">His name was George Kroo and we loved him and his wife and he loved us.</span> <span id="s1487">And one day I got a phone call from his daughter that his father died, he had a heart attack, at work.</span> <span id="s1488">So Sandy went to Hungary to his funeral.</span> <span id="s1489">He was married to a non-Jewish girl, but we loved them dearly.</span> <span id="s1490">So, I never even want to go on any trips.</span> <span id="s1491">And we had another good friend in Washington, D.C., who was George’s friend, our friend, he just died.</span> <span id="s1492">And had cancer.</span> <span id="s1493">I mean, it’s just, about four people from our life, who were kind of close to us, they all died within one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: I wanted to know about, after you moved to Louisville, did you have any contact with other Holocaust survivors who were living here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I had a Hungarian friend, who was pretty neurotic and she was supposedly in Auschwitz maybe for a month and then she was taken away.</span> <span id="s1496">We didn’t really talk too much about it, but I didn’t have really close contacts with people.</span> <span id="s1497">Then I had another Jewish friend, she died too, in the meantime, who survived the Nazism in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1498">Hiding.</span> <span id="s1499">And that’s a different way of doing it there, you know, that like the Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s1500">So we once in a while talked about it, but we did not talk about this like all the time.</span> <span id="s1501">And I don’t know how the other people, who now I see them once a year, when we have this… either at the movie theater or at the Jewish Community… every year it is somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1502">Where they have the Shoah, July, no not in July.</span> <span id="s1503">They usually have it here, somehow in May.</span> <span id="s1504">We had ours just not too long ago.</span> <span id="s1505">And in Hungary they have one, always, exactly the time when the ghetto was evacuated and taken away.</span> <span id="s1506">Then in the cemetery they have a big… and I’ve never been there at that time.</span> <span id="s1507">And then people come from Budapest, people who lived in Hungary before, I mean in Eger before, who had relatives.</span> <span id="s1508">They would come to this.</span> <span id="s1509">But, no I really don’t have any contact with any of the other Holocaust survivors here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: And is that occasion of going to the annual Yom ha Shoah event…</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Well, yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: …it’s much easier for you to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: …yes, to me, yes it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: …to see the other people…</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: No, not that, it’s for me, that’s one way for me to remember my parents and my family.</span> <span id="s1516">That’s one way, like some people light candles.</span> <span id="s1517">Some people can go to a grave.</span> <span id="s1518">In fact, when Andy died, they cremated his body and it came back.</span> <span id="s1519">And there was a question, how and where?</span> <span id="s1520">There is a beautiful cemetery here, it’s Cave Hill Cemetery.</span> <span id="s1521">And I didn’t know that Jewish people can be buried there.</span> <span id="s1522">But it’s a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s1523">In Spring it is beautiful, in Fall it’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s1524">There is a lake, a lot of sculptures all over.</span> <span id="s1525">And it’s just that people come and visit without visiting any graves.</span> <span id="s1526">And I’ve heard that Temple Shalom has a lot.</span> <span id="s1527">When I heard that, I figured, well Jews must be… and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there.</span> <span id="s1528">And we decided we’re going to do that.</span> <span id="s1529">And Rabbi Miles… Robert by then wasn’t home, but my daughter, Elizabeth was here.</span> <span id="s1530">And we went out to the cemetery and we did a private funeral for him with Rabbi Miles.</span> <span id="s1531">Then at that time he didn’t have a marker yet, but then several months later, not several months, maybe a couple of months later, I got a call from them.</span> <span id="s1532">By the way, the girl who is in charge of that cemetery, has been working there for twenty-five years and she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1533">She knew Rabbi Miles very much.</span> <span id="s1534">She was very, very nice and helpful.</span> <span id="s1535">And we ordered a marker and that’s there.</span> <span id="s1536">Now, in fact, when Robert was home at Fourth of July weekend, we went out there, and he looked at it.</span> <span id="s1537">And I’m sure… my daughter is coming tomorrow for just ten days and we will go out and I took a picture of that marker.</span> <span id="s1538">It says, Andrew Allen Klein, above it “Andy” and the date that he was born and the day that he died and there is a little menorah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: That makes me think of a question which may seem a little odd.</span> <span id="s1540">But you don’t have a grave to visit for your parents or for most of the members of your family.</span> <span id="s1541">Does that make it important to you to have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: That’s why I wanted Andy to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And what about for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Oh, well, if you’re really interested in that, Sandy used to be the type of guy who would say, I want my ashes in the parks and in the river.</span> <span id="s1545">When this happened, we never talked to Andy about what he wants.</span> <span id="s1546">We never thought that he’s going to die before.</span> <span id="s1547">The girl, I forgot her name now, at the cemetery says… she wasn’t pressuring anybody, but she says, “Many times people don’t think about it now, but later on suddenly they think they would like to be maybe near a dear one from the family.</span> <span id="s1548">And then there is no place for it.”</span> <span id="s1549">And she just thought she’d mention.</span> <span id="s1550">I kept on thinking and thinking.</span> <span id="s1551">And Sandy’s sister was here at the time from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1552">And I said to her, “You know I really would…” I thought about it a lot.</span> <span id="s1553">When we die, Linda and will the family just throw our ashes… I thought about this, but I never made a big deal about it.</span> <span id="s1554">So I said to Sandy one day, “You know, I wouldn’t mind to get two lots next to Andy’s.”</span> <span id="s1555">And he didn’t object to it and we did that.</span> <span id="s1556">So we have him and then two empty lots, which we paid for.</span> <span id="s1557">And we, of course, would like to be cremated.</span> <span id="s1558">I mean a long time ago, I decided.</span> <span id="s1559">So now I feel good, that at least I know what our kids need to do with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Do you think that is a special comfort to you because…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: …your parents, you don’t have places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: And I thought, see, we went out on Andy’s birthday for example.</span> <span id="s1564">I mean I’m not the type, who would going out every week.</span> <span id="s1565">But it gives me a comfort to know that he is here and he’s close to us.</span> <span id="s1566">And now that we decided to do this, and in fact Robert was kind of, almost funny… “Let’s all get a place.”</span> <span id="s1567">And I said, “I don’t know,” but we do, and if they do that… I mean Sandy will be eighty years old next year.</span> <span id="s1568">Eventually we will die.</span> <span id="s1569">I mean, we’re in fairly good health.</span> <span id="s1570">At least it makes me feel good, first of all that we belong to a Temple, secondly that if our kids want to visit our graves, since we cannot.</span> <span id="s1571">I don’t know where my brothers are.</span> <span id="s1572">I don’t know where his parents are.</span> <span id="s1573">It does make me, give me a comfort.</span> <span id="s1574">And I’m not sure why, but it does.</span> <span id="s1575">And I’m glad that he agreed on this, because I thought he’s going to give me a hard time.</span> <span id="s1576">And then the kids, what are they going to do with us?</span> <span id="s1577">Throw our ashes all over the place?</span> <span id="s1578">And I don’t know where my brothers are.</span> <span id="s1579">I don’t, I mean I know where my parents are, but we can’t visit them ever, and so, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Did you ever, have you ever visited Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: No.</span> <span id="s1582">I never visited Auschwitz, but I did visit Dachau, one time when we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s1583">He wanted to go and I went with him.</span> <span id="s1584">We took the train.</span> <span id="s1585">There were a bunch of people on the train, young students.</span> <span id="s1586">And it did come up that I was there.</span> <span id="s1587">And they asked me questions, but it somehow, again… I didn’t cry there.</span> <span id="s1588">It just was so manicured and it looked so different.</span> <span id="s1589">And we were in Austria, last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in that group.</span> <span id="s1590">But they had planned to go to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1591">And we did that.</span> <span id="s1592">And I saw there the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1593">Well of… it’s hard for me to explain it.</span> <span id="s1594">It’s almost like that’s not me.</span> <span id="s1595">You know, it’s almost like I couldn’t have been there.</span> <span id="s1596">I mean I know I was, but I just, that’s the way, maybe, it’s easier for me to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1597">I just can’t imagine how anybody can go through it and then be here to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1598">And I’m not the only one, a lot of people who… and it was, you know, the barracks, I peeked into some of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1599">But, you know, I mean, it was so much worse than when I was there.</span> <span id="s1600">I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing now, which is a museum, it’s just, it’s hard to imagine that people really were there.</span> <span id="s1601">But that was at the Dachau camp, where I went in.</span> <span id="s1602">Some people, German people were sitting next to the entrance, in their houses with flowers and all.</span> <span id="s1603">And I would walk by them and they looked maybe old.</span> <span id="s1604">And I used to think at that time, I wonder what they knew.</span> <span id="s1605">How much they knew?</span> <span id="s1606">Did they know what’s going on in that camp?</span> <span id="s1607">Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even now.</span> <span id="s1608">And Sandy gets very… if he runs into somebody who’s old and maybe it would be a German, then he would never trust them.</span> <span id="s1609">He would think he might have been a Nazi or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1610">So, you never can get that out of your system.</span> <span id="s1611">But slowly we are getting older and not that many people… and that’s why I talk to many schools about this.</span> <span id="s1612">And that’s why I’m doing this, too.</span> <span id="s1613">That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened really, after we die.</span> <span id="s1614">Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly.</span> <span id="s1615">I’m seventy-seven years old and young people were killed.</span> <span id="s1616">I’m not saying in Theresienstadt or some of those places, because families were together.</span> <span id="s1617">And a young person might live to be 90, and still… but in Auschwitz there were no kids, not one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Did you ever have the desire to visit Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: No.</span> <span id="s1620">I… we went to see Schindler’s List and I saw it a couple times.</span> <span id="s1621">And then from the Temple, people went.</span> <span id="s1622">And somebody interviewed us, but there were some young people in the group and one girl said that she visited… I think her grandparents might have been survivors.</span> <span id="s1623">And she went to visit some concentration camps and she was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1624">And I said, “What did it look like?”</span> <span id="s1625">And she says, “It has a souvenir shop, you can buy all these things.”</span> <span id="s1626">No, I really don’t have the desire to go.</span> <span id="s1627">I see it on movies or on film.</span> <span id="s1628">And it must look so different, you know?</span> <span id="s1629">I remember the railroad tracks as we arrived.</span> <span id="s1630">I remember that incident where Mengele was turning you, sending you to the right or the left.</span> <span id="s1631">I remember the barracks at the time, but now it’s probably, looks completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: So when you want to, when you’re remembering your parents and you want to visit them, and you don’t have that.</span> <span id="s1633">What do you…is there a place that you go?</span> <span id="s1634">Or is there something that you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: I can’t accept… around the time, you know, when they took us away.</span> <span id="s1636">No, well there is no place, you know, really that I could.</span> <span id="s1637">That’s the reason that I didn’t want that to happen to my children.</span> <span id="s1638">That they wouldn’t have a place to go.</span> <span id="s1639">I think about them.</span> <span id="s1640">See, we were taken away June twelfth or so, and I think about it a lot, but I do not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1641">You know, many, many times.</span> <span id="s1642">It’s just like with after Andy died.</span> <span id="s1643">They did that beautiful music, and I have a tape of it, see, because we put it on tape.</span> <span id="s1644">And I go down to my basement and I turn on that cassette when nobody is there.</span> <span id="s1645">And I re-hear it, and you know, then if I want to shed tears or cry over it, I do.</span> <span id="s1646">But I don’t… I’m never the type who does that very much in public.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Did there come…</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Maybe that’s good, maybe it’s bad.</span> <span id="s1649">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Did there come a point when you felt that you had to talk about your experiences, your memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Well it came after, many years later.</span> <span id="s1652">The very first time, I think I talked about it, that we were going to Cincinnati, to an art gallery, and Mary K. was with me and another friend.</span> <span id="s1653">It was a two hour ride and somehow it came up and then I told them.</span> <span id="s1654">When I used to walk with neighbors and friends and they have known me forever.</span> <span id="s1655">So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe 45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it.</span> <span id="s1656">So, I said, “I’ll be glad to,” and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and then they wanted to know the rest of it.</span> <span id="s1657">So, by now it doesn’t give me any problems to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1658">When some of the schools ask me, I did.</span> <span id="s1659">I couldn’t begin to tell you now how many times I did speak in schools.</span> <span id="s1660">Once at the Catherine Spalding College, once at St. Andrews Church and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course.</span> <span id="s1661">And they might have a Jewish student there or not.</span> <span id="s1662">And now, I’m completely at ease with myself and I can talk about it.</span> <span id="s1663">Once in a while I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: And I’m glad that I can, because Sandy’s sister, the one who is coming from Argentina now, she completely held it back all the time.</span> <span id="s1666">So much that if the subject comes up, she just completely bursts out crying.</span> <span id="s1667">She couldn’t talk to her kids about it… they know… or to her grandchildren about it.</span> <span id="s1668">And her granddaughter said, “Why don’t you make a tape of it,” because she was with me one year.</span> <span id="s1669">Sylvia, she’s now about twenty some years old.</span> <span id="s1670">She told her grandmother, “Why don’t you make a tape of it?</span> <span id="s1671">Maybe it would be easier for you.”</span> <span id="s1672">And everybody tells this to everybody, but it’s not easy to do.</span> <span id="s1673">I would have never just done it, if Mary K. wouldn’t have insisted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Was it important to you, personally to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: I, I, it’s nice.</span> <span id="s1676">Like, for example, I have a neighbor two houses down, who is from Vienna and who left Vienna, they took all of her things away.</span> <span id="s1677">And she ended up in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1678">I said, “Why don’t you tell your story?”</span> <span id="s1679">She can not.</span> <span id="s1680">And all alone, unless somebody asks you, it’s very hard to do that.</span> <span id="s1681">But I’m glad.</span> <span id="s1682">I am glad that I did it.</span> <span id="s1683">And I’m glad that there is a record of it, maybe for the future generation.</span> <span id="s1684">I mean, I don’t care whether I would have it or not, but… so, I think it’s… and that’s why they make such a big deal about that now.</span> <span id="s1685">Of course, a lot of people go back with transports to Auschwitz, and so I don’t have any desire to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: How do you, how do you feel about living in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: I like Louisville.</span> <span id="s1688">I do like it and I don’t.</span> <span id="s1689">Wouldn’t like to live any other place.</span> <span id="s1690">I’ve not been in too many places in the United States, but Louisville is a nice town.</span> <span id="s1691">And we made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s1692">Now that we’re getting older we don’t see them as much anymore.</span> <span id="s1693">And luckily one daughter lives here and the two grandchildren, you know.</span> <span id="s1694">I have in fact, a little one will have a birthday tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1695">He’ll be seven years old.</span> <span id="s1696">And I’m invited to go to a cave for the birthday party.</span> <span id="s1697">But I like it here.</span> <span id="s1698">I mean I am satisfied and I wouldn’t want to live any other place anymore… End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: …Democrats, okay?</span> <span id="s1700">Now if when we were younger and we would get together and like let’s see, during some of the presidential elections, we would all get together and everybody was for that same person.</span> <span id="s1701">We used to think everybody, like long, long time ago, Stevenson was running and we all liked him.</span> <span id="s1702">Then he didn’t make it and we were so surprised.</span> <span id="s1703">So we don’t have any, non-liberal friends, but you run into a lot of people like that.</span> <span id="s1704">And that doesn’t mean that we are not friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1705">But as we get older we don’t really… I used to have parties and now when my kids come home, we get together.</span> <span id="s1706">I’ll be pretty busy, so I’m glad you came today.</span> <span id="s1707">Cause from tomorrow on, I’ll be kind of busy with my daughter and her 13-year-old is coming from Seattle.</span> <span id="s1708">And they usually… my kids here come over.</span> <span id="s1709">And I was just now in Nashville with Robert, so… excuse me, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: You keep pretty busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Yeah, I keep busy, and I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: When you first moved to Louisville, how did you integrate into the community here?</span> <span id="s1713">How did you make friends?</span> <span id="s1714">And was it with the Jewish community only?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Well for a while, no, not really.</span> <span id="s1716">We lived in the South end and we didn’t, some people through his work would come and look us up and so on.</span> <span id="s1717">When we moved to this house, then we met more and more people and they would invite us.</span> <span id="s1718">But we’re not the type that we congregate only that they have to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1719">As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person, I would never want to have anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s1720">But that’s not the kind of friends we ever would have.</span> <span id="s1721">And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I mean it’s not a problem anymore.</span> <span id="s1722">And our kids, too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends and Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1723">Now, my son, Robert, in Nashville, he married a Catholic girl.</span> <span id="s1724">Now, he is the least.</span> <span id="s1725">He’s the one who came with me to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1726">And he said that he learned more about Andy during that three hour memorial service than he ever knew, because he was just a little boy.</span> <span id="s1727">And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to college and then he moved to Cal… so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me.</span> <span id="s1728">And it made a very big impression on him.</span> <span id="s1729">We got through music or through the universities or through work, that we made friends, you know, but it….</span> <span id="s1730">and some of them are Jewish, some of them are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1731">So it’s… we have some very, very good friends, who we still get together sometimes, have dinner out.</span> <span id="s1732">He’s almost ninety years old.</span> <span id="s1733">And on their second marriage and they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1734">So, it’s not a matter that it has to be Jewish or not, but it has to be the same type of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: I’m going to say something about… I have a question that I have to explain a little bit first.</span> <span id="s1736">I think and my assumption would be that most people living in Kentucky don’t really realize that there’s a group of Holocaust survivors who live in this state.</span> <span id="s1737">And most of the Holocaust survivors who live in the state, live in Louisville.</span> <span id="s1738">And I’m wondering if you’ve had a chance or an opportunity to travel outside of Louisville or to talk to people who have been kind of surprised, who know that you’re a survivor… like for example, if you speak to school groups, have you had experiences where you’ve found people, where you’ve spoken to people outside of the Louisville area, who maybe wouldn’t have expected that even a Holocaust survivor lives in the state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Well, there’s some schools that I’ve been speaking to, the teachers have been very, they’re mostly non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1740">A lot of them maybe half black, you know.</span> <span id="s1741">And they prepare the kids, most of them.</span> <span id="s1742">They had Holocaust pictures on the wall.</span> <span id="s1743">They were studying it before they asked me.</span> <span id="s1744">So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s1745">And I did it once at Highland Junior High School.</span> <span id="s1746">There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank you note about it.</span> <span id="s1747">And I have all that.</span> <span id="s1748">I have a box this full of all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1749">They, one black kid, for example, said, “Can I touch you?”</span> <span id="s1750">I said, “Yes you can.”</span> <span id="s1751">And he said, “At least if somebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at least I can say yes it did.</span> <span id="s1752">Because I touched somebody who was part of it.”</span> <span id="s1753">So, it made me feel good that they were thinking about that.</span> <span id="s1754">And they hear once in a while stories where people don’t want to believe.</span> <span id="s1755">And that’s the only reason I’m doing it, because it would very much bother me.</span> <span id="s1756">And then, you know, I was very affected by this Yugoslavia problems, too, with this Kosovo deal.</span> <span id="s1757">Because it was so similar to what we have gone through.</span> <span id="s1758">And there were… there again, and I don’t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the Democrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and going in.</span> <span id="s1759">I had very mixed feelings toward the end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe innocent people were killed.</span> <span id="s1760">That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if anybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it.</span> <span id="s1761">They would have bombed, let’s see, the railroad tracks, when the train was going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1762">Not necessarily mine, but hundreds and hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s1763">It could have maybe stopped something.</span> <span id="s1764">And nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s1765">And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1766">Although it’s a very complicated situation and it’s never going to be peace in that part of the world.</span> <span id="s1767">And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset—now that surprised me—over the bombing.</span> <span id="s1768">And she was not, she didn’t feel like I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: The bombing of Kosovo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Kosovo.</span> <span id="s1771">And she said, because she was from that part of the country, and she said something that, those problems go back to eighteen whatever and there will be never peace.</span> <span id="s1772">And Albanians and so on and so forth… that this is not going to help and the bombing just causes more, you know, destruction and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1773">And I was surprised by her saying that, because maybe there will be never peace, but at least it showed something to the world.</span> <span id="s1774">That’s the way I feel.</span> <span id="s1775">That something like that has to be stopped.</span> <span id="s1776">Whether they completely can stop it, you know, one doesn’t know.</span> <span id="s1777">But I… it bothered me, the bombing.</span> <span id="s1778">It bothered me, but then every time I watched the news where people were happy that they were being helped, it made me feel good.</span> <span id="s1779">Because just some food given to them or the shelter or the whatever, what would we have given if somebody would have rescued us during the year.</span> <span id="s1780">And what would those other people have done, who were there for three years, if that could have been stopped?</span> <span id="s1781">That’s the way I feel, whether that satisfies you or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: I also wanted to ask you, after you arrived here in the United States, did you want to have children?</span> <span id="s1785">Was that a goal of yours?</span> <span id="s1786">Or did you have any other goals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: My husband (laughing) wrote me the long letter, when he invited me to come.</span> <span id="s1788">And since he loves music so much, he even said that he would like to have six children.</span> <span id="s1789">Like he wanted like a quintet or whatever.</span> <span id="s1790">And after four, I think, we decided that’s plenty.</span> <span id="s1791">But yes, I was, you know, kind of, not in a depressed mood, that I went always, you know I had certain kind of a fate, will be the way it is.</span> <span id="s1792">Like I believe more in fate.</span> <span id="s1793">Like in Auschwitz, I never tried to, this would better or that would be better.</span> <span id="s1794">Whatever has to happen, would happen to me.</span> <span id="s1795">Yes, children we wanted to, but I’m not going to tell you that we exactly had it when we planned it.</span> <span id="s1796">Because then it would have taken a long time for us.</span> <span id="s1797">Because he didn’t have much money.</span> <span id="s1798">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1799">When do you feel now you are ready to have children?</span> <span id="s1800">That you really can afford it?</span> <span id="s1801">So, I’m glad just exactly the way it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: It seems to me that you’ve been overall just very accepting in your life of the circumstances…</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: …and not had a tendency to try to make something…</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1806">I really am and I think that’s what helped me through, if that’s a possibility, plus luck.</span> <span id="s1807">I mean you can feel this way and get sick or they can shoot you and then you can have a hard attitude, but if that didn’t happen to you, then maybe that’s the reason.</span> <span id="s1808">And why I was like that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1809">But from whatever I told you, maybe that’s the conclusion you come to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Do you have anything else that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: No, except you poor soul, you’re probably starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: I’m okay, I had breakfast.</span> <span id="s1813">(Laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: But that’s just what happened.</span> <span id="s1815">I can give you some cheese.</span> <span id="s1816">I can give you a sandwich before you leave.</span> <span id="s1817">And I’ll be happy to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1819">Thank you and this concludes our interview with Ann Klein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Conclusion of Interview Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in Israel and changed her name to Ilana Fried.</span></p>
