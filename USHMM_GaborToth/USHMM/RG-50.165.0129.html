translation...then asks her to speak English...and WH comments on how ‘beautifully’ she has kept her documents in a folder.</span> <span id="s5">(tape difficult to hear)...in 1949 you came here...on a visitor’s visa...you lived on 97th Street...you were born August 18th, 1924...during the war, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I the camps.</span> <span id="s7">.</span> <span id="s8">four years I was in camps...in Theresienstadt in 1941...</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I have one brother who is one and a half year older than me and he came here...in 1939.</span> <span id="s11">It’s a little bit mixed up.</span> <span id="s12">Let me tell you from the beginning, and it will be easier for you.</span> <span id="s13">I got born in 1924 in Berlin, Germany, and we moved to Leipzig and I was six years old and I went to school over there, my father had a very high position over there.</span> <span id="s14">He was the Director of the (name inaudible) Printing firm...a publishing house...he was the first Director over there and in 1933, immediately, of March, they found, when Hitler came...they want to hang him.</span> <span id="s15">He was very much insulted about this behavior of the Germans, and he still says that this is not the Germans, these are only the Nazis.</span> <span id="s16">And (laughs) then he couldn’t believe, but we went immediately to Czechoslovakia...I had a little brother...but he had a defect.</span> <span id="s17">He couldn’t walk straight...he didn’t make it...and I got very much involved in the Zionist Organization...but I was too young to go Aliyah...so I stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s18">I wanted to go to England with the children’s transport...but my parents didn’t agree, so I signed on my own, without permission, and I had to go on the 3rd of September, 1939...and the war broke out the 1st of September.</span> <span id="s19">So, everything gets, very, uh, - .</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: You couldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: ...my parents didn’t want to send me alone...and my brother went...and today, probably that I am alive, I’m glad that I didn’t do it, or didn’t come out, that I could go to England, or otherwise probably, I would eat my conscience all my life that I left them against their wish.</span> <span id="s22">And, I never would know what happens to them.</span> <span id="s23">What happened, we went in December, 1941 we went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s24">It was my little brother, my mother, father and me.</span> <span id="s25">And my grandmother came later.</span> <span id="s26">And I spent over there, almost three years...and worked, and was very often, very sick, and it is just unbelievable that I lost everything, (inaudible) A lot of operations...and I was never sick in my life before.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did your family survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, nobody survived.</span> <span id="s29">My father died in Theresienstadt (inaudible) and my mother came to the transport to Auschwitz...in May, 1944 and I went as a volunteer with her, I wanted to go with her, I didn’t want to leave her alone with my little brother.</span> <span id="s30">With the little brother and my mother came only three days later, but I met her and I could probably help her a little bit, even though I was again, very, very sick over in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s31">Always high fever, and what came from everywhere, But I had a lot of good friends who helped me overcome this and I have overcome all the selections from Dr. Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: You think that you owe much of your survival to your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s34">They are not living any more.</span> <span id="s35">They don’t live any more.</span> <span id="s36">They just had the opportunity to give a potato or something.</span> <span id="s37">(inaudible) It helps very much.</span> <span id="s38">And the medical men for the awful disease...(they helped me to not) come through the selections and the medical men helped me, and they had to pay the doctor for getting some medical (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did you find that most of the people in the camps helped each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: They had no opportunity.</span> <span id="s41">They had no opportunity.</span> <span id="s42">I, from the beginning, still have my friends, and after I came out...I had a very, very good friend, and we were always together.</span> <span id="s43">(inaudible) Hannah Greenfield, we were three (inaudible), the other girl lives in San Francisco today.</span> <span id="s44">And I only called her now, when I was in Los Angeles, I called her after 40 years.</span> <span id="s45">She’s quite happy, but our different life, after the war, she lives a very quiet life, and has no children and no desire for anything else, just to make a good living over there.</span> <span id="s46">Very modest, and probably, we have now in connection, but I am a little bit afraid that I have nothing to tell her.</span> <span id="s47">Nothing is of interest to her, what’s going on here and we are very much involved in Israel, with everything what’s going around.</span> <span id="s48">That’s not only my personal life, ‘cause it’s still for my children and grandchildren, and I’m worried’.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: ...right after the war ended, at Theresienstadt, where were you?</span> <span id="s50">You were in a D.P. camp, afterwards, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: We survived in Bergen-Belsen, and Bergen-Belsen after people left, it was a D.P. camp (for people) who couldn’t go home, they stayed in the camp and waited to go or to Palestine or to somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So, what happened to you then?</span> <span id="s53">Were you planning to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: The trouble was, that at that time I had the opportunity to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s55">Even my brother from here, who was in the British army, the Jewish Brigade, and he came to visit me and he said that he can take me to Palestine now, like his wife, we had the same name.</span> <span id="s56">We were in Belgium and the rabbi would give us the certificate that he can come back with his wife.</span> <span id="s57">But, first of all, I was already, I dreamed I was for many, many weeks (inaudible...) and I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s58">Always, I had the feeling I had to go home.</span> <span id="s59">Almost four years, and I didn’t realize that I had no home.</span> <span id="s60">Actually, I knew I have no home.</span> <span id="s61">I left my mother in Auschwitz with the little boy, and I knew what will happen to them, I know, my father died, and actually I knew I had no home.</span> <span id="s62">Anyhow, I wanted so much to go home to Prague.</span> <span id="s63">And when I woke up, I saw that I want (inaudible) to bring me to Sweden, and (inaudible...) and I couldn’t walk yet, and I didn’t want to go over there.</span> <span id="s64">(inaudible) Life was very difficult after for me.</span> <span id="s65">And now comes even the point, why I immigrated to America if it is of interest to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: It is of great interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: In Bergen-Belsen, in this camp, it was 3 months after the liberation, everyone could go home, wherever he wants to go, so there were signs to Poland, to Czechoslovakia, to Germany, wherever they wanted to go, we had to stand in line.</span> <span id="s68">And to tell where you got born.</span> <span id="s69">I had no citizenship, because the Germans took the citizenship from the German Jews...I was stateless...so when I stand in line to go back to Prague, they ask me where I got born.</span> <span id="s70">I said, ‘In Berlin,’ and then I..</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">said I was ‘German, but I am stateless now.’</span> <span id="s73">So they told me that they don’t take me back.</span> <span id="s74">I can’t go over there, to stay in Germany, because I am German.</span> <span id="s75">I said, ‘Well, I don’t stay for 5 minutes longer in Germany than I have to.</span> <span id="s76">I am so – I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not staying here.’</span> <span id="s77">I just wouldn’t stay over there.</span> <span id="s78">I had not the strength to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s79">It was for me, to go to Palestine, to go to Palestine, to go in the kibbutz, to work very hard, to look for water, I mean that was the idea (inaudible) and I had no strength and I had only the feeling that I wanted to be alone.</span> <span id="s80">Want to be alone, not again with the communal living.</span> <span id="s81">And a lot of girls around, and quarreling, and telling, I wanted only to be alone.</span> <span id="s82">It was my desire.</span> <span id="s83">Very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Could you have come to Israel and not worked on a kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, I didn’t know this.</span> <span id="s86">You see, my idea was always, that I come here and all the girls together, we were together and that was – I couldn’t understand that I could live like a normal person here.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: You brother, did he go back to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yah, sure.</span> <span id="s89">He lives here.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you think that maybe he wouldn’t be able to take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No...and I even didn’t think so much that I have to work for my own living.</span> <span id="s92">I didn’t think so.</span> <span id="s93">I was just, sick and tired of all the – lot of people, (inaudible) and I thought that I go home...but the trouble started to go home, and they didn’t want to take me.</span> <span id="s94">And the next day, I thought to myself...’Who know who I am?’</span> <span id="s95">No one knows who I am.</span> <span id="s96">So, I went again, and stepped in line, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s97">I told the girl I got born in Prague, and that I’m Czech.</span> <span id="s98">Finished...I told (this story) to the editor of Yad Vashem, (name inaudible)...and she says, she was the scriber, and she were writing, it was her handwriting, and she was writing it in Bergen-Belsen, and she told me, ‘You know, you think that they didn’t recognize you?’</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: That you were not Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s101">That I’m not the same who was the day before.</span> <span id="s102">And she said that...the British high officer said, ‘Look at this young German, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s103">She is here again.’</span> <span id="s104">And they made like they wouldn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s105">And I came back, the trouble started when I came back to Prague...the Germans recognized me...from the passport...they make a judgement against me and I get at least two years in prison...for making a false statement...I was already crying...and I wanted to talk to someone, and there was a young lawyer, and woman, and I ask if I can talk to her alone...so I told her the truth, that I lived for so many years in Prague and I want to come back here, I have all my friends, I were together with the Czech girls, and I have nothing to look for in Germany.</span> <span id="s106">So she told me, ‘You know, I can’t help you.</span> <span id="s107">I can help you only to leave the papers on my desk, and you have to try to go over the border somewhere.</span> <span id="s108">And I keep it here on my desk.’</span> <span id="s109">And that’s why I ask for an affidavit.</span> <span id="s110">I could get it very easy.</span> <span id="s111">The affidavit from my cousin and the visa very quickly, and the quota from the Germans for America was very big...and I got it in 6 weeks...</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you leave from Bremerhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No.</span> <span id="s114">I had more problems...so I went from Sweden.</span> <span id="s115">(?</span> <span id="s116">Guetenberg?)</span> <span id="s117">The S.S. Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s118">That’s why I left, actually, for America...(but) I didn’t want to leave, for I was in love already with my husband now.</span> <span id="s119">And he was very, very sick with T.B. and he was really very, very, - I had only, Sweden once I was in a sanitorium and I had nothing very serious...but he was really, very, very sick and the very, - at the beginning, was no hopes, that he was for 6 years in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Everywhere...they took him in 1939...as a political prisoner...and he got four years, to sit alone...and then they found out he’s Jewish...and they said, after the war he would serve his four years, so he had 2 and a half years, and then three and a half years in ?</span> <span id="s122">Bunamonowiecz?</span> <span id="s123">and he came to Bergen-Belsen and we came together back.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: That’s where you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yeh...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Did you leave with him for America?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: No.</span> <span id="s128">My husband was sick.</span> <span id="s129">He stayed in the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s130">I had to leave him.</span> <span id="s131">I couldn’t get married.</span> <span id="s132">I had no papers, and I had to leave him and I was very sorry, but I had no other chance.</span> <span id="s133">So when I came to America, first I started to work very hard to make a lot of money...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: You arrived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I was very excited when we arrived in New York in the evening, and we came only in the morning to the port, so we stayed all night outside the pier, and it was extremely exciting for me.</span> <span id="s138">For the, all the big lights, and the highways, you see it, and Europe was very poor.</span> <span id="s139">I left it very poor.</span> <span id="s140">I wanted to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s141">I was very angry about Europe.</span> <span id="s142">I couldn’t...forgive to the, to all (inaudible).</span> <span id="s143">There were good Czechs, there were good things, but I had not the feeling that I can live over there.</span> <span id="s144">I wanted to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s145">But I wanted to live with my husband together somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: You came in 1947.</span> <span id="s147">In March...who greeted you at the pier?</span> <span id="s148">HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, I came on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So no one was there when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No...I didn’t take anything from any Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s152">My cousin sent me the ticket.</span> <span id="s153">And then friends of him waited for me on the pier.</span> <span id="s154">I didn’t know them before.</span> <span id="s155">And, until today they are my best friends...and we just went to America, he died, so I went to her to visit her, in the States, after 40 years now I went to visit her.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You mean you hadn’t been to America for 40 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span> <span id="s158">Never.</span> <span id="s159">I have no money.</span> <span id="s160">And no desire.</span> <span id="s161">I was so busy here.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You came to America, and where did you live when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: These friends who expected me.</span> <span id="s164">I went to live in that place.</span> <span id="s165">I was not very happy about it.</span> <span id="s166">I had an uncle over there, and I have this cousin, who was very sick which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s167">And, actually, I didn’t want from anybody, anything.</span> <span id="s168">I’m very proud...but I lived for the first three months in that place...in Washington Heights...570 Fort Washington Avenue...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Did you read the Auf Bau?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span> <span id="s171">I didn’t read the German paper...I read the ‘P.M.’...they forced me to read, but my head was quite on a different - .</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: where was your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: My head was in Czechoslovakia...(inaudible).</span> <span id="s174">In the beginning, I suffered from the light nature of the American.</span> <span id="s175">Everything was only on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Superficial.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: They had – superficial.</span> <span id="s178">All my friends were refugees...they came from Vienna, from Prague, from Belzig, from everywhere, but I had no friend who got born in America.</span> <span id="s179">It was in some way, I had the feeling that I can’t talk, they are not listening, and they were not listening.</span> <span id="s180">I mean, not that I were talking about the camp so much.</span> <span id="s181">Absolutely not!</span> <span id="s182">I knew that no one will likes to hear something, but they were so interfering, they were so busy with themselves.</span> <span id="s183">Even the people I worked and so.</span> <span id="s184">The music were different.</span> <span id="s185">I mean, everything was different.</span> <span id="s186">And, I don’t say that I’m right, for today I see it quite different.</span> <span id="s187">I see it’s very happy if people can be happy with such a easy going, not going very deep in everything.</span> <span id="s188">It’s very good.</span> <span id="s189">It’s much better.</span> <span id="s190">But at the time I was very deep, and very – very sad.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, I can’t explain it.</span> <span id="s192">If you would read what I wrote in German, in my (inaudible) it was, - it came out from me, for myself, but not for others.</span> <span id="s193">Anyhow, I was very glad in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Glad?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I mean, glad I came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Even with all these problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s198">That is different.</span> <span id="s199">I got the flat in Manhattan from my cousin who had to leave.</span> <span id="s200">And, I lived on my own.</span> <span id="s201">I started working on the third day when I arrived in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Then I went with the Sunday Times and looked for ‘Filing Clerk,’ or for something, and I was very happy that the cheapest department store in New York, ‘Klein’s’ – 14th Street, they took me for picking up the dresses, I think.</span> <span id="s204">(inaudible) and I was very happy that they took me, but I was quite unhappy after the first week.</span> <span id="s205">For, I couldn’t stand so much on my feet, and my back were hurting, and the people were so coming and going and so unpersonal, and I didn’t understand even their language, and when I had twenty minutes to have a rest, I didn’t understand all the automates, and I had no one to ask.</span> <span id="s206">For all the girls who was over there with 16 years, they, - I got quite depressed, that I saw some very, very good looking refugees working over there, and I said, from so many years, I have nothing else to do, just to push the dresses, and so...I was very depressed from this work, and I went to the Personnel Officer again, and told her, a very nice woman...’ You have something where I can sit a little bit?</span> <span id="s207">I’m just not able to stand so much and the Manager doesn’t leave me even to stand up.’</span> <span id="s208">So she told me if I know how to sew, and I said, ‘Yes.’</span> <span id="s209">So I went down to the basement and for another week, I stayed over there, almost suffocating from all the old dressed I had to repair...and again I went to the Personnel Officer, ‘Do you have something else for me?</span> <span id="s210">I can probably do something.’</span> <span id="s211">And she told me, ‘You know you are so nice and I will, in this Department store, there were no job for you from me, but I will ask my friend.’</span> <span id="s212">...and there was an International stamp exhibition and I went there and I met a lot of people from Czechoslovakia who knew my father very well...he collected stamps...and I said, ‘Don’t talk so much.</span> <span id="s213">I am looking for a job.’</span> <span id="s214">So, immediately I got a very good job for the first time, for three weeks for someone who went on vacation...and I told the Personnel Manager at Klein’s, and she told me that she has a job for me in a fur store in Fifth Avenue, her friend want to take me already for $35 a week, five days.</span> <span id="s215">And so I told her, ‘Thank you very, very much Lily, for all efforts, but I found a job.’</span> <span id="s216">...so I started to work in America with stamps...I couldn’t go in the rush hour, it was depressing for me, again, so I worked different hours...I worked very, very many hours.</span> <span id="s217">It was downtown, next to Wall Street...there were all stamp dealers on one street...and then I took work home, and so it came out that I worked another couple of hours and made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s218">I’d go beyond $100 a week.</span> <span id="s219">And I needed for myself, not even $5.</span> <span id="s220">I didn’t bought for myself anything.</span> <span id="s221">I went only to eat in Chock full of Nuts for a soup...and I was always invited to these friends, who they never let me, any weekend to be alone.</span> <span id="s222">Not any holiday, Jewish holiday...they kept me like their child.</span> <span id="s223">I only found out now that they are only ten years older than me.</span> <span id="s224">But at that time, I had the feeling they were like my parents...so I had a dream, I want to bring my husband over, and so on.</span> <span id="s225">When my husband came here with the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s226">No one ask him whether he sick.</span> <span id="s227">Actually, he’s an invalid on his legs.</span> <span id="s228">They would never have allowed him to come in to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: He had T.B.?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: He had T.B. and it’s not only the T.B.</span> <span id="s231">He had a very special T.B. and he’s until today, not breathing (right).</span> <span id="s232">The Americans never would let him come to immigrate to America.</span> <span id="s233">But I had illusions, and I thought if he goes to Cuba, so I can afterwards to – I had already a job in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s234">Everything I arranged, he should come.</span> <span id="s235">But the Czech didn’t give him the visa...the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did he go to Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No.</span> <span id="s238">I almost lost everything what I paid over there...the deposit, the lawyer, and everything...when the Czech didn’t give him the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">SIDE ONE.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">SIDE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: ...you decided to go to Israel after being in America in order to join your husband-to-be.</span> <span id="s242">You were not married then, but when you heard he went to Israel, you decided - .</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I decided that if I go to Israel, I never go back if we understand each other after two years.</span> <span id="s244">I wasn’t (?</span> <span id="s245">sure) that I will stay alive if I don’t get married with him.</span> <span id="s246">Not that I could get married in America, everyone thought that I’m crazy...(inaudible) I had a very good professional position.</span> <span id="s247">I was already useful worker...I worked only with stamps, my English was poor and I didn’t want to make any other work, but I understood something from stamps...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you have people in America who wanted to go out with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s250">But I almost didn’t go out because I was afraid for myself.</span> <span id="s251">(laughs)...I was very young you see, and – so, I even didn’t want to come in the temptation for myself, that I put myself in.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Your husband is from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No, my husband is from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s254">He lived in Prague but got born in a little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did he have a Zionist background?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Absolute not.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: He only came to Israel because he couldn’t get into America?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">But we wanted to meet somewhere.</span> <span id="s260">If you want to hear, I even sent him a visa to Ecuador...Yes, I could buy it for $300 a visa to Ecuador and the French gave him a transit visa.</span> <span id="s261">Everything for money.</span> <span id="s262">Everything for money...Sweden wanted $1,200 for a transit visa and a ticket to Cuba which was $600.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Why bother with Ecuador if you could go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: No.</span> <span id="s265">It was not a question.</span> <span id="s266">To Israel, was only the first year.</span> <span id="s267">There were no ideas still from Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: It was ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: But once Israel became an independent country, and then the war broke out, did you then stop the idea of going to Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s272">Now, I had – I didn’t even wanted to go to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s273">Or to stay over there.</span> <span id="s274">I wanted a little piece in this world where I can meet him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And then you would decide what to do permanently.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: And even after one year, you see, after that I wanted to go back like a visitor...(inaudible) but in ’48 the Russian came to Czechoslovakia and then it was too dangerous for me to go back and spend all my money.</span> <span id="s277">I mean a lot of money what I saved so hard.</span> <span id="s278">So I thought it would be much better to use this money and to try much stronger to bring him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: What year did he get out of Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: In the first of January in ’49 and I came in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: ...so you took the Marine Carp to Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes...the trip was very, very good.</span> <span id="s283">I was not sick at all...I can’t explain this to no one, and no one can explain.</span> <span id="s284">And there were a lot of young people, young American people.</span> <span id="s285">I got friends with a lot of American young people who came to Israel and almost, everyone was much deeper from these American, because they were Jewish and if they decided already to come to Israel, so they had an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So you were a Zionist and an idealist, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And you came to America.</span> <span id="s289">Did you feel that America did not give you enough of a feeling of security or identity as a Jew?</span> <span id="s290">Was that your feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No, absolute not.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: In other words, if wasn’t for the fact that your husband had been in Israel, you probably would not have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: That I don’t know, but later on, probably not after two years.</span> <span id="s294">I was very strong in my feelings that’s like a Jew.</span> <span id="s295">I want to live here.</span> <span id="s296">But I had not the physical and mentally, strength at that time to leave everything in America in ’49 and to start again to decide, and to start again a new life.</span> <span id="s297">After I had already a new life.</span> <span id="s298">I had a flat, and I had very jobs, I had good friends already, and I enjoyed – I mean, most what I enjoyed in America was the freedom, what I never had.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: So, in other words, it was really your husband who was the major force in coming here.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: ...if he would come to America.</span> <span id="s301">I’m not sure whether I would not come again here to Israel.</span> <span id="s302">But, at that time, it was still war here in Israel.</span> <span id="s303">And, it was still, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s304">And again, all the rations and so on.</span> <span id="s305">Everything what I forgot already, and left behind me.</span> <span id="s306">And it left a bad taste, you know?</span> <span id="s307">To decide to go again, means a lot of strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you ever meet anyone here in Israel, who came from Europe and then, did like you did, came to Israel in ’48 and ’49...came from Europe to America, and from America to Israel but in the early years, who decided that they wanted a more Jewish life or whatever their reason was.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Personally, I don’t know...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: ...you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: One daughter...two grandchildren...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did she say to you, ‘What would it have been like to live in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">AS: Yes, she sometimes said what would happen, it would be probably better if you would (laughs) stay in America.</span> <span id="s314">But, I’m telling the truth.</span> <span id="s315">I arrived here, it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s316">I mean, there are so many details, and it was very hard.</span> <span id="s317">And, I never considered for one moment, that it was not the right step I made.</span> <span id="s318">When I came here, I felt here is my home.</span> <span id="s319">I mean, I really, I came, we rented a room and the people were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s320">(In (inaudible) next to Haifa).</span> <span id="s321">And people here, really helped everyone, to each other, and we met a lot of neighbors and friends and – I mean, probably I am a lucky person.</span> <span id="s322">I must point out that wherever, and wherever I was, and even in the camp, I always met, if it was the worse time for me, I met persons who helped me.</span> <span id="s323">That’s true.</span> <span id="s324">That didn’t start in America.</span> <span id="s325">It didn’t start when I came here.</span> <span id="s326">We lived together in this house for 30 years.</span> <span id="s327">With, like an adopted mother.</span> <span id="s328">Her children stayed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s329">And we met and we lived here together like one family.</span> <span id="s330">She is now in an older’s home, and in a very good condition, and everything is okay, but we lived 30 years like a real family together.</span> <span id="s331">And, it was very good for me that I have someone, like a mother who can talk everything, and you have feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you feel that the people here were nicer than the people in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes...I feel absolute at home here.</span> <span id="s334">Here I can choose who I want, you see, and we have very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s335">And, I’m now talking about the first days when I arrived, I had the feelings that I’m here at home.</span> <span id="s336">And, if you want to know, I decided immediately, that I’m not going back.</span> <span id="s337">And, I wrote a nice letter to the State Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: What did you say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I thanked them for the hospitality that I had in America, that I enjoyed very much...and I’m not coming back, not that I don’t like America, (inaudible) I feel that it’s my home here.</span> <span id="s340">.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: How soon after you came here did you write that letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: In ’49...March or April...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: You didn’t speak Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I didn’t speak Hebrew...no one spoke Hebrew at that time.</span> <span id="s345">I learned Yiddish, not to talk, but to understand at least...at that time everyone was a refugee.</span> <span id="s346">I mean, I had not to feel – my Hebrew is very poor today, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: But in America, also the community was made up of refugees...and so you had a small community there, but you still didn’t feel at home there.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: You know, the difference is, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s349">It’s very hard to tell.</span> <span id="s350">If you have something to give, you feel much better.</span> <span id="s351">If you always taking, I was quite poor in America.</span> <span id="s352">And, everyone liked me very much and I got used to that I’m invited.</span> <span id="s353">I never could invite anyone to me, I had only one room, and, a one room flat, and no one would even – they were all in much better positions.</span> <span id="s354">And I felt very good with them, But I always had the feelings that I’m the taker, and not the giver.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Well, wouldn’t the idea that you want to be proud, and independent, make it more likely that you would like a country that was proud and independent.</span> <span id="s356">In other words, your personal approach to life was, ‘I don’t want to have help from Jewish organizations.’</span> <span id="s357">You said it before.</span> <span id="s358">And ‘don’t want individuals to do me favors all the time.’</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I didn’t need.</span> <span id="s360">If I would need, I probably would take.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: But you have here, when you don’t need.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes, exactly when I came here to Israel, there was (?</span> <span id="s363">needs translation) they wanted to give us a lot of things without any money.</span> <span id="s364">A bed, I don’t know what else.</span> <span id="s365">I didn’t take it, for I didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s366">I mean, I had what I needed, and I was very lucky afterwards that I always could say that I never took anything, and I was never in the – here in these camps, people were waiting for flats.</span> <span id="s367">Which were too, much easier.</span> <span id="s368">But I said, ‘I’m not living for one day in a camp, if I have not.’</span> <span id="s369">So we took a room, I worked, my husband worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: ...your husband is retired...what kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: When he arrived in Israel, he started like a welder, even with his lungs.</span> <span id="s372">For that was only what he learned in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s373">He was the best worker (inaudible)...he worked like a (inaudible) for the Army.</span> <span id="s374">And we moved to Jerusalem in ’56 when they started building the Hadassah building here, in ’56 and he was responsible for the construction...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: How do you feel about the relationship between Germany and Israel now?</span> <span id="s376">That Germany helped Israel and all those years?</span> <span id="s377">Does that make you uncomfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: You know, it made me very, very uncomfortable, but I knew it has to be, otherwise we wouldn’t - .</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s380">When you think of Germans now, though, today’s generation, do you in any way relate it to the previous generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I have no (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: No real strong feeling about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t say that all the Germans - .</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Are prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Are prejudice.</span> <span id="s387">I have no prejudices (inaudible).</span> <span id="s388">There are working Germans here, even in the Hadassah, and no one even invited them, and I felt guilty.</span> <span id="s389">And it’s very funny that we, who made the linoleum you know, that they worked here, and no one ever wanted to – I felt like an Israeli, a little bit guilty if he’s working here.</span> <span id="s390">One was a young man, and very intelligent.</span> <span id="s391">So, it’s very funny that he, too, were 6, 10 years almost in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s392">We invited him for dinner.</span> <span id="s393">You see, it’s not that I can say (inaudible).</span> <span id="s394">My personal feeling is much stronger aversion than everyone else has.</span> <span id="s395">I can’t listen to the German, even in the television.</span> <span id="s396">And I was twice in Germany, after the war.</span> <span id="s397">Once was for my money.</span> <span id="s398">My husband was in such a very bad condition, my husband was in the hospital again here.</span> <span id="s399">(inaudible) And the insurance didn’t pay for it.</span> <span id="s400">He came with this sickness to the country, so they’re not paying.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And the second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: The second time I had to – I went to, I had an uncle over there.</span> <span id="s403">He was Director of the hospital and he was the leader of one of the prominent Professor, (inaudible) Herbert Levine.</span> <span id="s404">And he asked me to come to England...(inaudible – to see) in a prison, they have someone, and they think it is Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s405">And I saw him so often that I stand before him, probably I could recognize him.</span> <span id="s406">And I wanted to arrange something from Israel for myself, so I said, ‘Okay, I’m coming.’</span> <span id="s407">But I had sleepless nights, and I always thought, ‘How can I recognize someone I hardly saw?’</span> <span id="s408">And after that, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s409">I was afraid for myself.</span> <span id="s410">I thought that – before I see him, I could say that I can’t decide anything...in me, it’s always, I’m full with hate.</span> <span id="s411">I’m not talking about that I’m not complaining, let’s say for, I take life from today.</span> <span id="s412">But, everything in me is inside...(inaudible) and for Eichmann there had to be a witness over there, but I didn’t go either.</span> <span id="s413">They have other people, so I’m not – I don’t – I can’t talk.</span> <span id="s414">And, (inaudible) they had enough people, so - .</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did you speak to your daughter about what you went through when she was growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes, yes...I talked to her...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What brought you to Jerusalem...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: That we came to Haifa...my brother lived in Haifa.</span> <span id="s419">Then, my husband worked very hard, as I told you and got, - I was very worried about it, and looked for a better job.</span> <span id="s420">A job he had not to work physically so hard.</span> <span id="s421">So they offered him this job here in the Hadassah...we got it for three years, but I said I never will live with suitcases.</span> <span id="s422">I move and then I move again, but I am packing out.</span> <span id="s423">So we moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: ...do you think that America can be relied on as a friend of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: ...I’ll tell you, it’s very, - depends who is (inaudible) if they interested political, so they are interested, otherwise, they would sell us as everyone, now selling us, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: What about the Arabs...what possible solution can there be to this problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: The solution, to find a solution is a little bit late.</span> <span id="s428">I was a fighter for actually giving back everything immediately.</span> <span id="s429">Like Moishe Dayan.</span> <span id="s430">For, I knew in advance, that we can’t live with another 2 million Arabs.</span> <span id="s431">Exactly what happens now...(inaudible) I read a lot about it, and I heard all this.</span> <span id="s432">And I know that it’s a different – and I just could, today, you can’t turn back your - .</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Clock....</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: And I am very sorry about the situation to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s435">I don’t like to see people suffering on one side, and on the other side, we have to explain that it’s not our fault that the Arabs are living in the camps, after 40 years, no one is ever asking, ‘Why all the people are still living for 40 years in these camps?</span> <span id="s436">They are refugees.</span> <span id="s437">They kept them.</span> <span id="s438">And no one is asking.</span> <span id="s439">(inaudible) and America is paying for it.</span> <span id="s440">So you still getting the rations, and still living in the camps.</span> <span id="s441">They have no money.</span> <span id="s442">The Arabs have more money than the whole world – they could give them a human living.</span> <span id="s443">They could made it before, and then it wouldn’t come to this stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Do you think Israel should give back these territories?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Today, it’s very, very hard.</span> <span id="s446">I mean, for giving back, I don’t how to make the border.</span> <span id="s447">I agreed with the plan from (inaudible)...and they made it with shekel.</span> <span id="s448">And they had to make it before all the hatreds inside the country.</span> <span id="s449">I mean, today, it’s already – everything burned the Arabs from inside the country...</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you find that the Israeli’s have become more extreme in their views?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s452">(inaudible) very extreme and very aggressive.</span> <span id="s453">I mean, every person, personal even.</span> <span id="s454">I must say.</span> <span id="s455">It is (inaudible) religion got already a party.</span> <span id="s456">I mean, it’s already – not only religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: They mix religion and politics here.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It’s mixed very, very strong.</span> <span id="s459">I mean, if you – I am a very good Jew, (inaudible)...like I worked for one year I was in Germany, in Hamburg working like a prisoner.</span> <span id="s460">They offered me very often, one fall in love with me, I coils leave my Jewishness very easy.</span> <span id="s461">I would never do it, as if I would have to die for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s463">After the War?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No.</span> <span id="s465">During the war.</span> <span id="s466">Yes.</span> <span id="s467">I feel very strong, much stronger a Jew, a proud Jew, like probably all these who are going around and these Orthodox, and all these, this is not Jewishness.</span> <span id="s468">I mean, this is for me, so strange, a goy, a nice goy, is nearer to me than all these super-religious people who are (inaudible).</span> <span id="s469">It is, it is not to hate the Arab, hate the – I don’t know what they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What would you say is the basis for your feelings following Jewish Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I can’t explain.</span> <span id="s472">I feel Jewish very strong.</span> <span id="s473">I mean, I was always very proud that I’m Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I can’t explain it why.</span> <span id="s476">Probably the education that I knew I’m different.</span> <span id="s477">I mean, I had to be more quiet and we made at home, we were not religious at all, but it was Yom Kippur and I’m not eating.</span> <span id="s478">And I went to the Beit Knesset.</span> <span id="s479">And, for I felt, among, even today, I am in Israel, I never was in a synagogue, but if I am outside, and...(inaudible) in Yom Kippur I went to synagogue, of course, for it disturbs me that everything is going like normal.</span> <span id="s480">I feel very strong, even I’m not fussing any more.</span> <span id="s481">I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: When you think of Israel as a country, you think that it’s something that belonged to us 2,000 years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I don’t know if 2,000 years, but I have the feeling that this what we got belongs to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I have the feeling, that even for 2,000 years, where we are sitting now, that we have no right to throw out all the people who are living for a hundred and a hundred of years over there.</span> <span id="s486">I mean, you can’t do, and make and throw them out.</span> <span id="s487">When they are not doing – they are not better than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: But how can we trust them?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: We can’t trust them any more.</span> <span id="s490">We can’t live together any more.</span> <span id="s491">From both sides, so extreme, that there is no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Could we ever have trusted them?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Isn’t there a conflict between what you morally feel should be done, and what is practical?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I think what we will have to make a gentleman agreement with, whatever we can do, with the help of America probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You’re not dealing with gentlemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Not with gentlemen’s, but you have to make a border where you know how to keep.</span> <span id="s498">I mean, to stay, so many soldiers to keep over there and they are all unhappy to do this job...it’s not a job for our soldiers, what they are doing...</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: You went to Los Angeles this year...what did you think of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I went alone (to Los Angeles) my husband stayed in New York...we were there only three days in (Los Angeles?)</span> <span id="s501">...this is an old friend, we were together in the camp, and she...sent me the ticket, and she ask me, she’s 92 years old, I shouldn’t postpone my trip, and to come and see her...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: She was in Theresienstadt with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A:
