in Bodzanow?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: They came to Bodzanow in the middle of World War I, close to the end, maybe.</span> <span id="s24">I think they came in 1917.</span> <span id="s25">The little town of Bodzanow.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Where were they from originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father was in a town not far from Warsaw called, Radzamin(?)</span> <span id="s28">.</span> <span id="s29">The mother came from a different town, also not far away, its called Volka(?)</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And when did they marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: They married 1885.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: You were the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s34">I remember I was told my parents had fourteen children.</span> <span id="s35">I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s36">I remember only, unfortunately, only seven.</span> <span id="s37">The others passed away in between as I could remember.</span> <span id="s38">One of them, matter of fact, passed away in the town, Bodzanow but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s39">I remember the name my parents mentioned it.</span> <span id="s40">But I don’t remember the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: When they moved to Bodzanow, they had a bakery and I remember the bakery, I remember very vaguely there was a fire once in the bakery and the authorities had stopped, they couldn’t bake anymore all baked goods, bread and everything else, but they were permitted only for Shabbos to bake the challa, what we call, bread for challa for Shabbos and also we were permitted to bake the matzos for Pesach.</span> <span id="s43">And this practically they made a living at the time, then during later years they rented a fruit garden in the villages, they went out when they barely started to bloom and later on around June, July we moved out there to keep an eye on the fruit, they shouldn’t steal it, which it happened.</span> <span id="s44">Some kid came around, some grownups came around and they stole some fruit, so we had to be there to watch it.</span> <span id="s45">Then we could stay there ‘till end of August, beginning of September ‘till all the fruit was ready, we took it home.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Do you remember what kind of fruit?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Apples, pears, plums.</span> <span id="s48">In the beginning was cherries.</span> <span id="s49">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What was your favorite fruit?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: My favorite thing was to climb trees to--</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: To shake the trees?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Not shake.</span> <span id="s54">We couldn’t shake them, because if we shook the trees it fell down and it got spoiled.</span> <span id="s55">We had to take them off very gently.</span> <span id="s56">Cherries was nice.</span> <span id="s57">In the beginning we used to make a double we put them up on the ears like earrings.</span> <span id="s58">It was a good experience.</span> <span id="s59">It was an experience on the way you had to watch to make a living.</span> <span id="s60">When they come in some kids came in to do mischief to steal or to shake the trees I used to hide myself, was a little narrow places where I could hide, and when the kids came in I ran out, I caught some of them.</span> <span id="s61">They were like, what do you call it, the grass what sticks, poison ivy.</span> <span id="s62">I used to, if I grab somebody, I used to, of you’ll excuse my expression, I used to pull down his pants and put him in the poison ivy.</span> <span id="s63">An this was the last time he came in to steal the fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What kind of house did you grow up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: The house.</span> <span id="s66">We didn’t have the convenience what we have here in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s67">Not whatsoever.</span> <span id="s68">I don’t even remember having any toys to play with.</span> <span id="s69">But somehow we grew up.</span> <span id="s70">Taking the more value of life we always had to be on guard because the anti-Semites in Poland was very great.</span> <span id="s71">When I used to go to school we always had to fight.</span> <span id="s72">I had to fight because I never run away from a fight.</span> <span id="s73">We used to go in the street, two, three boys, and were approaching us a couple of Polacks, Polish boys, so the one who came across in the sides where they were coming, they always went on the other side, the side that I should always face them with my elbow to the Polacks.</span> <span id="s74">When they passed by, when I stick out my elbow, they felt it.</span> <span id="s75">So I was always like a fighter.</span> <span id="s76">I was a little boy in the family, but I never ran away from a fight.</span> <span id="s77">Many times it happens later on, it was around ’37 or ’38 when I was in Warsaw working, we’ll come later to it, so I was sitting with another boy in a park, a couple of boys approached us and start a fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: For no reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: For no reason.</span> <span id="s80">The reason was, we were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How did they know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: They find out later.</span> <span id="s83">Because they find out that we didn’t run away, we paid them back.</span> <span id="s84">Even home we had a friend what they had like a candy store and the boy was around the same age as me, a year younger than me, but we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s85">Whenever, I’m going one thing to another, in the pockets I always had a piece of rubber from a tire, the rim from a tire inside I always had 15 or 20 inch rubber in the pocket.</span> <span id="s86">The pocket was open, but it was in the bottom of the lining.</span> <span id="s87">Just on every eventuality what happen.</span> <span id="s88">So I was going once one evening in that luncheonette candy store and a couple of boys approached me and I knocked on the window and the other one came out and both of us beat him up and I walked in the store in the back room.</span> <span id="s89">A little while later the parents came in, a whole bunch of them, and they want to drag me out.</span> <span id="s90">I hold onto the door, they tore out the door and I didn’t gave in.</span> <span id="s91">Something happened, police came in, somebody called police, and I was safe at the time.</span> <span id="s92">We were always fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Now the house that you lived in, was it a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: It was an apartment.</span> <span id="s95">It was a house which it was there one floor, there was three apartments.</span> <span id="s96">Four different neighbors lived there.</span> <span id="s97">We had one room.</span> <span id="s98">And that time was the parents, two rooms we had, the parents, myself, and a sister at the time when I grew up.</span> <span id="s99">The older brother had been in Warsaw where he worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you have electricity:</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No.</span> <span id="s102">We didn’t have no electricity.</span> <span id="s103">We had kerosene lamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Were the streets paved?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: The streets weren’t paved, but they were the cobblestones.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What was the language spoken in your household?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: The language spoken in my household was Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: In what languages could you and your parents speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And the language in the school was…</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And how would you describe the religious life in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Religious life as we know now here was strict orthodox religious life.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Would you say that your parents were strict in other ways as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Strict in every way possible, every way.</span> <span id="s116">They were respected by everyone in the little town.</span> <span id="s117">Very respected and from that respect what I saw the people gave to my parents I was giving to the other people.</span> <span id="s118">Whenever Iv saw an elderly person was the greatest pleasure of me to see the person and being able to do something for him, like to help him cross the street or even later on here in the States, in Philadelphia, wherever I could help to another person, an elderly person, it was a pleasure.</span> <span id="s119">Because I remember the respect what they gave my parents, this was a time to give to others.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Now, what did you want to be when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: There wasn’t, in that town, wasn’t much to choose from.</span> <span id="s122">Either a shoemaker, or a tailor.</span> <span id="s123">There was a carpenter too.</span> <span id="s124">So, I choose the tailor.</span> <span id="s125">But before I came to be a tailor, I was about 12 or13 years old or so, I don’t remember, I went to a Yeshiva for around two years to another town, Tutusk where a brother of mine lived and an uncle, cousins, and those days I was fortunate to have a cousin.</span> <span id="s126">My brother lived in a suburb from the town, and a cousin lived in Tutusk, very comfortable living they had, and I stood with them during the week and for the weekend I went to my brother.</span> <span id="s127">I was there for close to two years, then later on I came home and I went to work as an apprentice tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: There wasn’t any chance of you becoming a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No, I couldn’t foresee it because I had to do some work to help my parents the upkeep in the house where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: You started to work as a tailor to help make ends meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes, I didn’t make too much money for a year and a half I didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s132">Later on, after a year and a half they didn’t have apprentices.</span> <span id="s133">How I learned the trade is a different story, because when I got there to work there were three brothers working at the same place.</span> <span id="s134">Then one somehow left and I worked there with the two others and one was a good mechanic and they didn’t want to show me anything.</span> <span id="s135">But I have to admit myself, I was quick with mine eyes.</span> <span id="s136">Whatever I learned from looking on to see how things were being done.</span> <span id="s137">The boss lady one time showed me how to sew in pockets to a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s138">Otherwise everything what I knew what I learned at the time, I learned from looking.</span> <span id="s139">This they couldn’t stop m.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So they were afraid of you as a future competitor?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Possible, possible</span></p> <p><span id="s142">.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: How old were you 13, 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I was about 13 or 14 years old.</span> <span id="s145">But things what happened yesterday or the day before most likely you forgot.</span> <span id="s146">But things what happened around sixty years ago like what happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s147">There was an incident which it happened when I was working.</span> <span id="s148">I was getting that time, five lopes(?)</span> <span id="s149">equivalent to five dollars a week, and I was sitting at the machine working to the left was the table where we used to press, to iron the work.</span> <span id="s150">Around the corner from the table was the other room where the boss used to cut the stuff and at that time the boss lady was standing at the table, she was ironing an apron for herself.</span> <span id="s151">The boss said, he said to his wife, her name was Marsha, similar to Moishe, he said, Marsha give me the scissors.</span> <span id="s152">And the scissors were laying on the table just to stretch out the hand and around the corner to the other room.</span> <span id="s153">So she said to me, Moishele, take in the scissors to my husband, to______.</span> <span id="s154">So I said the scissors are right around the corner, just stretch out the hand and she expressed herself to me not nice.</span> <span id="s155">Like, I don’t know how to call it, like not nice, which I felt it was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You felt insulted.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Insulted.</span> <span id="s158">So after she said that so I said if this is the case, if you could insult me like this, I took my coat and I was going out.</span> <span id="s159">There was another man working at the time, he said, Moishele, they used to call me Moishele, which a lot of people call me to this day.</span> <span id="s160">He said, don’t be so hard, don’t run away, she didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s161">I said, oh, no, if this is the case, she could insult me like this, so I went home.</span> <span id="s162">I went home.</span> <span id="s163">So my mother, may she rest in peace, said, you shouldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s164">You know how mothers always softie.</span> <span id="s165">My father, may he rest in peace, he said, well you did it, you did it.</span> <span id="s166">So I went over to a brother of mine which had a grocery store next house down.</span> <span id="s167">I was there, a little while later the boss lady comes in.</span> <span id="s168">It wasn’t far, they didn’t have no trolley car, it was walking distance.</span> <span id="s169">The whole town you could walk through it in five minutes.</span> <span id="s170">So, she said, I didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s171">I said oh, no.</span> <span id="s172">She said, you know what, I’ll give you an extra lotte(?)</span> <span id="s173">a week, like a dollar a week, but my husband shouldn’t know and come back to work.</span> <span id="s174">So this persuaded me and I went back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Inadvertently you were a good negotiator.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, I was always trying to stay on my feet.</span> <span id="s177">I figured out what’s right and what’ wrong.</span> <span id="s178">I learned that in my house, from my parents, to observe what’s right and what’s wrong.</span> <span id="s179">To do most of the time the right things, and I figured I thought it was wrong for her to insult me like this and I hope she’ll forgive me.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Were you taught anything useful at school when you went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Unfortunately, I went only three grades because I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s182">I remember when I was working here in Philadelphia in a place which they had a bookkeeper and they laid off the bookkeeper and the boss lady took over the bookkeeping and she was an attorney but she was a lousy bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s183">When I got the week wages, the way I figure, I didn’t have the full amount that was coming to me.</span> <span id="s184">Not because she wanted to take it off, to cheat me, but a couple minutes here and a couple minutes there she didn’t figure.</span> <span id="s185">So I told the boss, he said, go see my wife.</span> <span id="s186">So I went to see her and I told her, this I know, one and two is three.</span> <span id="s187">You figure it I said I don’t know and the way I see it, it’s not enough money.</span> <span id="s188">Well, she said, I said, unfortunately I didn’t went to a schooling like you, I just had three grade school, but somehow the figures I couldn’t figure out.</span> <span id="s189">She said, for not going through school, you’re doing all right.</span> <span id="s190">She admit she was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Now earlier you mentioned you had some trouble with anti-Semitism in your hometown in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s192">What was it like dealing it, was it a problem at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: It was a problem in school when I was very young.</span> <span id="s194">We had to fight back.</span> <span id="s195">For no reason at all they were trying to antagonize us and do whatever they could.</span> <span id="s196">And we insisted not to let ourselves be knocked down.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Do you have any theory as to why they were like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Not too many, not too many to rely on.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: How about business relationships?</span> <span id="s200">Your father rented orchards nearby were these from….</span> <span id="s201">?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: From Polacks, yes.</span> <span id="s203">This doesn’t mean that all the Polacks were bad.</span> <span id="s204">But there were a lot of them which they were very very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did you or anybody in your family give any thought to emigrating, leaving Poland.</span> <span id="s206">I know one of your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah, one of my sisters left Poland in 1929.</span> <span id="s208">In 1939 there was the exhibition in the United States, in New York, my sister that time was trying to bring us over to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: This was your older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: One of my older sisters, Briandel(?)</span> <span id="s211">.</span> <span id="s212">She got married in 1925 and her husband left for America and in ’29 she came over to the United States and in 1939 she was trying to bring us over, but somehow, in the bureaucracy, or whatever it was, she couldn’t make it and that’s how we remained in Poland.</span> <span id="s213">My sister, the one who was supposed to come over with me in ’39, vanished during the war and that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So you were hoping to go to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: At that time, yeah.</span> <span id="s216">But then during the war it was a different style.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: An older sister had gone to Warsaw years before, this was Bayla?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes, Bayla lived in Warsaw, but another sister, the one Hendel, was supposed to come over with me in ’39, she lived in Warsaw too, up to the war.</span> <span id="s219">She was with my sister because she was only two years older from me.</span> <span id="s220">She was still single and she was working in Warsaw as a tailor too.</span> <span id="s221">And I too, I went to work in Warsaw in 1936.</span> <span id="s222">I went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s223">I had a brother there, a tailor, he was doing subcontracting, tailoring, and I went to him for a while, then I went to work for somebody else and I worked until 1939, ‘till three days before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s224">There was a call, that time, for the mobilization of the people who were accepted for the army.</span> <span id="s225">I was accepted in 1939, it was May or June, I remember when I stood to the Board and I was accepted to the army but was never taken.</span> <span id="s226">But then when they were talking about the mobilization, so I said if I have to go to the army at least I’ll go from my hometown and be with the parents to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s227">So it took me a day or so to come from Warsaw to my hometown, Bodzanow, because the roads were blocked by the army, the military around, but they never called us.</span> <span id="s228">Many times we tried to go to the army to enlist and they didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s229">So that’s how I remained in Bodzanow.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So you were in Bodzanow when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: When the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What do you remember of when the Germans first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Right after the war broke out before the Germans came in yet to our hometown, we were trying to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s234">We heard they are not far from us, the Germans , and the expectations what we heard wasn’t good so we were trying to run away from the hometown.</span> <span id="s235">Twice we were running, once we were going to Warsaw, naturally, with one road through__________, which we couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s236">Next day we went to ___________, we wanted to go the other direction.</span> <span id="s237">We couldn’t make it because it was cut off already, so I remained in Bodzanow and a couple days late the Germans came in and they took over the city, the town.</span> <span id="s238">Certain things which are blacked out.</span> <span id="s239">They came in trucks, passed by towns, which we saw and then they took over the place, matter of fact they made a tailor shop next to my brother’s grocery.</span> <span id="s240">He had to move out from the grocery and they made there a tailor shop.</span> <span id="s241">The grocery my brother took out from the store everything what we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: But he had to give up his grocery.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: He had to give up his grocery business and time was getting tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Meanwhile some members of his family were still in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s246">Then when it was quieted down a little bit I was going twice, took in some food to Warsaw to my sister and brother.</span> <span id="s247">I took a horse and buggy with a Polish driver and we went to Warsaw and gave it away the food what we had there to my sister and brother and some friends and then a while later, a week or two weeks later, I did it again.</span> <span id="s248">I couldn’t come back already with the horse and buggy, I took like a ferryboat from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s249">The fruit we took over to Warsaw and coming back I went with a ferryboat and we passed by a town the Germans boarded the boat and they took us off.</span> <span id="s250">We came to a border like, we landed and they took us off from the boat and whatever they found, a pair Tfillin, it was used for morning prayer, and the Germans found it and said whose is it and naturally everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s251">So one young man went over and said it’s mine.</span> <span id="s252">Whether it was his or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s253">He gave it to him and didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s254">So they antagonized something then finally they let us go back home.</span> <span id="s255">The ferryboat didn’t go to my hometown, it was to the next town___________, from there is was about 70 kilometers, so I took a walk back to my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Empty handed?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Empty handed.</span> <span id="s258">But I came in one piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Two of your older brothers, if I’m not mistaken, were in the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: They weren’t serving in the Polish army during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: During the war,

me up on a bench and gave me the whipping.</span> <span id="s295">Taught me a lesson not to run away.</span> <span id="s296">During the wintertime we were taken to work to clean the snow from the roads.</span> <span id="s297">Many times there were ditches on the roads on the side roads.</span> <span id="s298">Some people fell in, we had a hard time to get them out.</span> <span id="s299">And

helped.</span> <span id="s371">They went out of their way to help.</span> <span id="s372">But, unfortunately the majority were against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What did you make when you

what they send out the people what they lived in Germany, they sent them back to Poland from the __________.</span> <span id="s389">So they told us what was going on.</span> <span id="s390">Of course we didn’t want to believe it yet.</span> <span id="s391">We said the same thing, how could it be?</span> <span id="s392">But unfortunately, it didn’t took us too long to realize whatever they told us wasn’t ( end of side 1)….</span> <span id="s393">.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SIDE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: We were talking about the German occupation and they weren’t a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: No, we weren’t surprised.</span> <span id="s397">We were surprised how one human being can do to another human being without any reason.</span></p> <p><span

deported, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So what happened the beginning of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: The beginning 1941 there were times which people used to say like the next day is going to be the evacuation from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s406">My father, may he rest in peace, always used to say, why try to guess for the worst, or speak up for the worst, why do we have to guess it?</span> <span id="s407">So, this also I learned from my father not to think for the worst, not to speed it up, whatever will come, there’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s408">So in the same complex, not like a complex of apartments, it was a big yard, there were apartments here and there.</span> <span id="s409">In one of the apartments they used to come in 2:00 in the morning to the place to Doven.</span> <span id="s410">So, one morning my father came in early back in the morning, it was March the 3rd, he said they’re saying again today is going to be the evacuation.</span> <span id="s411">It was early in the morning.</span> <span id="s412">He got dressed and this was no guess.</span> <span id="s413">They were right.</span> <span id="s414">The Germans were all around with the Polish cohort and to knock on the door to go to the mark place.</span> <span id="s415">The town was, in the middle of the town was a mark place, a square, to meet over there.</span> <span id="s416">We took very little thing that we could in a bag, knapsack, and we were going in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Were you told how much you could take?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, you couldn’t take much.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did anyone have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: No, going to the square was going me, my parents, the sister and the sister-in-law with the two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: The one sister was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s423">So, while we were going from our house out to the street we passed by one street the we came to the next street to the right, on the left was the Synagogue and one side street, at the second street we made the right, one side was standing the buses, the trucks.</span> <span id="s424">In one spot was standing the Germans, four, five of them, I don’t remember, two or three, whatever there was, with sticks and whips.</span> <span id="s425">Whoever passed by, they hit them.</span> <span id="s426">I was trying to avoid, but there wasn’t no way.</span> <span id="s427">I wasn’t so much afraid for myself, but I was afraid for my father.</span> <span id="s428">Anyway, it didn’t help, couldn’t avoid them, and they hit him with the stick and he fell to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: We should probably end right now.</span> <span id="s430">Your father was born when?</span> <span id="s431">He was a very elderly man.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: He was about 82 years old.</span> <span id="s433">White bearded man and they hit him over the head and they hit me over the head, was bleeding.</span> <span id="s434">I wasn’t thinking of myself and like in a daze, I remember there was a man coming behind us, another group of people, one came over and helped me pick up my father.</span> <span id="s435">His name was, it’s worth to remember, Yossel Volinsky.</span> <span id="s436">It’s like, they were living across the street, it’s like in a daze I remember him.</span> <span id="s437">He helped me pick him up and we got him in the Square.</span> <span id="s438">The whole town was there.</span> <span id="s439">There in the Square we stood with the group.</span> <span id="s440">I saw an elderly man was beaten to death in the Square.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Possibly a friend of your father’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes, it was a friend.</span> <span id="s443">They all knew each other.</span> <span id="s444">But, they beat him to death.</span> <span id="s445">Getting in the line so called, so everybody got up on the truck they hit them, wherever they could, they hit them.</span> <span id="s446">And going to the trucks we were separated.</span> <span id="s447">Was me and my mother and my father and the sister-in-law with the children and my mother and the sister got on a different truck.</span> <span id="s448">So this was -- they drove us up from the hometown with whatever we had, everything was left in the house.</span> <span id="s449">Just took a small package, with whatever it was I hardly remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: You still didn’t know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, we didn’t’ know where we’re going.</span> <span id="s452">We drove through a town called, Checkanov.</span> <span id="s453">Over there we stopped, the Germans stopped and people knew from there in the town they knew where we’re going.</span> <span id="s454">They had an idea where we’re going.</span> <span id="s455">So they throw up on the truck some food, bread, Jewish people throwing it.</span> <span id="s456">Then they took us to a place called, Dzaldowo.</span> <span id="s457">Over there was the same story.</span> <span id="s458">When we got to the gate they didn’t let the people get off, they pulled them off, or they hit them and pulled them off.</span> <span id="s459">And somehow there is a moment which everybody for a moment is for himself.</span> <span id="s460">So I saw on the truck ahead of us a young boy like I got to the gate and he jumped off from the side of the truck to avoid their hitting.</span> <span id="s461">When my truck came over, I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s462">Momentarily, while I jumped off I said to myself what am I doing.</span> <span id="s463">I left my father there, so I walked around the truck to the back where they were taking them off, I took him around my hands and I helped them off the truck and they just lightly touched him, and said, go you old dog.</span> <span id="s464">They didn’t hit him.</span> <span id="s465">That’s how we got to that town Dzaldowo, was a camp and over there we also saw brutality.</span> <span id="s466">There was a young man which they hit him, he jumped like crazy, that’s the way they hit him.</span> <span id="s467">A couple people got nearly killed.</span> <span id="s468">This was, we got there, I think on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I think on a Thursday they took us out and they took us to Chestochowa.</span> <span id="s469">Over there we were spread out in the town in different places.</span> <span id="s470">There was a ghetto______________ a big ghetto, later on they made a smaller ghetto.</span> <span id="s471">At that time it was still the big ghetto and they located us, Synagogues, community centers and I was fortunate, my parents were fortunate, because of my father, his personality.</span> <span id="s472">When they took us to that place, the first_________ was the streets in__________ like a street.</span> <span id="s473">Was a Synagogue in the backyard, was a big place, they took us in there and I was bleeded.</span> <span id="s474">From Tuesday I wasn’t cared of.</span> <span id="s475">The blood was dried up so there came in nurses and doctors came in and helped us and another person from there they saw my father also with the blood so they took him to his apartment.</span> <span id="s476">Then in Yaldova we got reunited with my mother and sister and the sister-n-law with the children we got reunited and we got to that place, they took us unto the house, which it was fairly, I mean it was clean.</span> <span id="s477">The day they took us to the Synagogue, they put in straw and junk back and that’s where they were laying one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s478">While they were cleaning up my head wound there was a young girl coming in and helped attend me to clean me up_________.</span> <span id="s479">And, somehow she took an interest in me.</span> <span id="s480">This was in March.</span> <span id="s481">On May the 15th we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: This is someone you had not seen before?</span></p>

brother of hers, his name was Duvid Tannenbaum.</span> <span id="s535">My wife’s name was Rose, maiden name Tannembaum from Krzepice.</span> <span id="s536">And naturally we were driven to work, taken to work and one thing I must say, I was one from the very few, very very few, fortunate people to be together with my wife all the time, since we got married, to work together and for a time wasn’t so nice but unfortunately this was the conditions of life, there were a barrack for couples, married couples, naturally no matter how the conditions were, everyone was trying to keep up self control, self obedience in the cleanliness of the family.</span> <span id="s537">We were given a long, what you call a bunk bed, a long.</span> <span id="s538">We were making separations wherever we could to

id="s544">Then that house, where we were, it was still considered the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s545">.</span> <span id="s546">I had a sister of mine there, she lived a different part of the city, which I didn’t see her anymore, Hendle.</span> <span id="s547">And then we were taken to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: You were still a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No.</span> <span id="s550">I was taken once to air force place.</span> <span id="s551">We did there, whatever we did.</span> <span id="s552">I can’t remember already whatever we did there.</span> <span id="s553">In the kitchen, the backyard, whatever it was, we were gone in the morning coming back at night.</span> <span id="s554">At one time I ran away from the group where they took us to work.</span> <span id="s555">I was hiding, why I did it, I don’t remember even.</span> <span id="s556">I was hiding in a like a ditch or whatever it was and for the day.</span> <span id="s557">Why I did it I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s558">But I couldn’t do anything and then I got back to the work and they went back and somehow snow came.</span> <span id="s559">Then my wife was working in the kitchen there so after awhile, like I said, I was fortunate to be with my wife together, like when it was time when it looked bad, they were trying to take the women out, I went to intervene.</span> <span id="s560">Later on when they were trying to take the men away, take me away, she went to intervene.</span> <span id="s561">At that time when she was working in the kitchen, which it wasn’t too bad, at least we had something to eat, so the foreman like, was a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s562">There were two brothers and the wife had three sisters.</span> <span id="s563">We lived in the ghetto, even before the ghetto, they lived there too.</span> <span id="s564">Back to back.</span> <span id="s565">So they knew us very well.</span> <span id="s566">One of the brothers became the foreman and he want to take away the wife, my wife from the kitchen, take in somebody else.</span> <span id="s567">He must have got something from them.</span> <span id="s568">So I went to him, my wife went to him, begged him, I’m staying here why are you taking me away?</span> <span id="s569">So his wife told my wife how long isn’t enough to be with your husband together?</span> <span id="s570">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s571">That brother gave her hell for it.</span> <span id="s572">How could you give her hell for it, how could you say it?</span> <span id="s573">But, apparently, time is doing is own course.</span> <span id="s574">Later on she got separated from her husband and I was with my wife all the time.</span> <span id="s575">So then everybody was against it so they made a lottery to see who should remain in the kitchen and who not.</span> <span id="s576">So, it so happened, my wife was able to remain in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s577">Then this was going on while we were still in the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s578">Then they liquidated the whole ghetto and they took us into the factory, the ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: It must have been sometime in ’43.</span> <span id="s581">I guess it must have been sometime in ’43 when they liquidated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s582">And so I was working the ammunitions factory like I said, together with my wife.</span> <span id="s583">We were working -- I was taking care on machine which we were controlling, checking the shells for the guns.</span> <span id="s584">To the machines which controlled the shells, whether they were a certain size, everything.</span> <span id="s585">My wife was working at the machine and I was the mechanic on the machine.</span> <span id="s586">And that’s how we spend our times in that factory.</span> <span id="s587">There were times which it looked close to the end.</span> <span id="s588">My wife used to ask me, “Moishe, what’s that?”</span> <span id="s589">But somehow, like I said before, I learned from my father, may he rest in peace, not to speed up and not to try to guess for the worst.</span> <span id="s590">To think positive like.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Take one day at a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Take one day at a time.</span> <span id="s593">Although, it looked bad, somehow but in the back of my mind I hoped, ech, it doesn’t look so bad.</span> <span id="s594">Whether I believed it or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s595">But just to make comfortable my wife she shouldn’t think the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Positive thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Positive thinking.</span> <span id="s598">That’s the way I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you have any idea who was going to win the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I’ll tell you, there are some people which they say, oh when I was in that time I was thinking I’ll do this and I’ll do that.</span> <span id="s601">To me I cannot it didn’t occur to me what would happen.</span> <span id="s602">Back of my mind I believed that maybe, maybe something will happen we’ll get free.</span> <span id="s603">But to make plans, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s604">We didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s605">We didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Had you heard any rumors about other camps, worse camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: We heard rumors that when they had to leave, they liquidate the camps with the people.</span> <span id="s608">This we heard later on, the end of ’44.</span> <span id="s609">So, many times I heard like this, my wife asked what’s that, I said it doesn’t look so bad.</span> <span id="s610">It made her feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s611">There were twice, two moments, she asked me what’s that?</span> <span id="s612">In my wildest imagination I couldn’t see anything good, so I said I don’t know.</span> <span id="s613">She didn’t ask me anymore.</span> <span id="s614">At one time all of a sudden it was at night, they shut off the lights, we were in the factory, we were working the night shift.</span> <span id="s615">It was sometime in ’44, the end of ’44.</span> <span id="s616">What’s that?</span> <span id="s617">I said, I don’t know, I couldn’t find anything, I couldn’t find any excuse.</span> <span id="s618">Naturally, we thought for the worst.</span> <span id="s619">And the second time, which it was the last moment before we were liberated, she said, we were driven out to the gates from the factory with the trains were outside and all of a sudden we were pushed back, the whole mess was like pushed back.</span> <span id="s620">My wife asked me that time, what’s that?</span> <span id="s621">This was when it went through the minds, this is the end.</span> <span id="s622">I said I don’t know and she didn’t ask anymore.</span> <span id="s623">We held on for a couple of minutes, then we could spread.</span> <span id="s624">It got over.</span> <span id="s625">What it was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s626">Some people were taken out t the train a the time and the bulk of us remained.</span> <span id="s627">There were three other camps in Chestochowa, ammunitions factory.</span> <span id="s628">I worked ammunitions factory and the day before we were liberated, the day when we were liberated, to me it seems to be the 15th of January, ’45.</span> <span id="s629">Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that.</span> <span id="s630">The end of ’44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine.</span> <span id="s631">There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those machines.</span> <span id="s632">We had there a German boss which it didn’t bother him.</span> <span id="s633">He said you don’t bother me, I don’t bother you.</span> <span id="s634">I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes.</span> <span id="s635">He was foolish, but it didn’t bother him any, didn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s636">Then they took him away and came in another one.</span> <span id="s637">They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy_________.</span> <span id="s638">He was crazy, foolish.</span> <span id="s639">You couldn’t talk to him anything, couldn’t talk to him, there was no way.</span> <span id="s640">So the boys said let’s try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit.</span> <span id="s641">So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him.</span> <span id="s642">Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, sometimes a shell we would find on the floor, or whatever it was he hit her.</span> <span id="s643">He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too.</span> <span id="s644">And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying.</span> <span id="s645">One time I passed by she said was it night?</span> <span id="s646">She was crying, I said what’s the matter she said I don’t know, everything was going perfect.</span> <span id="s647">He hit me with a screwdriver.</span> <span id="s648">So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you’re trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency.</span> <span id="s649">Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s650">Which it meant if we won’t be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow.</span> <span id="s651">As weak as I was I said no, not enough.</span> <span id="s652">I don’t buy it.</span> <span id="s653">And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn’t taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him.</span> <span id="s654">I said why did you hit my wife for nothing.</span> <span id="s655">If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I’ll be able to take a beating, but don’t hit her.</span> <span id="s656">And he started beating me up.</span> <span id="s657">While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don’t hit my wife.</span> <span id="s658">It’s unbelievable because he didn’t have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place.</span> <span id="s659">But apparently, he didn’t do it and since then he didn’t touch her again.</span> <span id="s660">This was before Christmas time ’44, about three, four weeks before.</span> <span id="s661">Then the 15th of January in the morning, they didn’t took us out from the barracks.</span> <span id="s662">We remained in the barracks.</span> <span id="s663">Like normally, we used to go out to work.</span> <span id="s664">A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before.</span> <span id="s665">At that time it looked, it didn’t look good.</span> <span id="s666">At one time before, like I said I had my sister in Philadelphia, America, home I never used to write the letters to her.</span> <span id="s667">But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5th, Philadelphia, Pa., USA.</span> <span id="s668">At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address.</span> <span id="s669">I used to say it in Polish.</span> <span id="s670">I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this.</span> <span id="s671">When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister’s address.</span> <span id="s672">If we’ll survive there we’re going to meet.</span> <span id="s673">This happened the 15th of January, the 15th.</span> <span id="s674">So in the morning we didn’t go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before.</span> <span id="s675">Later on around 9 o’clock or so, 10 o’clock, we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the line and the bosses came around to take us to work.</span> <span id="s676">We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man.</span> <span id="s677">Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman.</span> <span id="s678">Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in German, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you _________ clothes.</span> <span id="s679">To take in the factory.</span> <span id="s680">Like he knew something, something is going on.</span> <span id="s681">So we went in the factory, our group, and while we were in the factory, I took the coat, whatever my wife had and mine, put in a room wherever we had to do for the machines, and I’m there for a minute or two minutes, a boy comes in and says, Moishe go out take a look where your wife is.</span> <span id="s682">I went out I see her come in from outside.</span> <span id="s683">The boss who had the shift before, so he want to keep his women, he want to keep, and send away the others.</span> <span id="s684">So she went over to him, it was the 15th of January, it was cold, she said I want go take mine coat from my husband and I will be back.</span> <span id="s685">He said go, but come right back.</span> <span id="s686">So naturally I went over to that boss, he knew me, not the one who hit my wife before, but the other one, higher than him, and I told him my wife they’re going to take out, do something.</span> <span id="s687">He said I’m powerless, there’s nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s688">There was, the main engineer from the whole factory there, the ammunitions factory.</span> <span id="s689">So the main engineer from the whole factory, in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look.</span> <span id="s690">Terrible, terrible man.</span> <span id="s691">At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him.</span> <span id="s692">Why, it was plain and simple.</span> <span id="s693">They were trying to take out the people and people were running back.</span> <span id="s694">Nobody wants to go away.</span> <span id="s695">Everybody wants to stay in the place and they were taking them out and they were running back.</span> <span id="s696">So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could.</span> <span id="s697">And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as it may sound, how I did it, I don’t know, but I did something.</span> <span id="s698">I went over to him and I said, engineer, I’m here from the first moment when the place started, now they’re going to send out my wife.</span> <span id="s699">If they’re going to send her out, I’m going to go with.</span> <span id="s700">I scared him off.</span> <span id="s701">So he said, where is the boss?</span> <span id="s702">He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too.</span> <span id="s703">He said do you know her?</span> <span id="s704">.</span> <span id="s705">He said yes.</span> <span id="s706">Is she a good worker, he said yes.</span> <span id="s707">He said remain here.</span> <span id="s708">Another boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained.</span> <span id="s709">How I did it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s710">But it was a rumor just imagination it was, supposedly you’re supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here.</span> <span id="s711">So somehow I did it and that’s how we remained together.</span> <span id="s712">Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s713">So I said if we’ll survive, there is going to be a place where we met.</span> <span id="s714">O.K.</span> <span id="s715">Then we are still in the factory, we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the kitchen to bring in the lunch for the group.</span> <span id="s716">Then we got a lunch and I sat down on the floor near the machine, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big factory.</span> <span id="s717">So I didn’t pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn’t pay attention yet, but then it didn’t took long another few minutes we heard more banging.</span> <span id="s718">So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the machine, I said now I’ll put away the food what I had, let’s pay attention what’s going on.</span> <span id="s719">So after awhile we saw the Germans through the window, we could see that they start running.</span> <span id="s720">Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what’s going on with you don’t you see what’s doing outside already?</span> <span id="s721">Stop the work.</span> <span id="s722">So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the barracks.</span> <span id="s723">There was a factory_________, a munitions factory, a bigger one than ours.</span> <span id="s724">When the Russians came close to that__________ they evacuated the factory and it took about six months till the Russians came in that time.</span> <span id="s725">So they were told, the rumors were going on, the Germans said they were supposed to leave the factory with the people.</span> <span id="s726">The factory should be able to go till the last minute, cause it was a bigger factory than ours.</span> <span id="s727">This apparently what they did.</span> <span id="s728">In our place, in our situation the factory was running until the last minute.</span> <span id="s729">But still we were afraid that they’ll tear off the bounty (?)</span> <span id="s730">place with the people.</span> <span id="s731">This was the thought what it may happen.</span> <span id="s732">This is what they did in some other places.</span> <span id="s733">So we were in the barracks and around it starts to get dark already, one of the Germans came in with a sack of bread giving out bread.</span> <span id="s734">So whoever could reach it got bread.</span> <span id="s735">Then the commander from the camp start to go around and calling the people said to go with him.</span> <span id="s736">He said I was for you like a father, come with me, the Russians are coming, come with me.</span> <span id="s737">And unfortunately, a couple hundred people went up.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: With him?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: With him.</span> <span id="s740">And we remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">TAPE 2, SIDE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Around 10 o’clock, at first we were in the barracks, then we started to move out to go out from the barracks, after that incident at the gate, the push back was like I said before and so we start to spread and we were in the barracks, we were outside, because we heard the shooting and wondered what was going on.</span> <span id="s743">Around 10 o’clock the fire engines, the fire people from the fire engine company they came around and told us now you are free, just watch out from upstairs from the planes.</span> <span id="s744">It was only a wild dream to be able, I don’t know whether I even identify, but subconsciously there was some kind of hope in the back of the conscience that maybe, maybe.</span> <span id="s745">This was the moment what we heard, now you are free just watch out from the top.</span> <span id="s746">So I still had my can with my lunch and it was cold.</span> <span id="s747">So some people did smart things.</span> <span id="s748">They were going around in the German homes and did whatever they could do, take whatever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: These homes were empty?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: The homes were empty, the Germans were out already, they were gone.</span> <span id="s751">All of a sudden they disappear.</span> <span id="s752">Me and my wife, may he rest in peace, another friend just passed away in Israel, we kept ourselves together.</span> <span id="s753">We walked and we walked into an apartment building, Polacks were there.</span> <span id="s754">And at first they hesitated to let us stay there, but we insisted and we did not let ourselves be driven out.</span> <span id="s755">Till the next morning.</span> <span id="s756">Talking about the friend of mine I have to go back a little while to memorialize him, cause he just passed away and we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s757">He too was a tailor and while we were in the camps in the same barracks we used to make caps by hand, little caps be able to wear it.</span> <span id="s758">And my wife, if she could find a potato, she cooked something, so whenever she cooked something, whatever I ate, I fall asleep.</span> <span id="s759">He used to say, go ahead, go to sleep I’ll finish it.</span> <span id="s760">And that’s what we did, we lived very close together.</span> <span id="s761">Next morning, the morning we went out in the street, because the other guy, he was from Chestochowa, so how do we start a life again, we didn’t know because everything was unplanned.</span> <span id="s762">We came into our house, we knocked to the door and I said in Polish, naturally we just came out and we need hot water.</span> <span id="s763">They didn’t let us in, they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s764">I went to another door, knocked on the door and told them the same thing.</span> <span id="s765">See the difference between one person and another one, she said come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Polish.</span> <span id="s768">She said come in and make yourself comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: You probably smelled.</span> <span id="s770">You had lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s772">We made ourselves comfortable.</span> <span id="s773">Matter of fact she went out, she had to go to a funeral she said, stay in the house, do whatever you want it.</span> <span id="s774">And me and that friend and mine went out shopping see what we could do.</span> <span id="s775">We saw a woman was carrying a big batch what she grabbed from the store, shirts.</span> <span id="s776">So everybody grabbed from her, so we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s777">I grabbed a shirt, he grabbed a shirt, then we go see, it was a bakery.</span> <span id="s778">We tied up the two sleeves and put in bread, at least we had already something to eat.</span> <span id="s779">And slowly we started to realize what we had lost during that time.</span> <span id="s780">And we started to do whatever we can to start a life anew again.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Meanwhile you probably didn’t know what happened to the rest of your family, who survived and who didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: We didn’t realize we didn’t know anything that was going on.</span> <span id="s783">I had a cousin of mine in a camp next to us, not far from us, which we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s784">I find out this right after the war, we find out about it.</span> <span id="s785">Like I said we didn’t comprehend what we had lost.</span> <span id="s786">Naturally, we started looking and we’re still looking to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: You had a sister in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: She survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: How did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: It’s one of those miracles, if there is meant to be, no matter what it’s going to be.</span> <span id="s791">She was in a camp called Poniatow.</span> <span id="s792">Unfortunately, very few people survived that camp.</span> <span id="s793">She was there with four children, a son and a daughter in that camp where my sister was in another place of work, the same camp, another two daughters.</span> <span id="s794">That daughter that she was with was doing tailoring.</span> <span id="s795">She was working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s796">One time she found out it’s going to be a selection to take up people.</span> <span id="s797">So being my sister was an elderly woman then, white, grey hair, so she said to her mother, Mom, go hide yourself because there’s going to be a selection they’re going to take up people.</span> <span id="s798">So my sister listened and she hid herself.</span> <span id="s799">Fortunately from that particular group where they were, they didn’t took up anybody.</span> <span id="s800">So, it was good.</span> <span id="s801">A while later she comes back again and says Mom, go hide yourself they’re going to take up people again a selection.</span> <span id="s802">So my sister says, nah, they didn’t take then they’re not going to take now either.</span> <span id="s803">She didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s804">It so happens they took out my sister.</span> <span id="s805">So the two kids went over to Mom and said, Mom, where you’re going, we are going.</span> <span id="s806">Mom started to beg them said, me, all right, it’s me, I’m elderly already, so you’re still young you still have a chance.</span> <span id="s807">They said no, where you go, we go.</span> <span id="s808">The other two kids they couldn’t reach because they were a different place of work.</span> <span id="s809">So what happened, those few people what they took out they sent them to a different camp, the remain bulk of the people they all got wiped out.</span> <span id="s810">That’s how she remained alive with the two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Your sister and the two children survived, the other two?</span></p> <p><span

United States.</span> <span id="s856">This I wrote in the bulletin.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And your wife was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: My wife was with me.</span> <span id="s859">After the war in Poland I start to write from Poland, Chestochowa, to my sister.</span> <span id="s860">At one time in the middle ’45, May or June, a friend of mine heard that he had a brother in Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia, so he was sick.</span> <span id="s861">So both of us took a train to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s862">Just like this, like you go from here to New York, but it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s863">We got on a freight train from__________________ we took a freight train to Prague, Czechoslovakia, we didn’t have no money, we didn’t have no tickets.</span> <span id="s864">Going up on the train was no problem, going off the train they stopped us, we were stopped, tickets?</span> <span id="s865">We have no tickets.</span> <span id="s866">So they took us to the station in Prague, they took us to the Police Station, so called.</span> <span id="s867">Talking to us about tickets, who knows about tickets.</span> <span id="s868">We didn’t even know what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s869">A woman walked in and apparently she saw us taken off at the station.</span> <span id="s870">A woman walked in and she asked what was the problem.</span> <span id="s871">Apparently they told her what was.</span> <span id="s872">She took out money, paid the fine and gave us some money and disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: You didn’t know who she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Never knew who she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Not even whether she was Czechoslovakian/</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Or Jewish, never knew who she was.</span> <span id="s877">She walked away, period.</span> <span id="s878">While I was in Prague, we wanted to go to Theresienstadt so we had money already.</span> <span id="s879">So while I was in Prague I said, let me send a telegram I saw a post office, let me send a telegram to my sister.</span> <span id="s880">So I went over to the post office and asked can I send a telegram.</span> <span id="s881">He said yes.</span> <span id="s882">I wrote down in Polish.</span> <span id="s883">He came back, no good, got to be in English.</span> <span id="s884">So I took the form with me, telegram blanks, and I was going around the streets in the station, do you know English, do you read English?</span> <span id="s885">One said yes, so he wrote me down in English, he just wrote down, script.</span> <span id="s886">I came back, no good, it’s got to be print.</span> <span id="s887">I took a couple blanks with me went to Theresienstadt cause we had to get a train to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s888">Because we had the train already to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s889">While I was in Theresienstadt, we found his brother, so I go around and ask people whether they write English.</span> <span id="s890">So finally I got somebody who said they write English.</span> <span id="s891">I told him it got to be in print, capital letters.</span> <span id="s892">He wrote down the telegram, took four weeks I got an answer from my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And that was the beginning of the chain.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes, the chain reaction.</span> <span id="s895">But one thing she said in the letter she wrote to us.</span> <span id="s896">She said I am sending you out mail, she sent out money and she wrote me and said, one thing I want to tell you if you want to come to America you will have to work for a living.</span> <span id="s897">Another thing she said to stay clean not to get involved in any false dirty business.</span> <span id="s898">And after that letter, you want to come to America you have to work for a living, when she left I was eleven years.</span> <span id="s899">Now I am a married man.</span> <span id="s900">She felt sorry what she wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Treating you like a little kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: No, she said now maybe it’s a different character, maybe I tried to scare them off.</span> <span id="s903">So she wrote a couple letters after, she tried to apologize.</span> <span id="s904">But I took literally the way she meant it.</span> <span id="s905">There is no way to go around with a bucket and a shovel to shovel in the gold.</span> <span id="s906">If you want to make a living you will have to work.</span> <span id="s907">And we kept close all the years till the last moments of her life.</span> <span id="s908">Very close.</span> <span id="s909">Like when I came over here I lived around the corner, the same block but around the corner.</span> <span id="s910">If I had to take the bus in my corner, I went over to the next corner to go in the store, she had a cleaning store, to say good morning and took the bus.</span> <span id="s911">Sometimes it happened I was late and I got the bus right at the corner I couldn’t go in, she came up to the house, the apartment, to see what happened.</span> <span id="s912">That’s how close we were all the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Did she realize what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s915">Yes.</span> <span id="s916">She realized and she got one son, he was 15 when I came over here.</span> <span id="s917">When it came in a telegram from the boat I was coming in here, I sent a telegram to my sister that we are on the way because she sent to us the papers.</span> <span id="s918">And it was on a Sunday when the telegram arrived, the letter carrier brought in the telegram and the boy was 14, 15 years old.</span> <span id="s919">So he gave the letter carrier two dollars.</span> <span id="s920">Because the parents weren’t home.</span> <span id="s921">.</span> <span id="s922">Then when they came home, he said came in a telegram from Moishe.</span> <span id="s923">That’s it, they were happy.</span> <span id="s924">Did you give him something?</span> <span id="s925">He said yes, I gave him two dollars.</span> <span id="s926">They said two dollars!</span> <span id="s927">He said isn’t it worth it?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: And he hadn’t met you yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No.</span> <span id="s930">A funny thing when we arrived.</span> <span id="s931">She sent us the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Eight years late.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Right.</span> <span id="s934">Other people came in from the HIAS, from the JOINT, she paid for everything.</span> <span id="s935">For everything she paid.</span> <span id="s936">The day when we arrived, we came into Ellis Island, no, we stood around Ellis Island overnight, we didn’t get off the ship, because we arrived a Sunday night.</span> <span id="s937">I think it was a Sunday night.</span> <span id="s938">We stood a distance away.</span> <span id="s939">In the morning they came into New York, into New York Port.</span> <span id="s940">Right into the port.</span> <span id="s941">When we got off the ship and the port went through all the formalities, the paper work, I started to look around.</span> <span id="s942">Was a huge hall, a huge building.</span> <span id="s943">But somehow I looked around and I set my eyes to a corner.</span> <span id="s944">I said to my wife, you see this is my sister.</span> <span id="s945">We didn’t see each other since 1929.</span> <span id="s946">But we got pictures.</span> <span id="s947">I said you see, this is my sister and we start raising hands.</span> <span id="s948">It took a while, she came down with her sister-in-law for us.</span> <span id="s949">It was my sister.</span> <span id="s950">Like we could feel from the distance that’s a sister and brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: It was a happy ending.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: It was a happy ending.</span> <span id="s953">It was like I said I was from the very few fortunate people to be with my wife together.</span> <span id="s954">We came over here she was pregnant, six months, and then mine daughter was born.</span> <span id="s955">We came in March, she was born in August, August the 10th.</span> <span id="s956">She lived till the 2nd of March, 1968.</span> <span id="s957">Didn’t live to see the happiness from my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: One day short of March 3rd.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s960">So she didn’t live to see the happiness from our daughter.</span> <span id="s961">But she knew that she had a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s962">The boyfriend he lived across the street of us.</span> <span id="s963">He was home a week before, he was going to college in North Carolina, what was the name, I forgot the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Duke?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: No.</span> <span id="s966">I forgot the name of the college.</span> <span id="s967">Anyway he was home a week before and the following week she called him her mother had passed away.</span> <span id="s968">So he came back.</span> <span id="s969">The week before when he came in he gave her the pin.</span> <span id="s970">That’s how much she knew this was going to be the future husband.</span> <span id="s971">That’s how life goes.</span> <span id="s972">She is a good daughter, a good son-in-law and two wonderful children.</span> <span id="s973">The older one is going to be 17 in December and the young one will be 13 in January 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: I have to say there’s a big smile on your face right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s976">There’s a song in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s977">Every smile is mixed with a tear.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: I can see it.</span> <span id="s979">Do you have anything else to add to your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Anything else to add?</span> <span id="s981">Yes.</span> <span id="s982">There were times which we couldn’t talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s983">I think that most of us came to the conclusion we should talk about, we should tell about what we lived through and the world population with few exceptions stood silent, callously silent, to the annihilation of six million Jewish people.</span> <span id="s984">Among them a million and a half children.</span> <span id="s985">Children which they never had a chance to see the world with its beauty what they taste the tyranny of the people.</span> <span id="s986">We should talk about, especially now, they are so called educators, they are so called educators that they are denying the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s987">They say it only in our imagination.</span> <span id="s988">Things like this never happened.</span> <span id="s989">How kind of vultures can I say those people are.</span> <span id="s990">They denying the existing of us survivors who went through hell and they know about, but still they are denying it.</span> <span id="s991">We should remember, we remember, we should never let the people forget what we Jews went through, other Nations too, but there is a difference between us Jews and other Nations.</span> <span id="s992">We were annihilated for one reason and for one reason only.</span> <span id="s993">Just because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s994">There was said this Hitler may he rest in hell, wherever he is, said, if he’ll find a Jew in 1945, he is going to kiss his head.</span> <span id="s995">Thank G-d there are Jews survived him, there is Israel which hopefully will exist and he is in hell wherever he is.</span> <span id="s996">We a long accounting to do with people.</span> <span id="s997">So called friends.</span> <span id="s998">We hoped that the world will realize and help Israel, the Jewish Nation live in peace.</span> <span id="s999">Unfortunately, so- called friends are doing very little to help Israel in peace.</span> <span id="s1000">But let’s hope we are out making people hopefully will exist for many years to come.</span> <span id="s1001">And I thank you Anthony Di Iorio.</span> <span id="s1002">I thank you for coming into the house and telling my story of life.</span> <span id="s1003">Maybe it’s not so_______ but it’s a story of life which we went through.</span> <span id="s1004">Many people may say, why didn’t you fight back?</span> <span id="s1005">But there is a saying that it is always good to be a quarterback next day after the game.</span> <span id="s1006">Unfortunately, this was the story with us.</span> <span id="s1007">There were very few which were able to fight back, to resist.</span> <span id="s1008">The greatest resistance from the people was to exist and try to conduct as humanely as you could with all the bad luck situations where we lived, conditions where we lived, and we resisted to be able to exist and I think this is the greatest resistance what every human being could do.</span> <span id="s1009">And I thank you again for coming.</span> <span id="s1010">You had a long day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q; Thank you for having me.</span> <span id="s1012">I probably should say for those who will hear this tape that hard necking people, we should say that means stubborn and tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1014">I just couldn’t bring out the proper word for it.</span> <span id="s1015">There is the Hebrew translation for it, Em shay oraf, the heart necking stubborn people.</span> <span id="s1016">With all the humiliation that we had we still were able to bring up a second generation nice young people who do take an active part to keep up the Holocaust memory and the memory of the grandparents that they had lost.</span> <span id="s1017">It’s very heartwarming for those youngsters to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And the rate you’re going, you’re going to have a third generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Let’s hope, let’s hope.</span> <span id="s1020">(Di Iorio: Thank you.)</span></p></body></html>
