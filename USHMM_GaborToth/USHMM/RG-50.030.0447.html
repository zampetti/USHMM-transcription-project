Perl’s home in Beltsville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s14">And the interviewers today Arwen Donahue and Scott Miller.</span> <span id="s15">And Mrs. Perl, I’d like to start by asking you when you were born, the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: On the 13th of March, 1913.</span> <span id="s17">That, it’s a very long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And where were you born, exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: In Askersdorf.</span> <span id="s20">That was a suburb of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: A very long, Leonore Maria Luise.</span> <span id="s23">For such a little thing, imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And your, your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Was Rollig, R-O-L-L-I-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Would you say something about your family background, your, your father, first his name and then what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Fine.</span> <span id="s28">My father’s name was Franz Xaver and shortly after I was born, World War I broke out and he went into the Army and my mother and I, we were alone.</span> <span id="s29">My, then there was no money for soldiers’ wives and so on and my family wasn’t rich so Mother had to work.</span> <span id="s30">And she went to work at a very unusual way.</span> <span id="s31">She worked for, as an, importer for a firm that reproduced wooden barrels.</span> <span id="s32">And she went all over to buy the right wood, I don’t know any more and I never knew and never will know what kind of wood it was.</span> <span id="s33">But she was very good at that and when my father came home in 1918, I was five years old.</span> <span id="s34">I hardly recognized him.</span> <span id="s35">I told my mother, “There’s a strange man out there, would you go look for him?”</span> <span id="s36">Then I knew it was Father.</span> <span id="s37">During the war he occasionally came and brought food because food was very, very rare in Vienna.</span> <span id="s38">I have very bad memories as far as food goes that Mother and I, we were standing in line for a long time.</span> <span id="s39">I’ve, now, if, I try to remember, it seems it was the whole night in order to get some food ration that, that was supposed to come to us and when we got there, was sometimes there was no food left and sometimes, once at least, I remember when we came home, there were potatoes and they were all spoiled and Mother cried.</span> <span id="s40">So I was then maybe three years old.</span> <span id="s41">Occasionally, we went to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s42">They had a farm in, in Silesia, no, in, in [talkover], no, Moravia . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Moravia.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">And my, my father’s parents had a farm in Moravia.</span> <span id="s45">My father’s parents, they had the farm in Moravia and Mother and I went there several times in order to get some food.</span> <span id="s46">They, they did not suffer so much because they had all kinds of animals and, and, and, it’s, it, it wasn’t too bad for them and when we came home, we always had food for the few weeks to eat, until that went low again and then we went back to them again.</span> <span id="s47">They were very good to us and I have very vivid memories of my grandmother, who carried me on her back, no perambulator or something like that.</span> <span id="s48">She just carried me on her back.</span> <span id="s49">So I must have been very little and probably very light also.</span> <span id="s50">So when the war was over my father came home.</span> <span id="s51">He was a mechanical engineer and there was no job for him to get so he worked as a ditch digger and in a factory as this and in a factory as that until the situation had settled.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What was your mother’s name and her family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My, my mother’s name was Anna Steiner, and my grandfather had, well factory is said too much, he had a little, what would you say . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: A little shop where he produced linen and I still have napkins from him.</span> <span id="s56">And one tablecloth that he, he produced, it’s a long time.</span> <span id="s57">And he lost that and my grandmother and two sisters and a brother were alone.</span> <span id="s58">Grandfather died.</span> <span id="s59">And she . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: He lost that because of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, that was before the war.</span> <span id="s62">There, I do not know whether you are familiar with European history but there was a very, very hard time and people like now, they just had to close up.</span> <span id="s63">There was no more, asking for good supplies and good things.</span> <span id="s64">People bought whatever they could and as long as it wasn’t too expensive and apparently what he produced was very expensive.</span> <span id="s65">You can see if I have now still something that he produced, it must have been good.</span> <span id="s66">Now it’s more than hundred years now almost.</span> <span id="s67">So, my mother and my father married in 1909 and I was born in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: My mother had one stillborn child.</span> <span id="s70">That, that was all, no more.</span> <span id="s71">That was before me.</span> <span id="s72">I was an only one.</span> <span id="s73">He claims you can still see it.</span> <span id="s74">But it doesn’t, __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What were your parents’ political leanings?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: My father was a Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s77">He was very much concerned with the welfare of poor people and he tried to help as much as he could.</span> <span id="s78">He became a councilman in the city council and he was, he was kind of, well shunned, because wherever it was and wherever he went he would say, “That’s fine but, but you have to do something for those people.”</span> <span id="s79">For instance he organized that, at Christmas, baskets would go out with food to poor families and of course, he wasn’t loved for that by the people who had to fill the baskets.</span> <span id="s80">And, I guess I grew up in that spirit.</span> <span id="s81">I still love to send baskets too but I send them, so.</span> <span id="s82">And my mother was very helpful in everything that had to be done in this respect.</span> <span id="s83">In fact, my father used to say, “If you want something from Mother, she will give you her last shirt.”</span> <span id="s84">And it, it was true, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you have a particular religious upbringing, religious education, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s87">My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s88">She was Catholic.</span> <span id="s89">She was very religious in the way that she thought you have to, you have a certain amount of obligation and you have to help wherever her, you can.</span> <span id="s90">That was mostly her religion.</span> <span id="s91">The rest of her family, there was one aunt who went to church almost daily and my father didn’t think very much in religious terms.</span> <span id="s92">He always said that religion is the crutch of the poor and the church tries to keep them in bondage.</span> <span id="s93">That was his feeling so as you can see my, for some time, I went to parochial school because apparently it was then already, also better than the public schooling.</span> <span id="s94">It was not too good an experience for me, and I dropped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What was your father’s attitude toward Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I don’t know, he never had any.</span> <span id="s97">For us, in our house, my father had a friend who was a priest.</span> <span id="s98">They came and they came together and they argued for hours.</span> <span id="s99">And my father used to say, “And where was God when, on the, on the, in the war when the people were lying on the ground moaning and dying by the hundreds?</span> <span id="s100">Where was God then?”</span> <span id="s101">That’s what people ask now about the Holocaust, too, right?</span> <span id="s102">He had the same attitude.</span> <span id="s103">We had, we had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s104">I had a very, very good Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s105">She died last year in California.</span> <span id="s106">We, we kept very close all the time.</span> <span id="s107">Whether somebody was as he always said, “Whether somebody’s green, blue or red, it doesn’t matter, as long as they are good.”</span> <span id="s108">And this was his attitude.</span> <span id="s109">And for religious reason, he didn’t really, I don’t think he had any feelings for or against any kind of religion.</span> <span id="s110">He just didn’t believe into the doctrines of the religions.</span> <span id="s111">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you, do you remember from your childhood seeing any type of anti-Semitism or any type of discrimination?</span> <span id="s113">Were you aware of, of that in Vienna at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Discrimination, really only against me.</span> <span id="s115">My father, we, I was once detained, wrongly in the afternoon and my parents were very concerned that I didn’t come home, even then you didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s116">If your child is supposed to be home at one thirty, and at three or four o’clock, it’s not at home, you wonder.</span> <span id="s117">So my father came to school and I recall that the, the priest had kept me and a few other girls in school for a very funny incidence.</span> <span id="s118">He asked what was Christ when he was for 40 days in the, in the desert and there was no food and that was at this time, the time of the people who were called “hunger artists”.</span> <span id="s119">I don’t think you know what that means here.</span> <span id="s120">There were people who were going on a hunger strike for so and so long in order to, to show, to prove something.</span> <span id="s121">And when, when the priest asked what was Christ, one of the girls said, “A hunger artist.”</span> <span id="s122">And then he said, “Who said that?”</span> <span id="s123">And of course, nobody did say so I was one of the ones who were supposed to have said it and three or four others were there too.</span> <span id="s124">And my father came and he told the priest that what he did was wrong because he can keep me at, if he thinks I did something wrong the next day, am I too wordy?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: [negative grunt]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: That he can keep me the next day but not on the day when my parents don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s127">And from this day on when the priest came into the class, every morning he said, “ ____________ go into the corner.”</span> <span id="s128">And then I had to stand all, all the whole hour until the hour was over.</span> <span id="s129">So this was the discrimination I experienced.</span> <span id="s130">Well, then there, of course, the girls or the boys that were not Catholic, they could sit in the rear of the class but I didn’t find that this was discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: When you, when you say not Catholic, were these Protestants or, or Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Protestant and Jews.</span> <span id="s133">They were, they could sit in the rear of the class and they could read or do anything else.</span> <span id="s134">I never felt that this was discrimination.</span> <span id="s135">[talkover] I, no, not exactly, but I know that three girls I was close with, they were in my class . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Three, there were three Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Three Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s138">I was pretty close with, I visited them, they visited me.</span> <span id="s139">We played together and it was, it was, well a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s140">So, of, of course, when the Nazis came, it changed drastically, then.</span> <span id="s141">Everything changed and they were resettled.</span> <span id="s142">I didn’t have any contact then with the three girls.</span> <span id="s143">I was, I did go up because I went then to school in Vienna and I wasn’t in Askersdorf and things had changed quite a lot.</span> <span id="s144">And then when the Nazis came, I tried to contact one of the girls but they already, the father was a physician, they already had left but they were not resettled.</span> <span id="s145">They had left for, I do not remember, America, anything, anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: When, when did you move to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I lived in Vienna all the time but it was a suburb and I went then, I moved then into the city, proper, in the first district.</span> <span id="s148">When was it?</span> <span id="s149">I think in ’37, ’36 or ’37.</span> <span id="s150">I worked there.</span> <span id="s151">My father wasn’t very happy that I moved there but I, living in the suburb as it is here, in order to go from the White House to Silver Spring or to even Beltsville(ph), it takes you an hour and a half because we didn’t have cars at this time.</span> <span id="s152">You used public transportation and it worked out well.</span> <span id="s153">I had a good job.</span> <span id="s154">I, I liked my job and, and I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Go back just a bit.</span> <span id="s156">In ’34, as I understand it, Dolfus had banned all political parties including the Socialists.</span> <span id="s157">What effect did that have on your father, on your family life and on your perception?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I don’t think it had very much effect.</span> <span id="s159">My father did anyhow what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s160">He always did.</span> <span id="s161">Like almost all men do, right?</span> <span id="s162">And, well, Dolfus, he had a party of people and he had many people around him who were thought kind of ridiculous people, die Hamenschwenzler?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s164">They, they ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Hmmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: They were ridiculous _________ Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah, they, they were, they wore hats with a, a cock feather on their hats or they were called according to the cock feather and were made ridiculous, this is about all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: But he wasn’t persecuted any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s170">He was not persecuted.</span> <span id="s171">Whatever he did, he got away with it.</span> <span id="s172">He was, even when I was arrested when he went, no, no, out.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: We can get into that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: That time later.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did you have any knowledge of the, did, did you have much political awareness, what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span> <span id="s179">No, no, I did, unfortunately I didn’t have very much political awareness.</span> <span id="s180">See I went to school and I worked and it really took up all my time.</span> <span id="s181">And my mother was sickish and I also took care of her.</span> <span id="s182">So whatever time there was, I didn’t have time for politics.</span> <span id="s183">I was interested in it, but I could never take an active part.</span> <span id="s184">I took an active part in politics only after Hitler came to Vienna.</span> <span id="s185">Then I started to become much more aware of what was going on and I, because many of my friends were affected by it.</span> <span id="s186">And, and I, I tried to fight it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Tell me about what you were studying in school [talkover] and what you were doing for work after?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Oh I worked, first of all I, I went to the Institute, Lehrerbildungsanstalt, I don’t know now . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Teacher college.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: It’s a teacher’s college, okay, and while I, in my free time, I worked in the Jewish kindergarten which I enjoyed immensely.</span> <span id="s191">I, I never knew that I would love children that much but it was a delightful job.</span> <span id="s192">I even thought sometime that I would write about the sayings of the children and their behavior.</span> <span id="s193">I never did of course, that was just a dream.</span> <span id="s194">And then after I had my degree I started, I tried to start to work in a public kindergarten but it was absolutely impossible because as I applied for the job, the interviewer told me, “Well, I tell you, we do take two people a year.</span> <span id="s195">We hire two people a year.</span> <span id="s196">We have hundred and three applications so you figure out how long it will take before you are being hired.”</span> <span id="s197">So my, my aspects of being a being a public kindergarten teacher went all the way down.</span> <span id="s198">Then I just tried to get all kinds of jobs and it was ’33, the time when it was very, very hard to get jobs.</span> <span id="s199">It was in America the same.</span> <span id="s200">There was the big crash on the, on the Börse, on the stock market and in Europe it was the same.</span> <span id="s201">Jobs were very scarce.</span> <span id="s202">So finally I did get, I worked as a secretary in a, in a factory, no, no, in an office that imported wood from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s203">Then I worked for sometimes in an office that imported from Germany, dryers, commercial dryers and what else did I do?</span> <span id="s204">And then I, one of my father’s acquaintances lost his wife and he needed somebody to take care of his books and help him in his praxis.</span> <span id="s205">I took that job and this is when I met him while I was there and I, I stayed in this job until I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Let’s go back to your working with children.</span> <span id="s207">You were working with, in this kindergarten immediately after you got out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, no, no, while I was studying.</span> <span id="s209">I was working two or three [talkover] three days, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: As an intern.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Studying to be a teacher in Vienna is quite different.</span> <span id="s212">I do not know whether this like that here but I remember that we had to work for three months in an institute for the blind.</span> <span id="s213">Three months in an institute for the deaf and three months we worked in an institute or institution for the retarded.</span> <span id="s214">And I remember that this was the hardest part of my studying, so.</span> <span id="s215">And whatever I had on free time, I worked in the kindergarten, partly as part of my training, partly also because I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What did you like about it?</span> <span id="s217">You said you were surprised by how much you liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: What was that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, I always liked children but I never knew how much you can do to help them grow up and to help them to develop their abilities to see the world, to learn how to talk.</span> <span id="s221">I remember that I tried to teach them English, English songs and one of the first one was pitter patter pit pat, listen to the rain.</span> <span id="s222">You know that?</span> <span id="s223">No, you don’t know an English children’s song?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: You want to sing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, it was, pitter patter pit pat, listen to the rain, falling in the garden, running down the pane.</span> <span id="s226">A big song and the, another one that we, that I tried to teach them was the teensy weensy spider [talkover] you know that, went up the water spout.</span> <span id="s227">And those very tiny little things and the kids were just delightful.</span> <span id="s228">I remember that once we went out to the park and one of the little boys says, “Will you please excuse me but the fire engine has to make pee-pee.”</span> <span id="s229">[talkover] So those, all those things made me to get so much closer to the children, to understand them so much more.</span> <span id="s230">You learn a lot from books but you do not learn what you can learn from a personal contact.</span> <span id="s231">Their warmth, their love and later on I often thought how many made it.</span> <span id="s232">That was the hard part because I am sure that many of them and their parents perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And this, these, this kindergarten was a Jewish kindergarten specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes, it was, it was run by a Jewish organization but I do not remember anymore by what organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: How did you end up in a Jewish kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: This was arranged from, this, from the college.</span> <span id="s237">The college sent people out to this, and to this, and to this kindergarten and I happened to get this one.</span> <span id="s238">__________ sit, you’ll fall down.</span> <span id="s239">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you have, you mentioned that you had, you had many Jewish friends and that you had Jewish friends in your family and your father had Jewish acquaintances and yet there, there was a growing perhaps sense of anti-Semitism especially after Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s241">Did you, did you have friends who weren’t Jewish, who were, who were questioning your teaching Jewish children and enjoying them so much or did you experience any sort of derisive comments for doing that sort of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No, no, I, I did not.</span> <span id="s243">I don’t remember, I didn’t have very many, no Jewish friends and so I had one or two and I don’t think that they ever questioned anything.</span> <span id="s244">It was more, we were young people and it was more, you do what you think is right and I do what I do think is right.</span> <span id="s245">I only knew one young man who was an SS man later.</span> <span id="s246">He helped me get somebody out of concentration camp so he was in the way, he helped also partly to get Bill’s family safe.</span> <span id="s247">Those, this is my only known Jewish acquaintance Bekarntsdaft, Bekarntentkreis(ph) who had anything to do with my activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: How did it happen that you had mostly Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s249">Wasn’t that unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, because the school I went to was mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s251">So, as I told you we, I had a friend all my life, she only died last year (1995) in California.</span> <span id="s252">We visited her often.</span> <span id="s253">We supported her financially and she died last year.</span> <span id="s254">We were very close to the very end, I’m now very close, no, close with her, with her daughter and even the grandchildren send me invitation to their bar-mitzvah, bas-mitzvah and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What was this school, what was, was this your college?</span> <span id="s256">What was. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: A teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s258">The Vienna teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s259">And like most of the colleges, no I shouldn’t say most.</span> <span id="s260">But in all the colleges there was a large percentage of Jewish people and large, and it was more Jewish than anywhere else because Vienna had the large Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Now . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I, I also worked with Jews a lot.</span> <span id="s263">It, somehow, I, I can’t tell you how it happened but my feelings were kind of, well, not biased in any way.</span> <span id="s264">A person was a person and that’s it.</span> <span id="s265">That’s what my father’s teaching was.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you consider yourself unusual?</span> <span id="s267">Were you aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s269">I was always just a very ordinary person.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: You must have been very surprised when the, during the Anschluss . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: When the Germans were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: That was a very, very major blow for me first of all because I was worried about Bill.</span> <span id="s274">We were going to be married in March and in March Hitler came in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: March of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s277">And then Hitler came and the euphoria of the people of Vienna when they were lining the streets greeting Hitler and his entourage.</span> <span id="s278">It was, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s279">Just thinking of it, I cringe.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Would you describe your meeting with, how you met Dr. Perl and that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I do not know exactly the date but it was sometimes in June, [talkover], ’37.</span> <span id="s282">And I had a big argument with my father, as I told you he wasn’t happy that I moved out of the house and moved into the city proper and I was sitting in the park, crying and there was a very long row, in the park there was a large row of chairs and you know in Vienna, the chairs were chained one to another so that nobody could take one away.</span> <span id="s283">And I was sitting there crying and as Bill says, he walked by several times.</span> <span id="s284">And I don’t remember that but he says so.</span> <span id="s285">And finally he asked me, “Is this chair here free?”</span> <span id="s286">The chair next to me.</span> <span id="s287">And I just spit at him something like, “Oh you idiot, there are hundreds of chairs, leave me alone.”</span> <span id="s288">[talkover] So of course he sat next to me and then we talked and he started talking and he started telling me and then we found out that I live in Postgasse 11 and he lived in Postgasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">[End of side 1 of tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: This is a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lore Perl.</span> <span id="s291">This is tape one, side B and you were describing that you and Dr. Perl found out you were neighbors the day that you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Right and he, we, he accompanied me to the house and then we made a date for a later date and, and that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: What were your first impressions of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: A very brash young man.</span> <span id="s295">But he was very likable because, and he was very lively.</span> <span id="s296">He told me a lot of things that he had done, about his traveling and so on and so forth and I found him interesting.</span> <span id="s297">And then we, we had a date and we wanted to go out.</span> <span id="s298">I think I told him, come and, he should come and visit me and then I met him in front of the door and I said, “I have friends upstairs.</span> <span id="s299">Come and come upstairs,” but he didn’t want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: What was the point?</span> <span id="s301">So she says, “Visit me.”</span> <span id="s302">____________ people there so I said, “No.</span> <span id="s303">Not if there are people there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: So then we, we went out a couple of times together and then we thought well, this is something that will go into something more, more earnest and I wanted, well then he said, told me that he would never marry a Jewish girl, a non Jewish girl and whether I would consider converting.</span> <span id="s305">And somehow I felt that converting was absolutely not necessary for me because my feelings were anyhow for, against Nazism and for everything that stood in Jewish life.</span> <span id="s306">But we broke up anyhow, so, because he didn’t want to put any kind of pressure on me and we parted.</span> <span id="s307">And then came Christmas and he send me a lilac bush, a white lilac bush as a Christmas gift.</span> <span id="s308">It’s, in a, it was for long time in the garden of a cousin of mine in, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s309">I don’t know whether it’s still there.</span> <span id="s310">He died and so on and a friend of mine when she saw that bush she said, “Eh!</span> <span id="s311">That means marriage.”</span> <span id="s312">And I told her, “You’re crazy, we just broke up.”</span> <span id="s313">She was right.</span> <span id="s314">So we got the, I, I called him and I thanked him and we got in touch again and then the, our, the relationship became much closer and we decided we would marry.</span> <span id="s315">I would convert and we would marry.</span> <span id="s316">And then Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Were you aware of what it would mean for you, any personal dangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I was aware.</span> <span id="s319">I was very much aware.</span> <span id="s320">And especially my father was aware of it.</span> <span id="s321">He was, I think, much more aware because he was politically much more astute than I was.</span> <span id="s322">And after we were married, it was very kind of sad affair.</span> <span id="s323">My father, his brother, I and he.</span> <span id="s324">I think, I don’t remember anymore who walked first.</span> <span id="s325">We went to the, to the Seitenstädter Temple where Rabbi [talkover] Tageslicht had agreed to marry us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: You were converted?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I had converted, yeah.</span> <span id="s328">But there was no mikvah anymore so the conversion was not complete but it, I was converted as far as Tageslicht went and he, he took into consideration all the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What did you have to do to convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I, first of all I had to study and I had to tell him a lot about Judaism.</span> <span id="s331">I told him my thoughts about Judaism and so on and apparently, whatever we talked and whatever I had learned about, he, he was satisfied when he questioned me.</span> <span id="s332">And then, when we got married it was a very short ceremony and we all, I guess, listened, whether the SS is coming.</span> <span id="s333">And after, afterwards, we just all left the way we came, one behind the other and he went home and I, I don’t think I went with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I only later came to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: And, well it was, as I said it was a sad affair instead of a happy one.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Was illegal from both points, from the Jewish point of view and from the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Nazi point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Nazi point of view.</span> <span id="s341">From the Jewish point of view because she had not really fully completed the conversion.</span> <span id="s342">She had completed it according to his saying but she had not fulfilled all the requirement.</span> <span id="s343">She hadn’t studied enough and there was no mikvah, but Rabbi Tageslicht was a good friend of mine from, I was __________ and he knew her and he felt that she’s a very valuable person as he told me.</span> <span id="s344">And he said, “If she converts, well you cannot wish for better Jewish children than from her.”</span> <span id="s345">He was concerned.</span> <span id="s346">So he says __________ and from the Nazi point of view it was a major, very major crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: We both would have been killed if they would have found out so it was, as I said it was a rather sad affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: He would have been killed too.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: And probably he too.</span> <span id="s350">But killing for them was a very easy thing so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So you remember being there at the wedding and feeling a sadness [talkover] even at the beginning [talkover].</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: For years, I dreamt that the SS would come and chase us and I would run with him through the different rooms and the different steps up because the old building was, a very old building in Vienna [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Where you, where you had to go this step and here some step and here a few steps and it would go all around and you could run and run and run and I dreamt again and again and again that we two, the two of us run.</span> <span id="s355">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: The synagogue was in this building.</span> <span id="s357">The Jewish synagogue still is in this building.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: But it’s a new building now.</span> <span id="s359">Well, and then, we never lived together.</span> <span id="s360">I went to my apartment.</span> <span id="s361">He was in his apartment and on the, we married on the 17th of April.</span> <span id="s362">And on the 10th of June he left for, after he had been arrested, and freed, he left for England.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Did you consider yourself, were you able to consider yourself Jewish?</span> <span id="s364">Did you feel that you were able to really become Jewish or did you feel that that was just a side consequence of your marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I did not feel the conversion had made me more Jewish in thinking and acting than I was before.</span> <span id="s366">That’s the answer to your question.</span> <span id="s367">After Bill had left, I did collect food for the people who were sent to the East and I very often worked for Gildermeister.</span> <span id="s368">Do you know who Gildermeister was?</span> <span id="s369">And I do recall one woman and a, her son and until today, I sometimes talk about it that I couldn’t, I do not know whether they got out because I was arrested before I could know whether they did really succeed in getting out.</span> <span id="s370">And until today I think of the little boy who was delightful and he had a charming mother.</span> <span id="s371">And I sometimes wonder if I would have said that I adopt that child.</span> <span id="s372">Nobody knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s373">If I would have adopted that child maybe I could have made sure that he’s alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: You will never have adopted a Jewish child.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: At this time . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Maybe it wouldn’t have been possible, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s378">But I feel, for one reason or another I always feel guilty that I let those two down.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Will you try to describe or reconstruct your growing political awareness?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: It started to become more political, not only feelings after I had met Bill.</span> <span id="s381">He told me about the plight of the people in Poland and he told me about Palestine.</span> <span id="s382">And that was, Palestine was something that was not in my thinking at all.</span> <span id="s383">It was too far away.</span> <span id="s384">But through him I became aware of so many things and I recall the first time when he told me that he had collected some betterim(ph) from Poland and they would go illegally to Israel and he showed me and introduced me to them.</span> <span id="s385">It was always very clandestine.</span> <span id="s386">It always had to be very secretly so that I wouldn’t be caught with any one of them.</span> <span id="s387">And then he asked me whether I would consider keeping his, we were not married then, keeping his, the passports of the people.</span> <span id="s388">And I remember that I kept all the 16 passports and I was a very, very big secret agent.</span> <span id="s389">I put them into a leather chair here in the rear and I thought that would be absolutely safe.</span> <span id="s390">But fortunately nobody looked for them and nobody came and asked so it was safe.</span> <span id="s391">That was the first time when I really was involved in saving some people’s lives.</span> <span id="s392">I, I knew about it but I, I only knew intellectually but now I had met the people and it was quite different.</span> <span id="s393">And from then on as I was aware of his and became more and more aware of his activities I, I was, let’s say caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: It sounds like you and Dr. Perl were in many ways very, very different.</span> <span id="s395">He had a different level of political awareness than you certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What was the bond or the attraction?</span> <span id="s398">Can you, do you think you can describe or characterize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I think that I was, I was drawn to him.</span> <span id="s400">As I told you before it was his spirit and it was his mentality that drew me to him and then when I realized that he was going out, out of his way and forgetting about himself and helping other people even to the, to the maybe end that he’s would be killed, it, it formed a bond.</span> <span id="s401">And if I think about it now, it might also be that it reminded me of my father.</span> <span id="s402">I never thought about it, it just occurred to me now.</span> <span id="s403">So you are now my therapist.</span> <span id="s404">But it, it might be that because my father was always so concerned with the underdog that this was another attraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: How did your father feel about Dr. Perl?</span> <span id="s406">Did, what was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: He didn’t have very many feelings except that he said, “You’ll get into problems and you, you don’t know what you are heading for.”</span> <span id="s408">But he would never say don’t do it or don’t do that, never.</span> <span id="s409">He just said, “He will be working and he will have to work and at times he will have to forget about you and wherever you will be.</span> <span id="s410">If you are together, you will be an albatross about his neck and if you are not together, you will have to worry and worry and worry.”</span> <span id="s411">And this is how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Did your friends know of the marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Nobody except my father, his brother and the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Nobody __________ the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: So.</span> <span id="s416">People did __________ suspect.</span> <span id="s417">People did suspect my closeness because I always kept alone.</span> <span id="s418">I didn’t go out and I didn’t go and see anybody.</span> <span id="s419">It was seven years, right?</span> <span id="s420">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: When Dr. Perl went to London, when he left Vienna for London . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Soon after you were married . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Married.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Was there a possibility of, of you going?</span> <span id="s426">Did you want to go, just the idea of escaping, getting out of Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I could have probably gone because I could travel very freely but it, at this time it was for many reason not possible.</span> <span id="s428">My mother was very sick and I, I just didn’t want to abandon her.</span> <span id="s429">And then as my father always pointed out again and again, “You’ll be an albatross about his neck.</span> <span id="s430">Don’t go.</span> <span id="s431">He will have so much to do, so much to worry.</span> <span id="s432">He has to worry about his safety and the safety of the people whom he tries to, to get into Palestine.</span> <span id="s433">If you would go, it would not be a good thing.”</span> <span id="s434">I realized that and I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s435">And then when Bill was in America he sent an affidavit for my parents and for me but the war had broken out and it was not, and my mother had died and very shortly after my mother died, my father died.</span> <span id="s436">Fortunately in a way because then when I was arrested I didn’t have to worry about anybody but myself.</span> <span id="s437">I knew he was halfway safe.</span> <span id="s438">I knew he was in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Meaning Dr. Perl.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Right.</span> <span id="s441">And my father and my mother didn’t live anymore so I was on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Soon in, after the war broke out were you aware __________ being as they said in quotes resettled in the East.</span> <span id="s443">Did you have any idea what that meant to be resettled?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, I did not know in the beginning but after I saw that they took sick and old people to resettle, I am a very gullible person.</span> <span id="s445">I hoped against my better knowledge because I went to the resettlement centers with food that I had collected from a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s446">She had a delicatessen store and whatever she could, she gave me.</span> <span id="s447">And whatever I could get from other people and food, there were already rations then.</span> <span id="s448">But whatever anybody could give, I brought it down to the settlement station.</span> <span id="s449">So I believed first that it is resettlement but when I saw the misery, the illness and everything I knew that, because Hitler at this time had already ordered the, the killing of the mentally ill in Vienna.</span> <span id="s450">So I knew that this was not resettlement.</span> <span id="s451">I mean knew in quotation mark.</span> <span id="s452">I, I, I felt that it was not resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: You were aware of the killing of the mentally ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s455">I was aware of this because I had a friend who was a nurse in the hospital for mental, mentally disturbed men but I, and, she had told me that they came in and took the incurable out.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And she knew what this meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s458">There was also one special institution, Steinhof, the, the Yard of, of Stones, literary translation.</span> <span id="s459">There were only incurable mentally ill and this, within a short time, it was completely emptied and you knew that.</span> <span id="s460">I think all Vienna knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: When you used to go and bring packages, food packages to the resettlement center, were you, were you, was that a risky thing to do?</span> <span id="s462">Were a lot of people doing that?</span> <span id="s463">Were you under suspect?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I do not know whether a lot of people do it.</span> <span id="s465">I do not know whether I was a suspect and I tell you I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s466">I just went there and I brought it and that was it.</span> <span id="s467">There are times when you really don’t, I hope you never will be in a situation like that, when you do not really care what happens to you, you just do what you think you have to do.</span> <span id="s468">And this is, I knew I could not help everybody there, that there is, but I knew I could give one or the other people hope.</span> <span id="s469">That was, that was all I could do.</span> <span id="s470">I, I, if I would have been able to bring wagons full of food it might have helped one segment of settlement but with my little things that I brought, it, it, it was just a little bit of hope and maybe also not only hope but seeing that somebody cares that helped a little bit.</span> <span id="s471">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Can we go back to the Anschluss once again and that period immediately after . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And you had that shocking realization of the welcome of . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Of the German army.</span> <span id="s477">Would you describe your, your awareness of anti-Semitism was, did, how did that grow?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I knew then because as I told you I had very many Jewish friends and right after the Anschluss when the SS started rounding up Jews, that was for me, let’s say a very hard awakening.</span> <span id="s479">I knew about anti-Semitism and I knew what it meant but I didn’t realize that it would go to that extreme.</span> <span id="s480">That, for instance, I had many friends, one cut his wrist, died in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s481">Another one jumped off the window from the fourth floor and another one shot himself.</span> <span id="s482">So all this, you can’t help but being more aware of what’s going on.</span> <span id="s483">Then you saw the people in the street, how the SS made old Jews with long beards wash the sidewalk, how women had to scrub the sidewalk, ahh.</span> <span id="s484">It was a horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Did any members of your family or acquaintances of yours join the Nazi Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Only the one I told you about, that was the only one.</span> <span id="s487">I think, wasn’t Mundle(ph) also a member?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I had a cousin who joined the Nazi Party but I do not know what he did.</span> <span id="s490">He was not active.</span> <span id="s491">He just had, was a member.</span> <span id="s492">Some, in some organizations you had to become a member in order to keep your job.</span> <span id="s493">Maybe he did that.</span> <span id="s494">He was much too complacent a person to be active in anything and I know something.</span> <span id="s495">I, I just remember something now.</span> <span id="s496">We had a Jewish butcher and this cousin went to him and told him that if he need some help, whatever he can do, he would do.</span> <span id="s497">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So there seemed to be a real, did you have the impression that there was a real sort of split personality going on among the Austrian people?</span> <span id="s499">Or did you, do you think that you just weren’t immediately acquainted with the people who were really rabid anti-Semites?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No, I was not acquainted with anybody who was, who was real an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s501">I, if I tried very hard to remember, no, no.</span> <span id="s502">Some people were saying, oh well, the Jews, the, the women flaunted their jewels, their jewelry and so on and people got very jealous and, but I don’t think they were aware that those were anti-Semitic feelings or anti-Semitic statements.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: So do you think that the majority of the Viennese people were perhaps, apathetic toward . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s505">But, but when it then came to looting, I should say it, it’s ugly to say but I feel that the Austrians are very, very big opportunists.</span> <span id="s506">Every single one of them and when it came to looting then, the Jewish homes and the Jewish stores, they were all for it.</span> <span id="s507">All.</span> <span id="s508">I had a cousin who’s, once, when the Nuremburg Laws came out and when the laws came out that you, that non Jews shouldn’t buy at Jewish stores, she said, “Hell with them.”</span> <span id="s509">And went to her store where she always bought and for the whole day she sat in a window, in a display window with a sign in front of her that said, this Jewish, this Christian swine buys in the Jewish store.</span> <span id="s510">It rhymes in German.</span> <span id="s511">This is, __________.</span> <span id="s512">She sat for the whole day there in the window.</span> <span id="s513">That’s, many people saw, but many people didn’t have the courage to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When, when the Nuremburg race laws were imposed in Austria, how, how did that make you feel?</span> <span id="s515">You were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Well, I knew about it from the beginning.</span> <span id="s517">For me it wasn’t anything new and I wasn’t going to marry a Jew anymore.</span> <span id="s518">Right?</span> <span id="s519">So it really didn’t affect me.</span> <span id="s520">But I know, I know for instance an acquaintance of mine went to, to the prison where I was also because he had a Jewish girlfriend and I, I visited him in the prison not knowing that a short time later I would be in there too.</span> <span id="s521">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So you, did you, would you say that, you described that when you, when you were married that there was a sad feeling . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: And perhaps a feeling of danger.</span> <span id="s525">Did you continue to feel that or did you feel . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, I, I felt very, in a way I felt euphoric.</span> <span id="s527">Now we did it, hell with them.</span> <span id="s528">And, and the other side I said, “We don’t know what’s in store for us.</span> <span id="s529">But now we are together.”</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So you didn’t feel that somehow you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: An, an oppressive mood.</span> <span id="s532">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s533">I felt, for him, for my husband, I was always trying to get him out of the country as quickly as he could because I knew he was in danger.</span> <span id="s534">Before we were married, we once walked very close to where I lived and with a friend of his and three Nazis . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: That was before the Nazis came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Three Nazis came towards us and this Jewish friend of ours had a very heavy Polish accent and when those three came they mimicked our Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s537">They were so tall that Bill had to practically jump and hit one into the face.</span> <span id="s538">I was paralyzed with fear, what will they do?</span> <span id="s539">They didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s540">They just walked on this way and we walked on that way in the opposite direction but I think my heart stopped beating.</span> <span id="s541">So I knew that he would do things like that.</span> <span id="s542">I knew him and I always tried to push, go, go, go.</span> <span id="s543">Until he went.</span> <span id="s544">And his going, no, it didn’t take seven years because I came visiting him in Yugoslavia for two days, three days on his birthday the next year.</span> <span id="s545">I went on the train.</span> <span id="s546">[talkover] Right.</span> <span id="s547">In September ’38 it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: ‘Kay.</span> <span id="s550">I went down to Yugoslavia and I met him there in the hotel and we, we tried to forget everything bad even as we knew that the Gestapo was very close by, watching us.</span> <span id="s551">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s552">He had then dealings with the Greek Underground for ships that he rented in order to bring illegal immigrants to Palestine and the three days went by very, very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: This is September of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: September, ’38.</span> <span id="s555">His birthday is the 21st of September.</span> <span id="s556">So I came down, I think it was a Saturday or Sunday and I stayed Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</span> <span id="s557">Then I went back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Were you aware of all that Dr. Perl was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s560">I was aware.</span> <span id="s561">[talkover] Yes.</span> <span id="s562">I did, in some way even try to help.</span> <span id="s563">I do not know whether I was much help but I tried anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: With his office.</span> <span id="s566">He had the office and I went very often there to, to see what is going on and what the, the girls, he had a, a number of secretaries what they were doing.</span> <span id="s567">‘Kay?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: So you were just checking in on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes and if there, when I thought that there was something to be done that could be done that they didn’t think of I told them get in touch with this person, get in touch with this person, and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Let’s pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Lore Perl.</span> <span id="s574">It’s November 13th, 1996 and this is Arwen Donahue, Scott Miller is also an interviewer and this is tape number two, side A. And Mrs. Perl, tell us a little bit more about your visit with Dr. Perl, how, [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Now the first, he came, first of all I had smuggled money out to cousins of his which I gave them in, in Fume and then I went to his hotel.</span> <span id="s576">I, I think he wasn’t even there and when he returned and he found me he was quite happy.</span> <span id="s577">And then we went out and we came into a demonstration that was very, very scary for me.</span> <span id="s578">The, the people were shouting Hitler, Duce of, Hitler and, and Mussolini.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s581">And Hitler and the Duce should go down.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: The Duce.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: The Duce, the Mussolini, they should go down [talkover] and, and he brought, no pulled me into a doorway and we there we were standing.</span> <span id="s584">I, you cannot imagine the, though the street was filled with people, one next to the other, it was really a horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s585">And after the whole thing was calmed down, we went into the hotel and we, we tried to forget what had been and what we had been through and we just were happy to be together.</span> <span id="s586">And then we went out for dinner and it must have been a long dinner because I do not recall how long it took.</span> <span id="s587">We took home a carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I had been drinking.</span> <span id="s589">I, that’s one of the three times I have been high.</span> <span id="s590">I wasn’t drunk in my life but I was high and she always tells me how in the carriage I was singing at the top of my voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes, he was really singing at the top of his voice.</span> <span id="s592">When we came to the hotel I tried to shush him.</span> <span id="s593">And I think I probably succeeded because it was already very late, so, this, this was our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s594">And the next day I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Did you, it sounds as if you both may have had really a feeling of, of hopefulness for the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I tell you, I always thought if Willie promised me to get the moon, he will get it.</span> <span id="s597">And well, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: At this time I knew that he would not stay in Europe, that he would go to America and he will make it.</span> <span id="s600">I, I had so, I can’t talk, can’t talk.</span> <span id="s601">There might have been dangerous times, I knew that also but I knew that he would make it.</span> <span id="s602">I knew it.</span> <span id="s603">As I always told when I came home, when the war was over and I came home from concentration camp, I always told everybody Willie will be here in May.</span> <span id="s604">Well he was, he was here on the 22nd of June.</span> <span id="s605">So every, every soothsayer can make a, a three week error, right?</span> <span id="s606">That’s it and he was there.</span> <span id="s607">So I, I really knew whatever will happen it will end well.</span> <span id="s608">And I think he is an eternal optimist, he, anyhow, for him there’s nothing that can be bad.</span> <span id="s609">Everything will turn out well and it did.</span> <span id="s610">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Back in Vienna, it was September of ’38 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Do you remember Kristallnacht and the events?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh sure, sure.</span> <span id="s615">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s616">His aunt Liesel whom I loved very much, no Valerie. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Valerie, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Valerie called me and said, “Can you help?”</span> <span id="s619">And I said, “I, I really don’t know what to, you couldn’t come here because you are two.”</span> <span id="s620">She had a friend.</span> <span id="s621">And the friend was a very, a person whom you could see because he was very tall, very heavy, very big so you would not be able to miss him, you cannot hide him.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: He was very Jewish looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, you couldn’t hide him.</span> <span id="s624">So I told her, “I’ll come to you and we’ll see what we can do.”</span> <span id="s625">So, and when I was there, we developed a plan that the best thing would probably be to take a taxi and drive around.</span> <span id="s626">And this is what we did.</span> <span id="s627">The whole night we drove around in the taxi.</span> <span id="s628">I sat next to the chauffeur and the two of them sat in the rear.</span> <span id="s629">And, we were driving and we saw everything and the guy, we told the guy just drive here and there and we drove into neighborhoods where we knew that there were very few Jews so that it wasn’t too obviously.</span> <span id="s630">But the guy was very good a driver.</span> <span id="s631">He drove us and drove us and in the morning when it, when the sky got gray he drove us back to the house and the two were safe.</span> <span id="s632">By the way, her two sons were saved too.</span> <span id="s633">They had come with the first transport to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Too risky for __________.</span> <span id="s635">Risky for a few days before the so-called Kristallnacht which is a misnomer, the Germans give it the name Kristallnacht because the crystal, the broken crystals cover the streets and this is a, __________.</span> <span id="s636">Kristallnacht makes, takes away of the horror.</span> <span id="s637">__________ Kristallnacht is the night of the national German pogrom.</span> <span id="s638">That’s how I call it.</span> <span id="s639">And you, I think you should, she should __________ tell you of some of the things which she saw during __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s641">This doesn’t help, I’m sure you have heard this a hundred times.</span> <span id="s642">How the mob went and broke into houses, into, into stores, how they carried as I told you when it came to plundering, they were all not anti-Semitic but they were on the bandwagon.</span> <span id="s643">They carried furniture and everything around and they, it, it was, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s644">You saw the flames leaping up.</span> <span id="s645">No, I can’t talk about it, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Were any of your friends hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I, I do not remember that.</span> <span id="s648">I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s649">This is, I told you that I’m very good in repressing and this is one of the things that I have completely blocked out.</span> <span id="s650">Even you as a psychiatrist or, or a pseudo-psychologist wouldn’t be able to get it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And then in September 1939 of course, is the beginning of, of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: The, Germany invades Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What were your feelings then as a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: That, that’s very odd.</span> <span id="s657">I remember that I wanted to go swimming and a cousin of mine came and, and she said, she shouted at the window, “War has broken out!”</span> <span id="s658">So we, I’m not going swimming.</span> <span id="s659">That, that was the __________ side of the war breaking out.</span> <span id="s660">No, but I knew and I hoped it would be the end.</span> <span id="s661">But of course I hoped wrongly.</span> <span id="s662">I hoped that with the break, the breaking out of the war, that America would get into the war right away and it would be an end.</span> <span id="s663">And then the Russians came and the Russians said now Germany, kaput, then America, kaput.</span> <span id="s664">That was their motto.</span> <span id="s665">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: What activities were you involved in?</span> <span id="s667">What did you do in Vienna in the early years of the war until your arrest?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I was working and I was arrested at the place that I told you that imported from Germany dryers, from there I was arrested.</span> <span id="s669">I worked there as a secretary and the guy was a very good Nazi and I remember that there was a, a lady working there.</span> <span id="s670">She had one son and that one son was killed in the war.</span> <span id="s671">And I remember that she put an ad into the newspaper, was proud, so I announce the dead of my son.</span> <span id="s672">Those were the people I worked with but it didn’t affect me in any way.</span> <span id="s673">I was Miss Rollig and that was it.</span> <span id="s674">And when I was arrested I know that he right away ran to the Gestapo to find out what I had done.</span> <span id="s675">I had never heard from him again, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: What reports were you getting from Poland by 1941, 1942?</span> <span id="s677">The, the final solution was underway.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, you know that we could not listen to foreign radios.</span> <span id="s679">Foreign radios, there were trucks going up and down the streets which checked who is listening to foreign broadcasts.</span> <span id="s680">We did it anyhow but the broadcasts were scarce and they really did, at least for me, they did not tell me too much.</span> <span id="s681">I knew that when the Germans went in that there would be massacres.</span> <span id="s682">I knew that.</span> <span id="s683">But I knew only through my feeling, I didn’t really, it was not certified.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: And no it wasn’t also information it was just my feeling that they would do horrible things.</span> <span id="s686">Then I, I was arrested.</span> <span id="s687">My arrest came about, I had a very good friend and she came to me and she told me, she had married one of the richest men in Vienna.</span> <span id="s688">His name was Tappish Rockshine(ph).</span> <span id="s689">Shine was his name and the Rock because he had the largest Oriental rock stores in Vienna.</span> <span id="s690">And she married him in the hope that with his money, they might come to America.</span> <span id="s691">Well one day she came to me and she told me, “We have received notice that we have to go to the resettlement point.”</span> <span id="s692">And the resettlement point was there, there and she said, “I know he will go, I won’t go.</span> <span id="s693">Can you help me?”</span> <span id="s694">Said, “Sure, stay here.”</span> <span id="s695">So she stayed with me and my father had just died and I, I was very down and I wanted to go on vacation and I went to relatives in Silesia to, for two weeks to recuperate.</span> <span id="s696">And in order to not make it obvious that, that she is alone in the apartment, I ask a cousin of mine to stay in the apartment with her.</span> <span id="s697">So when light is on, the water is running, that people do not say hey, who’s there, this apartment isn’t empty, she isn’t there.</span> <span id="s698">And while I was gone, she did something very stupid.</span> <span id="s699">She went to her lawyer.</span> <span id="s700">And when she came to her lawyer, the Gestapo was there because he had a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s701">So when she came, they said, “Eh, come on in,” and so on.</span> <span id="s702">And I do not know what they did to her but she told them that she had been hiding and the Gestapo came from my cousin and, and told, and she told him then the Gestapo that I am away and when I will be back.</span> <span id="s703">And when I came back, she told me, “You have visitors.”</span> <span id="s704">So I thought that maybe that SS man of whom I told you that he was so nice, that he had sent them.</span> <span id="s705">But they, he hadn’t sent them.</span> <span id="s706">They just interviewed me and they took me to the Gestapo headquarter and there they were telling me all kinds of things and threatening me, me with all kinds of things and telling me what a threat I am to the, to the German spirit with my doing what I am doing.</span> <span id="s707">And then they let me go again.</span> <span id="s708">[talkover] Don’t, don’t, yah, I said to them, “Listen I, I have, I didn’t know that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s709">I have been friend with her for a long time and she came that she had a fight with her husband and she wanted to stay away from him for a while.”</span> <span id="s710">So the, I don’t whether they believed it but they let me go.</span> <span id="s711">But don’t do it, don’t do it again.</span> <span id="s712">And then, I went home and I stayed at home for some time when I got the letter from this friend, Valerie, that she is in, in a very bad situation.</span> <span id="s713">She needs food and she needs clothes.</span> <span id="s714">Would I please send it to her.</span> <span id="s715">Of course I made the package and I send it to her.</span> <span id="s716">And this is when the Gestapo came and arrested me.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Where was Valerie at the time?</span> <span id="s718">Where was the package sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: To Poland.</span> <span id="s720">To some place in Poland, I do not recall anymore to where at, but it was the end, I never heard from her again, and, and I was brought to the Gestapo and from the Gestapo I was brought to Rossaeur Lände(ph), that was the prison where I told you before that I visited a friend of ours who had an affair with a Jewish girl who was there imprisoned.</span> <span id="s721">This is where I went first.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So you were arrested, not because you were Jewish, married to a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: No, because I helped Jews.</span> <span id="s724">Oh I can show you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: The arrest . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: The arrest report.</span> <span id="s727">I, I can get it.</span> <span id="s728">I have an arrest report that says that I was arrested for behavior that’s not worth a, a Gentile woman and that I do sacrifice the, the, the, for the person it would be health, I do not know what [talkover] it is.</span> <span id="s729">Endangered the, the security of the German people.</span> <span id="s730">So that, that was my arrest report.</span> <span id="s731">I think he’s going to find it.</span> <span id="s732">And I was for three weeks in Vienna at the Rossauer Lände Prison and then I was brought to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s733">The trip to Ravensbrück lasted weeks because they, we were in a train and they used the train for troop movement so whenever we were somewhere in the way, they put us aside so that the, the troops can move.</span> <span id="s734">We, I was in a little cell that was meant for two people.</span> <span id="s735">We were five in there.</span> <span id="s736">Three had to stand, two could sit.</span> <span id="s737">And it would always change.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Was this in the jail, in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No, that was in the, in the train that was used for transporting prisoners.</span> <span id="s740">And then we stopped at every little place where they had prisons that they could putted us in.</span> <span id="s741">We stopped I know in Sanpurltin(ph) and then in, there was one prison that had just been built that was a very clean one.</span> <span id="s742">We were very happy to be there even if we were in a one-man cell, five or six people.</span> <span id="s743">It was clean.</span> <span id="s744">We also stopped at the Pankrus(ph) that’s the big prison in Prague.</span> <span id="s745">That was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s746">We had to stand there with our back to the wall and our hands stretch out that, try to do that for an hour.</span> <span id="s747">And try to do that for five and six hours and you will see how hard it is.</span> <span id="s748">Then finally when I got into a cell, there were Yugoslav partisans in, there was such a stench, you cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s749">It was a stench of, of, of flesh being, being eaten up by illness.</span> <span id="s750">And those partisans had been beaten badly on the soles of their feet and on their backs.</span> <span id="s751">Their backs were raw.</span> <span id="s752">There was no bandage, no nothing.</span> <span id="s753">I remember that I tore up chemise . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Cloth?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: A rag, a cloth.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No, an undershirt [talkover].</span> <span id="s760">And I tore it up to strips in order to help one of the women to cover her back.</span> <span id="s761">There was no salve, no medicine, no nothing and the groaning and the moaning I have still in my ears.</span> <span id="s762">From there we went then on Wieherachen, there was another big place and some other prisons which I do not remember into Berlin.</span> <span id="s763">Berlin Alexanderplatz.</span> <span id="s764">This was the, the big prison in, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s765">While we were there, bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s766">Bedbugs were one of the first things.</span> <span id="s767">You could hear them when they came down and fell on you.</span> <span id="s768">And the stench, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s769">And while we were there, the bombs were falling and people were praying.</span> <span id="s770">Some were crying and I always told them, “Don’t worry, we’ll get out of this.”</span> <span id="s771">We did get out of it.</span> <span id="s772">We came to Ravensbruck and until today, I do not know how we get from Berlin to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s773">I know we got there because I was there but I couldn’t tell you how.</span> <span id="s774">I only know when we arrived in Ravensbruck we were had to stand in formation, two holes deep.</span> <span id="s775">And all the time in the prison and on the trip from the prison to Ravensbruck I, I always had the feeling it’s not I that’s happening to, somebody else, and I was outside just watching what was happening.</span> <span id="s776">When we came to Ravensbruck I learned, I had to wake up.</span> <span id="s777">While we were standing there, there were two witnesses of Jehovah coming and they had a big basket in between them.</span> <span id="s778">They were walking on the street the so-called Lagerstrasse and a big truck was coming.</span> <span id="s779">And the truck would, was going so close that the mirror that a side mirror that he had, hit one of the women.</span> <span id="s780">The women fell and the rear wheel went over her.</span> <span id="s781">All the people who were standing there in formation searched for what.</span> <span id="s782">But the overseers right away did sick the dogs at us.</span> <span id="s783">And this was the moment when I awoke and knew, I can’t dream anymore.</span> <span id="s784">That’s I, that’s not somebody else.</span> <span id="s785">So sometimes I think that that woman died so that I can live, okay.</span> <span id="s786">__________ Now while I was in Vienna there was a girl there who told, who had come in from Ravensbruck for an interview of, at the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s787">And she had told me when you come to Ravensbruck I’m sure that’s where you’re going, ask for so and so.</span> <span id="s788">She will be able to help you.</span> <span id="s789">She is a very tiny dark-haired girl and she has, she is in the, in the receiving line for all the people who come in.</span> <span id="s790">And she’ll help you.</span> <span id="s791">And this is what I did and the girl told me, “I’ll come visit you in the block in the evening,” and this is, this is what she did.</span> <span id="s792">I stayed at the receiving block who was run by a Viennese prostitute.</span> <span id="s793">Everybody went into this block first.</span> <span id="s794">And we stayed there, we, there were the bunks.</span> <span id="s795">And every bunk was supposed to hold one person.</span> <span id="s796">There, in every bunk were at least three.</span> <span id="s797">Two this way and one this way.</span> <span id="s798">And in the morning when I woke up I noticed that my cloths were missing and I couldn’t go for to a __________ in clothes without shoes so I, I called and the block, the Blockalteste, the leader, this prostitute she came and she said to me, “You are Viennese?”</span> <span id="s799">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s800">She said, “Wait.”</span> <span id="s801">And a few moments later she came with other, with other clothes, not with my own so I was saved for the moment.</span> <span id="s802">And for the while, I think for about three or four days we stayed in this block which was horrible because there was really everybody in there.</span> <span id="s803">And then we were separated and I went into block number one, the older, not old but some political prisoners were.</span> <span id="s804">Rosel Jochman who became a member of Parliament in Austria after the war, she was there.</span> <span id="s805">Helena Popptetts(ph) who became also some kind of big wig in the Austrian government after the war, she was there.</span> <span id="s806">And I was there and oh I didn’t tell you one story.</span> <span id="s807">When I came in Vienna into the prison, I had to wait out in the hallway for the little while and for, for the few hours, a little while.</span> <span id="s808">And then a door was opened and I was pushed into a room.</span> <span id="s809">The room was, you couldn’t make out anything, it was so full of steam, of smell.</span> <span id="s810">Everything was kind of hazy and out of this haze somebody came towards me and said, “Don’t cry, it isn’t so bad.”</span> <span id="s811">And this was a former teacher of mine.</span> <span id="s812">Muti Tiechman was her name.</span> <span id="s813">She also had helped Jews and this was, was, was the reason why she was arrested.</span> <span id="s814">And when I came to Ravensbruck, she already was in Ravensbruck, also into, also in this number one block.</span> <span id="s815">And there we, we kept up very much contact.</span> <span id="s816">I was her former pupil, she was my former teacher and somehow a bond was formed.</span> <span id="s817">After the war, she adopted Saul whom you met now as her grandson.</span> <span id="s818">And she came to visit us in America twice.</span> <span id="s819">When we went to Europe we always visited her.</span> <span id="s820">Then she died.</span> <span id="s821">Now.</span> <span id="s822">The number one block, is that all?</span> <span id="s823">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: You mentioned that most of the people in the number one block were political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Were they mostly Viennese?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s828">There were some Viennese but there were of course a number of Germans.</span> <span id="s829">The Germans, the young German girls mostly were arrested for distributing Communist pamphlets into the population or printing them or they were Communists.</span> <span id="s830">They were the real Communists.</span> <span id="s831">And one person was there [End of side 1 of tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Lore Perl.</span> <span id="s833">And before we flipped the tape you were talking about Ravensbruck and your block and I wondered also if you could say something about your, what happened upon arrival.</span> <span id="s834">Were you, were you given a uniform or a badge of some sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No, first of all, I do not remember our arrival.</span> <span id="s836">I just know that we went then into a building.</span> <span id="s837">We went through a line where this young lady was I told you about who was supposed to help me and I talked to her and they took all our belongings away and then we went on and we came into a room where we had to undress and where we got Lager clothes.</span> <span id="s838">And, and then we were again assembled and then we went out and went to this block to, no, in the beginning we all went to the block that was the receiving block where everyone of us had to go.</span> <span id="s839">In our group that arrived there were French nuns, Polish youngsters from, the SS had closed up or emptied the whole, the Lyzeum.</span> <span id="s840">I think you can say Lyzeum in English too.</span> <span id="s841">Lycee?</span> <span id="s842">No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s843">And they were all there and all, the baby’s crying, and all of them were of course stand frightened, bewildered.</span> <span id="s844">That was all that you could be.</span> <span id="s845">Then you were thrown into this mass of people in the, in the receiving block where everybody was there.</span> <span id="s846">From criminals to political prisoners.</span> <span id="s847">They all were and all, the women were all unwashed, dirty.</span> <span id="s848">The clothes that we received was not the cleanest either and, and it was miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: You mentioned seeing the two women who were Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: How, how could you tell that they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Oh, they had, everyone in the camp had a different, the triangle on the sleeve and the purple triangle was the Witnesses of Jehovah.</span> <span id="s853">And those two women had those triangles.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: So at the time you, you didn’t know that they were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s856">I only learned later what they were.</span> <span id="s857">I recognized the, the triangle and the color of it but I did not know.</span> <span id="s858">Maybe somebody told me also.</span> <span id="s859">I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Do you remember, were you given a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s862">Right when you entered you were given a number and you were supposed to sew the number on your sleeve.</span> <span id="s863">I had some 80,000 and some, 18 thousand and something, I do not know how much it was.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s865">I just know the 18 thousand.</span> <span id="s866">My baby’s asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: What color badge were you given?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Red.</span> <span id="s869">Red.</span> <span id="s870">All the political prisoners had red badges.</span> <span id="s871">The so-called, the Jews had yellow, yellow triangles and the people who were, they were the, some of them had black triangles, those were like the, our block and the, and the receiving block the one who was a prostitute or also the, I, I think that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Was there segregation between the different classes of prisoners?</span> <span id="s873">Or did you have . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s875">Sure.</span> <span id="s876">Sure, we would not have associated with criminals, right?</span> <span id="s877">The criminals also had black and I think that the political prisoners did keep a lot together.</span> <span id="s878">By the way, in the same block that I was was also Jan McGlock(ph).</span> <span id="s879">Jan McGlock(ph) was the sister of LaGuardia the mayor of New York.</span> <span id="s880">When the camp was liberated, Eisenhower wanted to bring her over on a special quota but of course LaGuardia was very much against it.</span> <span id="s881">He wanted her to come the regular way.</span> <span id="s882">She was there with her daughter and her grandson.</span> <span id="s883">For a long time they had been in the bunker because the SS didn’t want them to be in, in the population, in the camp population, but finally all three of them were released.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You had quite a, a group of people in your block, it sounds like . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: You mentioned several people who really . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Became prominent later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s890">And I think that amount of Germans, there were also people who became prominent later.</span> <span id="s891">But I, as they were not Austrians and not from Vienna, I didn’t keep track of them.</span> <span id="s892">But the people in our block were really special, altogether special people, not that I claim to be a special people but the others were, most of them were.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Did you know at the time that LaGuardia’s sister was there?</span> <span id="s894">Did you know that she was the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: When, after she came . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Sister of the mayor of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yah, after she came out of the bunker and came into our block, she of course told us.</span> <span id="s898">And you know that she was the one we practiced English with?</span> <span id="s899">If there was a word, I remember she brought me a book that I should read, the first book in English in the camp was Men Against Death.</span> <span id="s900">Do you know?</span> <span id="s901">I’m sure you don’t.</span> <span id="s902">It’s about Sammelvise(ph), the guy who found out in Hungary that so many women died, died in childbirth because the doctors didn’t wash hands.</span> <span id="s903">That was the first, she, and there were of course words that I didn’t understand in spite of the fact that my English was, let’s say, pretty good for European school English.</span> <span id="s904">But there were certain words that I didn’t get and then she would be the one who, to tell me what it means.</span> <span id="s905">So, I did __________ something for my education in Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Did you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Were Jewish prisoners in a, in any way . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Separate, were they in any way singled out in terms of harsh treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s911">Harsh treatment was really for everybody the same.</span> <span id="s912">It was just the kind of work that you could get that would remove some of the harshness of the life.</span> <span id="s913">See for instance, I worked in the library and I worked in the book binding.</span> <span id="s914">For me, life as such wasn’t that harsh because I didn’t have to go out in the morning and pull the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Steamroller.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: The steamroller.</span> <span id="s917">Women used to every day go out and pull the steamroller and I had, later on I made a friend whom I got away from there because somehow prisoners did have some influence on what could happen to prisoners and I got her away.</span> <span id="s918">Her name was Annemarie Thiele.</span> <span id="s919">She came then to America as a cousin of ours.</span> <span id="s920">We sent her an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: She was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: But she was in camp because she had an affair with a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s923">And she wore the black and yellow star, so.</span> <span id="s924">We sent her then an affidavit to come to America.</span> <span id="s925">She was a cousin of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Did you witness other brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yes, but, but I do not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s928">It’s, it’s too, too, it’s too harmful for me and it wouldn’t do any, and it wouldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s929">I have here still a big dent where a SS woman kicked me.</span> <span id="s930">I have this where an SS woman slashed against me and when I made like that, she stabbed my hand and you see the finger?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: She stabbed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yes, she was angry at me because I wasn’t fast enough with something or I didn’t understand what she meant, so she grabbed a scalpel and she went like that to me and I made of course like that and, did you see it?</span> <span id="s933">So, I knew that there were experiments going on because when you went on the street that ran between the barracks, the two rows of barracks, you could hear the moaning and the groaning.</span> <span id="s934">And, so you knew what, what happening.</span> <span id="s935">Some . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Medical experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s938">Medical experiments and some of the prisoners, some, there was one block where they kept the prisoners who had gone over the edge.</span> <span id="s939">And it was really terrible.</span> <span id="s940">It was so bad that after I had my first son, in, within a very short time, he, he found out if he cried in a certain way, he could have anything he wanted, because it did remind me so much of Ravensbruck that I just wanted him to be quiet and not cry.</span> <span id="s941">In this way, he found out very early.</span> <span id="s942">Children do.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: You couldn’t drive through the tunnel in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Oh yeah, a long, late, when I was in New York, for a long time when we went through the Lincoln Tunnel, I felt sick.</span> <span id="s945">I felt like throwing up, die, I always told him, “Please, let’s not,” told my husband, “Please, let’s not go through the tunnel anymore.”</span> <span id="s946">And then we talked and we talked, and after all he’s a psychologist.</span> <span id="s947">And one day he said, “Let’s go and look what’s what.”</span> <span id="s948">And it was a very slow traffic and I really looked and you know what’s really amazing, at the bottom end, pardon me, and at the top of the tunnel of the tiles, were black stripes.</span> <span id="s949">I do not remember now anymore whether they were double stripes or single stripes.</span> <span id="s950">I knew that was in the shower room in Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s951">From then I could go through the tunnel without any problem.</span> <span id="s952">We had found out what caused the problem.</span> <span id="s953">So.</span> <span id="s954">When I already was in America I could for instance, not eat steak.</span> <span id="s955">The smell of seared flesh just made me sick.</span> <span id="s956">Courtesy of Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: What was the first job that you had there?</span> <span id="s958">What was your first work detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: My first work detail was in the SS library.</span> <span id="s960">Working with the SS like for instance in the library, in the book binding and so on, we, we, __________ were mostly political prisoners and we had all one advantage.</span> <span id="s961">We could take a shower once a week because the SS was afraid that they might get lice too if we get lice, right?</span> <span id="s962">So they, they tried to keep us clean.</span> <span id="s963">And I remember that the shower was something that was very, very important for us, because it separated you more or less from the dirtiness of the camp.</span> <span id="s964">Because the camp was not paved.</span> <span id="s965">Everything was dust.</span> <span id="s966">And then you were standing for hours and hours at attention whether it was cold or hot.</span> <span id="s967">It didn’t do very much to your image.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Roll call in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Every morning would you go for roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s972">We got up, I don’t remember the time anymore but it was very early.</span> <span id="s973">It was either five, four or five o’clock.</span> <span id="s974">And we had about so and so many minutes to get ready and have our breakfast, then we had to stand at attention, at the apell(ph) as it was called.</span> <span id="s975">And then we were standing there as long as the SS did feel it was good for us.</span> <span id="s976">And then a bell rang and we could go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Did you, were, was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Sure it was cold.</span> <span id="s979">We didn’t have any clothes.</span> <span id="s980">We had very thin prisoner’s clothes.</span> <span id="s981">And you didn’t have, you hardly had any underwear.</span> <span id="s982">Later on when I was a little bit familiar with the camp, I went to some of the Witnesses of Jehovah who were in charge of all the clothing that had come in and they stole for me for my bundle, underwear so that I could have underwear.</span> <span id="s983">You, you had some very flimsy stuff.</span> <span id="s984">You, you must know from, from the museum and so on, you know how thin the clothes was that you had and sometimes when it got very cold, we got a jacket which didn’t very much against the cold either.</span> <span id="s985">And up there it can get very cold.</span> <span id="s986">The wind is extremely cold and if somebody, for instance, out of fatigue or not feeling well, if somebody fainted, that was fatal because he was just trampled, or she was just trampled to death.</span> <span id="s987">Not that somebody picked her up and brought her to the doctor, to the hospital, she was just trampled to death.</span> <span id="s988">That’s if somebody felt sick, we always tried to lean one against the other to hold her up.</span> <span id="s989">Sometimes it failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: How was your health?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Pretty good until one day I had a, a very odd episode.</span> <span id="s992">I reached for something and when I reached I, I collapsed.</span> <span id="s993">I got all blue and I don’t know, until today I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s994">I just collapsed and they brought me then to the so-called Revier.</span> <span id="s995">Revier is infirmary.</span> <span id="s996">And there the, there was a Czech heart specialist, a prisoner and she looked at me and she said, “That’s the camp.”</span> <span id="s997">And I remember, I thought, I thought it’s my heart because I’m all blue so they didn’t have any medicine.</span> <span id="s998">I just was lying there for some time and she ordered some rest.</span> <span id="s999">I went to the hospital and I stayed in the hospital a few days and then I went out again.</span> <span id="s1000">That was all.</span> <span id="s1001">So.</span> <span id="s1002">And with this here I got bandaged and they couldn’t do anything because they didn’t have suture material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: With the wound on your hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah, so it just grew the way it is and when I came to America, the friend of ours said, “Have it done, you can have this all fixed.”</span> <span id="s1005">But then I had a baby, I had a new life, a new, a new house and really a new husband because we hadn’t lived together for too long a time.</span> <span id="s1006">I didn’t want to be in a cast for six months.</span> <span id="s1007">This is what, no, six weeks.</span> <span id="s1008">That’s what they said.</span> <span id="s1009">I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1010">So I still, until now, I don’t play piano, I don’t play guitar anymore, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: You can’t type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: I cannot type because I hit another type.</span> <span id="s1013">Now it comes in handy because I don’t have to work the computer.</span> <span id="s1014">So, see?</span> <span id="s1015">There’s always some __________ silver lining, even if you don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: How many, how, what were your hours of work each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Of, I believe from seven ‘til twelve but this, I’m not absolutely sure.</span> <span id="s1018">Billy, you’re banging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Twelve . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: From, twelve noon.</span> <span id="s1021">And then we had an hour for lunch and then again of, until five, until six.</span> <span id="s1022">I, I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1023">But in the evening we could sit together after dinner, when after work we had dinner, the food was brought in very, very big . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Pockets(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: No, kettles, a kettle with handles on the side.</span> <span id="s1026">They were almost as big as we and they carried it, I remember that we sometimes four, two on each side tried to hold onto the handle and drag it.</span> <span id="s1027">And every block got one of those things and this is the way we were being fed.</span> <span id="s1028">In the morning we got something that was called coffee.</span> <span id="s1029">It was some kind of a brown water and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1030">And at lunch we got some soup.</span> <span id="s1031">It was again water with a little bit of something swimming in it.</span> <span id="s1032">And in the evening sometimes it was rice with milk, also very watery.</span> <span id="s1033">Well, when I came out, I had, I weighed 90 pounds.</span> <span id="s1034">So you know I weigh now 127.</span> <span id="s1035">So I, I looked like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Did you have any supplemental food at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1038">Yes.</span> <span id="s1039">I was very, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1040">I tell you all my life long I was always fortunate.</span> <span id="s1041">When I came to camp I had the, the name of a woman who helped me to get into a good block.</span> <span id="s1042">When I was in camp such, I had the support of Muti Teichman and the support of Rosel Jochman and Helen and so on.</span> <span id="s1043">And I had really a lot of support and from the outside as I had sent packages to other people, now other people send packages to me.</span> <span id="s1044">It wasn’t much, because there was rationing going on but it was always a big joy.</span> <span id="s1045">For everybody around.</span> <span id="s1046">Even if you got only a bite, it was already, well I mean it was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: You would share the packages that you received?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1049">So would other people.</span> <span id="s1050">The only people who did not share anything were the Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1051">They didn’t give.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Jewish people were gentle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1054">But the Polish girl, Poland still had a lot of food and they really got food but they rather let it spoil than share it with somebody who was not Polish.</span> <span id="s1055">This is something I, until today, I do not understand.</span> <span id="s1056">We worked with one Polish girl, she worked with me in the library and I could never understand how they could do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: What about your work in the library, what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Just play in library and work, I, I gave books out, I note, marked it and I got the books returned and if books were late I sent out a reminder, that was all.</span> <span id="s1059">Was not a very hard job.</span> <span id="s1060">And in the, in the, in book binding, it was interesting, I really learned book binding.</span> <span id="s1061">So if you have a book to bind, don’t bring it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Who was checking out books at the library?</span> <span id="s1063">Who was the library for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: The SS people.</span> <span id="s1065">That was the SS library.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: What sorts of books did the library have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1068">I didn’t read a single one.</span> <span id="s1069">I would assume, and just an assumption that this were all political books.</span> <span id="s1070">They wouldn’t have novels or anything of that kind.</span> <span id="s1071">My assumption.</span> <span id="s1072">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: But the prisoners were not allowed to check out any books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: No, no, we did not, the prisoners did not have a library.</span> <span id="s1075">So there, this would have been too much of a privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Were, who were the other people working in the library, were they all political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1078">One of them was this one Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1079">She was very beautiful, a blonde, a little bit dumpy, Jewish girl and she stayed dumpy because she got a lot of food from the outside.</span> <span id="s1080">I do not remember anybody else.</span> <span id="s1081">I think Helena Pottetts(ph) came sometime, as kind of an overseer, checking whether everything is okay.</span> <span id="s1082">But not for us, for them.</span> <span id="s1083">‘Kay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: And then, was the work in the book bindery a separate job where you transferred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s1086">Book binding was together a, it was a separate job and the overseer of book binding was also a Fursorgerin and he help out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: She was leading the social work program of the camp.</span> <span id="s1089">That was all in one and she was a miserable, miserable thing.</span> <span id="s1090">Very tiny, very dried up with the, pardon me, with the hair around in, in, braids around her head, on the top of her head.</span> <span id="s1091">And she told us that she was in love with a Jewish man and he jilted her and she’s very happy that she didn’t marry him.</span> <span id="s1092">So you know what kind of a person she was.</span> <span id="s1093">She wrote, if people inquired how prisoners are, is, how is so and so and how is so and so.</span> <span id="s1094">I remember answering one letter for her.</span> <span id="s1095">I sometimes did typing there and I answered one letter, writing to the parents of a girl who was there.</span> <span id="s1096">She is okay, she’s very busy and she’s too lazy to write, but I’ll make her write.</span> <span id="s1097">That’s what I typed.</span> <span id="s1098">The, that girl was dying of TB, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Did you, did you know the girl personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: After I had sent the letter I wanted to tell her your parents inquired.</span> <span id="s1101">In fact I went to her, she was dying.</span> <span id="s1102">But, she was a very young kid, maybe 18 maybe 19.</span> <span id="s1103">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Did you have any contact with the outside world?</span> <span id="s1105">For example did you have any contact with Dr. Perl at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Oh yeah, I had a, I had a telegram going through Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1107">And one day I had a, a call that I have to come to the Kommandant to his office and when I came, he asked me, “Who is Mr. Lindpeutner?”</span> <span id="s1108">And I said, “Mr. Lindpeutner is a cousin of mine.”</span> <span id="s1109">“How come you have contact with America?”</span> <span id="s1110">“Well, he’s in love with me and he wants to marry me.”</span> <span id="s1111">That’s what the telegram said.</span> <span id="s1112">So he said, “Oh, and is he a Jew?”</span> <span id="s1113">I said, “No, how can Lindpeutner be a Jew?</span> <span id="s1114">Right?”</span> <span id="s1115">So he let me go and I knew that Willie knew where I was because the, I’m sure the Red Cross did tell him.</span> <span id="s1116">I had occasionally a letter from a friend of mine and that was about it.</span> <span id="s1117">I could write once, I think once a month, I do not remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: You mentioned that people were sending you food packages occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Who was it that was sending them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: There was one couple that, whose daughter I had tutored to get through school and they were always very fond of me and while I was in Vienna in prison still, they said they would help.</span> <span id="s1122">And he went with the Postal Service to Romania and to Hungary and so on.</span> <span id="s1123">And he got at those other countries, food.</span> <span id="s1124">That was really all that counted.</span> <span id="s1125">And they were one, that was one couple that send me food.</span> <span id="s1126">Then I had another friend, her husband was a painter and they were absolutely apolitical.</span> <span id="s1127">I, if I ever saw a person as apolitical as those two were, they were very much concerned with holistic medicine and, and, and all kinds of things . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: ____________ psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: And not, they were not interested in life per say.</span> <span id="s1130">So they also, she was a very lively person and she also, she went to this friend of mine who used to give me food for the transports.</span> <span id="s1131">She went to her and she got there food for me.</span> <span id="s1132">So that’s how I, those were the two people who send packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: And did those showers that you were allowed to take every week prevent you from getting lice at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yeah, sure, because you see when you are able to change your clothes, lice don’t grow and if you’re not too, in too close contacts, I mean a louse doesn’t grow on your body, you have to get one from somebody else, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So no one in that block one had lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1137">We were very, as I told you I was, through all that tragedy, I was always very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1138">For instance, when I was released, why was I released?</span> <span id="s1139">I had an uncle who worked in the Foreign Ministry and he was what you see in there, the grouch.</span> <span id="s1140">The picture.</span> <span id="s1141">That, that was he, pardon me.</span> <span id="s1142">He was one, he never became a Party member, never.</span> <span id="s1143">Being in the Foreign Ministry and not being a Party member, they were all scared of him because whatever it was, he found a hair in every soup.</span> <span id="s1144">And when he heard that I was arrested, he went to the Gestapo and he bothered the Gestapo day in, day out, saying, “I will . . .”</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: I’m lying comfortably __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: “I will, I will take her into my house and I’m sure she won’t do anything anymore against the government.”</span> <span id="s1147">I was called and I was told that he will vouch for me but I should live in his house.</span> <span id="s1148">I was very stupid and very stubborn because I didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s1149">I said, “Why should I go to him?</span> <span id="s1150">I have my own apartment, right?”</span> <span id="s1151">Well I was released anyhow, much earlier than was expected.</span> <span id="s1152">And after I came home, I didn’t even find the heart to tell him thank you.</span> <span id="s1153">Because I really thought that not he but his son-in-law who happened to be an SS man that he was the one who got me out.</span> <span id="s1154">I do not, I do not recall anymore how my release went.</span> <span id="s1155">I know that I was called in the morning End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: This is tape number three, side A of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lore Perl.</span> <span id="s1158">This is Arwen Donahue and Scott Miller is also with me doing this interview and it’s November 13th, 1996.</span> <span id="s1159">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: I told you when I was released how it went but I still remember I got kind of a ticket for the train.</span> <span id="s1161">I got a few marks and I got the bundle that I had brought to the camp.</span> <span id="s1162">And then I do not know how I went to the train, how I got to the train.</span> <span id="s1163">In any case, before I left one of the girls whispered to me, “If you are stuck in Berlin, call this and this number.</span> <span id="s1164">They will help you.”</span> <span id="s1165">So when I came to Berlin, it was nighttime and there was no place for me to go and I didn’t know really what to do.</span> <span id="s1166">I was at the station, there was no train the same night anymore.</span> <span id="s1167">An air raid was on.</span> <span id="s1168">I went to the shelter and when I sought my release from camp they said for people like you we don’t have a space in the shelter.</span> <span id="s1169">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: __________ an i.d.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1172">When I stood and while the bombs were falling around the station I stood in kind of __________ hoping that nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s1173">But all the time I was sure nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s1174">I hadn’t lived through camp and through all of this and now I should be killed by a Allied bomb, no.</span> <span id="s1175">That was just simply impossible for me.</span> <span id="s1176">And then I went to a telephone and I called the number that the girl had told me and the people told me, “Go and this and this railroad and we’ll pick you up.”</span> <span id="s1177">And they really did.</span> <span id="s1178">And I stayed there overnight and I had the first meal.</span> <span id="s1179">That was another thing that could have landed me right back again, right?</span> <span id="s1180">I did it anyhow.</span> <span id="s1181">So next day I went to the station and I got the train and of course the trains were constantly checked by SS and when an SS man came and saw my release from Ravensbruck he just looked at me and disgustedly gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s1182">Fine with me.</span> <span id="s1183">And then I arrived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1184">I do not remember anymore the how and when and what.</span> <span id="s1185">I just went to my apartment and there lo and behold in my apartment was an aunt and a cousin of mine because they had been bumped out and they had moved into my apartment with all their furniture.</span> <span id="s1186">So, the, everything was just stuck full and the second floor, two rooms were filled with furniture from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1187">Now, if I wanted one thing or I did not want one thing to live with women after I had been forced to live with so many women for so long a time.</span> <span id="s1188">So I moved up into the furniture.</span> <span id="s1189">Into the furniture rooms and left them down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: I just wanted to backtrack a bit and ask you how long all told, you were in Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: About a year and a half, about, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And when you, on the day that you were allowed to leave when you were hauled to the Commandant’s office, what were you thinking?</span> <span id="s1193">Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yeah, sure, because you never know.</span> <span id="s1195">You really never knew what will happen.</span> <span id="s1196">It was the second time within a short time.</span> <span id="s1197">The first time when his telegram came . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: What was in the telegram, I don’t remember the telegram?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Just longing to be united in marriage with you.</span> <span id="s1200">That was it.</span> <span id="s1201">Hans Lindpeutner</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Had you agreed on that name before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes, yes, because we had correspondent.</span> <span id="s1204">We did write to one another via the friend in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1205">He wrote to him, the friend put the letter into an envelope, send it to me and I did the same.</span> <span id="s1206">So I knew, I knew who Hans Lindpeutner was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Were any of your colleagues in the block one on transports out of Ravensbruck or was the population pretty stable while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Stable, pretty stable.</span> <span id="s1212">There were occasionally one or two new ones came in but usually it was, I can say only while I was there because after I was gone, I heard Rudy’s mother . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: She, people were sent out into ammunition factories to work and so on and they were mostly killed.</span> <span id="s1215">But those were also people from block one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: What were your thoughts about the future?</span> <span id="s1217">Did you still feel hopeful during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: I tell you one thing, after I came home, I was euphoric.</span> <span id="s1219">Then when the bombs fell all around, I hoped one would hit.</span> <span id="s1220">Then later on, I would question, why am I alive?</span> <span id="s1221">Why are all the others dead?</span> <span id="s1222">Why?</span> <span id="s1223">And it was very hard, so, the future, I knew really would come.</span> <span id="s1224">I always told my, as I told you before, always told my aunt, he’ll be here in May and she would say, “Ha!”</span> <span id="s1225">When May was over, she said, “He still didn’t come.”</span> <span id="s1226">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: When I came to pick her up she was all packed.</span> <span id="s1228">__________ packed, ready to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: There wasn’t very much to be packed because while I was gone and the Russians came near, my, the cousin who had moved into the house, she had taken all the clothes that was mine.</span> <span id="s1230">She had put it into suitcases and send it to, into the Burgenland [talkover] It’s a province of Austria.</span> <span id="s1231">And to, to a, a farm, a wine growers farm that was, that belonged to the people whose daughter I tutored and who sent packages.</span> <span id="s1232">She sent all the suitcases there, hoping that when I come back that I have something left.</span> <span id="s1233">Well what happened was, the Russians came via this village, they opened the suitcases and everything that was wearable they took out and the evening gowns and the afternoon gowns, this __________ way, I still have one afternoon gown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: I remember that you had your trunk ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes, but the trunk was ready with, with bedding and with linen [talkover] and so on.</span> <span id="s1236">And I, I still have [talkover] comforters, comforters.</span> <span id="s1237">So?</span> <span id="s1238">I still have comforters from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1239">You won’t believe it?</span> <span id="s1240">It is so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: May I ask why you had such a strong feeling of not liking your uncle that you would have preferred staying in Ravensbruck to going and living with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: He was a miserable __________.</span> <span id="s1243">He was just a miserable person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: He’s very stubborn.</span> <span id="s1245">__________ you wouldn’t expect it.</span> <span id="s1246">He’s very stubborn.</span> <span id="s1247">__________ and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1248">And nothing will change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: No, he was, he was just miserable.</span> <span id="s1250">I, listen, my aunt loved a dog.</span> <span id="s1251">He knew that she loved the dog so he killed the dog.</span> <span id="s1252">Is that miserable?</span> <span id="s1253">I, I just, I just did, there are very few people whom I do not like but I disliked him with a passion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: When I asked her once why she did it, she told me, “In everything, __________ I went in the concentration camp, I tried to keep my dignity.</span> <span id="s1255">It would have been undignified if I agree to stay with this man.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: I really disliked him so utterly, I would have given up everything I stood for, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: But they let you go anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: They let me go anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Do you have any idea why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: No.</span> <span id="s1261">Because I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1262">I told you, I was in all my life always very lucky, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1263">The house where I lived 56 bombs fell, all around.</span> <span id="s1264">The last bomb hit across the street and destroyed the house here.</span> <span id="s1265">All the windows were blown out . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Of your house, where you lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yeah, the roof was gone but a flowerpot stood on the window intact.</span> <span id="s1268">No?</span> <span id="s1269">Isn’t that a good sign?</span> <span id="s1270">And then Willie came.</span> <span id="s1271">Yeah, I started as, as I told you before I love children and everything was disorganized, the Russians came closer and there were no schools or nothing so I collected all the children in the neighborhood and went to a place that used to be before, the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1272">And I, I taught them and I spoke to them and we played.</span> <span id="s1273">I had them there.</span> <span id="s1274">And one day I got a phone call that a, the, the wife of a friend of his called.</span> <span id="s1275">Her father had died and I should provide a casket else he would go into a mass grave.</span> <span id="s1276">People always came to me if they needed something.</span> <span id="s1277">So I, I knew a carpenter so I went to the carpenter but not right away.</span> <span id="s1278">I went down the hill in order to go the carpenter.</span> <span id="s1279">When I went down the hill I saw a jeep passing me, a jeep held in front of the house.</span> <span id="s1280">And a man got out and I said, “Those damned Russians,” only Russians were in Vienna at that time.</span> <span id="s1281">And Muti Teichman’s son said, “Uh-uh, those are a British or Americans, Lore, those are not Russians [talkover].”</span> <span id="s1282">I said, “British or Americans, that’s Willie.”</span> <span id="s1283">And I started running.</span> <span id="s1284">It was Willie, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: You were _______________, how we met in the operation action _______________ in detail, how I got her out.</span> <span id="s1286">I still have this passport, _______________ provided for the Russian who let me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: But . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: And then you know, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Oh, before we go, I, I think it’s, it would be very interesting to hear how you got out of Vienna but I wondered how you came back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1290">You had nothing, you were coming back to a place that had really been destroyed.</span> <span id="s1291">How did you manage and on top of managing organize these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Well, there are certain things, you cannot say I will do this.</span> <span id="s1293">You see there are children on the street, there you see that the children are scared.</span> <span id="s1294">You see that the children need some kind of direction that there is nobody here so you just say come, come with me and we will play together.</span> <span id="s1295">It worked.</span> <span id="s1296">Somehow I was also able always to get a piece of candy or a cookie or something.</span> <span id="s1297">It helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: How did you get food for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1300">I remember that the cousin who lived in my apartment did give all my records, I had a record collection, to an SS man and she got a big shopping bag full of sugar.</span> <span id="s1301">That was one way.</span> <span id="s1302">So you bought it.</span> <span id="s1303">I went with Muti Teichman into the countryside to get some flour and some butter or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1304">We bartered clothes, whatever we had and survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: And you went to this, to the SS _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1307">That was not SS.</span> <span id="s1308">The, there was, I don’t know, we should turn it off.</span> <span id="s1309">You ask me what we lived from.</span> <span id="s1310">Very, very frugal but one day when, after the SS had left and the Russians came close, we went to the pig farm and everybody was there, trying to get a pig and everybody who never had slaughtered a pig slaughtered the pigs.</span> <span id="s1311">So a, this neighbor of ours who send me packages to, to the camp, he also had gone up there and he brought home a pig and he slaughtered it.</span> <span id="s1312">And of, from the meat and the fat that we got from that pig, we lived a long time.</span> <span id="s1313">Besides this, there were bread that was rationed.</span> <span id="s1314">Every now and then, you could get, if you stood in line very early in the morning, you could get bread and it wasn’t very much but you had your ration and it help for the, for week maybe, if you really were very careful.</span> <span id="s1315">So we, we lived very frugal.</span> <span id="s1316">Maybe you cannot even call it living.</span> <span id="s1317">But we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Do you remember when the Russians entered Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s1320">Day and night we heard this, I do not know how it’s called in, in Vienna it was called the Russian Organ(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: The Italian(ph) Organ(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: No, the Russian organ(ph), the _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: And it was going constantly, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.</span> <span id="s1325">And this came closer and closer and we had SS in our house and they were duck in the garden and what the bombs didn’t destroy, they destroyed with their shooting.</span> <span id="s1326">And one night, you heard only [sound of footsteps], the SS had run.</span> <span id="s1327">Oh they first came to us into the basement whether we would like to go and with them.</span> <span id="s1328">And I remember I said, “If I die, I don’t want to die on the roadside, I die rather here.”</span> <span id="s1329">And then in the morning all was quiet and the Russians came down the street.</span> <span id="s1330">And there was a delegation of people who were very happy that the Russians came.</span> <span id="s1331">One of them was Helena Pottsett’s(ph) father.</span> <span id="s1332">And he greeted the Russians with open arms and the Russians were very happy to see them and they took everything they had off them.</span> <span id="s1333">The rings, the watches, everything.</span> <span id="s1334">So Helena Pottsett’s(ph) father was then no Communist anymore.</span> <span id="s1335">And we had next to the house a little park and this is where some of them settled down.</span> <span id="s1336">And I remember that, the saying, now Germany kaput.</span> <span id="s1337">Then Amerika kaputt.</span> <span id="s1338">Fortunately, they were not right.</span> <span id="s1339">Germany was kaput but they couldn’t get America kaput.</span> <span id="s1340">And well, the rest I told you.</span> <span id="s1341">How I came to Willie and how I had everything packed, the story about how we met in front of the door you have in, in the book to read and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Did you tell anyone after the war had ended that you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1344">We could.</span> <span id="s1345">Now nobody could arrest us anymore, right?</span> <span id="s1346">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Did anyone suspect it?</span> <span id="s1348">Did anyone react?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1350">No, they just thought he’s my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1351">In fact it was so much that he’s my boyfriend that my cousin had, what she ever had left in jewelry, she gave, gave to me and said, “Here, in case Willie should change his mind and leave you.”</span> <span id="s1352">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: The Russians didn’t behave well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: No, the Russians behaved very poorly but they were an occupying force.</span> <span id="s1355">Those were the, the front troops.</span> <span id="s1356">I guess you cannot expect anybody else, why should the Russians behave better than anybody else, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: They raped the women by the dozens, by the hundreds . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah, we, my cousin who lived in the apartment together now with me, she and I we slept for two weeks in the hospital for mentally ill that I told you a, a friend of ours was the head nurse.</span> <span id="s1359">We slept there on benches because the Russians would . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: At this point in, in 1945, did you, had you realized what had happened to the Jews of Europe as a whole?</span> <span id="s1363">Had you, at what point did you realize the full story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I tell you, while I was in camp, we were pretty much isolated.</span> <span id="s1365">We didn’t know very much.</span> <span id="s1366">When I came out, it was more or less a question of day to day surviving.</span> <span id="s1367">I do not think that then I did realize what happened.</span> <span id="s1368">Only when Willie came.</span> <span id="s1369">Then, and we talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: And he told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: And he told me, then did I realize what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: _______________ a little piece of margarine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Now, once a week I got in Ravensbruck a little piece of margarine.</span> <span id="s1374">Now I knew he was in America and I knew American women are beautiful.</span> <span id="s1375">I didn’t have any skin cream so what do you do with the margarine?</span> <span id="s1376">You put it on your face so in order not to get wrinkles.</span> <span id="s1377">Today I laugh about it but it really wasn’t a laughing matter.</span> <span id="s1378">So.</span> <span id="s1379">Now I have told you all my secrets.</span> <span id="s1380">When Willie came then, we, I got into the jeep and we went with the jeep with a Russian soldier that they had given him to accompany him and with a sergeant whom we called Red who by the way was here a few months ago visiting with his wife.</span> <span id="s1381">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: And his name used to be__________ but he changed it now and he’s Franklin, __________ in New York, __________ and he for himself wrote for some magazine the story of how we’re going to Vienna and my __________ and it is the same with the exception of a few details which I don’t remember anymore as mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: So we went back and the trip back was something like going into a fairy tale.</span> <span id="s1384">The roads were not roads.</span> <span id="s1385">They had big bump holes and we, we had to go around and around the riverbeds, no bridges there.</span> <span id="s1386">And towards us came those little Russian wagons with those little Russian horses and on top were women sitting with fantastic head draped into drapes that they had taken, that they had looted and it was such a, a unbelievable, colorful picture that you cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s1387">And I remember that once we had lost the way and a truck came towards us and the Russian asked the truck, we had lost the way, how to go and the Russian told him.</span> <span id="s1388">And by the way, he showed him, look, how many watches he had.</span> <span id="s1389">He had . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: __________ “I have a watch,” he told you.</span> <span id="s1391">“ __________ the watch.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: And that’s the, the truck driver said, “Look here.”</span> <span id="s1393">And he had watches up to his elbow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: __________ few people in each village had their watch.</span> <span id="s1395">__________ watch for me.</span> <span id="s1396">When I left for, to pick up Lore, I __________.</span> <span id="s1397">__________ couple of watches from the PX.</span> <span id="s1398">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: I think we got this on, on your interview.</span> <span id="s1400">I think we got that information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1402">[talkover] _______________ he showed this proudly to this Russian truck driver who showed us the way, we always, we got lost and the Russian said, “Look,” the whole arm full of watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: So.</span> <span id="s1404">And then we came to the first American station and Willie was very happy now, I will get a good meal.</span> <span id="s1405">Couldn’t hold it.</span> <span id="s1406">Not even the coffee and there were, all the toilets were only for men so he chased everybody out, he stood in front and if somebody wanted to go in he said, “Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s1407">My wife is in there.”</span> <span id="s1408">And they wondered, a wife?</span> <span id="s1409">But it, it worked.</span> <span id="s1410">Then we came to, back to the station and he drove me then to Bottnow-hime(ph) where I stayed in the hospital for three or four months.</span> <span id="s1411">And, and then everything, from then on everything went smooth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Were you very ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1414">I had angina acquired and I was physically all the way down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: And after how long, it wasn’t so long afterwards that you became pregnant, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Yeah, about from June until March.</span> <span id="s1417">So, I wanted a child very badly.</span> <span id="s1418">We had lost so much time, so, it turned out fine.</span> <span id="s1419">And now he, we have two grandchildren from him, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: And you knew at this, at this point you were going settle in the United States, you knew you weren’t going stay in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: No we did not know where.</span> <span id="s1422">We had a very, very funny decision made.</span> <span id="s1423">On the way over here [talkover], I was, I was on a bride ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: I had managed to be in control of this or something on this bride ship.</span> <span id="s1425">_______________</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: I, so, we looked at, at a magazine and we saw a Peter, a Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon.</span> <span id="s1427">There, there was a woman, one of those women standing on the podium and saying to secretary down there and now you send this resolution to Marshall Tito(ph) so he should know where, what the women of Mamal(ph) think about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: So he said, “_______________, let’s look it up.”</span> <span id="s1430">And you know what, we bought a house in Mamal(ph) when we came back.</span> <span id="s1431">A Peter Arnoo(ph) cartoon, see?</span> <span id="s1432">You never know what influences your life.</span> <span id="s1433">And I remember when I had Rafael(ph), he was a baby, and Willie went out into the country to look for houses and he came and he said, “I found the house that, that I, you will like.”</span> <span id="s1434">Because I always said I want soft ground under my feet.</span> <span id="s1435">I don’t want to live in the city.</span> <span id="s1436">And I ask him, “What’s, how’s the house?”</span> <span id="s1437">And he says, “It has a beautiful garden.”</span> <span id="s1438">That was all he knew about the house.</span> <span id="s1439">But we bought the house anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: You . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: It, it had to be a __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: So you knew you didn’t want to stay in Europe to try to rebuild your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: __________ suburb of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: No, Europe was completely out for me.</span> <span id="s1446">I could, I couldn’t even, when after years we went back and we picked up our car in Lugano, and drove back with the car towards Austria, close to the Austrian border Solomon had to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Rafael(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: No, Solomon had to go to the bathroom and I threw all the papers that I had on my lap, I threw them out.</span> <span id="s1449">And when we came to the border, we didn’t have a passport, we didn’t have car papers, we didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1450">That’s how much I hated to go back.</span> <span id="s1451">I didn’t throw it up, out on purpose and I, but I remember then where it must have happened and we found the papers.</span> <span id="s1452">We went back.</span> <span id="s1453">They were still lying there.</span> <span id="s1454">But that’s how I felt about Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: What had become of most of your Jewish friends from before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: With some of them, I had still contact.</span> <span id="s1457">Come when they were in America but most of them, unfortunately were killed.</span> <span id="s1458">Most of them.</span> <span id="s1459">One was in, in London, I do not recall anybody else.</span> <span id="s1460">His family of course, they were all in America but, and this one friend I was really close to, she came also to America and I had contact with her.</span> <span id="s1461">And that’s about it, I do not know anything of anybody who was close to me in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1462">It’s sad but things were so, in such a tumult that from one day to the other, you didn’t know what would happen.</span> <span id="s1463">And you just lost contact and I think with the other people, it was just the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Did your feelings about faith, particularly the Jewish faith grow over the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: I tell you something.</span> <span id="s1466">I always believed in God and God is everywhere so give it any kind of stamp.</span> <span id="s1467">It’s God.</span> <span id="s1468">And I really believe that God was not only during all that time with us, that God is with us all the time.</span> <span id="s1469">I really believe that.</span> <span id="s1470">That, and somehow, sometimes I feel that it’s like an, pardon me, like an umbrella above us so that really nothing can hit us and I always tell it to the children.</span> <span id="s1471">They, so that they should feel the same way.</span> <span id="s1472">I think that the Jewish religion in, in comparison with the Catholic religion has so much more positive.</span> <span id="s1473">The Catholic religion has so many restrictions which the Jewish religion doesn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Such as.</span> <span id="s1476">You can talk to God, you don’t need an, a mediary.</span> <span id="s1477">You can, you can even scold God if you feel like it, right?</span> <span id="s1478">You are not forced to do this and this, this.</span> <span id="s1479">There are certain restrictions in the Jewish religions too and you have to obey certain, certain laws but it’s not as harsh as the, as the Catholic religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Did you have any struggle in accepting God’s, [talkover] God’s role perhaps in the, in the existence of the Holocaust __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1482">And I, I, I always if something bad happens, I remember my father saying, “Where was God when the soldiers were dying?”</span> <span id="s1483">Where was God when all this happen in, in, in Auschwitz and everywhere?</span> <span id="s1484">Where was God?</span> <span id="s1485">And I have talked to our rabbi about it and he said, “I do not know where he was but it was for the good of the Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s1486">What good can this do to the Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1487">You learn, can’t you learn differently only so misery of others?</span> <span id="s1488">You have to accept certain things and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Have you found any answers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: I haven’t found any answers.</span> <span id="s1491">If the rabbi doesn’t find an answer, we have talked through this many, many evenings, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Tape number three [talkover], side B, [talkover] tape number three, side B of an interview with Mrs. Lore Perl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: One thing that she always tells me she appreciates in the Jewish religion is that it counts what you do not what you feel.</span> <span id="s1494">What you believe.</span> <span id="s1495">You can believe and listen to __________, you feel this but what you do is the final decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1497">Now you see, if, I think that both of us and also our children have accepted my conversion.</span> <span id="s1498">I didn’t tell you when I came to America, in order to make it really completely prove and secure I went through another conversion with dipping in the, in the mikvah and cutting the lace and cutting the hair, I did that all over again, so.</span> <span id="s1499">In order to make it foolproof.</span> <span id="s1500">That’s, that sound all very odd to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: After the war, did you consider at all going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1505">Yes.</span> <span id="s1506">We both did but there was a price on Bill’s head and he couldn’t go back to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Price by who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: By the British.</span> <span id="s1509">The British had put a price on his head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Thousand pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Thousand pounds he was worth, see?</span> <span id="s1512">And there, there was simply no way we could have gone there.</span> <span id="s1513">We even considered later when Rafael(ph) our older son, was twelve years.</span> <span id="s1514">He wanted very badly to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1515">We were in Israel [talkover].</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: The state of Israel exist . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: We could have gone by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1520">And we went there for the first Yom Ha-Atzmaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: It’s really Independence Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1523">And Rafael(ph) was so enamored with Israel.</span> <span id="s1524">He begged, “Let’s us, let us stay here, let us stay here.”</span> <span id="s1525">And, but Willie had a job here, we had an existence here.</span> <span id="s1526">In Israel we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1527">So we went back.</span> <span id="s1528">And now our oldest son married an Israeli and he intends to go back to Israel when he retires.</span> <span id="s1529">He even bought some property there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: This is Solomon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Rafael(ph).</span> <span id="s1532">Say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: His children are being brought up in __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: His children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: His children are being brought up in ____________.</span> <span id="s1536">____________.</span> <span id="s1537">Twice a year they go to Israel, early in the, the spring and in, in the fall.</span> <span id="s1538">And he, when he retires, he’s in the federal service, he’s going to retire to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: So.</span> <span id="s1540">I do not know whether we did things wrong, whether we did them right.</span> <span id="s1541">I think we did the best we could, both of us.</span> <span id="s1542">And that’s all you can ask of anybody.</span> <span id="s1543">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Jewish is when we came back from Israel, she always tried to persuade me to walk to the synagogue regularly because she had the idea from the Catholic school that you have to go to church every week.</span> <span id="s1545">And I didn’t want to, to the synagogue every day or every week.</span> <span id="s1546">So she dissatisfied with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: No, that I appreciate that you came.</span> <span id="s1550">I appreciate it very, very much.</span> <span id="s1551">It’s your time and it’s not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s1552">Mostly not a very pleasant experience to listen to other people’s misfortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Well we thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: This concludes the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum [talkover] interview with Mrs. Perl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0447 PAGE 31</span></p></body></html>
