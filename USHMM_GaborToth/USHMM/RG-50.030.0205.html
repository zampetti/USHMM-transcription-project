but I would call ourselves traditional Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">When the war broke out, uh, I was eighteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Let's talk a little bit more before the war.</span> <span id="s28">I want to know something.</span> <span id="s29">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Tell me about...what was Lódz like, pre-Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, Lódz was a industrial city, about the second largest city in Poland.</span> <span id="s32">It was...it had a large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s33">I'd say about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Jews used to live in Poland [NB: in Lódz].</span> <span id="s34">Uh, most of the Jews were concentrated in uh...in one area.</span> <span id="s35">It was voluntarily, because they...they like just to live....</span> <span id="s36">It was just, I would call it, a voluntary ghetto; because they like to, to stick to each other.</span> <span id="s37">They...they had a cultural life.</span> <span id="s38">There were three Jewish theaters, three daily newspapers.</span> <span id="s39">It was a publishing house.</span> <span id="s40">It was Jewish schools, which I attended one of them.</span> <span id="s41">It was also a very active religious life and a political life.</span> <span id="s42">Uh, it was swarming with the unions and, uh, political parties.</span> <span id="s43">It was really a bustling Jewish life, in the city of Lódz.</span> <span id="s44">A lot...most of the Jews were in textile industry.</span> <span id="s45">Uh, many of them, uh, used to take out work from the factories, and they did it at home; and by the end of the week they'd put it back together and they'd send it in.</span> <span id="s46">It was those...uh weavers, hand weavers, mostly.</span> <span id="s47">It was a large industry in...in Poland.</span> <span id="s48">After I finished school, you know, for a Jewish young kid, it was uh....</span> <span id="s49">In, in our class, I could not afford any higher education.</span> <span id="s50">I went to learn a trade, as an apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">What...[some (ph)] went as weavers, tailors, shoemakers.</span> <span id="s52">Well, I choose to be a tailor; and for a few years I worked as an apprentice even without getting paid.</span> <span id="s53">Just for the benefit to learn the trade.</span> <span id="s54">And later on, I start to make a little money.</span> <span id="s55">And then come the war.</span> <span id="s56">War broke out, I was about eighteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s58">Tell me what happened the day the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Well, I remember...to, to talk about the outbreak of war, we have to go back a..</span> <span id="s60">.</span> <span id="s61">a few weeks before.</span> <span id="s62">It was a war situation--like a war fever.</span> <span id="s63">We felt in our bones that war, war is coming.</span> <span id="s64">They dig trenches.</span> <span id="s65">They took away the young people to the...to the army; and we, we knew for sure that war is going to break out any...any day.</span> <span id="s66">We were preparing for war.</span> <span id="s67">We know.</span> <span id="s68">It's nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s69">We uh...we heard in the radio--for example, in our building it was two radios, and people were getting together to listen to the news.</span> <span id="s70">It was not like uh we know today, that every family has a radio or TV.</span> <span id="s71">It was one radio in a building, and it was enough.</span> <span id="s72">This, this was our contact with the world; and we heard the the speeches from...from Hitler.</span> <span id="s73">We, we heard the...the speeches from Polish officials, and we know that any day we're going to be in the war.</span> <span id="s74">And sure enough...I remember like today.</span> <span id="s75">It was Friday morning, September the 1st.</span> <span id="s76">We heard that this is war.</span> <span id="s77">And uh the same day we, we, we heard German planes already; and three days later--it was the 3rd of September--it came uh an order over the radio that all young people should move, get away in...towards Warsaw, to the east.</span> <span id="s78">Because the Germans are approaching, they will need us to go into the army.</span> <span id="s79">And we, we...we packed our few things and we left.</span> <span id="s80">I left my mother and...and my sister behind; and uh the men--even my, mine ten year old brother--what also we were going to...towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s81">Like the order said.</span> <span id="s82">We found out later that this was a German provocation.</span> <span id="s83">The...the voice on the radio was not from the Polish government.</span> <span id="s84">It was from the German government, actually.</span> <span id="s85">Uh the Germans made...tricked us; and they want to jam the roads so the Polish Army would have difficulties to move.</span> <span id="s86">And sure enough...when we came on the road, we saw what's happened.</span> <span id="s87">The, the vehicles couldn't move.</span> <span id="s88">The the the the the troops couldn't move.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Everything, every road was jammed with refugees, with people going towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s90">On the way--it was not far away from Lódz, just uh several kilometers--German planes start to bomb us.</span> <span id="s91">We...and many of those refugees were killed, right there on the fields.</span> <span id="s92">In a little town near... outside Lódz, [Bierzyn (ph)], it was like one huge cemetery... refugees [ (ph)] laying all over the fields--uh, injured, dead.</span> <span id="s93">And this was our first day actually that we experienced the war.</span> <span id="s94">And uh whatever we took with us, uh we had just enough food for a day or so.</span> <span id="s95">Soon we found out, little by little, actually there is no sense of running anymore; because with the German planes controlled the roads.</span> <span id="s96">They controlled the skies.</span> <span id="s97">It was no defense whatsoever.</span> <span id="s98">Even the Polish army was disorganized.</span> <span id="s99">They could not understand where they had...they lost communication with each other, and we decided--uh, I mean, me, my...my brother, my father--that there's no point in running.</span> <span id="s100">Maybe we should return back to Lódz, to...to our family, to the mother that we....</span> <span id="s101">And after another day, uh we decided there's no point in in running any longer.</span> <span id="s102">And we started to...to go back.</span> <span id="s103">On the way back, we met already the...the Polish Army like uh uh...like they would quit.</span> <span id="s104">There's no point.</span> <span id="s105">And we came back...this was, uh...we came back by Friday.</span> <span id="s106">It was...actually it was a Fri..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">the following Friday.</span> <span id="s109">After a week, we came back to Lódz.</span> <span id="s110">And the same uh evening, the German, uh, patrols already came into the city; and it was a Saturday when they marched in... into...to the city of Lódz.</span> <span id="s111">At that day, we all stood and watched.</span> <span id="s112">Lódz also had a large German ethnic population, and immediately they came out and start to throw flowers and candy at them, to welcome them, finally, uh...like they would be liberated by the German army.</span> <span id="s113">For us Jews, the nightmare started that day; because, uh, here and there we saw already Jewish people were beating [NB: beaten] up.</span> <span id="s114">And uh even our Polish neighbors took advantage of the, you know, the long antisemitic feeling.</span> <span id="s115">They had a chance now to display, because nobody would protect any Jew anymore.</span> <span id="s116">And uh, religious Jews were caught in the street, and beards were shaved off.</span> <span id="s117">Uh, some beards were teared out from the faces, to the point that blood came out.</span> <span id="s118">And Jews were caught in the street like uh dogs, and taken to work uh in doing all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s119">Every German had the right to do this.</span> <span id="s120">The civilian German population, the ethnic Germans, uh immediately they...they took out of the swastika armbands and they put on; and they became the masters of the street.</span> <span id="s121">Uh Jews used to own in business.</span> <span id="s122">They...everything was closed.</span> <span id="s123">And uh they they also threw out Jews from homes, better looking homes.</span> <span id="s124">Immediately every German had the right to do this.</span> <span id="s125">He just came in and said, "Get out!"</span> <span id="s126">And they took over and it...all the rights were taken away immediately, the first day the German troops entered the city of Lódz.</span> <span id="s127">A Jew had no right whatsoever.</span> <span id="s128">And uh at...by us, we...after a few weeks uh official Germans ca...officers, they came into our home, to our...even to the apartment, the big apartment building that we lived.</span> <span id="s129">And they gave us five minutes to leave the house, to leave our apartment; and my mother said, "Where should we go?"</span> <span id="s130">He said, "You should...." It seems that he understood that question.</span> <span id="s131">Uh he said, "I would suggest that you go to Ba_uty."</span> <span id="s132">Ba_uty was a..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">a section, a very poor, it were the slum section of the city of Lódz.</span> <span id="s135">He visualized that this is going to be the area for Jews to live, where Jews would be forced to live.</span> <span id="s136">Uh so my mother start packing.</span> <span id="s137">He said, "You don't have to pack.</span> <span id="s138">You just take uh the...your, your coat, and you...you take just the bread, the food that you have.</span> <span id="s139">And you leave the house.</span> <span id="s140">Otherwise you will be thrown out."</span> <span id="s141">So my mother said, "But uh we...we have a family.</span> <span id="s142">I have to take a few things.</span> <span id="s143">My little kid, you know, he'll needs clothes."</span> <span id="s144">He said, "Well, if you stay and talking, what there's now you got only three minutes time."</span> <span id="s145">So my mother run to the...to the...to the closet, you know, and she start uh to pack.</span> <span id="s146">And then he saw that there was a fur coat.</span> <span id="s147">He said, "No, this you're going to leave."</span> <span id="s148">He didn't let her take.</span> <span id="s149">So we took just a few things.</span> <span id="s150">My father took uh a box of tools; so he went over and checked the box of the tools, and see if there is not anything uh is not hidden under there.</span> <span id="s151">And so when we were about to leave the house...you see, my mother stood there by the...by the door and looked around our apartment.</span> <span id="s152">And then he said that she should take off the pearls that she wore.</span> <span id="s153">So she took off the pearls and throwed away on the floor.</span> <span id="s154">And then he made her pick it up from the floor and put it on the table; so she took the...the pearls from the floor and just throw it on the table.</span> <span id="s155">And we walked out from our house, and here we stay on the street with no place where to go.</span> <span id="s156">So we start walking to Ba_uty, to that section.</span> <span id="s157">And there already was some kind of Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s158">They call it the [Geminde (ph)], the [Gemeinde (ph)]; and they took all the refugees from--because they knew that building are coming to the ghetto--and they gave us some kind of a shelter.</span> <span id="s159">And we did get an apartment through the Jewish Council in that, in that section.</span> <span id="s160">We did get another apartment.</span> <span id="s161">It was a one- room...we did not have a big apartment before.</span> <span id="s162">It was two, two rooms and a kitchen; but here we got one room apartment.</span> <span id="s163">And please, we were so lucky.</span> <span id="s164">Everybody envied us that we still had a roof over our head.</span> <span id="s165">And we start...we made that home; and later on, a few months later, this was the official section for Jews to live.</span> <span id="s166">It was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s167">And Jews were ordered from all of the sections in in the in the part of the town where we used to live, to leave.</span> <span id="s168">When we...we were a regular...thrown out actually from one building; but then all the Jews in the city were ordered to leave.</span> <span id="s169">And it was like an exodus, you know--like another war, where you could see through the city to the, to the...to the streets, storming people with their belongings, whole families.</span> <span id="s170">They took carriages and make uh little wagons.</span> <span id="s171">They took everything they could and load it up on those uh carriages and wagons, and it's on backs; and they stormed into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s172">And that's how the ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s173">It was a very small part of town, mostly slums.</span> <span id="s174">And that's how a hundred and seventy-five thousand people were crowded in, in that uh....</span> <span id="s175">Rooms had to be shared for families.</span> <span id="s176">We, we were fortunate enough to have our own apartment.</span> <span id="s177">We didn't have to share with nobody.</span> <span id="s178">It was that time uh...my, my father--I forgot to tell you- -my father at that time took some of the belongings and...and went to a small town where his his sister lived and....</span> <span id="s179">Just to put it away there.</span> <span id="s180">And by that time the ghetto was closed, and you could not come back; and he was separated from us all through the war and we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s181">Uh my brother decided, one brother of mine that's younger, decided that uh he will try his luck and go to that part of Russia...that Russia occupied, a city by the name of "Bia_ystok."</span> <span id="s182">Well, actually he told me to come with him.</span> <span id="s183">So I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s184">My father was gone.</span> <span id="s185">And he...he went away because he had arrangement with some friends; and he tried to stay in Bia_ystok.</span> <span id="s186">Now there was my mother, and a kid brother only ten years old, and...and my sister.</span> <span id="s187">I just did not have the heart to leave them.</span> <span id="s188">And I decided to stay in the ghetto with them.</span> <span id="s189">And by May the 1st,the ghetto was...was closed.</span> <span id="s190">And was like...like a big prison, barbed wires around, armed guards every few feet.</span> <span id="s191">And this was our...our life, that time--1940.</span> <span id="s192">How did we live?</span> <span id="s193">Everybody still had some, you know, money.</span> <span id="s194">And there is, there was some food to buy here and there.</span> <span id="s195">But we could see the writing on the wall, what's going to happen next month, and a month later.</span> <span id="s196">The Jewish Council that was formed came up with an idea that we should organize shops and work; and this was the... the plan that the the elders of the ghetto uh came up to the German peo...to the German authorities: that we have tremendous resources in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s197">We got shoemakers--experts.</span> <span id="s198">We got tailors.</span> <span id="s199">We got weavers.</span> <span id="s200">We got such good craftsmen that maybe we can interest German industrialists to use, to make use out of those talents.</span> <span id="s201">And they did, for their...for their own reason.</span> <span id="s202">This, for them...a chance to have a big bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s203">They wouldn't have to go to the Front.</span> <span id="s204">They employed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s205">It's still better to guard Jews than to go to the Front.</span> <span id="s206">And uh and this was going on for...until 1944.</span> <span id="s207">But conditions were worsening with every month, because it was less and less and less food.</span> <span id="s208">You see, we understood that the German people...the whole ghetto was designed, actually, to starve the people out.</span> <span id="s209">Uh if the if the war would last another 1 According to Hilberg, the order to close the ghetto was issued May 10, 1940.</span> <span id="s210">See Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, vol.</span> <span id="s211">1, p. 223.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">ten years, they would liquidate the entire ghetto without firing one shot; because the statistics showed that every month more people died and died.</span> <span id="s213">Uh from families that used to be five people, there are only three; because people were dying out...and getting sicker...and getting smaller.</span> <span id="s214">And we could see they emaciated up to nothing.</span> <span id="s215">People start to look like skeletons.</span> <span id="s216">And it came to a point that people couldn't even work; and the work was (cough) compulsory.</span> <span id="s217">We have to go work.</span> <span id="s218">If you miss a day of work, you get less food; because the, the, the place of work provided one soup a day.</span> <span id="s219">So if you didn't go to work, you get one soup less.</span> <span id="s220">You have to just make with that little food that you got from the monthly rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Leo, tell...tell me about a day in your life.</span> <span id="s222">What was it like for Leo Schneiderman?</span> <span id="s223">A: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Tell me what you did, and what your family did?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: OK.</span> <span id="s226">When we get up in the morning, all four of us, we had to prepare for work.</span> <span id="s227">I start off with...with my mother.</span> <span id="s228">My mother worked at a..</span> <span id="s229">.</span> <span id="s230">at the place where they used to, to, to... fuel, to distribute the fuel for the house.</span> <span id="s231">Coal.</span> <span id="s232">It's a.... So she had to go to work in order to get that pot of soup.</span> <span id="s233">My sister went to work in a..</span> <span id="s234">.</span> <span id="s235">in a..</span> <span id="s236">.</span> <span id="s237">a place where they used to make shoes out of straw; used for the German army on the front, so when they stood guard they shouldn't freeze their feet.</span> <span id="s238">So those big shoes she used to make out of straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">My little brother worked in uh one of the tailor shops, in the office; he was a runner.</span> <span id="s240">And I went to work as a tailor in the factory for uniforms.</span> <span id="s241">When we came to work in the morning, we start...we started uh by...by the machines, of course, and we were making the German uniforms.</span> <span id="s242">But uh the minute I sat down, un...until we finish, that's all it was in my mind at that time is twelve o'clock when we will go, we'll have a break and we'll get something to eat.</span> <span id="s243">Because I was constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s244">The...the hunger didn't leave me, because the little food that we had at home uh in, in the morning--it was one piece of bread that I ate in the morning, and the se...the other piece I took with me to have it in the shop.</span> <span id="s245">And I..</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">I kept it in my pocket, or I kept it in in the pot that I took with me for the...for the soup.</span> <span id="s248">Everybody had a little pot with them.</span> <span id="s249">And we could not wait; and this was everybody.</span> <span id="s250">The whole day, it was in my mind.</span> <span id="s251">In the meantime, work has to be done.</span> <span id="s252">It was strictly controlled.</span> <span id="s253">And twelve o'clock, the minute we have the break we have to... everybody was running for the soup.</span> <span id="s254">This was the major event in the...in the day.</span> <span id="s255">After work, we came home.</span> <span id="s256">Uh if it was summer, it was bearable.</span> <span id="s257">In the wintertime, it was no fuel.</span> <span id="s258">It was cold.</span> <span id="s259">Uh, most of the furniture was gone already because we break, broke it up and burned it just to keep warm.</span> <span id="s260">And the minute we were ready with that little supper that we had from the...we, we finished it all together.</span> <span id="s261">And then we went to bed, to...even just to keep warm.</span> <span id="s262">Uh, and this...when it...most of the time uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in bed.</span> <span id="s263">The summertime, when it was warm, we used to go out.</span> <span id="s264">We also had to go to stay in line for the rations to...to get.</span> <span id="s265">And sometimes uh the staying in line meant hours.</span> <span id="s266">And me being the...the man of the house, it was up to me; because I would not have my mother standing in line, or my sister or my little brother, but it...it was up to me to...to bring in the food from the rations.</span> <span id="s267">And uh it was very little left for social life.</span> <span id="s268">Me being eighteen, nineteen year old--for some people this is the golden age.</span> <span id="s269">Uh, I spent my eighteen and nineteen and twenty years in...in the ghetto of Lódz.</span> <span id="s270">Always hungry, always tired, uh overworked, and with no hope for the...for the future.</span> <span id="s271">I didn't see any hope.</span> <span id="s272">Later, after a few years, I got involved in...in, in some educational project.</span> <span id="s273">We started to...to write.</span> <span id="s274">I particular was interested in writing something about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s275">And I developed some... people say that I did develop some talent for poetry, which later on it was used by some Jewish dramatists like [Jonah Stogow (ph)].</span> <span id="s276">I was also at one time involved in teaching Yiddish, because I was a student of the Yiddish school in...in Lódz, of the [Medem (ph)] school.</span> <span id="s277">And we taught.</span> <span id="s278">It was...this was illegal.</span> <span id="s279">It was not allowed to teach.</span> <span id="s280">My students were not the children, actually.</span> <span id="s281">It was young uh girls--uh, at the age of fifteen, sixteen-- who were interested in knowing, because before the war they went to Polish school and Yiddish was strange to them.</span> <span id="s282">In the ghetto, they got that chance.</span> <span id="s283">They considered this part of the social life; and also beneficially, because they learned a language.</span> <span id="s284">And to me, it was very rewarding, very satisfactory for a while.</span> <span id="s285">And for the...for a few years, actually, I did that kind of teaching in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You told me before about a particular man in the ghetto who was particularly cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Would you tell us about it and tell us the name you knew him by?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">Uh it was one German guard.</span> <span id="s290">He took some pleasure in abusing people physically.</span> <span id="s291">It was a part of the ghetto where you used to cross from one...from one side to the other, under guard.</span> <span id="s292">And this man many times stood there at those gates.</span> <span id="s293">And uh if he didn't like somebody, or he went too fast, or he didn't take off his hat in the right way, or he'd walked too slow, he went over to him (cough) and he punched him several times.</span> <span id="s294">And that's how (cough) he got the name of "The Boxer," because he used to box people.</span> <span id="s295">I looked at that man several times, and somehow he registered in mine brain.</span> <span id="s296">At one time-- it was in 1942, before that action that we used to call the "Sperre" [Translation: "Closing," "Closure" (Ger)], that we were ordered for eight days not to leave the house and they selected all the people that got too weak to work anymore.</span> <span id="s297">The children--it were illegal to have children in...in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s298">The sick, the olderly [NB: elderly], that they considered useless people.</span> <span id="s299">But that...before this action actually started, they...they...all of a sudden, they attacked the ghetto.</span> <span id="s300">They came in like a surprise, and they surrounded the hospital.</span> <span id="s301">And like wildfire the news spread that the Germans surrounded the hospital on Lagowniecka Street.</span> <span id="s302">Before the war, this used to be the ...the....also a "ambulance"--like social...social medicine station [NB: perhaps "ambulatorium" (Pol), an outpatient facility of a hospital].</span> <span id="s303">Kasa Chorych [NB: former National Health Service].</span> <span id="s304">And we run over there.</span> <span id="s305">It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that hospital; because he had an attack, they took him to that hospital.</span> <span id="s306">And when I heard, the first name that came to my mind, "Oh, my God, Jósek Feldman is in the hospital!"</span> <span id="s307">And I run over and stood there.</span> <span id="s308">I still had an hour before going to work, so I stood there for the hour and watched.</span> <span id="s309">What I saw, it's hard to describe, even.</span> <span id="s310">Wagons standing below the building, and nurses bringing out the patients and put them on the wagons.</span> <span id="s311">Uh some patients going on themselves; like uh I saw them, they're going to the wagon.</span> <span id="s312">And then I saw from the second floor, they opened the window and people were throwing out sick people into the wagons.</span> <span id="s313">And who is there conducting the whole operation?</span> <span id="s314">That "Boxer"!</span> <span id="s315">Well, after the war at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me, that the the....</span> <span id="s316">It was to the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that "Boxer."</span> <span id="s317">Of course, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in Chicago and I was told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...in that day.</span> <span id="s318">I said, "I certainly do."</span> <span id="s319">I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to Germany and I testified against that "Boxer," which I found out that his real name is "Krisom" because that's how they referred to him, "Herr Krisom."</span> <span id="s320">And I was asked by the prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that hospital, what's happened in that...in that day.</span> <span id="s321">Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I know for sure that the people were thrown out from the windows into the wagon.</span> <span id="s322">He said how do I know for sure they were thrown out?</span> <span id="s323">Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when they saw the troops.</span> <span id="s324">They jumped out by themselves.</span> <span id="s325">So my question to him was, "How about the stretchers?"</span> <span id="s326">People on stretchers.</span> <span id="s327">And also: belongings, packages, suitcases, bottles.</span> <span id="s328">Altogether were thrown out into the....</span> <span id="s329">And then another question was put to me: "Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with that 'Boxer,' that you call him, around?</span> <span id="s330">Weren't you afraid to stand there?</span> <span id="s331">You told me that he used to beat up people he didn't like."</span> <span id="s332">So I told them that I think that they wanted us to stay.</span> <span id="s333">If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away.</span> <span id="s334">They want us to stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did.</span> <span id="s335">Then the only defense was, from the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else.</span> <span id="s336">They never denied that such action happened there by the hospital.</span> <span id="s337">The only defense was: maybe it was somebody else, not him.</span> <span id="s338">And sure enough, this was forty years later.</span> <span id="s339">I said, "Looking at that man I don't know if this is the man.</span> <span id="s340">I only know the 'Boxer.'</span> <span id="s341">And if he was the 'Boxer,' he was the man."</span> <span id="s342">They showed me pictures from the past.</span> <span id="s343">I recognized him immediately.</span> <span id="s344">And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked his uniform.</span> <span id="s345">I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">And then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it was a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the orders.</span> <span id="s347">But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one that we called "The Boxer"--was in charge of that operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: When and where was this trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: The trial was in Bochum (Westphalia), West Germany.</span> <span id="s350">It was outside of Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s351">It was in 1978.</span> <span id="s352">I don't recall the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s354">Let's go back to the ghetto in Lódz.</span> <span id="s355">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s356">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Are there any other stories or incidents that you remember from Lódz that are important that you want to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the transports, we were trying to stay in the ghetto, not to go away.</span> <span id="s359">Because to go away to nowhere, to a unknown destination, it's frightening.</span> <span id="s360">We don't know where.</span> <span id="s361">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Tell us...excuse me, what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the ghetto, so we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s364">The the people from the ghetto was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred, thousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different place.</span> <span id="s365">That they need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong men and they put them to work, and they send them away.</span> <span id="s366">For a while, their families used to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the ghetto-- to make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is getting.</span> <span id="s367">But after a while, it stopped.</span> <span id="s368">There were no more letters.</span> <span id="s369">No more money.</span> <span id="s370">We didn't hear about them; like they were gone.</span> <span id="s371">And a few months later another resettlement program.</span> <span id="s372">They took away other people.</span> <span id="s373">They need another five hundred, or six hundred, or...or a thousand.</span> <span id="s374">It was little by little.</span> <span id="s375">The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s376">The population dying, and putting...and sending away.</span> <span id="s377">Until it came to a point that everybody, the whole ghetto, is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s378">And everybody was going away.</span> <span id="s379">And ...and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay.</span> <span id="s380">We hide.</span> <span id="s381">We built even uh hiding places underneath, uh underneath cellars.</span> <span id="s382">We...we kept on running; because uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the ghetto from there, that there's no place left for a Jew to run.</span> <span id="s383">They even promised us that that we were going away we can take our tools.</span> <span id="s384">We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new place.</span> <span id="s385">But the question was: What is wrong with this place?</span> <span id="s386">Why, why do we have to be a new place?</span> <span id="s387">Our...this is not paradise that we are here.</span> <span id="s388">They promised us a huge amount of food at the train for three days.</span> <span id="s389">Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s390">This was a treasure.</span> <span id="s391">It was like a bait.</span> <span id="s392">But still we were...we would like to stay in one place, because one precious thing was left to us--the family was together.</span> <span id="s393">And this we felt, it's going to be...the minute we go on the train, we're going to be separated.</span> <span id="s394">The men probably will go to work someplace else.</span> <span id="s395">We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the men will work in one place.</span> <span id="s396">The women will work in another place, and the...the youngsters will work someplace else.</span> <span id="s397">This alone was frightening for us.</span> <span id="s398">And it came to a point uh that they used to hunt there from street to street.</span> <span id="s399">And transport was formed every day, and going to the train and sent away.</span> <span id="s400">People among us working at those transports, they told us what is going on at the train and how the people are packed in those trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Unhuman conditions.</span> <span id="s402">And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work, and that's how you transport people going to work?</span> <span id="s403">And it was...it became clear that this is the end.</span> <span id="s404">And we used to run as much as we could and hide, to avoid those transport going away.</span> <span id="s405">It came to a point when our part of the ghetto was sealed off; and it was no more place to hide and no more strength to run.</span> <span id="s406">And if one member of the family gives up, the rest follow.</span> <span id="s407">My mother told us she cannot run no more.</span> <span id="s408">This is it.</span> <span id="s409">She would like to go to the train, and get at least a loaf of bread and go away.</span> <span id="s410">Lets happen what's happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Then she suggested that maybe I should keep on hiding with my little brother, and she with my sister would go with them.</span> <span id="s412">The minute she said that, my kid brother grabbed my mother's hand and start to cry.</span> <span id="s413">He said, "No, I'm going with you, too."</span> <span id="s414">At that moment we all decided that we shall go together.</span> <span id="s415">Either we're going to live together, or we're going to die together.</span> <span id="s416">We reported to the train depot.</span> <span id="s417">We came there.</span> <span id="s418">It was a huge crowd.</span> <span id="s419">The boxcars were waiting; and uh German troops, armed guards all around us.</span> <span id="s420">Some even had dogs on their leashes.</span> <span id="s421">And they divided groups of a hundred...a hundred to each boxcar, and we started to go to train.</span> <span id="s422">And sure everybody received a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s423">Two kilo, will be around four pounds of bread.</span> <span id="s424">We never had so much bread since the war started.</span> <span id="s425">A lot of people started to eat even before they boarded the box car.</span> <span id="s426">You know, they start tearing the bread apart and eating.</span> <span id="s427">And in an hour when we all were in...in that box car, a hundred of them, he came over-- the one with the dog came over--and looked around, and he took some people from the other group and added to our train; because he felt that we have too much room.</span> <span id="s428">And this was in August 1944.</span> <span id="s429">It was a very hot day at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">And after he added the other people, then they put those gates together and we heard that big noise that he locked the boxcar.</span> <span id="s431">And there we were in that train, over a hundred people.</span> <span id="s432">The only facility in the train was two buckets for over a hundred men, women and children; and the train was standing on one place.</span> <span id="s433">It was unbearable hot.</span> <span id="s434">Lack of air.</span> <span id="s435">So some people had an idea that the minute we start moving, it's going to get cooler.</span> <span id="s436">(Cough) But at one moment we heard that the gate opened up in the boxcar, so we thought maybe they changed their mind.</span> <span id="s437">They're going to leave us out.</span> <span id="s438">But instead, they brought a few dozen Jews discovered in a hiding place; they were all badly beaten up because they were hiding.</span> <span id="s439">I remember one young man, all his front teeth were kicked out.</span> <span id="s440">And one boy's face was so badly swollen, it was just a nose that we could see--no eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">And they added to our car.</span> <span id="s442">And soon we started to move.</span> <span id="s443">It didn't cool off.</span> <span id="s444">And at one moment, we heard a young teenage girl crying.</span> <span id="s445">She had to go to the buckets in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s446">Her mother, her sister tried to shield her with a coat.</span> <span id="s447">A man was begging the people around to give a little more room his pregnant wife.</span> <span id="s448">Me being among the youngsters, I was asked to climb up those packages, and look out to see where are we going.</span> <span id="s449">I start to reading signs.</span> <span id="s450">One recognized those names.</span> <span id="s451">He said that we are moving south towards Kraków.</span> <span id="s452">I also saw some Polish peasants lining the road.</span> <span id="s453">They were probably used to those scenes, those trains.</span> <span id="s454">Some made signs to us, pointing to the sky.</span> <span id="s455">And some went with the fingers across this throat, the throat.</span> <span id="s456">I didn't tell the people what I saw; but I mentioned that later on, after the war, to the Polish alderman in Chicago, Mr. Roman [Pochinsky (ph)].</span> <span id="s457">And he told me that, "They tried to warn you that you going to be killed, that you should try to run away."</span> <span id="s458">Well, I tried to believe that; but the expression on their faces told me something else.</span> <span id="s459">It was late at night that we arrived at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s460">When we came in, the minute the gates [NB: the doors of the train] opened up, we heard screams, barking of dogs, blows from...from those kapos--those officials working for them, over the head.</span> <span id="s461">And then we got out of the train, and everything went so fast: left, right, right, left.</span> <span id="s462">Men separated from women, children torn from the arms of mothers, the olderly chased like cattle.</span> <span id="s463">The sick, the disabled, were handled like packs of garbage.</span> <span id="s464">They were thrown in a side together with broken suitcases and with boxes.</span> <span id="s465">My mother run over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, and she told me, "Leibele, I'm not going to see you no more.</span> <span id="s466">Take care of your brother."</span> <span id="s467">Well, my brother was twelve, thirteen at that time.</span> <span id="s468">Ten minutes later, Mengele, the doctor--I didn't know in that time...I saw a handsome looking gentlemen with white gloves--pointed to my little brother to go to the left.</span> <span id="s469">And before I realized, he was gone and I didn't see him no more.</span> <span id="s470">I didn't know at the time that I was the lucky one; because when I went into the showers, from the shower heads we got water.</span> <span id="s471">Other people got poison gas.</span> <span id="s472">But when we came out from the showers, the sky was red.</span> <span id="s473">The air was filled with smoke and the odor of burning flesh and...and hair.</span> <span id="s474">A man went over to those officials, and he asked one of those officials (ph)--he called them the "kapos"--he asked him about his wife and his little girl.</span> <span id="s475">And the man looked him straight in the eye.</span> <span id="s476">He said, "There is no more little girl.</span> <span id="s477">There was...there is no more wife."</span> <span id="s478">He said, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s479">Where they are?"</span> <span id="s480">And he pointed to the chimney with that...that smoke bursting out.</span> <span id="s481">"That's their funeral.</span> <span id="s482">Here they go."</span> <span id="s483">Well, the man didn't cry.</span> <span id="s484">He didn't scream.</span> <span id="s485">He just stood there and stared at that chimney.</span> <span id="s486">We all stared at it.</span> <span id="s487">We would stay there probably for hours.</span> <span id="s488">But we started to be chased into the block, to the barracks where we were marched over.</span> <span id="s489">We couldn't even recognize each other.</span> <span id="s490">No hair.</span> <span id="s491">The hair was shaved off.</span> <span id="s492">Dressed in striped uniforms--too small, too big, too large, too short.</span> <span id="s493">We all looked like clowns.</span> <span id="s494">And then we were welcomed by a speech from one of those kapos.</span> <span id="s495">He said, "You saw that sign that 'Arbeit Macht Frei'?</span> <span id="s496">That means 'freedom through labor.'"</span> <span id="s497">He said, "Don't make any mistakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Nobody needs your labor here.</span> <span id="s499">You did not come here to work.</span> <span id="s500">You came here to be killed.</span> <span id="s501">You're just waiting your turn.</span> <span id="s502">And remember I don't have any...I don't have to have a reason to kill you, if I want it.</span> <span id="s503">So you better do what you're told."</span> <span id="s504">Well, this was the beginning of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s505">Every morning that we went out to be counted, we could feel the crematoriums burning.</span> <span id="s506">And that most disgusting odor is the burning of flesh and hair together.</span> <span id="s507">I decided to make every effort to do everything I can to go away from Aus... Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s508">Because they were forming transport to go away to labor; because Auschwitz itself was an extermination camp, not a labor camp.</span> <span id="s509">But for the time being, they...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps.</span> <span id="s510">I didn't succeeded in the beginning, but I..</span> <span id="s511">.</span> <span id="s512">I still tried.</span> <span id="s513">I still tried.</span> <span id="s514">Uh, at one time they asked, "Who knows, who ever worked in road construction?"</span> <span id="s515">The minute I run over, and I said, "I did."</span> <span id="s516">He said, "Where did you work?"</span> <span id="s517">I said, "Outside of _ód_, when they build the highway."</span> <span id="s518">I never saw any construction worked at all.</span> <span id="s519">So they put a few hundred together, and they put us in a site.</span> <span id="s520">So we were in the transport.</span> <span id="s521">All the rest start to get the tatoos to stay in Auschwitz, their number.</span> <span id="s522">And we were put on a transport; and I went to a labor camp outside in Silesia, in a place called Kaltwasser.Kaltwasser was a labor camp under construction.</span> <span id="s523">It was a beautiful area.</span> <span id="s524">They were building uh new roads and a small railroad, and that's what we worked.</span> <span id="s525">The conditions that time: it was very hard.</span> <span id="s526">We didn't have adequate clothes; and starting to get cold in the morning, especially when we stood to be counted.</span> <span id="s527">We were freezing.</span> <span id="s528">There were no beds in our barracks.</span> <span id="s529">They just put uh some straw on the floor, and that how's we slept, in our clothes.</span> <span id="s530">And the work was very 2 Administered by Wüstegiersdorf (subcamp of Groß Rosen).</span> <span id="s531">Located at Kreis Glatz, in Lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s532">Opened August 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">hard.</span> <span id="s534">But the....</span> <span id="s535">We felt that we were chosen to live.</span> <span id="s536">It is not Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s537">So we, we consider ourself the lucky ones, that we got away from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s538">The...we did not stay too long in that particular camp; because as work progressed, we were sent to a different camp called Lärche.Was the same work, a continuation of the same work.</span> <span id="s539">And, uh, there we also worked at the same thing, but the living conditions were a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">There were beds already--bunks--and we did receive, uh, warmer clothes.</span> <span id="s541">Uh, but fortunately that...that work, in...in that was finished in...in a very short time; and they decided again send us to a different camp, in a place called Wolfsberg.Uh at that particular camp, I met some people--those officials that knew my family from before the war--and I did get a better job.</span> <span id="s542">I worked in the hospital, in the Revier, in that hospital in that camp.</span> <span id="s543">And my situation improved a little bit, and so did my physical uh condition improved.</span> <span id="s544">And there I stood [NB: stayed] until we could hear the Russian army already approaching.</span> <span id="s545">At night we heard cannon sound, and we felt that any day we're going to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: At this point we need to stop and change tapes.</span> <span id="s547">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s548">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">3 Administered by Wüstegiersdorf (subcamp of Groß Rosen).</span> <span id="s550">Located near Lehmwasser, in Lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s551">Opened October 20, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">4 Administered by Würstegiersdorf (subcamp of Groß Rosen).</span> <span id="s553">Located at Friedland, in Lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s554">Opened May 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s557">You are in uh Lärche... A: ...Lärche.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Tell us about...tell us about working in the hospital there.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: In the hospital, I worked in a place called Wolfsberg, not Lärche.</span> <span id="s560">Yeah.</span> <span id="s561">Well, uh, people, uh, if they had some minor accident or they got sick, they report to the doctor.</span> <span id="s562">Uh, they came in, and the doctor prescribed how many days he can stay in that hospital.</span> <span id="s563">Three days, four days.</span> <span id="s564">A lot of people, uh, tried to just get in to be away and to get some kind of a rest, and to be away from that hard work.</span> <span id="s565">They couldn't take it no more.</span> <span id="s566">And some legitimately got sick, and they reported to the hospital.</span> <span id="s567">They didn't get any treatment, uh, for anything.</span> <span id="s568">They just laid there, just to stay away from work.</span> <span id="s569">And after a few days, the doctor decided, "You're all right now, and you can go."</span> <span id="s570">If somebody got seriously sick, somebody made a report.</span> <span id="s571">And every few weeks they came and they took the peo-- German people, you know, the Gestapo, whatever--and they took them away.</span> <span id="s572">They said they took them away to a real hospital where they can get better treatment.</span> <span id="s573">Actually, they were taken to Auschwitz to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s574">And, for example, uh, people who knew that, uh, they were seriously ill, they tried as much as they could to stay away from the hospital; because the hospital...they know if they happened to be so unlucky and this is a time when the Germans come....</span> <span id="s575">Because they come every once in a while to check on this hospital, and they could tell....</span> <span id="s576">They didn't, they didn't care about those people who tried to get away from work for a day or so.</span> <span id="s577">Whoever was ill, they were taken away; and they...they said they take them to a hospital to be cured, but this was the end of them.</span> <span id="s578">Uh, the end station actually was Auschwitz, or any other extermination camp.</span> <span id="s579">My work in that hospital was, uh, to keep order.</span> <span id="s580">Uh, in the morning, uh, they come in.</span> <span id="s581">I had to count the people, uh, to get them ready to...for inspection; and after...and also the food.</span> <span id="s582">I also distribute the food for those people.</span> <span id="s583">Uh, in some cases, people who did not work received half of the normal rations.</span> <span id="s584">Not in that camp where I worked, but in other camps this was the case.</span> <span id="s585">For example, this was the case in the last camp where I was liberated, later on.</span> <span id="s586">This was the case that non-working people received half of the rations.</span> <span id="s587">But in that camp, uh, where I worked--in Wolfsberg--it was not too bad, you know.</span> <span id="s588">But the only thing is...three, four days was the maximum that, uh, a person was allowed to be sick.</span> <span id="s589">If there was a serious sickness for longer, they took them away.</span> <span id="s590">Uh, at one time, they they came in and they took away almost half of the hospital.</span> <span id="s591">Yeah, a lot of people.</span> <span id="s592">For example, in our...our barrack where I was, uh, in charge--it was some over eighty people--that they took out about thirty, thirty five people away that they considered actually they were not uh...they were emaciated.</span> <span id="s593">They looked so bad.</span> <span id="s594">So they took them away.</span> <span id="s595">And the rest of the people stood [NB: stayed]; and a lot of people were frightened, and they reported out that they said that they feel better.</span> <span id="s596">They want to go out to work already.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Where did you go from here?</span> <span id="s598">Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: That was like I said, that we fe...we heard already noise of the...of the Red Army approaching.</span> <span id="s600">And at one day the...we were told to assemble, and we started to march on foot.</span> <span id="s601">The clothes that we had, it was uh not adequate; because this was February already.</span> <span id="s602">It was cold and snowing; and we were marching on these columns, quite uh...almost eight hundred people at that time, the whole camp.</span> <span id="s603">And we were marching through the fields; and uh...there was no food.</span> <span id="s604">We marched the first day, until it was dark.</span> <span id="s605">We passed a lot of hamlets, a lot of villages.</span> <span id="s606">People came out and they looked at us.</span> <span id="s607">They were probably used to that scenes already.</span> <span id="s608">And when we passed a place uh on the field.</span> <span id="s609">There were two huge barns, and that's...that how we stood overnight.</span> <span id="s610">In the morning we start marching again, the second day.</span> <span id="s611">And also until late at night; and it was no food, only that what we got when we started.</span> <span id="s612">It was a loaf of bread, and some uh artificial honey, it was a lump; and that's how we marched through two days.</span> <span id="s613">On the third day we were also put in...in barns, very big barns; and that's how we stood one day, and another day.</span> <span id="s614">And no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">The people was starving to die, from starvation.</span> <span id="s616">They didn't get up.</span> <span id="s617">In the morning we used to touch each other to get up, and some didn't.</span> <span id="s618">When we walked out, and we just walking around...I remember one instance that the other side of the wall was a horse.</span> <span id="s619">And I heard that that horse in a grubbing of some food.</span> <span id="s620">So I was by the wall.</span> <span id="s621">So I took away, I tore away a board from that wall; and I saw that the horse was eating beets, sugar beets.</span> <span id="s622">So I tried to grab one from that horse.</span> <span id="s623">He almost bit my hand off.</span> <span id="s624">He didn't let me.</span> <span id="s625">So I..</span> <span id="s626">.</span> <span id="s627">I outsmarted the horse.</span> <span id="s628">I took a piece of straw, and I started to tickle the horse on the head.</span> <span id="s629">So the minute he picked up the head, so I grabbed a beet out from...and that's how I ate it.</span> <span id="s630">The German guards saw that they...they wouldn't have no nobody to march with anymore, because people were dying so fast--and so many of them.</span> <span id="s631">They slaughtered a few of those horses, and they told the people to cook some soup.</span> <span id="s632">And then we received a..</span> <span id="s633">.</span> <span id="s634">a warm soup out of that horsemeat.</span> <span id="s635">This was the third day.</span> <span id="s636">The fourth day they assembled us.</span> <span id="s637">We start marching; and I saw that we are marching to a train depot, because it was railroad tracks already.</span> <span id="s638">We came there.</span> <span id="s639">And if we thought that the...the ride from _ód_ ghetto to Auschwitz was bad, this was even worse; because this was in the wintertime and the train car were open cars.</span> <span id="s640">Coal cars, out in the open.</span> <span id="s641">And there were we packed in.</span> <span id="s642">And also we received some bread, also a loaf of bread; and they told us to be careful with the bread because we don't know how long we're going to stay in those trains.</span> <span id="s643">And it took about five days.</span> <span id="s644">In every car, I would say about ten percent, fifteen percent of the people died.</span> <span id="s645">In our car, I remember it was a father and two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">And the father survived; both sons died in that train.</span> <span id="s647">And the minute they...he start to move, the other grabbed his part of bread.</span> <span id="s648">We become like animals.</span> <span id="s649">But at this point, I would like also to...to mention it, we passed in Czechoslovakia one town.</span> <span id="s650">I even remember the name today, for so many years.</span> <span id="s651">The name of that town was Stará Paka.</span> <span id="s652">And it was a factory next to that train station.</span> <span id="s653">And people from the fac... factory run out; and everybody took those lunches they had and threw in in our train.</span> <span id="s654">Some people threw even apples, that we didn't see for years already.</span> <span id="s655">And they threw in our train.</span> <span id="s656">The</span></p> <p><span id="s657">5 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">German guards started to shoot on them from their rifles.</span> <span id="s659">They shoot in the air.</span> <span id="s660">They didn't kill nobody.</span> <span id="s661">They shoot...they try to scare them away.</span> <span id="s662">They didn't react.</span> <span id="s663">I saw a young woman.</span> <span id="s664">When she saw us on the train, she went into those factory, start to ring a bell.</span> <span id="s665">And everybody came out with the...with the food, with lunches, and they threw in to our....</span> <span id="s666">This was the Czech people in a town called Stará Paka.</span> <span id="s667">They took us...on the fifth day we arrived in Austria.</span> <span id="s668">And this was the end of our journey, a concentration camp called Ebensee.</span> <span id="s669">It was the overflow of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s670">Mauthausen was such a cruel camp that the Germans themselves called it "Mordhausen," which means "House of Murder."</span> <span id="s671">When we came to...to Ebensee, the hunger and the labor and the way--especially for us Jews--the way we were treated, we were sure that not one will survive that camp.</span> <span id="s672">That this was it.</span> <span id="s673">The charge, the man in charge of our block was a professional killer.</span> <span id="s674">He enjoyed so much killing people.</span> <span id="s675">The...the people who went to the hospitals when they were sick there, hardly one came out alive.</span> <span id="s676">The people who were not working, who were in that hospital: Jews received half of the rations that the normal worker received; non- Jews they gave the regular rations if they were not too long in that hospital.</span> <span id="s677">The...we went, I remember, to the shower in that camp.</span> <span id="s678">It was the end of February or the beginning of March [NB: 1945].</span> <span id="s679">It was still cold.</span> <span id="s680">When we came out from the shower, we stood outside...I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s681">Without clothes.</span> <span id="s682">Without...without wiping ourselves off.</span> <span id="s683">I would never believe that a person can survive standing in the outside in the wintertime without clothes for so long.</span> <span id="s684">We were waiting 'til we get our bundles of clothes from disinfection, and then we run back to the block.</span> <span id="s685">I remember standing on that, waiting for my clothes, like a pelican.</span> <span id="s686">I stood on one foot, and then I changed.</span> <span id="s687">I put down the other foot, and I picked up the other foot.</span> <span id="s688">I didn't realize that this is possible for a person to survive, but apparently it is possible.</span> <span id="s689">I did it.</span> <span id="s690">In that... in that camp we worked in tunnels.</span> <span id="s691">The...we built tunnels in behin...below the mountains.</span> <span id="s692">They decided to put the munition factories inside those tunnels to be away from the bombing.</span> <span id="s693">The work was hard, no food; because scared...even the German guards were fighting for food for themselves.</span> <span id="s694">The...it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s695">Conditions were terrible for everybody.</span> <span id="s696">Many times the...there were bombings.</span> <span id="s697">Uh, we saw the planes coming.</span> <span id="s698">At one time, we stood; we can't work.</span> <span id="s699">Bombs start to drop; and uh the Germans were running, hiding.</span> <span id="s700">We didn't.</span> <span id="s701">I stood there, and I did not care if I'm going to get killed or not.</span> <span id="s702">I was just looked up in the sky, and I was just looking that the bombs should drop.</span> <span id="s703">Nobody even cared anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Sometimes people wonder, "Why are you not afraid to die?"</span> <span id="s705">Because when you are in such a condition that uh...that you really don't care no more, people are not afraid of to die.</span> <span id="s706">I was not afraid to die.</span> <span id="s707">When we were led to a..</span> <span id="s708">.</span> <span id="s709">a place of work in the morning--it was around five or six kilometers--there was a pile of potatoes laying.</span> <span id="s710">The Germans knew that we're going to grab them.</span> <span id="s711">They stood with the big sticks, and everybody get near those piles was beaten.</span> <span id="s712">And uh we didn't care.</span> <span id="s713">And I saw, for example, that they drop the stick on somebody's head and the man started to bleed.</span> <span id="s714">And then I figure out that it must take time 'til they get the stick up.</span> <span id="s715">In the meantime, I--just like...like lightening--I jumped on that pile; and I grabbed two, three potatoes and I run back.</span> <span id="s716">So he could have split my head, too.</span> <span id="s717">And I knew it, but I didn't care.</span> <span id="s718">In the meantime, I ate raw potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">That's what hunger can do to a person.</span> <span id="s720">We can see what it does to a body, but it's very hard to describe what it can to do a person's mind.</span> <span id="s721">You gave up on life.</span> <span id="s722">I did.</span> <span id="s723">Until I was liberated, we also experienced a terrible ordeal.</span> <span id="s724">At one morning, we were told that we're not going out to work.</span> <span id="s725">Is it in Ebensee, in this hell?</span> <span id="s726">They let us stay home?</span> <span id="s727">They said, "You're not going out to work."</span> <span id="s728">They said, "But the American army is approaching the camp, and we decided that we have to go and hide because they're going to bomb that camp.</span> <span id="s729">They might think this is a military camp.</span> <span id="s730">And that we should go and hide in those tunnels in the mountains."</span> <span id="s731">So one of those Kapos--he was a Frenchman--he got up, and he says, "No!"</span> <span id="s732">And he starts screaming, "No!</span> <span id="s733">No!</span> <span id="s734">No go to the stalls!"</span> <span id="s735">So people was confused.</span> <span id="s736">"What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s737">He said, "Dynamite in the stalls!"</span> <span id="s738">They had prepared dynamite charges, and they were ready to blow us up in the last minute.</span> <span id="s739">So that the...the ältester from the...from the camp said, "If you don't want to go hide, it's OK.</span> <span id="s740">You can stay here in the camp."</span> <span id="s741">And the next day in the morning, tanks came in.</span> <span id="s742">The American tanks came in, and we were free.</span> <span id="s743">Then I went to the hospital, uh, in the area to...I had at that time weighted a hundred, a hundred and seventy kilogram.</span> <span id="s744">Uh, this was almost a hundred pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Tell me about liberation, when the soldiers came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Well, people were crying.</span> <span id="s747">People were hugging each other.</span> <span id="s748">They climbed up on those tanks.</span> <span id="s749">They were sticking to the tanks like flies.</span> <span id="s750">And, uh, they...already they realized at that time the enormity of their tragedy.</span> <span id="s751">Especially for us Jews.</span> <span id="s752">People started to make the preparations to go home.</span> <span id="s753">Delegations came in from France, from Russia, from Poland; you know, to get their people together.</span> <span id="s754">Nobody came for us.</span> <span id="s755">Nobody even was interested what is going to happen to the Jews.</span> <span id="s756">We had no homes to go.</span> <span id="s757">Our homes were destroyed.</span> <span id="s758">There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s759">They came, and they explained it to us that "Soon you will receive some information how to get together."</span> <span id="s760">The Jewish Agency came and want to take us to Palestine.</span> <span id="s761">And they were told us Polish Jews, "You're not even welcome back in Poland."</span> <span id="s762">The French government wanted the Jews to come back, but there were very few.</span> <span id="s763">But the bulk of the Jewish population was from Russia, from Poland, from Hungary.</span> <span id="s764">Some did go back after the liberation, and some came back to the camps.</span> <span id="s765">They said, "There is no more place for us in our home."</span> <span id="s766">Especially in Poland.</span> <span id="s767">A Jew came back, and he said he almost got killed when he tried to reclaim his hou... his house.</span> <span id="s768">And we decided to stay there.</span> <span id="s769">We established some kind of a Jewish community in Austria, some in Germany or in Italy.</span> <span id="s770">I was in Austria.</span> <span id="s771">I worked for uh the Jewish Central Committee.</span> <span id="s772">My boss was the famous Nazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, who headed the political department.</span> <span id="s773">Also the documentation center.</span> <span id="s774">He published our bulletin, that I was also involved because the Yiddishe [Rundschau (ph?)]</span> <span id="s775">.</span> <span id="s776">I worked in the cultural department of...in Linz, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Until uh....</span> <span id="s778">By the way, I also met my wife, that I knew from the ghetto, in Austria.</span> <span id="s779">We got married and we lived in Linz, where I worked in the Central Committee of the Jews in Austria.</span> <span id="s780">Until we emigrated.</span> <span id="s781">We received a visa through the HIAS, and we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s782">But uh the memories of the Holocaust, from those camps-- especially that one scene that when my mother grabbed me by the shoulders and said, "I will never see you again," that I should take care of my little brother--this stays with me for all those years.</span> <span id="s783">And I'm sure it will never leave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Leo, what...besides that memory, what has been the effect of the war on you, of the Holocaust on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: The effect is that I got some, I feel that I have a responsibility to tell the story about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s786">But I never dreamed that a time will come that I will have to convince the people there was such a thing as a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s787">Beside all the ...the fact and documentation and witnesses, there are people who denied it, that said there wasn't a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s788">This I never thought that I will have to do.</span> <span id="s789">I feel some kind of a responsibility towards future generations.</span> <span id="s790">I tell...I talk to my children about it.</span> <span id="s791">A lot of people--friends of mine--tried to spare their children, and their grandchildren, those horrible experiences that they went through.</span> <span id="s792">I think it was wrong.</span> <span id="s793">I feel that we should make every effort for the world to learn the lesson of the Holocaust, so such an event should never, never happen again.</span> <span id="s794">To no people.</span> <span id="s795">I'm very sensitive at the misery of other people.</span> <span id="s796">Mainly because I'm a Jew, and I know what it means.</span> <span id="s797">The Holocaust Museum that is being built in Washington now means quite a bit to me.</span> <span id="s798">Mainly, it is not a Jewish project.</span> <span id="s799">It's an official United States institution, I feel, just like the Smithsonian Institute or the Library of Congress.</span> <span id="s800">Because if a revisionist goes who say that the Holocaust is a lie, I can tell him that the government of the United States said it is true.</span> <span id="s801">And go to Washington, and see for yourself.</span> <span id="s802">Yad Vashem, it's also does a tremendous job, but they can say it's a Jewish institution.</span> <span id="s803">That boxcar who is in the Washington Museum, has...is significant because it was given by a Polish government.</span> <span id="s804">Just like the boat from Denmark was given by the Danish government.</span> <span id="s805">That's why this museum means quite a bit to me.</span> <span id="s806">That mean this is one more way that the world will learn the lesson of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s807">It is a mission that's almost sacred.</span> <span id="s808">(Pause) OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s810">Thank you, Leo.</span> <span id="s811">Very much.</span></p></body></html>
