id="s13">This is Stephanie Blyskal.</span> <span id="s14">It is November 9th, 2008, and we are in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s15">Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Why don’t you start by telling me where you were born, when you were born and what your name was at birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s19">I was born in – on November 29th, 1936, in Cluj, Kolozsvár, or Klausenburg, depending.</span> <span id="s20">Klausenburg is the Yiddish word, but depending who was in power, the name was different.</span> <span id="s21">My –</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And who was in power when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Actually, I believe it was Hungaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: And – no, it was Romania, because as a little girl I remember standing and greeting the Hungarian soldiers coming into town, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: So it was Romania, then it became Hungary.</span> <span id="s28">But as I recall, I spoke most of my life, as a young child, only Hungarian, I don’t remember speaking Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My father – my maiden name is Eva Katz.</span> <span id="s31">My father was one of 10 children, and my mother – his name is Aleksander(ph) Katz, or Alexander Katz, depending where – you know, what paper it appears.</span> <span id="s32">And my mother’s name is Margit Katz, her maiden name is Roth, r-o-t-h, and she was one of six children.</span> <span id="s33">I believe both of them were the second children in the family.</span> <span id="s34">My father became a printer, and my mother was a hat maker, and I love beautiful hats.</span> <span id="s35">I remember we lived in a very nice apartment, it was a multiple unit apartment.</span> <span id="s36">And I have some memories of being in Kolozsvár.</span> <span id="s37">I never called it Cluj til later.</span> <span id="s38">And I had a vivid, active life.</span> <span id="s39">I remember being spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Were you – were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I was the only child.</span> <span id="s42">My – I remember once I was being punished because early age on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in a Christian church, a big Catholic church.</span> <span id="s43">There was music coming out of it and I went in and my poor mother was looking for me.</span> <span id="s44">And I ended up being punished, and my punishment was that my father took away my shoes, and my mother had to carry me.</span> <span id="s45">And I was a little – kind of bad, so I said, this is really no punishment.</span> <span id="s46">I loved being carried by my mother, so my father got pretty angry [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s47">So early age on I had a certain amount of independent spirit.</span> <span id="s48">And we moved, I think my parents moved there when they got married, so they didn’t have as many friends.</span> <span id="s49">And I remember my mother kind of talking to me always about what was going on.</span> <span id="s50">I was her little confidant, which continued.</span> <span id="s51">Unfortunately, she died at age 28, so it was to – for a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Was your – was your – I’m sorry to interrupt, was your – were you in a li – religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Both my father and mother came from very religious family, but I believe when they moved up to Cluj, some of the religion was left a little behind.</span> <span id="s54">And my father enjoyed playing cards, and I remember that causing some problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: He played chess and cards, and it wasn’t something what my mother was used to, so as a young girl I remember arguments about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you keep kosher til your move?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: We always kept kosher, yes.</span> <span id="s59">And I don’t recall my – I didn’t recall that my mother was working, but my aunt, who survived, her aunt – my aunt is my father’s younger sister, her name is Ibby(ph) Steinberger(ph) now.</span> <span id="s60">She remembers that when I was a baby, she came over to watch me while my mother went to work.</span> <span id="s61">But for some reason, I had no recollection of that.</span> <span id="s62">My mother always dressed beautiful, and she was a very beautiful lady.</span> <span id="s63">And we ended up moving because my father heard what was happening around him, and he was worried that in a small city, people know us.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: And if we go up to Budapest, we would have a better opportunity to survive.</span> <span id="s66">Even though most of the people didn’t believe it can happen where we lived.</span> <span id="s67">It may happen in Poland, but it won’t happen in Kolozsvár.</span> <span id="s68">So my father went up and secured in a – a room in Budapest, and there was such a tremendous amount of shortage of – of apartments already.</span> <span id="s69">It must have been either I was four or five, I have no recollection of the date.</span> <span id="s70">And my father talked very little about my life before the war, after I came back.</span> <span id="s71">And we moved up to Budapest and all of a sudden we had to share one apartment unit with several families.</span> <span id="s72">And I remember that was a little difficult.</span> <span id="s73">And my mother’s father, who had long beard and payos, you know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s74">And in one room my father lived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather.</span> <span id="s75">And it was ov – you know, crowded, and there were some arguments about that.</span> <span id="s76">I have very, very precious memories of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s77">He always had real deep pockets and always some goodies for me.</span> <span id="s78">He spoiled me whatever way he could.</span> <span id="s79">And when the – the Nyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he came home all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out.</span> <span id="s80">And after that I never seen him.</span> <span id="s81">He came to us, and he kind of – I don’t know where he went, but that was the last time I seen him.</span> <span id="s82">My father went to work as a printer, and my mother continued working as a – as a hat maker.</span> <span id="s83">And when the war broke out, I happened to visit with my maternal grandmother in Tashnalt(ph), and they were – I was visiting with my grandmother and I have vivid recollection of that, that she was pre – baking challah, and the smell in the room was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s84">And all of a sudden they knocked on the door and they said the Jews are being collected in that city.</span> <span id="s85">And my aunt, younger aunt, her name is also Ibby(ph), my mother’s younger sister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth, and she says, Eva, you are not – she didn’t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) -- Havelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide.</span> <span id="s86">And when it gets dark, you will go to the rabbi’s house, and they will send a message for your father to come and get you from Budapest.</span> <span id="s87">Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the Transylvania section.</span> <span id="s88">So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the fields.</span> <span id="s89">And they usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and pointing where she is putting the key.</span> <span id="s90">And I was ready to go inside when a group of Gypsies appeared.</span> <span id="s91">And I pretended that my grandmother was inside the house, because they had s – they were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be stolen by Gypsies.</span> <span id="s92">And I pretended that my grandmother is in there, and I said, Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don’t leave me alone.</span> <span id="s93">Naturally, everything is in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s94">And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on.</span> <span id="s95">And I said, just leave me alone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you.</span> <span id="s96">And they left.</span> <span id="s97">And I felt like a sense of accomplishment.</span> <span id="s98">I could fool the Gypsies, I’d be able to go to the rabbi’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: And I did.</span> <span id="s101">And I think a day or so later, my father came.</span> <span id="s102">He was note – my mother’s – my grandmother must have – the rabbi must have called my grandmother, and my grandmother se – and my mother send message to my father, who was in a labor camp by then, what happened.</span> <span id="s103">And my father came to get me from the rabbi’s house.</span> <span id="s104">And my father had to wear his yellow star.</span> <span id="s105">And he told me, if by any chance something happens, and I’m being arrested, you go back to the rabbi’s house, and I will come and get you.</span> <span id="s106">As we were walking toward the railroad station, the police stopped my father and they took him in.</span> <span id="s107">And I think we had some kind of agreement where he motioned for me to go back.</span> <span id="s108">I’m seven, this had to be in April of ’44, so I’m seven and a half that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: And I go back to the rabbi’s house.</span> <span id="s111">My father is being kept overnight there and beaten up pretty bad.</span> <span id="s112">And he had the chutzpah that when they let him go, he did say why he came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: He asked for a – a note from the police station that they kept him overnight, because he had only a short duration he could come and get me.</span> <span id="s115">So he had the note.</span> <span id="s116">And next day when we went to the railroad station, we got on the train, but my father couldn’t come inside the train.</span> <span id="s117">And before the train arrived, my father approached a woman with a young child, and ask her if she could take me, and pretend that I belong with her.</span> <span id="s118">And that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s119">My was – father was – I could see him from the window, he was between the railroad cars, you know, the open place where he could stay.</span> <span id="s120">And this lady started flirting with the German soldiers who were inside the train, and I was petrified.</span> <span id="s121">That time I didn’t speak anything –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: – I was quiet.</span> <span id="s124">And when we arrived to Budapest, my father tried to hold my hand, and I just run off.</span> <span id="s125">And I don’t know how I knew the way how to get home, but my father couldn’t catch up with me, I run all the way home.</span> <span id="s126">I wanted to be – I wanted my mother to hold me because she – she meant safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: A short time later where we lived, the apartment was being emptied.</span> <span id="s129">And we had the choice to go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s130">And my mother secured papers to go into – I don’t remember if we went – I think we went first to the Swiss safe house.</span> <span id="s131">And when that was emptied, then we ended up in the Swedish safe house.</span> <span id="s132">And I remember once when we were in the Swedish safe house, my mother hid me on a top of, you know those – in Europe you have those big cli – furnitures, you know, which opens up and you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: And on top of it was a basket, and she put me inside that basket, and she told me, Eva, you have to be very quiet, and even if you have to go to the bathroom, you just stay in that basket until I come and get you.</span> <span id="s135">Well, I was there for several hours, and I think my mother hid somewhere in – they had those, like in a elevator shaft [indecipherable] she was hid – hidden there.</span> <span id="s136">It was an elevator actually there.</span> <span id="s137">It was between the windows, which you know, it was like – I don’t see it here, but it – it’s like a place where windows look out, and there is really no access to it, and she – I thi – that’s what she told me, she was hidden in one of those places.</span> <span id="s138">When she came to get me, I remember I was wet, I was there for many, many hours.</span> <span id="s139">And she caressed me and told me everything is okay.</span> <span id="s140">And we were trying to sneak out from the building when the Hungarian policeman seen us.</span> <span id="s141">And she said – the policeman said, I don’t see you.</span> <span id="s142">Go.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: So I remember my mother telling me that there is no other place for us, we will – I will get somewhere some false papers, false identity.</span> <span id="s145">And – I have to go back.</span> <span id="s146">The person from whom we rented the room where we stayed, she rented one room to us, and an other room to a woman who was actually a SS woman, became a SS woman.</span> <span id="s147">And the lady’s name whose apartment it was originally, and the place na – I remember the address, it was kira(ph) utsa(ph) tisanirt(ph).</span> <span id="s148">Kira(ph) is street number 15, and the lady’s name was Mrs. Gross.</span> <span id="s149">My mother befriended the person whose – who was the SS woman, the brother, and we hid with him for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: And I don’t know what was the reason, my mother felt that that wasn’t a safe place –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: – for – I don’t know what was the reason behind it.</span> <span id="s154">And that’s when she got a name and I got a new name.</span> <span id="s155">My name was Eva Noig(ph), and noig means in Hungarian big, so she says, now you are a big girl, and I’m going to enroll you to school.</span> <span id="s156">She enrolled me to school, we were – she was dressed up, you know, very fashionable, and dressed me up pretty.</span> <span id="s157">And I was accepted in the class and she found a new place.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And this – was this the first time you had gone to school, or is this –</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I never went to school before.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: You never went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And I remember I was skipping, I was so happy.</span> <span id="s162">And in Europe you have these round places where they have advertising posted.</span> <span id="s163">And I remember going by there, and my mother saying, we’ll just go get our belongings from that person where we stayed for awhile.</span> <span id="s164">And I have no idea the duration how long we were there.</span> <span id="s165">And as we were passing that round thing, somebody said, Mrs. Katz?</span> <span id="s166">So we were turned in.</span> <span id="s167">We never got to the apartment.</span> <span id="s168">And we were marched to the police station.</span> <span id="s169">And at one point my mother says, come on Eva, sneak off, and I was frozen, I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s170">And for years afterwards I was feeling that maybe if I would have moved, my mother would be alive today.</span> <span id="s171">From the police station, they knew who we were, we were taken to a place called – a brick factory [indecipherable], which was like a holding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: And from there we were s – they were marching us toward Germany.</span> <span id="s174">You have to realize that most people had a little warning and had some clothes with them.</span> <span id="s175">We had absolutely nothing, my mother wore fashionable shoes.</span> <span id="s176">And every so often they gave rides for children on, you know, those horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: The carr –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: You know, where they carried their – and every so often – and one day my mother ask if s-she could come, because her feet were killing her.</span> <span id="s181">There were a few children on that wagon.</span> <span id="s182">Short time later we heard shots, and I never seen my mother again.</span> <span id="s183">At night when we arrived, they had like a makeshift Red Cross station where people were united.</span> <span id="s184">And I remember every time the door opened, I was listening for my mother’s steps.</span> <span id="s185">Never came.</span> <span id="s186">And I was crying.</span> <span id="s187">There was bombing going on around, and I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s188">How could my mother leave me?</span> <span id="s189">And there was a woman who was working at that Red Cross station, and she says, until your momma comes, I take care of you.</span> <span id="s190">And actually, I was with her until we got to Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: She got – she was half Jewish, or I don’t even know if she was half Jewish or she bra – did something, but they gave her a different position, they didn't put her in the lager, and I was separated from her.</span> <span id="s193">When I arrived to Ravensbrück they took the clothes which I had on, which was very limited.</span> <span id="s194">And by that time the weather’s changed and it was cold, and I was freezing.</span> <span id="s195">They shaved my hair, and I had to go through a so-called spray where they disinfected you from – oh, by the way, when we – before we arrived to Ravensbrück, I was put in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s196">And I remember some people died in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s197">We were shoved in, that you couldn’t even move.</span> <span id="s198">There was no food, nothing, and it was dark, you couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s199">In Ravensbrück I remember going through that disinfectant area, and I came from where – you know, we didn’t go naked anywhere, and I was so embarrassed being naked, and I tried to cover myself up.</span> <span id="s200">I didn’t have much development yet, but still, I just – the idea of doing – and I remember a woman putting a stick to me, and she said in German, put your hands on the side.</span> <span id="s201">Yelling at me.</span> <span id="s202">And even though I probably didn’t understand, but I knew what I needed to do, so I did it.</span> <span id="s203">And I remember kind of running between – it was almost like a train, you know, a stationary train, and I was walking between it because I was thinking, maybe I should just fall between it.</span> <span id="s204">And one of the women, she was a little older, it was almost like she read my mind.</span> <span id="s205">She asked my name and held me.</span> <span id="s206">And I kind of – she atta – she kind of adopted me.</span> <span id="s207">And in the barracks in Ravensbrück where I was, we were in the upper, you know, they had layers of –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: – cots, you know, where you know, like bunk beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: And we were on this middle one.</span> <span id="s212">And I remember one morning, her arms were around me, but she wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s213">And I re – I tried to tell her wake up, we have to get out of bed.</span> <span id="s214">And they se – some women must have seen what I was doing, and they said, oh my God, she died.</span> <span id="s215">So I laid back on her, I wanted to die, too.</span> <span id="s216">And the women didn’t let me, they pulled me off.</span> <span id="s217">I have no idea how long I was in that barrack.</span> <span id="s218">But I remember once hearing a baby cry.</span> <span id="s219">And the woman’s whisper to me, he says, you have to be – keep it.</span> <span id="s220">We have to keep this a secret.</span> <span id="s221">We are going to hide the mother and the child.</span> <span id="s222">So there was actually a baby being born in the barrack where I was.</span> <span id="s223">And I said, oh my God, will I ever re – have children of my own?</span> <span id="s224">Will it ever happen, or – and all through the time when I was totally petrified, I repeated the Shema Israel over and over.</span> <span id="s225">I kind of went in my own private little world when I said the prayer.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Was it like a meditation almost?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: In a way.</span> <span id="s228">And I remember praying, please God, give me the opportunity.</span> <span id="s229">Once while we were in Ravensbrück, there were a lot of people speaking other languages.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t know how I communicated, I really have no recollection of that.</span> <span id="s231">I think mostly in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s232">But I seen a soldier at the w-wires, and he was with a big dog, and I was petrified of those German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s233">And he told me in Hungarian, come closer, and he gave me some food.</span> <span id="s234">And he said, if I’m here tomorrow come again, and I give you.</span> <span id="s235">I went there next day, he wasn’t, but the Russians were approaching Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s236">I didn’t know about it, but the people were talking about it.</span> <span id="s237">And they – we were being collected.</span> <span id="s238">Some people hid.</span> <span id="s239">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s240">We were pushed again in cattle cars, this time directly, we weren't being marched.</span> <span id="s241">And I was taken from mar – Ravensbrück to Bergen-Belsen, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: [coughing] When they opened the cattle cars, the first thing I remember seeing in Bergen-Belsen when they marched us in, were the big mountains of bodies.</span> <span id="s244">And I remember I just couldn’t take off my eyes from it.</span> <span id="s245">And there was another little girl, a little older than I, and she pulled on my hand, and her mother and I – her mother and her kind of adopted me.</span> <span id="s246">Except the rations when we got, sometimes the mother didn't give me my ration, she took some of the rations and gave it to her daughter.</span> <span id="s247">Everybody in Bergen-Belsen – sometimes, I remember going by the area where there was a kitchen, in back of the kitchen, and they had potato peels backed up there.</span> <span id="s248">And they pushed me through, because I was so small.</span> <span id="s249">And the first few times I brought out the potato peels, there was nothing left for me.</span> <span id="s250">And I remember some people telling me, oh you saving me by giving me, and I think the idea of helping somebody really sounded good for me.</span> <span id="s251">I remember the third and fourth time they pushed me in, I ate first, before I brought out some potato peels.</span> <span id="s252">Raven – Ravensbrück was bad, but Bergen-Belsen was horrible.</span> <span id="s253">I don’t know how long I was there, but all I remember that my f – I was so cold my feet got frozen.</span> <span id="s254">And I was going to go to the hospital or clinic, whatever they had there, and the women didn’t let me go, because they said, you go in there, you won’t have a leg left.</span> <span id="s255">I still have a little mark on my leg where it was frozen, but my leg wasn’t amputated.</span> <span id="s256">When I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen by the British on April 15th, I remember getting some food from some of the soldiers.</span> <span id="s257">And they looked at it – the children in marvel.</span> <span id="s258">I think the food I ate, or whatever, I became so sick, very soon afterwards.</span> <span id="s259">And while I was in – actually, it was, I didn’t get sick right away, it was like a f – little while later, because I remember meeting that Mrs. Gross who rented u-us the room.</span> <span id="s260">And she told me Eva, come on, I take you back.</span> <span id="s261">And I told her, I’m not going back to Budapest, to Hungary.</span> <span id="s262">I’m sure my mother is dead, otherwise she would have come and got me during this time.</span> <span id="s263">And probably my father was killed, too.</span> <span id="s264">I said, I’m going to live in the King’s castle in Sweden.</span> <span id="s265">I heard about the woman who took care of orphans in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s266">People were whispering about it, and heard – I – all I heard was that her name is Luba(ph).</span> <span id="s267">And I wanted someone to take care of me.</span> <span id="s268">I wanted to be together with other orphan children.</span> <span id="s269">And I said, I’m sure I’d be able to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s270">And I don’t remember the process going through, how I ended up.</span> <span id="s271">But before I ended up going to Sweden, I was in a ho – for a long time in a hospital because I was so sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s272">And there was a British doctor who really liked me.</span> <span id="s273">And he says, my wife and I don’t have any children, we’d like to adopt you.</span> <span id="s274">And I told him the same thing what I told Mrs. Gross, I want to live in the King’s castle.</span> <span id="s275">I had it so bad.</span> <span id="s276">I w – I want some servants, and I want people to take care of me.</span> <span id="s277">Well, I – just before I went on the boat to Sweden, I met the young girl who I connected in Bergen-Belsen, and her mother died.</span> <span id="s278">She apologized to me.</span> <span id="s279">And she hugged me and kissed me, she says, I’m sorry if we – any way you were hurt.</span> <span id="s280">And on the boat going over to Sweden, I remember there was another Hungarian girl who had the sister who was – he couldn’t speak – deaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Deaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: And after the first time I was interviewed, she actually got in contact with me because it – her husband worked at Yale.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: And my late husband became very sick and I never really connected with her, so this is something I’m – still have to do one of these days.</span> <span id="s285">So I ended up in Sweden.</span> <span id="s286">I don’t know exactly when I went.</span> <span id="s287">And I was in a orphanage, first time.</span> <span id="s288">We didn’t have no more schooling, but I started to learn.</span> <span id="s289">And we were being prepared to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s290">First time I was told I’m worth something, I’m special, I can do things.</span> <span id="s291">Look at, you survived, and you will be a soldier in Israel and you will help us build Israel.</span> <span id="s292">And I remember having campfires and singing and really had a wonderful comradeship, you know, with other children.</span> <span id="s293">I r – I remember being – going on the – you know, the slides, you know sa – i-in the snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: And just doing everything, you know, as a [indecipherable] so for me that was very special, I liked it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And you got to be a child in a w – in a wa – in a way that you weren’t able to.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I was – I wasn’t for quite some time.</span> <span id="s298">And then I – I remember – and I connected with Luba(ph) there.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I forgot to mention something, that I had the ring.</span> <span id="s301">And I kept that ring all through the camps under my tongue.</span> <span id="s302">Because that was – I felt if I survived, that’s the only way they’d be able to recognize me, because I changed so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: And while I was in Sweden, my – the ring became small on my finger, and I moved it to my little finger.</span> <span id="s305">And it slipped off, and it went down the drain.</span> <span id="s306">And that Luba(ph) was holding me for hours, and said, Eva – she didn’t speak Hungarian, so by that time I spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: She says, Eva, the ring is not who you are.</span> <span id="s309">Your mother will be always in your heart.</span> <span id="s310">And that was the end of my ring, but I had that very close connection with Luba(ph), and I talked about her many times.</span> <span id="s311">And when I was – okay, I get back to that.</span> <span id="s312">One day I’m being called that my father is alive, and he wants me to go back.</span> <span id="s313">And I think I had the telephone conversation with my father.</span> <span id="s314">Somehow they arranged it, and I remember telling my father, the only way I come home, if you promise you won’t argue any more, and you won’t play too much cards.</span> <span id="s315">Naturally, my father promised.</span> <span id="s316">And I must have spoken to him in German, because we were educated in German.</span> <span id="s317">And in 1947, January, I went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s318">And I didn’t know how to speak Hungarian, because – it wasn’t that long time, but apparently a child forgets easily, and learns.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: And by that time I’m 10 years, I just turned 10.</span> <span id="s321">And they enrolled me to a religious school.</span> <span id="s322">My father remarried, I had a new mother, and a new brother.</span> <span id="s323">And while chronologically I was 10, I survived for a few years by the wit, and a certain street smartness.</span> <span id="s324">And when somebody told me no, I wanted to know the reason behind it, when I came back.</span> <span id="s325">And my father said, what happened to you, it was horrible, but we are not going to talk about it.</span> <span id="s326">We want you to be, quote unquote, a normal child.</span> <span id="s327">And you will call your norm – new mother as mother, because she’s going to raise you, and you have a little brother.</span> <span id="s328">He was six months old when I came home.</span> <span id="s329">And you will go to school.</span> <span id="s330">They hired a tutor who – who was teaching me how to speak again Hungarian.</span> <span id="s331">Can we stop a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s333">[break] This is a continuation of the interview with Eva Brettler.</span> <span id="s334">Now you – your father came back from – for you, and you went back to Budapest, and you had a new mother and a new little brother.</span> <span id="s335">Did it surprise you that your father had remarried already?</span> <span id="s336">Cause it – there wasn’t a long time –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I was shocked.</span> <span id="s338">It was very short duration, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: And actually there’s some family disagreement about that, because some of my aunts, my father’s sister, said, how do you know she is dead?</span> <span id="s341">And then he said that he was told that she is dead.</span> <span id="s342">It happened more often.</span> <span id="s343">I – my father was the type of person who needed someone, and she – my stepmother, in many ways was good for him.</span> <span id="s344">She was a strict woman and everything, and she lost her first husband also, in the Holocaust, so there was something.</span> <span id="s345">And my father, when he wanted something, he went after her – and, very handsome man.</span> <span id="s346">And he had – she had difficulty and she was alone, and a lot of people connected after the war.</span> <span id="s347">And they got married in March ’45, and my brother was born in ’46, so you – you know.</span> <span id="s348">So it was little after a year.</span> <span id="s349">I brought up something when I was interviewed in 1982, I went and asked certain questions of my father, he was still alive.</span> <span id="s350">And my stepmother said, you stinker.</span> <span id="s351">You were so angry at me, you refused to talk to me.</span> <span id="s352">And I told her, Mama, I didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s353">All these years she was under the impression that I was angry at her, and that’s why I didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s354">I could speak with my father, my father spoke fluently Yiddish, and if you spoke German, Yiddish was understandable.</span> <span id="s355">It was, in a way, typical.</span> <span id="s356">She is a very strong woman, and unfortunately my brother is not doing as well as he could be doing in life.</span> <span id="s357">And partially had to do with maybe my father being a little too giving in to her needs.</span> <span id="s358">And I felt a little bit deserted by him.</span> <span id="s359">And mostly I felt deserted because I couldn’t talk about her.</span> <span id="s360">And a couple of times I approached him to talk about my mother, and he refused to tell me anything.</span> <span id="s361">So, whatever I found out about my mother was much later, when I connected with my mother’s sister, who survived.</span> <span id="s362">Her name is – was Blanca.</span> <span id="s363">And also with my aunts and uncle through my father’s side.</span> <span id="s364">So, I didn’t have an easy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I came home, my father at that time was running a grocery store.</span> <span id="s367">And before that he had some black marketing ways of doing things.</span> <span id="s368">I think for awhile they called him the salt king, because he went to Romania, brought back salt, and there was no salt in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: So, he had all kinds of ins and outs.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: And so he, you know – and I helped out occasionally, deliver things, you know, from the grocery store, until the communist government took over things.</span> <span id="s373">I ended up going to a Jewish school, a Orthodox school.</span> <span id="s374">And the first day I went to school I was taken to the principal office, the principal introduced me to my teacher, and the teacher had to go to the bathroom and he said something to me to go into the classroom.</span> <span id="s375">I misunderstood him, and I walked into a boys’ classroom, and they were saying the mor – you know, the morning prayer, the Modeh Ani.</span> <span id="s376">And I hang up my coat, and I hang up my backpack and I see everybody staring at me, feel kind of awkward.</span> <span id="s377">And the teacher ask me in Hungarian – I understood Hungarian, I just couldn't speak it – and the – he ask me, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s378">And I said – the teacher told me to come in.</span> <span id="s379">He says, you are on the wrong floor, you have to go a floor above.</span> <span id="s380">Well, all of a sudden everybody heard somebody speaking German.</span> <span id="s381">So I was nicknamed for awhile, the Kraut, which you can imagine how delicious that felt.</span> <span id="s382">But all of a sudden, people heard about me.</span> <span id="s383">There weren’t too many children that came back.</span> <span id="s384">And from early on I kind of took on certain – I don’t want to say leadership, but I was independent, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: And I spoke up, like I mentioned before, I questioned things.</span> <span id="s387">And people found out that I came back from the camps, and suddenly there were a lot of people coming to our home.</span> <span id="s388">And I remember people coming with pictures, wanting to know if I remember seeing some of their relatives, and so on.</span> <span id="s389">I’m 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: So as a 10 year old, I kind of adapted to the situation, and I remember crying and telling them, I’m sorry, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s392">And I promised to write.</span> <span id="s393">I don’t know how I even could promise [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s394">And I remember somebody said, I’ll give you the money to write.</span> <span id="s395">I said, give me the money after you get the answer, or something to that nature.</span> <span id="s396">Going back – and we had a grocery store, and I remember once getting a basket of like, those light biscuits.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: You have to remember, I lived in a place where sweets and things like that, I obviously had a sweet tooth, were limited.</span> <span id="s399">So I decided to have one, then another one.</span> <span id="s400">By the time I took it home, the box of biscuits were gone.</span> <span id="s401">And I couldn’t live it down.</span> <span id="s402">My stepmother was bringing it up all the time.</span> <span id="s403">So I ended up kind of getting mixed messages, you know.</span> <span id="s404">In one hand, they admired that I survived, on the other hand, at home I was miserable.</span> <span id="s405">I really was miserable.</span> <span id="s406">My stepmother’s mother, who left illegally with her son to displaced person place, she couldn’t stand it there and she came back.</span> <span id="s407">And if I turned at night, she accused me of doing something.</span> <span id="s408">I didn’t know what she was accusing me, but she – so I – I really had it difficult being home.</span> <span id="s409">So, I must have been about 11 and a half, I befriended a girl, and I said, can I move in with your mother?</span> <span id="s410">And I approached the mother, and she loved me.</span> <span id="s411">And she was a widowed woman, her husband didn't come back.</span> <span id="s412">And I made all the arrangements.</span> <span id="s413">I went home to pack, and my stepmother took me aside, she says, you cannot bring that kind of a shame on your father.</span> <span id="s414">You can’t do that.</span> <span id="s415">So that was kind of my childhood.</span> <span id="s416">I – I remember those days, punishment was that you were actually beaten, and my father tried to hit my brother and I stood between my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s417">So my father took off his belt, and I ended up getting a nice beating.</span> <span id="s418">So being home wasn’t exactly comfortable.</span> <span id="s419">Did I crave being among the kids I were, where I was one of many, and we kind of looked out for each other.</span> <span id="s420">The younger ones, you know, and the older ones looked out for me.</span> <span id="s421">So I – I realized I missed that.</span> <span id="s422">So from early age on, I realized that I had to look out for myself.</span> <span id="s423">And I think that stayed with me for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s424">Maybe it started already in the camps, and it continued.</span> <span id="s425">I made friends.</span> <span id="s426">I was selective, but I made good friends, and I kept them.</span> <span id="s427">I tried to be good friends, and they were good friends for me – to me.</span> <span id="s428">I – when I went to Israel, I found out that I probably cried more than I recall, because some of my old classmates were telling me they remember me crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Does – so when you went to this school, this Orthodox school, did – did you stand – besides being called the Kraut –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Didn’t last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s432">But did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No.</span> <span id="s434">They got the –</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: – were you the only chi – survi – were you the only child that came back from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did that – did the other children ask you about it?</span> <span id="s438">Did they talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: No.</span> <span id="s441">But they all knew that you ca – had come back from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: They knew that I came back from Sweden.</span> <span id="s443">How much they knew where I was, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I stayed in the Orthodox school until the state took over.</span> <span id="s446">So that was in the sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: So seventh and eighth grade, I had to go to the local school where – the district I belonged to.</span> <span id="s449">Apparently there was way of doing it, but it cost money and they decided I – not to do it for me.</span> <span id="s450">And from a straight A student, I went down, because I had the one teacher who picked on me non-stop, she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s451">And I used to be exceptionally good in math.</span> <span id="s452">And she was cruel to me, so I took a book with me to class, and when she was teaching, I was reading.</span> <span id="s453">So the pi – my parents were called in that I misbehave, and so on.</span> <span id="s454">So from a straight A student, she ridiculed me; oh, in the Jewish school they give good grades easier, don’t they?</span> <span id="s455">Next year, when I didn’t have her, my grades went back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I liked school.</span> <span id="s458">I liked to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: When I graduated at age 14, eighth grade was mandatory.</span> <span id="s461">My mother called together so called advisory committee, and they decided my grades, I’m not such a good student, I should go learn a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: And they found a place which didn’t work on Sabbath, because I wasn’t working on Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I started to work there, and I realized that something was happening to me which I really don’t like.</span> <span id="s466">And I worked in a textile factory, and I learned how to desi – you know, you had to design textile.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: And in the olden days they had – I’m – I’m sure I won’t have the English equalant of the word, but each thread you had to pull through a needle.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Mm-hm, like a loom.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah, and you made the design.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And that loom was put in a machine, and that’s how they made that.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Well, I was young, I did very fast, and I became a sztahanovista.</span> <span id="s475">Sztahanovista is a person who da – produces a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Well, the fellow workers were very upset with me, you shouldn’t work so fast, because the new norm will be much higher.</span> <span id="s478">So, I worked very hard, and I still got together occasionally with – I got together with the friends I made in the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s479">And I belonged to a group where we kind of had after school activities.</span> <span id="s480">And I realized I have to do something.</span> <span id="s481">So I am about – closer to 15 by now.</span> <span id="s482">I didn’t go to school for a year.</span> <span id="s483">I found out there is a school where they – you can become a chemist.</span> <span id="s484">I will try that.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: You said you like math.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I like math.</span> <span id="s487">In order to go, you had to go through a preparation class, and I did that.</span> <span id="s488">And I did exceptionally well, I had good math skills and so on.</span> <span id="s489">And they accepted me to school.</span> <span id="s490">But the problem was that the factory had to request for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s491">And I wasn’t in a communist party or anything, so I didn’t qualify.</span> <span id="s492">And the school requested me from the factory, because this factory send a few people to do, and they didn’t qualify, but I did.</span> <span id="s493">So I worked – oh, I forgot to tell you then, the hours changed, and I had to become a [indecipherable] Shabbas, that meant that I had to work on the Sabbath, too.</span> <span id="s494">And that hurt me more than anything else.</span> <span id="s495">And when I started school, it was at nighttime, so they couldn’t put me – I used to work either from six to two, or from two to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: And I was petrified because the factory was next to a cemetery, and at night to get to the bus stop I had to go by the cemetery, and I’m only 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: So I was – I’m surprised they allowed children that young to work that hours.</span> <span id="s500">But a lot of thing changed, because they took me out from the assembly line and I started to work in the lab.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s503">So, you actually hear more about my after –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: No, it’s – it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s505">I mean, especially, I mean, given your age, given your circumstance, the fact that you started school later than other kids, and you were able to – to achieve that –</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: – in such a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah, so I actually was working, and then the factory in the – where I worked, they send me out to work at university on research.</span> <span id="s509">I was going to a technical school at night.</span> <span id="s510">And I really – I befriended the person, you know, I had to give her my wages, and I befriended the person who gave me a phony paycheck.</span> <span id="s511">And I had some money to spend, because I was supposed to give all money – so I learned early on that there are certain back ways, yeah.</span> <span id="s512">And my relationship with my mother wasn’t too –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: – too good.</span> <span id="s515">And not because – I did try.</span> <span id="s516">I really tried, but if I hugged her, you squeezing me hard.</span> <span id="s517">So you know, it was – and – and my father wasn’t really there – that much there for me so the irony is that now my step – my father died, and I’m in charge of my grandma – my stepmother and I do take care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And your brother still –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: My brother is – he hasn’t worked for a number of years.</span> <span id="s520">My mother helps to support him and his family.</span> <span id="s521">He married, he has two young children.</span> <span id="s522">So, I really didn’t wanted to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I appreciate if you don’t talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: That’s fine.</span> <span id="s526">When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: So, when the revolution broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Aha, here we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I was on my way to school when I heard there will be a big demonstration front of the parliament.</span> <span id="s530">So I went with another girl who was about to get married.</span> <span id="s531">And I said, it’s a lot of – we – we should be there.</span> <span id="s532">So I was actually at the point where the revolution started, when all the speeches were going on and everything.</span> <span id="s533">When I got home that particular day, I remember I came home late, and my aunt and uncle were visiting from Szatmár.</span> <span id="s534">And everybody was waiting for me because in Europe the gates to the apartment building closed at 11 o’clock, and I was home much later, because there was no transportation, you had to walk home.</span> <span id="s535">And I told them that I probably will be leaving.</span> <span id="s536">By now I’m 20, 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I wasn’t quite 20 yet, but close to 20.</span> <span id="s539">And the revolution was October 23rd, and I would be – a – a few months later – a m – a month later, almost.</span> <span id="s540">And I went with another friend to the train station, packed up.</span> <span id="s541">The only thing I packed up to take with me was my Red Cross certificate in case I get caught, I would say that I came to help people who need help.</span> <span id="s542">And I brought my prayer book with me.</span> <span id="s543">And no pictures, nothing.</span> <span id="s544">Those were – and my photo i.d., which I still have.</span> <span id="s545">And the girl I started out with, she had more money, she could go with the transport.</span> <span id="s546">I met one of my stepmother’s cousin, who was helping other people cross, and he ended up taking maybe the bus, and several other family – families, we went to a little city called Burschavkine(ph) and I crossed the border there to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: And it was during the night, and it was a bigger transport of people.</span> <span id="s549">And I stayed behind with the family who had the young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s551">So you were cross – you crossed the border into Austria –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: – or you’re waiting to cross the border into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: We are cra – we actually crossed the border and we didn’t realize we were crossed already.</span> <span id="s555">So for awhile we were actually at night fumbling around in Austria when, you know, they were going around finding refugees.</span> <span id="s556">So, I was first on the outskirts of Vienna, and this family who I crossed with, their names were Fisher, and they were related to my stepmother’s first husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: It’s a small world.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: And there were a lot of young people who crossed, and I remember one saying all the Jews are leaving.</span> <span id="s561">So I turned to him, and what the hell are you doing here?</span> <span id="s562">So the guy was ready to beat me up, and this family, they put me in the middle of the children, next to the wives, and the husbands on the end.</span> <span id="s563">So they protected me.</span> <span id="s564">The next day we left.</span> <span id="s565">I had an address in Vienna, and we went up to Vienna.</span> <span id="s566">And I connected – in that particular place I connected with quite a few Orthodox kids I knew.</span> <span id="s567">And we went to somebody’s home who is – actually, he was a reporter from Austria, and he was related to one of the young men who I crossed with.</span> <span id="s568">And, I remember going into that apartment and the husband was caught in Hungary, and the wife was having a party.</span> <span id="s569">And when she seen us, she put us in the kitchen because we looked too dirty.</span> <span id="s570">She didn’t want it to ruin their party.</span> <span id="s571">So after that we ended up going into like a holding place, you know, it was a big s-school which was converted.</span> <span id="s572">And I stayed there for a short time, until they opened, the Orthodox community opened that big hotel.</span> <span id="s573">And I stayed there for a very short time.</span> <span id="s574">And through the Joint and HIAS, I ended up coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s575">But before the HIAS and the Joint accepted me, they gave me a prayer book.</span> <span id="s576">They wanted to make sure I know how to [indecipherable] I’m Jewish, because a lot of people claimed to be Jewish, who weren’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s577">And I got my traveling to the United States, when my parents arrived with my young brother.</span> <span id="s578">I actually sent somebody for them.</span> <span id="s579">And my father said that he had a passport fo – that was my letter with, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It wasn’t actually written out, but we had, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s582">And I arrived end of – they arrived end of December, and I was supposed to leave the following day.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And I didn’t want it to leave them.</span> <span id="s585">I thought it would be nice for me to be together, but they said their opportunity to come to the United States would be much better –</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: – if I’m here already.</span> <span id="s588">So I came to my stepmother’s brother and sister-in-law, and their three children.</span> <span id="s589">I couldn’t have been welcomed nicer if I would have gone to my first degree relatives.</span> <span id="s590">They never met me.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s592">Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: This was in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s594">First I went to Camp Kilmer, and from Camp Kilmer I had another incident when they said the Jewish – Jews are leaving and I told –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I had a big mouth those days already.</span> <span id="s597">And I told him, what are you doing here if –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: The same story as before.</span> <span id="s600">And I was in Camp Kilmer for a short time, then for maybe a couple of days in New York.</span> <span id="s601">And from New York they flew me, for the f – you know, the second time I’m flying, because from Sweden I flew back to Prague on a plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: And I arrived to – first to Chicago with a short stopover, and from Chicago to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s604">And my aunt and uncle and their children and her brother, and I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: – there must have been about 20 people waiting for me.</span> <span id="s607">And they just fi – they loved me, they fussed over me, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: – I really had a beautiful, beautiful connection.</span> <span id="s610">And for a long time my stepmother was a little jealous on her sister, you know, because I just connected totally, and I’m still very close with the chil – with the daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: What must it have been like – what was it like for you leaving cold Europe and winding up in sunny Los Angeles?</span> <span id="s612">I mean that – it’s a completely different –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: You know – don’t forget, I’m 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: So look a little different, a little slender.</span> <span id="s616">The taxi driver who took us from the place to the airport, he gives me some money.</span> <span id="s617">I mean, he had no – not money because he wanted something, it was – and the other people who were taking, he says, how about us?</span> <span id="s618">He says, I like her.</span> <span id="s619">So, I – I was overwhelmed with – first of all, overwhelmed in Vienna, was beautiful, but over there we went hungry a lot.</span> <span id="s620">And over when we – United States, I remember coming, when I see the Statue of Liberty, I was just – amazing.</span> <span id="s621">When – I wanted to go to Israel, and my stepmother said, you lived through too many wars.</span> <span id="s622">We have relatives here.</span> <span id="s623">You can go later to Israel, let’s go to United States, you can always go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I felt a little guilty coming here, but once I was here I managed to kind of adapt to the currency Jewish, and – and being with my aunt and uncle, my new cousin gave me private tutoring in English, I didn’t speak a single word English, but he was – Robert must have been like seven, eight years younger than I am, had a little crush on me.</span> <span id="s626">And my ha – the youngest one, who was Stanley, he says, wait for me, I will marry you.</span> <span id="s627">So I knew.</span> <span id="s628">It was all of a sudden, you know, it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I went to work here and I worked – I went to Jewish Family Service, and they found me a job, and my first job as a chemist.</span> <span id="s631">They thought, if you do chemistry, you can become a – dye clothes in a cleaner.</span> <span id="s632">Well, the problem dyeing clothes in a cleaner was that that was so heavy, and to move those heavy things, I just couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s633">Oh, I had a job before that, that was even funnier.</span> <span id="s634">I – it was where you make window shades.</span> <span id="s635">And he says, I give you more hours to work, stay and work.</span> <span id="s636">And then he says, I also want you to meet my son.</span> <span id="s637">I told my father, I’m not going back to that place.</span> <span id="s638">You know, I was very naïve, and it kind of – you know, a Orthodox girl, and they didn’t have those many days –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: – religious girls.</span> <span id="s641">So I think they started to match you up very early on.</span> <span id="s642">So coming to the United States, and walking around, and seeing all the things, it was absolutely amazing.</span> <span id="s643">I met my late husband probably about four months after I came to the States.</span> <span id="s644">My parents arrived and then I moved back with them.</span> <span id="s645">And I lived in the Orthodox area.</span> <span id="s646">And they were trying to match you up daily.</span> <span id="s647">I had a blind date, somebody came to the house, one guy I had nothing to do with.</span> <span id="s648">The second one was pretty smart.</span> <span id="s649">He came in, he sized up the situation, he seen that my stepmother was the person in charge, and he started to talk with her.</span> <span id="s650">And I played the games with some of my brother’s friends.</span> <span id="s651">And he kept on calling, and four weeks later we got engaged, four weeks later I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s653">And how long were you married for?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Until, unfortunately, he died in 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: We were married 31 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s660">How many grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Not enough.</span> <span id="s662">I have nine grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Oh, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Eight – eight natural, and my daughter married somebody who had the child from the first marriage.</span> <span id="s665">And my late husband was very, very supportive.</span> <span id="s666">He wanted me to learn everything, early on.</span> <span id="s667">Not typical European man.</span> <span id="s668">And while the kids were young, I did the same thing what I did at home.</span> <span id="s669">I went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I got a degree here, I went back – and went to UCLA, got a degree in psychology and I’ve worked as a social worker at Jewish Family Services.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s673">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: That’s fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: And my late husband was a electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s677">He was also a survivor.</span> <span id="s678">Unfortunately, he never talked about his experience.</span> <span id="s679">His father was killed the last day of the war in Debrecen, which is in Hungary.</span> <span id="s680">And to some extent it turned him against religion.</span> <span id="s681">And so the kids kind of had to do a message about religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Mm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: One of my daughters sends her children to reli – to Jewish school.</span> <span id="s684">The other ones are more into science.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And do you have any influence on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: In the science, a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yes, a little.</span> <span id="s690">Buying all your grandkids their first chemistry set, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s692">I have one son, my oldest son became a rabbi, he’s not having a congregation or works in that field.</span> <span id="s693">My second son became a physician.</span> <span id="s694">My daughter is an architect, and my youngest daughter has a doc – a PhD in neuroscience.</span> <span id="s695">And, when the money ran out for research, she went back to school, and she is teaching now.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: And I am very proud of all of my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Yes, I can see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s700">Thank you.</span> <span id="s701">And I’m going to show you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Actually, some of these pictures –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s705">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: My son put it together just be –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: This is my mother.</span></p> <p><span

from.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Oh, my mother was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: This is my grandmother, my father’s mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span> <span id="s717">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: This is me when I worked in a lab here.</span> <span id="s719">And that’s my late husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: And that’s my late husband’s mu – brother.</span> <span id="s722">I don’t know why he made the double.</span> <span id="s723">And these are my grandkiddellas.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s725">Wow, what a legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s727">And turn one more page, I don’t even know what’s on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: These are the married pictures.</span> <span id="s730">This is the son who is not married, and the other three are.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s732">That’s just amazing.</span> <span id="s733">And this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: This is a family picture.</span> <span id="s735">It was taken a few years back.</span> <span id="s736">Both of them are family pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s738">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: This is my stepmother, she’s in a wheelchair now.</span> <span id="s740">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: So, you kind of have an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: You have a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s747">A Dafka for Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Why don’t you think about it?</span> <span id="s750">What else would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Oh, well, you were very thorough.</span> <span id="s752">I mean, I know there’s little things that – we’re never gonna get everything in every interview, unfortunately, but I guess I just – when you went back to Hungary after you left Sweden, when your father came for you and you still didn’t speak hu – you didn’t speak Hungarian any more.</span> <span id="s753">And you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: That’s a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s756">And you were learning Hungarian again.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did you forget your German?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I forgot my German, I forgot my Polish.</span> <span id="s762">I could talk to my fr-friend’s father now.</span> <span id="s763">I forgot Swedish.</span> <span id="s764">When I came out in ’56 from Hungary, within a month I almost spoke again.</span> <span id="s765">So apparently is somewhere buried, and it needs to be retrieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I tried Swedish, I have a friend who wa – is Swedish, and made no sense.</span> <span id="s768">So maybe too much time lapsed now.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Don’t forget that was a – one was 10 years later, and the other one was – is now 60 year – you know, it’s a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Do you know what happened to your father while your mother, you and your mother were –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: – running all over in – in – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: He was in a forced labor camp, which quite a few Jewish men were.</span> <span id="s775">And he worked, you know, whatever work they had to do.</span> <span id="s776">And he also did some black marketing while he was in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s777">He always did sa – you know, he – he sold and he bought and I don’t know how he did it, but he did it.</span> <span id="s778">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: And he was – he was in Budapest, or – the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: He wasn’t in Budapest, he was somewhere else [indecipherable] of Budapest.</span> <span id="s781">I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: But he was in the general area, he wasn’t sent –</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: He was sent outside of –</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Yeah, he was working outside.</span> <span id="s786">And like I said, unfortunately, I really never got the story from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s789">A-All I know, that he got a letter from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s790">And the letter said, all these years I tried to help you to grow up.</span> <span id="s791">I’m s – we are starving.</span> <span id="s792">My grandmother was together with my aunt, who had twin children.</span> <span id="s793">And they were famished.</span> <span id="s794">And there were witnesses who seen my grandmother, that beautiful grandmother of mine, who was marched into the gas chamber holding onto one of her twin grandchilds.</span> <span id="s795">Yeah.</span> <span id="s796">And the husband, the son-in-law survived, and my aunt kept in touch with him.</span> <span id="s797">He remarried after war and have a other family.</span> <span id="s798">But most of – all my aunts and young uncles were killed.</span> <span id="s799">My grandfather, my father’s father, died just before the war.</span> <span id="s800">So I went back to Szatmár and I visited his graveside.</span> <span id="s801">So there is a graveside for him in Szatmár.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Because it was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes, and apparently there are – a lot of people put it – Szatmár is a well known Orthodox commun – you know, was a very well known, that big yeshiva is there.</span> <span id="s804">And I remember visiting there as a child, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s805">I did some mischievous thing there too.</span> <span id="s806">I let out the neighbor’s rabbit.</span> <span id="s807">I don’t know what the rabbit was doing there, and I know that I got in trouble.</span> <span id="s808">I did some mischievous thing as – like I said, I was a spoiled little girl</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: From early age on I kind of did things which maybe I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s811">And I’m much better now.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Is it true?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: For the record, she’s shaking her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A2: Yeah, I’m allowed to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Yes, you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A2: I’m her best friend [indecipherable] sister, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Is –</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: [whispering] I know.</span> <span id="s820">Have fun, enjoy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: I guess the la – when – one of the things that I’m curious about is, you know, you were seeing all of these dead bodies as a child.</span> <span id="s822">Did it – were you afraid of them, or were you afraid that you would be one of them?</span> <span id="s823">I mean, I guess – it’s – it’s one of those things –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: You know, whenever I see dead bodies, I always look for my mother.</span> <span id="s825">And for, I think I was already married when probably I stopped.</span> <span id="s826">I was always hoping that either she had amnesia or something, and somehow she will come back again, find me.</span> <span id="s827">I think the idea of losing my mother – she was not only my mother, but she really gave me the inner strength from very, very early age on.</span> <span id="s828">And my mother was amazing, I didn’t bring that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: She risk her life, and she smuggled food in for people who were incarcenated or something.</span> <span id="s831">So, I looked up on her.</span> <span id="s832">She was beautiful, she was – she was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: While my father was, you know, all over.</span> <span id="s835">He – my father was a very good man, people adored him, he was hu-humorous.</span> <span id="s836">I mean, he made the jokes all the time, and my fr – girlfriends were – thought my father was somebody – you know, the-they used to come over and stare at him.</span> <span id="s837">I think I missed my mother tremendously, in a sense that – especially when my – she and I were in hiding in this – you know, and my father wasn’t in the picture any more.</span> <span id="s838">She really talked to me like an adult, and confined in me and tore me like – I didn't tell you about stories that, when we were on the far – fictitious – you know, for – you know, we were in hiding with that man.</span> <span id="s839">And I remember walking, and she taught me how to put the cross on me.</span> <span id="s840">And at that time already I’m seven and half, eight?</span> <span id="s841">I’m eight probably – no, not eight, because eight I was already in the camp.</span> <span id="s842">Instead of putting the cross, I scratched myself.</span> <span id="s843">And my mother said, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s844">She said with one word, and next minute she kissed me, that I couldn’t put a cross on me.</span> <span id="s845">So, she kind of seen the good in me, which for – you know, I – I think that reassurance meant a lot to me, and that acceptance.</span> <span id="s846">I really looked up to her, she was someone very special.</span> <span id="s847">And she could put up with my Papa, which wasn’t the easiest thing those days.</span> <span id="s848">It’s kind of sad because when my father became sick he totally withdrawn.</span> <span id="s849">He was making jokes and everything, and when he got sick he became withdrawn, he didn’t go to the shul any more.</span> <span id="s850">He used to go every morning, you know, to daven, you know what that means.</span> <span id="s851">Yeah.</span> <span id="s852">And when he became sick he totally withdrew himself and he – when my late husband died, he died in ’87, December 24th, it was such a big loss for my father, losing my husband.</span> <span id="s853">It was – he really looked up to him, they really did a lot of things together.</span> <span id="s854">My late husband was a wonderful chess player, and my father was a good chess player, they played chess.</span> <span id="s855">They played pinochle together, you know, cards together.</span> <span id="s856">So – and I took, you know, my fa – I left my late husband home, he played cards with my father, or played chess with my father.</span> <span id="s857">And if one of them won you heard about it for days, or vice-a-versa.</span> <span id="s858">And I took my stepmother shopping, you know.</span> <span id="s859">So, you know, there was a division between it.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: And I did play – I didn’t play chess with my late husband, but I played a mean player – mean hand of cards, and so did my kids.</span> <span id="s862">My kids, from early age on got tremendous amount of self reliance, in a sense.</span> <span id="s863">You have to be independent, because my brother wasn’t so independent, and we wanted to kind of – we kind of over –</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: And the kids’ education was – emphasis put on, to the highest degree.</span> <span id="s866">And my late husband took such pride in it that all of us became college graduate, including his wife, you know, over here.</span> <span id="s867">And my kids were exceptionally good students.</span> <span id="s868">My – one of my daughter attended Harvard, you know, as a undergraduate.</span> <span id="s869">And – to become, you know, the professions they choose, and they are still leaders in their community, so they learned something at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: And I, as a young American I had an accent, much worse probably than even today, and I was active in school activities.</span> <span id="s872">I was the treasurer for the Boy Scouts, for the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s873">I became a room mother representative.</span> <span id="s874">So I – I was a typical American.</span> <span id="s875">I visited women who didn’t have husbands and helped them out, you know, to connect them.</span> <span id="s876">And then my late husband says, you do it anyway, go back to sc – get the degree, and – and do it full time.</span> <span id="s877">So I went back to school and I did it because I still tend to overextend myself.</span> <span id="s878">I have that tendency.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: You’re living life.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I try to give back, because I feel that I survived, and I survived because of, as a young child I probably couldn’t have survived if somebody wouldn't have give a kindness to me, but they did.</span> <span id="s881">And I, if I can help somebody, I like the idea of helping, and through the Child Survivor organization, I made friends, which is a combination of friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s882">I – to some extent they are maybe closer than you can be to some relatives, because you can talk about the pains and everything.</span> <span id="s883">And nonjudgmental.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Do you find that a lot?</span> <span id="s885">Do you find that – that people judge you because you did survive, or – have you experienced that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s887">My poor stepmother’s mother, her son Shlymie(ph) was killed, and he was apparently a saint.</span> <span id="s888">I never knew him.</span> <span id="s889">And she told me.</span> <span id="s890">Not once, not twice.</span> <span id="s891">And then she apologized, you know.</span> <span id="s892">But she personally told me, and I have been told, you know.</span> <span id="s893">We went to conference, I will never forget, the guy wasn’t aware that I was in camp.</span> <span id="s894">He said, what do you know, you were just a child, and you were not even in the camps.</span> <span id="s895">Or, you were Hungarian, you were a shorter length of time.</span> <span id="s896">So, you know, they don’t even know, but they look at you as a child, and you know, you were a child, how would you know what suffering really was?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I mean, suffering was pretty crucial.</span> <span id="s899">I mean, there was a time I had clothes, in Bergen-Belsen I remember I put something under my hat that – and I slept on it, that you know, I was together with Gypsies, couldn’t get away from Gypsies.</span> <span id="s900">So, there were Gypsies in the same barrack where I was.</span> <span id="s901">And in the morning, it was gone.</span> <span id="s902">And I remember putting some kind of a blank – it wasn’t a blanket, but something like it, around me.</span> <span id="s903">And when I had to stand achtung, you know, the line-up, the woman throwed it off from me, the same way, you know, with that stick.</span> <span id="s904">When I see those sticks it scares the daylight out of me.</span> <span id="s905">And for a long time I was petrified of darks, too.</span> <span id="s906">So it – it was really – I mean, I listened to some older survivor describe and it – flashes come back to you.</span> <span id="s907">You know, things which you think you forgot, and then kind of ha – I go to sleep and all of a sudden I – I see certain things which I didn’t realize that they were – some were stored in the memory, they laying.</span> <span id="s908">And it – they come forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: And like, recently, just in – I think it was in June, I was involved in the Bearing Witness program with UCLA, did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: And I was matched up with a young man who comes from a Iranian background, I think he was born here already.</span> <span id="s913">And we had like three or four sessions together.</span> <span id="s914">We met for lunch, and – and I remember when I told him how old I was in Bergen-Belsen, he went in almost like a state of shock.</span> <span id="s915">And I remember touching him and holding him.</span> <span id="s916">His – I said, I’m here.</span> <span id="s917">And he just couldn’t – what did you do all day, was his a – a question.</span> <span id="s918">How could you be here?</span> <span id="s919">So I realized it’s – even for me, when I look at my grandkids, it’s hard to believe that a person at that age, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s920">God forbid nobody should be tested on it.</span> <span id="s921">And I – when last year I came back from Israel, I went to visit my daughter, because my granddaughter’s birthday is November 15th.</span> <span id="s922">So I came back two days later, I flew to Seattle.</span> <span id="s923">And I looked on my granddaughter, she just turned eight.</span> <span id="s924">And I realized I was in the camp, I probably didn’t even know what day it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: And tears got into my eyes and I started to cry.</span> <span id="s927">And my daughter and I went a little later on a ride, and she says, Mom, I can’t handle it.</span> <span id="s928">I can’t handle the idea of knowing what pain you went through, and I can’t handle you associating it with my daughter.</span> <span id="s929">So I heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: And I – I’m respecting it, and I – I make a point of not bringing it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: But my other daughters – my story was written up re-recently in the L.A. Jewish Journal.</span> <span id="s934">It was about four or five people were in the Indestructible Spirit project, I don’t know if you heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: I haven’t heard about that, but you seem like a good subject for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Well, and they quote me – they took a picture of my youngest grandson and I. Bill Aron, did you hear of Bill Aron?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: He’s a very well known photographer and he – he took pictures of quite a few survivors.</span> <span id="s939">And there was a write-up, you know, somebody interviewed me, and er – and the story about the potato peels was written on.</span> <span id="s940">And with my grandson, I am holding my grandson.</span> <span id="s941">And my 10 – 12 year old grandson was reading it.</span> <span id="s942">That’s my Grandma.</span> <span id="s943">So, in a way he – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: You know, there are stories which happened, and cruelty which happened, some of them I probably still cannot talk about.</span> <span id="s946">And maybe they are better –</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Left unsaid, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: – not to be said.</span> <span id="s949">I have memories of sted – trying to find a solid surface to put my head against it, to kill the lice which were biting.</span> <span id="s950">I mean, it was so painful.</span> <span id="s951">I mean, how can you da – talk about things of that nature?</span> <span id="s952">It happened.</span> <span id="s953">And then I remember about my feet when it was frozen, and it was painful.</span> <span id="s954">And people, total strangers who never knew me, were holding onto me so I don’t go into there and don’t have my feet amputated, or probably killed.</span> <span id="s955">So cruelty still happens today, and injustice still happens today, and probably the reason I started to speak now, and I wanted to give my oral in – interview to you, because if we can stop only one person – and that particular young man I mentioned to you I met through UCLA, he said it was one of the most meaningful experience I had til now in my life, he says, seeing you at UCLA, he says, to me, to meet a survivor and to see where you are today.</span> <span id="s956">So, you hear my reason for being here.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: I do, and I appreciate your time and I appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Thank you, and I felt –</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: – your strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: – a very strong bond with you, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s961">You have the face, you could be one of my – you are too young to be my child, maybe a grandchild, not quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Well, thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: This – this concludes our interview with Eva Brettler.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s966">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s967">PAGE 4 Interview with Eva Brettler</span></p> <p><span id="s968">November 9, 2008</span></p></body></html>
