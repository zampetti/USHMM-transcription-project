Jegher.</span> <span id="s6">My name before the war at home, I was called Chaim David and I was born in a town called Ronadejus in Transylvania in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: What was the year of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: September 17, 1927.</span> <span id="s9">I was living at home with my mother and father and we were a family of six children, three girls and three boys.</span> <span id="s10">My two older sisters were married.</span> <span id="s11">One was living in a city called Siget and she had two children.</span> <span id="s12">She married a man by the name of Ignatz Hershkowitz.</span> <span id="s13">My second older sister was married and I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s14">I know Ashmael but I don’t remember the family name.</span> <span id="s15">Anyway the whole problem started with all the suffering we endured.</span> <span id="s16">I was thirteen years old when we couldn’t go from town to town and we had to register and we had to close the front windows to the house facing the street.</span> <span id="s17">Jews couldn’t travel on trains.</span> <span id="s18">It was long- suffering and one day the military came in.</span> <span id="s19">It was a Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s20">My mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: This was in 1940 about?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In 1944 and my mother was cooking the Shabbos dinner and of course we were all at home because we were not allowed to go anyplace and they told us whatever we can carry to make a package.</span> <span id="s23">We have to go with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Were these iron guards who came or were these gendarmes or the military?</span> <span id="s25">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s27">I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s28">All I know is that when we were leaving, whatever, we made a package that everybody could carry, whatever you could carry.</span> <span id="s29">My mother was crying and telling my father, this is what we worked all our lives.</span> <span id="s30">This is what we worked and tried to make a family life and try to make, you know, to eventually be able to achieve something and now we have everything.</span> <span id="s31">What we have now is just what we can carry in our bags.</span> <span id="s32">We had a very prosperous farm, orchard with trees.</span> <span id="s33">We had cattle, but my father was also what I would call it -------- transportation or something.</span> <span id="s34">What it was.</span> <span id="s35">There was no cars, it was primitive, there was no cars, no machineries but when anybody wanted to go into the city my father drove two horses with a wagon that people got on the wagon to go to the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What city would you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: To Siget.</span> <span id="s38">And anybody wanted to come back, they also got on the wagon and they came back and he was passing a few towns on the way until we got where we were living.</span> <span id="s39">Also on the way to Siget in the morning there was country stores all in these villages, towns that my father stopped and got a list from the country stores whatever it needed and he went into Siget, bought it, brought it to them so they would have the things they were looking for, they need.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So he made regular trips?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Every day except Shabbos.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: These people would pay him for the ride into Siget?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s44">So in other words there were many things that pertained to conduct a way of making a living.</span> <span id="s45">For instance, one way is to have transportation for people to bring them into the city and also back.</span> <span id="s46">And also on the way into the city, the farmers who had cows or sheep that milk, they had it in containers and we took the containers from them and we took it into the main creamery in the city and they made cream, whipped cream, butter and then we brought the empty containers back and we dropped them off.</span> <span id="s47">We did this six days a week.</span> <span id="s48">One way of making a living was taking in the milk which was also from our farm and from the other farmers and picking up the list from the country store…</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Of their needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Of their needs, and a country store was not just anything like you have a store here.</span> <span id="s51">I mean a country store over there, we bought petroleum, we bought whiskey, we bought flour, we bought whatever in the world it was.</span> <span id="s52">A general store everything that the farmers or the people in the villages needed.</span> <span id="s53">And that was usually the only store and therefore there were no separate stores for this or separate stores for that.</span> <span id="s54">So this is what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: This was two horses.</span> <span id="s56">It must have been a pretty large wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s58">You could seat at least twenty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: How long was the journey from your town to Siget?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: About an hour and a half, two hours.</span> <span id="s61">Also it was big because of the hills and the mountains which you have to go through.</span> <span id="s62">There was very steep hill that it was very difficult to get up in the winter time or even when you had on the way from the city that you were bringing back to the people flour and petroleum.</span> <span id="s63">This was very heavy.</span> <span id="s64">When you loaded up the wagon it weighed like a railroad car and to pull up the steep hills, to cross over into the villages, it was very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: I suppose you had to help pull or push the wagon, or did the horses manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: The horses pushed and you put your elbow and you pushed along with them and a lot of times depending on the weather you just didn’t have enough power to pull it.</span> <span id="s67">So we went to the nearby farm and they came in and lend us another horse or two that we put up to help pull over the mountain.</span> <span id="s68">Just as hard as it was going to get up on the mountain, it was just as difficult getting down, to hold back all that weight.</span> <span id="s69">And you got to the point where you were about holding it to the middle of the mountain going down and then you just lost control and it would just shoot down and anything happen.</span> <span id="s70">It was God’s will.</span> <span id="s71">Sometimes the horses were trying to hold it back.</span> <span id="s72">They held it back as much as they could and then they just used to just like slide down on the hind legs on the ground and the weight from the wagon was just pulling them down and sometime one horse was holding back so hard that they pulled the whole wagon into the ditch on the side where the water was running.</span> <span id="s73">Then we had a hard time.</span> <span id="s74">We had to unload it, put everything on the street and get the wagon out and load it up again.</span> <span id="s75">It was a very hard life but it was home.</span> <span id="s76">I mean we had a very, very strong family unity.</span> <span id="s77">And we always -- sometimes it was very little to eat and sometimes whatever it was we sat at a table and we shared.</span> <span id="s78">And my mother, may she rest in peace, she always fed everybody and sometimes there wasn’t anything left and she just went without.</span> <span id="s79">And I saw that myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Where were you in the range of children?</span> <span id="s81">Were you one of the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, I was the fourth one.</span> <span id="s83">Then, of course, I had relatives.</span> <span id="s84">I had, of course, grandparents.</span> <span id="s85">My mother’s side lived in the same town where we lived.</span> <span id="s86">And, of course, my father’s parents lived with us.</span> <span id="s87">My grandfather, both of my grandfathers had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: While you were a kid they died or even before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: They died before the problem started.</span> <span id="s90">But my grandmother, my father’s mother, she was in bed all the time, she was something wrong with her, and of course we carried her to the train when we were leaving.</span> <span id="s91">And we took her and she was in the wagon even when we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s92">And of course my other grandmother was still walking.</span> <span id="s93">Then my father had one brother and three sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: All living in Ronadejus?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Two of them were living in Ronadejus.</span> <span id="s96">The others were living in some other towns.</span> <span id="s97">My mother had a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s98">Her brother luckily enough before all this trouble started, he emigrated to Argentina and his children, I mean my uncle, I happened to see him after the war.</span> <span id="s99">He moved from Argentina to Israel and he died just about a couple of years ago now.</span> <span id="s100">But his children, my cousins, are still living now.</span> <span id="s101">But my mother’s two sisters, the husbands and the children, they all perished in Auschwitz My father was, they were very poor when they got married.</span> <span id="s102">They didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s103">He started all of this so-called enterprises, whatever, a way that was needed and in order to be able to support the family and the money that he made from this -- taking all these things to the villages and into the town and everything else, we bought land.</span> <span id="s104">We had beautiful orchards with apples, pears, plums.</span> <span id="s105">We ended up making our own whiskey because I remember big, big drums like they have gas storage tanks that they used to put in all the fruit.</span> <span id="s106">And there was a little thing coming out from the bottom after whatever long it took, and the whiskey was coming out and we made our own wine and we also made our own dried fruit.</span> <span id="s107">And we sold it not only to the markets in Romania at the time but we also sold it to the neighboring countries like Czechoslovakia and Hungary and this and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: How did you manage to sell to other countries?</span> <span id="s109">Was there a co-op set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So you must have produced a mass of dried fruit, a fairly large amount?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s113">I remember when I was a little boy that in the summertime, whatever manure from the cows was piled up in big piles.</span> <span id="s114">And in the wintertime when the snow was you chopped it up in chunks and you loaded it in a sled and you hauled it into the fields for fertilizer.</span> <span id="s115">During the daytime my father was taking care of whatever he had to do the business of, I don’t know what would you call that, transportation or whatever.</span> <span id="s116">And at nighttime we worked in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: You’d better believe it.</span> <span id="s119">I mean that was the kind of situation.</span> <span id="s120">There was no clock, there was no nothing.</span> <span id="s121">You devoted your whole time working in the fields.</span> <span id="s122">And then, of course, when the summer came, you have to plow it and you plowed it with the horses not with tractors.</span> <span id="s123">Every time you cleared more trees to make more land, clearing for farm land to be able to.</span> <span id="s124">One time my oldest brother was already taken from us into what they called forced labor by the Hungarians because during my time when I was going in school which reminds me another situation.</span> <span id="s125">When I was going in school and I was four years in public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: This was Romanian public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Romanian public schools.</span> <span id="s128">I had very little time to do my homework because when I came home I had to do the chores in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did you have specific duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes I had to clean all the stables and see that the milking cows were fed.</span> <span id="s131">And my sister did my homework.</span> <span id="s132">As a matter of fact, when we started school, I flunked the first year because I never did my homework.</span> <span id="s133">But my sister that was a year younger from me, she started school the following year and she did her homework and she did my homework.</span> <span id="s134">But I was bright enough that I really did very well not from studying at home, just for being in school and doing it when the teacher was doing the stuff.</span> <span id="s135">Then the problem came when the Hungarian took over that part.</span> <span id="s136">I started the fifth year in school with a Hungarian teacher that only spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s137">I never spoke Hungarian in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: It’s a foreign language to many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes and what happened was, I was very good in arithmetic.</span> <span id="s140">We used to have tests like who could answer faster like five times five, five times three, eight times nine.</span> <span id="s141">I always was the winner.</span> <span id="s142">But we had the test in Hungarian and I lost because I had to transfer the Hungarian to Romanian or to Yiddish.</span> <span id="s143">Even today when I am figuring a bill, when I had my catering, people used to always be amazed because I figured in Yiddish, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Is that what you spoke at home, Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s146">We spoke Yiddish at home and I spoke Romanian in school.</span> <span id="s147">And then in the fifth year I had to learn Hungarian.</span> <span id="s148">And it was a very hard thing.</span> <span id="s149">And one of the things that really hurt me --– when we were leaving the house, when they were taking us to --- they took us to the ghetto, there was one of the guys who was my best friend all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: A Jewish guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, a gentile.</span> <span id="s152">His father was the post office man.</span> <span id="s153">He delivered the mail.</span> <span id="s154">We were very close friends.</span> <span id="s155">We were practically every day together.</span> <span id="s156">When I was leaving, when we were taken, I had on a red sweater with no sleeves.</span> <span id="s157">It was man-made.</span> <span id="s158">The guy that was taking us told me to take my sweater off.</span> <span id="s159">Would you believe it I saw him take my sweater, he took it with a stick ---</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Didn’t want to touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And he gave it to my best friend because my best friend asked him to get it for him.</span> <span id="s162">And he was wearing a rifle but it was not a real one.</span> <span id="s163">It was made out of wood just so that he had the authority.</span> <span id="s164">This is something that I could never believe.</span> <span id="s165">I never went back there and if I ever do I’m gonna take a sweater off him.</span> <span id="s166">If it’s the last thing in my life I’m gonna do.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were there many Jews in that community?</span> <span id="s168">What was the breakdown in terms of gentiles and Jews in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: There was about, for that time of the world it was considered to be a lot.</span> <span id="s170">It was two hundred families.</span> <span id="s171">And there was about half of them, Jews.</span> <span id="s172">There was only one main street that the whole town consisted of, but there was a lot of homes in the back fields and in the woods.</span> <span id="s173">Most of the homes, I would say seventy-five percent that were built on the main road were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s174">The Jewish people had more or less -- it was even in those days like we had a kitchen that we were, you know the floor was nothing but a mud floor because I remember my mother once a week used to bring mud and make it soft with water and just take the hand and go over and give it a fresh go-over.</span> <span id="s175">But still in all it had a table and chairs and we were eating with knives and forks and we had kosher dairy dishes and meat dishes.</span> <span id="s176">My father was very religious.</span> <span id="s177">My mother was ---</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Chassid or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, I never knew the word Chassid at the time but I do know I never saw anybody anywhere in America or anywhere I have been that could have been more religious than my father.</span> <span id="s180">My mother wore what they call a sheitl and I remember when my sisters got married they cut their hair.</span> <span id="s181">And they cried.</span> <span id="s182">I remember that.</span> <span id="s183">We lived, for instance, a lot of the gentiles that were living in that area, they had a house.</span> <span id="s184">But their house consisted of four walls and in the corner was a bed and in the other corner was a stove which was heated with wood.</span> <span id="s185">In the wintertime they kept this wood going, the stove.</span> <span id="s186">This is how they heated and they all slept in one bed and all around, whatever.</span> <span id="s187">But we had beds.</span> <span id="s188">We were civilized people.</span> <span id="s189">We had beds.</span> <span id="s190">Everybody had their own bed.</span> <span id="s191">We might had a room where we had three kids sleeping in the same room, whatever, but we had beds and we each had a bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Was this one floor this house, one story?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yeah, one floor.</span> <span id="s194">In the summertime we still continued, for instance, we had our own, like they call here a pizza oven, we had one that was built out of brick.</span> <span id="s195">And we heated it with wood, made it hot, and the oven got hot and my mother baked bread and also she put Friday in the cholent for Shabbos and she put it in the oven with the coal created by the wood and you can imagine if a woman today would have to go out and get wood and create the oven, this baker oven, which was like a huge boiler which was built out of stone and brick.</span> <span id="s196">You bring the wood and you put it in and you light the fire and you create coal and when it’s hot enough you put in all the pots and have like a 24 by 36 opening and you sealed it and you used wet mud to seal it so the heat will not escape, and then you opened that Saturday after you come home from shul and that’s what we ate Saturday, the cholent and the kugel and all that and it was always very delicious.</span> <span id="s197">There’s nothing ever comparising to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Was this oven outside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, it was a corner of the house.</span> <span id="s200">Like let’s say when you come in from the front, the front part like three-quarters was the kitchen and then there was a wall with a door that you went into the other room, that was the other corner of the house.</span> <span id="s201">That corner was built where the baker-oven was built.</span> <span id="s202">It had a big chimney going up and this is how my mother baked the bread and put the food in for the cholent and things like that.</span> <span id="s203">And we had a wooden stove in the kitchen which was lined with brick.</span> <span id="s204">This was how we cooked and this is how we heated the winter.</span> <span id="s205">When you went to sleep and I’m telling you it was bitter cold, none of the rooms were ever heated, wherever you went to sleep but you never had to worry because you had feather quilts.</span> <span id="s206">You was really in no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you attend cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Oh yes, I attended it’s not a cheder.</span> <span id="s209">I mean I didn’t have to be in public school until nine o’clock so I started cheder in the morning like 6:30.</span> <span id="s210">Then when I finished cheder my mother waited for me to give me something to eat and I was eating while I walked to public school.</span> <span id="s211">And when I got out of public school again she waited for me to give me something to eat and then I went to cheder till nine o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So morning and night you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah and I also of course had a lot of Shabbos.</span> <span id="s214">You know they had teachers and lectures and things like that.</span> <span id="s215">And I spent a whole day in cheder, Sunday, because there was no public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And your chores on top of all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Chores on top of that.</span> <span id="s218">And of course, then they took us to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: This was the Ordea ghetto, the Siget ghetto or Ordea?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, it was across the river.</span> <span id="s221">It was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s222">It’s called Slotyna, Solopvina in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s223">That’s where they got all the Jews from the whole area because when the Hungarian came in, they already had occupied Czechoslovakia, it was Hungary.</span> <span id="s224">Then when they came in, took over the Carpathian Mountain it became Hungary, too.</span> <span id="s225">So all of it was already one and when they got the Jews from all the towns and from the big city, from Siget they formed the ghetto in what used to be Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s226">It used to be Slotyna and in Yiddish they used to refer to as Solopvina.</span> <span id="s227">They cramped us in.</span> <span id="s228">They took a section of the town, of the thing, and they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s229">They moved all the gentiles out and they took whatever it was and they cramped us in, ten in a room.</span> <span id="s230">There was no such a thing as a bed or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: When in 1944 were you taken from your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I am for one terribly ---</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Okay I can verify that because we have start times for the ghettos and end times for the ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: One thing I just don’t remember dates.</span> <span id="s235">I just know what happened.</span> <span id="s236">So when we were in the ghetto in Solopvina we had tremendous suffering because aside from everything, sleeping on the floor and things like that, we just didn’t have food.</span> <span id="s237">We were really suffering.</span> <span id="s238">And so I endangered my life by sneaking out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">The way I did it, there was somebody going through because you see you have to go through guards and they checked everything.</span> <span id="s240">The traffic still people were going on the main road.</span> <span id="s241">We were not allowed to get near the main road.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Was there a fence around the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, oh sure, there was a fence around the ghetto and there was guards around the ghetto and also where the main road was that went through the ghetto that was also blocked off.</span> <span id="s244">If you had a house you had to block the windows, board it off.</span> <span id="s245">And there was a fence that had to be made higher so nobody could get over it.</span> <span id="s246">But I went over it and I saw a wagon with two horses.</span> <span id="s247">There were just wagons and horses that the local people were still using.</span> <span id="s248">So what happened there is a long piece of wood that holds together the front wheels with the back wheels, that’s in the bottom like.</span> <span id="s249">And I put my legs onto that under the wagon and my hands and I went through the checkpoint and when I got on the other side I went into the town where we were living.</span> <span id="s250">I guess whatever it was at that day I told them that we were being held in such and such a place and that we don’t have food and we’re starving and this and that.</span> <span id="s251">I was able to manage to get a wagon from somebody and I had a lot of people -- because you see my father was very honored and respected because of all the transactions and all the things that we did for the town and for all the other towns so everybody knew because if you wanted to send something to the city you got my father to carry it.</span> <span id="s252">If you wanted to bring something home, you got my father to carry it.</span> <span id="s253">So we were very well known.</span> <span id="s254">So when I came into the town and told them we’re starving and I had a wagon, I had from the farmers, they brought me all kinds of things and I loaded up a whole wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You were able to get back to your old town?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I got back to my old town but when I got into town I kept asking where the Gestapo was to make sure I don’t run into them.</span> <span id="s257">And some of the people even helped me stay out so they couldn’t reach me.</span> <span id="s258">And I loaded one of these big wagons and I mean full with everything, with corn and potatoes and mostly that.</span> <span id="s259">I found two horses that used to belong to us.</span> <span id="s260">Of course I recognized them and I got them and I hitched them up and would you believe it I drove in through the checkpoint and I was inside already and when I did, I wanted to get in.</span> <span id="s261">You know everything was blocked off.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: The ghetto itself was blocked off?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: The ghetto, the main road, everything was fences.</span> <span id="s264">In order for me to be able to do this, I broke open whatever I was able to do, a gate.</span> <span id="s265">And I got in the ghetto and I drove to where my mother and father were and what happened was my mother was so worried and so nervous and upset she used to bite the back of her hand to keep her --- she bit off her flesh because she was so upset.</span> <span id="s266">And when I got there I yelled quickly whoever was available to unload quickly the wagon.</span> <span id="s267">And when I did that after it was unloaded I took the two horses and the wagon back to the main road and I slapped them in the back and I let them go.</span> <span id="s268">And nobody ever found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Did your mother know you were going to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s271">She would tie me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: But she knew you were missing and she was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Of course, because I was gone for two days.</span> <span id="s274">As far as she was concerned she didn’t know if I am alive or if I am dead because when I had to do this I had to do it on the QT because I had to find out if I go another half a mile in the town am I running in.</span> <span id="s275">They were looking for people like me that if you did something what they didn’t let you do they just hanged you and just let you hang in order to set an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Your whole family was in the ghetto except your oldest brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: He had been deported for forced labor earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s280">He was in the Russian front line behind the enemy line digging trenches and doing this kind of work and this is the only brother that survived.</span> <span id="s281">He is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s282">I know of another man who lives in Cleveland who was together with my brother in the same labor force.</span> <span id="s283">So we were in this ghetto and we were there until they brought more and more people, more Jews, till they rounded up all the Jews from all over the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did this take a couple of months or weeks, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I would say maybe a couple of months.</span> <span id="s286">I really don’t remember dates because to me one day was just like another day.</span> <span id="s287">I never knew --- as a matter of fact I didn’t even know the day that I was born because before I came to America there was a lady in Germany who says to me I was young, under age, and somebody says to me one day, would you like to go to America and I said what are you talking about.</span> <span id="s288">Anyway I said well they asked me the date I was born.</span> <span id="s289">But every time somebody asked me I just used whatever data just came to my mind.</span> <span id="s290">The latest was very easy.</span> <span id="s291">I used to say January first.</span> <span id="s292">So this lady asked me where I was born and this lady asked me for my name and I never could believe she happened to write a letter to her organization UNRRA and one day she sees me in the street and she comes running after me and she says, look what I’ve got, look what I’ve got.</span> <span id="s293">I’ve got your birth certificate.</span> <span id="s294">They send it to her.</span> <span id="s295">And so that’s what I knew the day I was born and things like that.</span> <span id="s296">But you see my brother, I am Yegher and he is Taub.</span> <span id="s297">The reason for that is because when the Jewish people got married, nobody ever realized that you have to go to City Hall to get a license so when my older sisters and my older brother was born they were named after my mother because the laws didn’t consider them married because they weren’t married legal.</span> <span id="s298">But then when they found out they had to have from the city a marriage certificate, then when I was born I became Yegher.</span> <span id="s299">So everybody wants to know why your brother Taub and why I am Yegher.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yegher is your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s302">Yegher is my father’s name and my mother’s name was Taub.</span> <span id="s303">That’s why they are named Taub.</span> <span id="s304">We’re in the ghetto and every day you know how you must feel.</span> <span id="s305">You had a beautiful whatever it was nice life, nice home, nice situation, human beings live whatever it was and all of a sudden you are cramped in like I don’t have to explain.</span> <span id="s306">You put twenty people in a room.</span> <span id="s307">You could just sit on the floor, or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Were you in an apartment or was this a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: There were houses like they have townhouses here, one floor you know.</span> <span id="s310">When they brought the people in from the other towns they just unloaded whatever --- we walked from the stations.</span> <span id="s311">And when we walked they decided you go here and you go here and you go here.</span> <span id="s312">You split up the families and when it’s full they say go to the next house and you keep pushing in and pushing in until it’s full.</span> <span id="s313">Once it’s full they go to the next house and this is how they packed them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: You all managed to stay together though.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Well, once you get food in a house nobody stayed guard because you could walk around outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s316">So if three people from one family was in one house and three people from the other they just sort of stayed together.</span> <span id="s317">Until one day -- you know the life, one of the things that kept people from losing their mind like my father, for instance, you pray every morning and you put tfillin and you daven every night and you worry about the Shabbos and you keep things sort of something to do so you don’t go out of your mind and this is what usually happened the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: They didn’t assign labor or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No, we were just kept in.</span> <span id="s320">You could go out certain times even from the houses but you have to stay inside and so on.</span> <span id="s321">So one day after being in the ghetto and I don’t have to tell you we had people getting all kinds of bacteria and sickness and dying and everything else.</span> <span id="s322">Even the world at that time didn’t have the proper medication what they have today.</span> <span id="s323">Even today you put twenty people, fifteen people in a room and you’re bound to have problems.</span> <span id="s324">And so until one day after being all this time in the ghetto and all this tremendous --- And the situation was they never left you alone.</span> <span id="s325">The entire time from the minute this thing started they were always trying to find a way how to beat you and how to keep you running and how to keep you scared and how to keep you from having no time to thing or trying maybe make a plan of some kind.</span> <span id="s326">And they were constantly taking people from one house move them to the other house.</span> <span id="s327">For no reason at all they just came in beating people.</span> <span id="s328">And people were so scared and people were always crying and people were always upset in situations like that.</span> <span id="s329">They created such a fear that we never knew what’s going on in the world outside.</span> <span id="s330">We never knew what the situation is all about.</span> <span id="s331">We were just like sheep.</span> <span id="s332">Like animals we were herded into one corner, herded into another corner, beaten into here, beaten into there, moved into here, moved into there.</span> <span id="s333">When the time came they evacuated us from the ghetto, I remember distinctly they told us that the front is lying where they were fighting the Russian was getting in danger because they were afraid that we will provide information, we will turn espionage or traitors or partisans against them to help the Russians.</span> <span id="s334">But we never had a chance from nothing.</span> <span id="s335">We never had a chance.</span> <span id="s336">We didn’t know a war, we didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s337">We just didn’t know from nothing.</span> <span id="s338">So they told us that the time has come that we’re close to the front line and they have to evacuate us deeper into, away from the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Had you heard any bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s341">So what happened is, you know the Jewish people, they always are so law abiding citizens.</span> <span id="s342">They are such a law abiding citizens.</span> <span id="s343">I don’t know if this has anything to do with this or not but while I was here in Washington, I worked in a place, in a restaurant called Duke Zieberts and on the way to work one day I hear on my radio that George Lincoln Rockwell is going to be speaking on the mall.</span> <span id="s344">And so I went into work and when I finished my work I walked down to see what’s happened.</span> <span id="s345">I just couldn’t believe I saw swastikas in America.</span> <span id="s346">I saw a man like they used to be a Gestapo tall off the ground, the guards.</span> <span id="s347">I saw a man that looked like that and he’s talking and he has a swastika.</span> <span id="s348">There’s people with swastikas all around and I said to myself, I am not going to be like the Jews in Europe.</span> <span id="s349">They had the tallis and tfillin and when the Gestapo came they said, Sh’ma Yisrael.</span> <span id="s350">I’m not going to be like that.</span> <span id="s351">I’m going to go down and I’m going see what he says.</span> <span id="s352">And he was talking about whatever he was saying.</span> <span id="s353">So I walked away and I started talking to the Jewish people in this area.</span> <span id="s354">As a matter of fact I tried to contact B’nai Brith, the Anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s355">And they told me, no problem, because this is America.</span> <span id="s356">That’s what they call freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s357">But I just couldn’t believe this is freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s358">So I tried to talk to -- I met in libraries in the Silver Spring area was Jewish War Veterans.</span> <span id="s359">And I’m never going to forget there was one guy, Harvey Rosenberg, who was a Jewish lawyer who told me this is freedom of speech, this is America, that the swastikas is the American way of life.</span> <span id="s360">He was talking about having this big rally the fourth of July, you know how many people are down there.</span> <span id="s361">So he went down there July the third which was a Saturday and July the fourth was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s362">I went down there and the park police had him roped off with ropes.</span> <span id="s363">He’s speaking on a loud speaker and he has his troopers with the Gestapo folded the hands in each corner all the way around him and I said to myself, let me hear what he’s got to say.</span> <span id="s364">If Harvey Rosenberg, a Jewish lawyer, I tried to tell him, what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s365">Are you going to wait until he comes to your house.</span> <span id="s366">You can all let this man, this is not what it is.</span> <span id="s367">And he says to me, if he comes to my house, I’m going to kill him.</span> <span id="s368">And I says, well, I’m glad to hear you at least say you are not going to say Sh’ma Yisrael.</span> <span id="s369">So I went down there and I honest and truly tell you for the first time in my life I was able to beat up a Nazi.</span> <span id="s370">I tore his ear off and he tried to take my eyes out.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: This was Rockwell?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, one of his troopers.</span> <span id="s373">And the man I talked to, I’m the one that started the riot.</span> <span id="s374">I had my hand on the rope.</span> <span id="s375">And I was trying to reason with him.</span> <span id="s376">He was a marine that turned Nazi.</span> <span id="s377">So I said to him, why are you people doing this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s378">Didn’t the world suffer enough for what Hitler did?</span> <span id="s379">And he says to me who are you to talk like that.</span> <span id="s380">I says to him you see this number, I got this in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s381">And he says to me, you big liar.</span> <span id="s382">How much did you pay to have this put on?</span> <span id="s383">And he said to me we are going to build bigger and better gas chambers than Hitler did.</span> <span id="s384">When he told that to me I put my hand on the rope and I jumped in.</span> <span id="s385">And I started a riot.</span> <span id="s386">And when I started the riot I got arrested because for the first time in my life when I jumped in the guy got on top of me and put his fingers in my eyes and whatever I had to do.</span> <span id="s387">But I got him messed up in such a way that the police took me off and they twisted my hand in back of me and they held me by my belt and by my hand in the back.</span> <span id="s388">And I says to the officer, officer I have nothing against you but you’re breaking my arm.</span> <span id="s389">And I says, if you don’t let me loose or you make me in pain, I says, I don’t want to fight you.</span> <span id="s390">And he says to me, shut up, you did enough damage already.</span> <span id="s391">So I was booked.</span> <span id="s392">I put ten dollars down as they call whatever it was, I don’t know, and they let me go home.</span> <span id="s393">It was in the newspapers and the Nazi party called my house; they’re going to kill me, kill my wife, kill my children.</span> <span id="s394">I had friends come over while I went to work to stay in the house with my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: I don’t remember what year it was but it was all over the newspapers and everything else.</span> <span id="s397">And all of a sudden the whole town, the Washington area was talking about David Yegher.</span> <span id="s398">And I had the best criminal lawyers who tried to donate their time to defend me against this.</span> <span id="s399">So anyway when I went to court the judge took one look at me and he says to me, Mr. David Yegher, I feel you had enough of the Nazis and you suffered enough of your life.</span> <span id="s400">What I’d like to do is give you back your ten dollars.</span> <span id="s401">Go downstairs and we’ll give you back your ten dollars and we’ll make believe like this thing never happened.</span> <span id="s402">But anyway because of this, all these lawyers were trying to build a case by saying when you tell a Holocaust survivor that you’re going to build bigger and better gas chambers that’s not freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s403">That is not something that a man or that.</span> <span id="s404">His permit was canceled and he could not talk Fourth of July.</span> <span id="s405">But he was gotten more permits for other places; and he went to Cleveland and he went to this.</span> <span id="s406">But I was told by the Anti-Defamation League, we don’t want you in jail.</span> <span id="s407">You got away with it once.</span> <span id="s408">But we don’t want you to get involved again because the next time you’re not going to get off so easy.</span> <span id="s409">I still kept in touch and believe me I had people come to my house and wanted me to give them the okay to kill them.</span> <span id="s410">And I said, no I don’t want them killed.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t want to be a martyr.</span> <span id="s412">And besides I will not do anything but I would break the laws of the United States and as far as I’m concerned, I will have no part of it.</span> <span id="s413">And I told him if you’re going to, I’m going to report you because the United States laws has to be uphold.</span> <span id="s414">So anyway that’s one of the situations that happened to me in Washington.</span> <span id="s415">So when they took us from the ghetto they loaded us in closed railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: You mean the cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Cattle cars -- and again as many as they could push in, they pushed in and they locked the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What time of year was that, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: It was around this time of year, around Pesach time, around this time of the year.</span> <span id="s420">I remember that much and we rode in these cattle cars for a long time.</span> <span id="s421">We didn’t have no food and we didn’t have nothing and people go to the bathroom and God knows what else.</span> <span id="s422">And then they open the cattle cars and there were people with sticks.</span> <span id="s423">The minute they open the cars and you had to get off the cars, it was between tracks, like for no reason they were yelling, los, los, and beatings, for no reason.</span> <span id="s424">Everybody didn’t have a chance to look or see or do anything.</span> <span id="s425">Everybody didn’t have a chance to look or see or do anything.</span> <span id="s426">Everybody was just trying to bend down to prevent them from hitting you and they were beating you all the time.</span> <span id="s427">We were going down in between these tracks and I saw somebody in the front with a long stick like and he was saying this way, this way, to the left and to the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: This is Auschwitz now?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes, I found that out.</span> <span id="s430">When we got there, I’m the only one that was going to the right.</span> <span id="s431">My sisters were young, good healthy women, grew up on the farm, worked the fields, but because they had their children, they went to the left -- my mother, my younger brother.</span> <span id="s432">I went to the right with the man and I knew that the sister who was a year younger than me also went to the right but I talked to people after the war that she ended up in the crematorium after all.</span> <span id="s433">But I was the only one.</span> <span id="s434">Now I’m talking to you what I told you a whole generation of uncles and aunts and families and people and the whole town that I don’t know if a dozen people survived from the whole town.</span> <span id="s435">And I landed in Auschwitz, Birkenau.</span> <span id="s436">But then while I was there it didn’t take long for me to find out because the next morning I was asking what happened to the people and somebody was showing me the smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Another prisoner you asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, that was there before me.</span> <span id="s439">So when I found out about what in the world was happening with this and that, what can I do?</span> <span id="s440">When I got there they shaved off my hair and they gave me a striped suit and they gave me a pair of shoes with wood soles and cloth and that was it.</span> <span id="s441">And I was living, I saw in the Holocaust Museum the bed, flat, which was eight or ten people in three layers.</span> <span id="s442">And when one turned, everybody had to turn.</span> <span id="s443">So I was in one of those.</span> <span id="s444">And one day I got separated from all the people that was from my area because somebody told me one day that this is where the people get numbers and they are being shipped out to work instead of sending them to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s445">I saw a line one day: I was way across in another barrack and I took my chance and I ran and I got in line.</span> <span id="s446">And sure enough I got a number and I was put in trucks and we were taken to a desert place which was in Poland called Obershlazingen and I landed up in a place called Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s447">I since found out that Gleiwitz had four camps, concentration camps.</span> <span id="s448">It was Gleiwitz one, Gleiwitz two, Gleiwitz three and Gleiwitz four.</span> <span id="s449">I was in Gleiwitz two.</span> <span id="s450">And when we got there, there was nothing but mountains, wilderness.</span> <span id="s451">But the barracks were already built and it had electric wires around and with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s452">And when we opened the gate, one gate it had where the Gestapo came into in and out bringing out the people and one gate is to the side where you went to work.</span> <span id="s453">And then they also divided the camp though they didn’t put electric wires was just a fence with two gates and they made women.</span> <span id="s454">Because afterwards, like after we got there, we dug down the mountain and we pushed it like coal cars and we built a factory.</span> <span id="s455">They brought the machineries, I’m never going to forget this, we built the whole thing.</span> <span id="s456">What we did is we mixed the cement by hand, seven shovels of sand, one shovel of cement.</span> <span id="s457">Then you kick it back and forth, then you make a hole in the middle, then you put so much water and you mix it.</span> <span id="s458">But this was like eight stories high.</span> <span id="s459">We brought the cement eight stories with a wheel barrel.</span> <span id="s460">I still have here, you see this, you were not allowed to stop and I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s461">I got to the fourth floor, I put the thing down for a second, he hit me with a piece of steel and cracked my skin.</span> <span id="s462">And so we were over there and the women came in to monitor -- it was long tubes, steel, it had little fires and it was turning and it was creating some kind of black sword (?)</span> <span id="s463">and the women were taking care of that.</span> <span id="s464">They were taught how to put the sword and when it fills up, tie it up and put a new one in.</span> <span id="s465">There was a whole shift and we were continue building more factory, more thing.</span> <span id="s466">And I lost my left ear, my mastoid because I was young, energetic, and after we came back from work, from working in the construction, building all day long, the Gestapo, they had the barracks outside they wanted to have beautiful flower gardens and polish their shoes and things like that.</span> <span id="s467">And I was a farm boy, I knew how to work with dirt and make these things and I made a flower gardens and I did keeping up with their fields, whatever it is in front of the houses and I cleaned the floors and I used to get extra soup for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: You did this in addition to the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: In addition, of course, because when you were working in the factory, they did not give you enough food for you to be able to continue working and continue living.</span> <span id="s470">They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but to extract from you all the strength so you become weak.</span> <span id="s471">And believe me the way they did it there was the barracks all the way around the fences, there was one barrack in the middle.</span> <span id="s472">They called the people out and you have to get in five in a row.</span> <span id="s473">And then they make you run around this barrack, the center barrack.</span> <span id="s474">When you ran around and then when you got weak and they started hitting you, you had to run faster, faster.</span> <span id="s475">The guy that was doing this, where he ran behind everybody, when he saw the people that he overtook, he stopped right there, those people were not strong enough to live anymore, to produce work, they went to the trucks and went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s476">Because they had more people, they brought Jews from all over the world in Europe and they wanted the healthy one to make use of their strength.</span> <span id="s477">But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up and that’s how I survived.</span> <span id="s478">But what happened is when I did all this extra work I got extra soup.</span> <span id="s479">And one day this same guy that was asking for volunteers and I always went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me the soup and you saw all the rest of the people just dying to get a bite of something and nobody could get nothing.</span> <span id="s480">You see them dying, starving.</span> <span id="s481">But then he asked for a volunteer to wash the kettle out.</span> <span id="s482">And I was very gladly going to wash the kettle because this guy didn’t care about how he dipped out.</span> <span id="s483">The best stuff was in the bottom of the kettle.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: This was another prisoner, this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No, this was one of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s486">And when I come there to volunteer to wash the kettle and I was one of the volunteers, I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him say to me, you swine and he hit me on my side with his right hand and he busted my ear drum.</span> <span id="s487">And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated, I went to doctors in Germany and doctors in everywhere and I finally ended up here in Washington a place with the ear clinic where a doctor said to me, I have one choice, have the operation because it’s so deteriorated that it’s going to affect my brain and it’s pressing against my brain and that I don’t have much to live.</span> <span id="s488">So I authorized him to operate on me and he took the mastoid out completely and I have a mastoid, a plastic one and I don’t hear in my left ear.</span> <span id="s489">But thank God the operation was very successful.</span> <span id="s490">The doctor told me I would have to come in and check-ups and things like that.</span> <span id="s491">But thank God whatever it did it took over.</span> <span id="s492">I go to see him every couple of years or so and I have no problem.</span> <span id="s493">So anyway I was in Gleiwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: How did they take you from Auschwitz to Gleiwitz, again by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No, no, by truck.</span> <span id="s496">We were working in Gleiwitz and building the factory and me doing the side works and me getting a little soup a couple of times a week, because it wasn’t every day.</span> <span id="s497">And so I was coming along.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So the work the women were doing as you were building the factory they started doing work in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They ran the machinery and they as a matter of fact, when they got through for the day, their faces, the whole thing, was covered with the dust, with black dust, just like your hair black.</span> <span id="s500">That’s what the job they did.</span> <span id="s501">And afterwards one day while we’re being there and I’m telling you every day ----- I look outside in the street and I see people walking, cars and the highway and I said to myself, I don’t know, will I ever be able to walk free, will I ever be able to walk free.</span> <span id="s502">There was no such thing as trying to plan an escape because where are you going to go.</span> <span id="s503">There’s no place to go.</span> <span id="s504">They will catch you.</span> <span id="s505">And so we don’t know anything what goes on in the world.</span> <span id="s506">We don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s507">And one day they tell us they have to evacuate us.</span> <span id="s508">They opened up all the warehouses and everybody was running crazy, grabbing a loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: This was the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: The winter, oh was it winter.</span> <span id="s511">We went, I don’t remember, two or three days walking through the woods up to here in snow.</span> <span id="s512">And when the nightfall came they just tell us freeze or die or something and we just kept on walking.</span> <span id="s513">And anybody just couldn’t walk anymore, they just shot you and left you right there.</span> <span id="s514">And there is one thing that I had with me that was another guy by the name of Shia Spiegel who was from Poland, from Bengene and he and I sort of teamed up to look out for one another.</span> <span id="s515">Well, when everybody went crazy and got a loaf of bread, I took a loaf of cheese, like a loaf of American cheese, five pounds and I put it in my belt and covered over with this and I carried because two days later the bread was gone and you had to march.</span> <span id="s516">And if anybody had any bread they killed you for it, or food or something.</span> <span id="s517">So I used to reach inside and take a piece of cheese, break off a piece and hold it in my hand, and I had him lay down in my arms like this and I fed him and he ate the piece of cheese, or he did that to me and this is how we survived.</span> <span id="s518">Then we came to a place where there were railroad cars where they were going to transport us.</span> <span id="s519">Yeah, there is one more thing that I did.</span> <span id="s520">I became an expert in concrete, and not just concrete, also to make the steel because the concrete is usually reinforced by steel.</span> <span id="s521">I became an expert in steel.</span> <span id="s522">They promoted me to build the individual air shelters for the Gestapo all around the camp.</span> <span id="s523">Basically it was built like four feet deep on the location, round.</span> <span id="s524">Then we had a place where we had to design that we built forms like barrel sections with a narrow opening from the back.</span> <span id="s525">And lookout that was wide and narrow to the front.</span> <span id="s526">And then we put a dome on it.</span> <span id="s527">We built this whole thing by hand and then we loaded it on a two -wheel cart and we pushed it to the location.</span> <span id="s528">And when we got to the location we left clamps that we put nuts and bolts to tie it together, the section.</span> <span id="s529">Then we put the dome on it.</span> <span id="s530">That’s what I was doing.</span> <span id="s531">That was my last job with a crew of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Those warehouses that they opened were those in the SS part of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: They opened up everywhere.</span> <span id="s534">And everywhere people could go in and people ---- we went crazy trying to find food, all they could find.</span> <span id="s535">And so when we got to the railroad, when they were evacuating us, they made us go into the wagon.</span> <span id="s536">It was open; it was cold; it was snow so deep; it was absolutely blizzard.</span> <span id="s537">In our wagon there was a hundred and eighty people because when they tell the people to go in I saw this with my eyes: the Gestapo rook the rifle with the heavy side and hit people over the shins, over the feet, so they will back up so they can get more people up.</span> <span id="s538">And no matter how they did, they still couldn’t get everybody on there.</span> <span id="s539">What happened to the people then, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s540">But we left.</span> <span id="s541">When midnight came the train took off.</span> <span id="s542">The first morning there were thirty people dead in our own wagon.</span> <span id="s543">We drove in this wagon for about eight days.</span> <span id="s544">Nobody ever gave us anything to eat.</span> <span id="s545">To get water, I made out of whatever I could find from striped shirts, from coats like a rope with a hat and dragging it down on the ground as the train was going to get snow for water.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: These were the open cars, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: The open cars.</span> <span id="s548">Out of our wagon when we were unloaded in Oranienburg, there were three people from my wagon left, everybody died.</span> <span id="s549">Three people in my wagon, Shia Spiegel, one, me and somebody else.</span> <span id="s550">And the only reason we survived because I got the snow for water and I got the cheese that I made him and he made me eat and nobody could ever find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So it lasted you that whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Right, a little piece at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What did you do with the dead bodies?</span> <span id="s554">Were they still on the train with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: First of all when there was enough people, people just dumped them overboard.</span> <span id="s556">But then there was nobody to do it anymore so everybody that just died, they just died.</span> <span id="s557">I saw a man dying who was out of his mind, shivering, things like that.</span> <span id="s558">And I found out that he was born in the town right next to my town and I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s559">And so when I got to Oranienburg I was still in pretty good shape.</span> <span id="s560">And as I was walking, this was I believe an air hangar for airplanes or something.</span> <span id="s561">And believe it or not, I come across somebody that we grew up together.</span> <span id="s562">We were together practically every day.</span> <span id="s563">And his name is David Yegher, too.</span> <span id="s564">And he lives in Lakewood, New Jersey right now.</span> <span id="s565">He wrote his biography.</span> <span id="s566">He wrote it so the kids would have.</span> <span id="s567">He has it in there that I saved his life.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t know how I did it but I got some food for him.</span> <span id="s569">On top of being sick what it was he was also wounded from air raid.</span> <span id="s570">And I bandaged him up and I stayed with him until they were looking for healthy people and they picked me again and guess where they sent me -- to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s571">I was in Bergen-Belsen and I saw like your eyes would never want to see.</span> <span id="s572">Just like flies people dying all over the streets and there was a wagon that was being pushed by people like us picking them up and just dumping them in the wagon and you see a hand or a leg or something stuck in the wheel or something and they just pushed the wagons and pushed the wagons.</span> <span id="s573">I didn’t know where they were taking them but they were just picking up the dead like you pick up logs or something.</span> <span id="s574">And again they are looking for somebody that is still in good health and I still was.</span> <span id="s575">That’s when I lost, I separated from my friend because he was no longer able.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: David Yegher, the other David Yegher?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Spiegel.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Spiegel.</span> <span id="s580">So when they took me to Bergen-Belsen and I was still with Spiegel, from Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen, when I got to Bergen-Belsen, again they were looking for people that were still in pretty good shape and I still was and they took me to Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Back to Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: No, no, no, from Oranienburg to Belsen-Belsen and from Belsen-Belsen they took me to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s583">They was a place called Desaoofa.</span> <span id="s584">Now, in Desaoofa where my strength came to an end, they took me out in the morning to repair the railroads and the bridges that were bombed during the night.</span> <span id="s585">We always rode in some sort of a transport car, truck to get to the place or by train to where the place was bombed and we were repairing.</span> <span id="s586">But to come back, most of the time we couldn’t ride back because either the bridge was bombed, either the train was not available or something, we had to walk.</span> <span id="s587">So we walked and by the time we got to the place into Desaoofa they had saved a kettle for soup for us because we were important people to give us.</span> <span id="s588">But when we got there and they brought out the kettle of soup and we got in line, everybody got in line.</span> <span id="s589">And the guy was very nice; he took the soup and he dumped it on the floor and we didn’t get nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s590">And during the night was air raids.</span> <span id="s591">We had to go down to the basement but the basement was full of water when we get down.</span> <span id="s592">It took me four months to get me to the point where I could no longer stand on my feet.</span> <span id="s593">They loaded me into railroad cars that we were told we’re going back to Belsen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s594">The reason we were shipped to Bergen-Belsen they should put us in the gas chambers or whatever in the crematorium to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s595">But, God was with us.</span> <span id="s596">What happened was the whole time that they tried to reach Bergen-Belsen, there was air raids.</span> <span id="s597">They bombed this track, they bombed this track.</span> <span id="s598">They shifted us back and forth and they never reached Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: You saw and heard the raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s601">As a matter of fact I was in one place whereby we were a little wooded area but we were not allowed to go into the shelters.</span> <span id="s602">But to the left of us -- there was three corners.</span> <span id="s603">One was like a military, like a post office whatever it was and one was an air shelter where all the Germans ran in and one was a bridge.</span> <span id="s604">Three bombs were direct hits.</span> <span id="s605">Our place was vibrating like you couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s606">And then they called us to come to the air shelter and to move the stuff.</span> <span id="s607">We removed the dead bodies and things like that but nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s608">So when they couldn’t get us anymore to Bergen-Belsen, they unloaded us in a place called Zamposten.</span> <span id="s609">In this place, Zamposten, it wasn’t a concentration camp, it was ---- of course it was guarded, it didn’t have electric wires whatever it was but it was a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s610">And they unloaded us inn this place called Zamposten and this was how shall I say it was like a ghost camp because there was no movement because everybody was weak and dying and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: These were soldiers.</span> <span id="s612">This was a POW camp so there were ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I was too weak to know.</span> <span id="s614">All I know is I was told that this is a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s615">I want you to know I am not a weakling.</span> <span id="s616">I want you to know my condition, the way I felt and I’m never going to forget that.</span> <span id="s617">I’m always hunting, looking to find something to eat.</span> <span id="s618">I finally found a potato and I finally dragged myself to the trees to find some limbs to be able to build a fire to cook the potato, bake it or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Where did you find the potato?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: I found it someplace.</span> <span id="s621">But would you believe it I couldn’t accomplish my goal because I didn’t have the strength after I found a match.</span> <span id="s622">I couldn’t have the strength to light the match.</span> <span id="s623">Could you believe that.</span> <span id="s624">I was getting weaker and weaker and weaker by the minute and I was already in a situation that I didn’t know, I didn’t know, I couldn’t get up, I couldn’t move and I was ----- but I don’t know what happened in the next I don’t even know how many days, I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s625">All I know is I was lifting my head one day and I saw the Germans running and the British running after them.</span> <span id="s626">Then I looked again and I saw the British running back and the Germans running after the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: This was from your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: From my barrack through the window.</span> <span id="s629">Then I saw the Germans and the British chasing them and that was the end But the next thing I knew, I remember, you see the movies where there was people skin and bone, that’s how I was.</span> <span id="s630">My thigh right here I could take it around with my fingers.</span> <span id="s631">I remember one thing that somebody coming with scissors and cutting off the striped pants and the shirt I had on and lifting me up and putting me on a blanket which was put on a stretcher.</span> <span id="s632">I remember somebody putting some kind of powder or whatever it was and covering me with a blanket and that’s all I know.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t remember nothing else until I came to in that used to be a German military barrack what they turned into like a hospital.</span> <span id="s634">I remember them feeding me like you feed a baby with a bottle, the sweet milk.</span> <span id="s635">I remember them that after that giving me the broth from a potato.</span> <span id="s636">Then I remember them giving me the broth with a little potato in it.</span> <span id="s637">And I have started to recover really nice.</span> <span id="s638">Then I made a mistake because there were Germans, workers that were working for the military and somebody did me a favor by giving me a piece of his sandwich.</span> <span id="s639">I had two bites and I swallowed it and I was dying.</span> <span id="s640">I remember one of the military doctors, because there was a few doctors around trying to do whatever they’re going to do and I heard one saying, I can’t let this one die because he is my challenge and he revived me.</span> <span id="s641">It took me four months to be able to stand on my feet and being able.</span> <span id="s642">After that I just got up one day and they told me where are you going to go, what are you going to eat, what are you going to be.</span> <span id="s643">I says, where I’m going to go God knows, but I’m going to go anywhere and everywhere to look for anybody that I can find to survive.</span> <span id="s644">And everywhere there was a camp that I heard of I somehow managed to get there by stopping in, begging for food, things like that.</span> <span id="s645">What can I tell you.</span> <span id="s646">I met at the time people, German people, who fed me, who cried when they heard my story.</span> <span id="s647">I also had people tell me that they are going to get even with America because they said the reason they lost the war was because America bombed their cities, their villages and their towns and they’re going to get even with America.</span> <span id="s648">I went in and I searched all over the Germany where it was under the British occupation.</span> <span id="s649">Then I wanted to know if I can find some more people.</span> <span id="s650">So I went across the border.</span> <span id="s651">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s652">They were so strict of having people going across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Which border?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Between the British zone to the American zone.</span> <span id="s655">But I fooled all of them and I went across to the American occupied territory.</span> <span id="s656">This is how I came to America, from the American zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: What year did you emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I came to the United States in 1948.</span> <span id="s659">It was April 17 that I came into the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Between the time you were released from the hospital and emigrating you were going to various camps, that’s how your time was occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes I was going to various camps and I was living in various camps until one day that lady found me.</span> <span id="s662">That changed my life.</span> <span id="s663">And of course, the rest is history.</span> <span id="s664">When I landed in New York and I came in and I was sponsored by the United Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s665">But I was sponsored to come to America I don’t even know who the people were that I was assigned to go west.</span> <span id="s666">So when I came to New York I ran into some people.</span> <span id="s667">They knew of my people, I ran into some people that I knew at the Hotel Marseille, 103rd Street and Broadway.</span> <span id="s668">When they came to me and they told me that they have me assigned and when am I ready to go west and I said to them I’m sorry I don’t know west, east.</span> <span id="s669">All I know is that I found a few people.</span> <span id="s670">It’s not my relatives but it’s some people, a few people that I knew and to me this is my family.</span> <span id="s671">And I said I like to stay here.</span> <span id="s672">And they said to me well, they want me to know if I stay that I will be strictly on my own.</span> <span id="s673">They cannot be responsible for me or give me any assistance or financial or anything like that.</span> <span id="s674">And I said to them, haven’t you done enough for me already.</span> <span id="s675">You brought me out to America.</span> <span id="s676">I guarantee you that I won’t be no burden to you.</span> <span id="s677">In a country like this where you can go out and have a job and make a living.</span> <span id="s678">And they said okay you’re on your own and I’ve been on my own.</span> <span id="s679">I worked, I got a job, I was working in this place.</span> <span id="s680">Oh, I worked hard.</span> <span id="s681">I was making $50 a week and I worked from eight o’clock in the morning until eleven o’clock at night seven days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Was this a factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No, cooking.</span> <span id="s684">And so after working a year I got a raise, not money, but I mean I got working six days.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You got a day off?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, then after working two years over there I heard about the Catskills and I heard about the places .</span> <span id="s687">I went to work as an assistant chef to a place which was very well known at the time called Pioneer Country Club at Greenfield Park, New York which was kosher, strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s688">They were so impressed with me, they had a hotel, the Edwards Hotel in Florida, they were paying me some assistant chef $150, so I went from $50 to $150.</span> <span id="s689">But I went to Florida and worked for them.</span> <span id="s690">As first chef I went from $150 to $400.</span> <span id="s691">I worked for them two years.</span> <span id="s692">Then I got to be so well known because the people who have eaten where they stayed and people came from other hotels because they liked the food so much that I had two agents who were signing up my jobs.</span> <span id="s693">I did that for ten years and believe it or not I did that from 1950 to ’51 actually.</span> <span id="s694">That was the first year I went until ’58 when I came to Washington.</span> <span id="s695">I was in those years making a thousand dollars a week because while I was in Germany hunting around and finding places where DP’s were, DP camps, so I used to work in hotels and restaurants and I learned to bake and butcher and do everything and this was my profession.</span> <span id="s696">So when I came to Washington, I didn’t realize then, I was the chef, one of the most popular, the best restaurant in Washington, Duke Zieberts.</span> <span id="s697">I was there four and a half years.</span> <span id="s698">Then I went into business for myself and I operated Yegher’s kosher caterers.</span> <span id="s699">When you work, whatever money you make, you know I had a family and kids, you are just not able to save a lot of money but I was able to save up $3,000 and I went into the business.</span> <span id="s700">I made a very good living and I sold it for $1,010,000 cash.</span> <span id="s701">I sold it and I went into the Pavilion in the Old Post Office and I left September a year ago, the Pavilion.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: You sold that restaurant too?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Well there was nothing to sell.</span> <span id="s704">My lease was up and while I was there I just didn’t make any money.</span> <span id="s705">It was just a very bad arrangement.</span> <span id="s706">Everybody that ever goes in there has a hard time.</span> <span id="s707">It’s just not a money proposition because it’s so over-rated and it looks so glorious and looks so over, over, over promoted that people just don’t realize you just can’t make a living.</span> <span id="s708">I know people there who are absolutely starving in business.</span> <span id="s709">They have no money to take care of their children and no money to live, just waiting for -- you know.</span> <span id="s710">So I managed to hold on because I didn’t have to hire no chef.</span> <span id="s711">I didn’t have to hire no expensive whatever you want to call it and I was able to hold out until my lease is up and I just took my equipment and I came out here.</span> <span id="s712">My situation right here, I hope to be able to find a bank who’s going to lend me money to build a road.</span> <span id="s713">What you see right here I own nineteen acres with all of them buildings and it’s all free and clear.</span> <span id="s714">.</span> <span id="s715">And I’m hoping to get a loan and then I’m going to open and then I’m going to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Will this be a kosher inn or -----?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well, it has a lot of ifs and buts about it.</span> <span id="s718">For this to be kosher, I would like it to be kosher, but if it’s not going to be kosher is because it will be determined that it’s just not a market to support it.</span> <span id="s719">So it all depends, it all depends.</span> <span id="s720">I haven’t really decided yet but I will have to do -- remember one thing, I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s721">I’m going to do whatever I have to do to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: I did have a question if you don’t mind going back a little bit about what you remember about the first occupation of your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Oh, how can I forget, I mean it started little things, slowly.</span> <span id="s724">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s725">First you had to register.</span> <span id="s726">After you registered they imposed various restrictions.</span> <span id="s727">You couldn’t walk from one town to the other; you couldn’t be out at night; you couldn’t have no windows facing the main road, have to be blocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Did you live on that main road?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yes, and they were deporting Jews what they called it where people had to evacuate because of the front lines and they needed people to work the fields.</span> <span id="s730">So they came in with this clever thing by saying that all the Jews who don’t have enough means of living and supporting themselves and what they have within their farm.</span> <span id="s731">For instance; we had no problems; we had enough food, we had enough things, we had enough things we never needed to leave the farm.</span> <span id="s732">We had wheat, bread, you know all the things in the summer, in the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: You were self sufficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Self sufficient, and we even sold a lot.</span> <span id="s735">So there was no problem with us but there were Jews taken who were very cleverly misrepresented because they were taking Jews to Galicia and then we found out they weren’t taking them to work, they were taking them and they dug deep trenches and shot them all.</span> <span id="s736">But there were some people that somebody, somehow, that the word got out.</span> <span id="s737">Wherever they did, they did it in such a way by always giving you a reason.</span> <span id="s738">We need to evacuate the people because the ones that don’t have enough sufficient to sustain, to live, whatever they have on their farm because they are not allowed to work, you’re not allowed to walk, you have to stay on your farm, those are the Jews that they took.</span> <span id="s739">Then they come to the Jews and they said, well everybody of such and such age had to report to the military.</span> <span id="s740">That’s when they took my brother.</span> <span id="s741">Then they came again and they said no school, no Jews are allowed to go to school; no Jews are allowed to congregate; no Jews are allowed to go to the synagogue; no Jews are allowed to have communications of any kind with one another.</span> <span id="s742">Everything you have on the farm you have to deliver to such and such a place, whatever the crops and things like that.</span> <span id="s743">I remember my father dug a hole in the barn and put in sacks of wheat so we would have.</span> <span id="s744">In case whatever, in reserve or something.</span> <span id="s745">But we didn’t know that when you put in sacks of wheat in the ground and the wheat touches the ground on the side, the wheat turns to dirt.</span> <span id="s746">It started cultivation and growing.</span> <span id="s747">When we uncovered it, whatever it had, lumber on the top and hay or something, there was only a little bit in the middle that was still useable.</span> <span id="s748">Everything else was all turned.</span> <span id="s749">We had no experience.</span> <span id="s750">We had known we would have put lumber on the side, on the bottom but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s751">When we didn’t have wheat we ground the beans for flour and made some kind of bread out of beans because we just couldn’t get because even in the farm when you get whatever you get in the winter time you have to be able to exchange and trade and market, you just cannot ---- We were lucky because we, now for instance, potatoes -- we dug a hole in the ground and we put straw on the outside and on the bottom and then we covered with straw and we put dirt on it, it was just like fields.</span> <span id="s752">Then we used to go and dig out potatoes.</span> <span id="s753">So we always found some things.</span> <span id="s754">Every day of course you had to wear the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Did you have to make it at home, did somebody distribute them?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I don’t remember, I don’t remember of they distributed it or you made it or you got it, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s757">And as always there was never a let down.</span> <span id="s758">There was never a let down one day that they would leave you alone.</span> <span id="s759">There was always this constant harassment, nudging -- today you have to do this, today you have to do this, today you have to do this constantly.</span> <span id="s760">And they wore you down, wore you out, wore you down.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: How old were you when decrees began”</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: I was thirteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Had you begun gymnasium or were you going on in school at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s765">I only had four years of public school.</span> <span id="s766">That’s it.</span> <span id="s767">I had very little schooling but I did have training in Jewish, I went to cheder.</span> <span id="s768">I learned in cheder.</span> <span id="s769">I know how to daven pretty good.</span> <span id="s770">I know all there is to know.</span> <span id="s771">I learned from my father.</span> <span id="s772">I was with him ----</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: You carried his entrepreneurial spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I mean he used to pray all the time and he used to be so observant and so religious and such a good person.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: He wore a beard?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, he didn’t wear no beard but he used some kind of paste to dissolve the hair or something because you’re not allowed to use a razor.</span> <span id="s777">But anyway ----</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: What about anti-Semitism by the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh, I had anti-Semitism all the time.</span> <span id="s780">I grew up with that.</span> <span id="s781">Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s782">I was a tough kid, and I mean I was a tough kid.</span> <span id="s783">I was not bothered by anybody because to me, I would never back down and even if I encountered ------ I encountered a bunch of school, my younger age you know, and there was somebody by the name of Kuza that they had thought, he got after the Jews at the time, even before the Germans came.</span> <span id="s784">And they got surrounded me and they wanted me to say Treaska Kuza which means in Romanian long live Kuza.</span> <span id="s785">And I wouldn’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Kuza, that was part of the government real anti-Semite -------?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: That was the guy like George Lincoln Rockwell over here.</span> <span id="s788">And Kuza organized men who were going on the trains and when they found a Jew they threw him off the train while the train was running, through the window, beat him up and things like that.</span> <span id="s789">So anyway they tried to get me to say Treaska Kuza and I wouldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s790">But I knew one thing.</span> <span id="s791">There was about five, six kids my age and I knew that if I took care of the leader that they would scatter.</span> <span id="s792">They had me surrounded and the guy who was the leader was telling to me to say Treaska Kuza and I got closer and closer to him and I used my right foot and I kicked him in the balls.</span> <span id="s793">He bent over screaming and when he did the rest of them, and I hit him afterwards, and I said who is next?</span> <span id="s794">And they all ran away.</span> <span id="s795">That was one thing and I was attacked another time.</span> <span id="s796">I was a tough kid.</span> <span id="s797">Somebody was going to hit me and I took his arm and I was going to put him over my shoulder, flip him over, but I did a terrible thing, what I did I had his hand backwards and I broke his arm.</span> <span id="s798">Nobody bothered me again.</span> <span id="s799">They knew I was a tough kid.</span> <span id="s800">When I went to school even I also spoke very good Romanian and the teacher was trying to break up the Jewish kids, there was two in a bench and so they got and they put one gentile and one Jew because they wanted not that the Jewish kid to be able to talk in Yiddish and carry on together.</span> <span id="s801">But there was me and one more kid from the other end of the town.</span> <span id="s802">They let us sit together.</span> <span id="s803">Well they said because we spoke fluently, Romanian, so they didn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s804">But whatever it was -- I was a tough kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Did your father, was he ever harassed singly within the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Well, we were constantly harassed, no question about it, constantly harassed.</span> <span id="s807">I remember one time, I don’t remember exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s808">Somebody, I don’t know, hit my father with a rifle and my father told my sister to go and get the police because we were on pretty good terms with the police.</span> <span id="s809">My mother wouldn’t let her out of the house.</span> <span id="s810">As a matter of fact it’s a good thing she didn’t because the guy was outside who hit my father, he was outside in the street and after a few minutes if my sister, if anybody would have come out he would have shot us.</span> <span id="s811">But instead of shooting us he used his rifle to shoot and he shot the geese.</span> <span id="s812">There was a flock of geese and he shot the geese with the bullets.</span> <span id="s813">And so my mother, she wouldn’t let my sister go out and she just stayed in the house down until he left.</span> <span id="s814">What can I tell you.</span> <span id="s815">This transport that went from Gleiwitz to Oranienburg that was a suffering.</span> <span id="s816">I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s817">There were some people that got off the train when the train had to slow down, whatever, and they started to run away.</span> <span id="s818">They were just shot, they were just shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Were you able to get a blanket or anything when they opened those warehouses before that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: So you were just exposed?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: You better believe it.</span> <span id="s823">You stay close together and when one side is warm you turn the other side to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: What did you do mentally?</span> <span id="s825">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s826">How did you deal mentally with that kind of hardship?</span> <span id="s827">Do you think you’re going to make it through or do you just agree to accept the inevitable?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: No, no, no, you never think of that.</span> <span id="s829">You constantly think what to do to survive.</span> <span id="s830">You constantly plan what to do, how to do, what to survive.</span> <span id="s831">You don’t think of it’s good, you don’t think of it’s bad.</span> <span id="s832">It’s just like somebody is out in the desert and they’re dying from thirst and when you see them in the movies, when they’re running, when they see water, what do you think these people are going to be thinking of?</span> <span id="s833">Their entire body and mind and soul and power and strength is just to get to that water.</span> <span id="s834">Well that’s the kind of conditioned that you become that you constantly like fatigue just thinking where can I find something to eat.</span> <span id="s835">You don’t think of nothing else.</span> <span id="s836">You just think, how can I survive the next hour.</span> <span id="s837">And you are constantly thinking just of that.</span> <span id="s838">And there is nothing else because you are in such a pain for hunger , you’re in such a pain trying to find something to eat that you just don’t ever have anything else on your mind.</span> <span id="s839">You’re just frustrated, how can I find something to eat to get rid of the pain.</span> <span id="s840">And that’s the way the whole situation is.</span> <span id="s841">And you constantly manipulate and maneuver and you constantly look to find something, something that you can eat, constantly.</span> <span id="s842">You constantly plan where to be.</span> <span id="s843">When I used to do the side work all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: The gardening?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: The gardening and polishing the shoes and making the beds and things like that.</span> <span id="s846">That’s what it took and you’re just so helpless, you’re just so useless, you’re just so without nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s847">It’s just like you see so many people dying, you see so many people starving, you see so many people, there’s nothing you can do, there’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s848">It’s just like you are walking along the roads and there’s an earthquake and you get covered and you’re dying.</span> <span id="s849">What can you do?</span> <span id="s850">Nothing!</span> <span id="s851">There’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s852">And I don’t know why is there always that somebody always comes up in a generation and always has the right, he feels he has the right to destroy the Jews.</span> <span id="s853">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s854">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s855">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s856">All of a sudden the Jewish life becomes so cheap and so nobody sets any value on it and Jewish life -- I mean I saw the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: At Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s859">I mean how in the world can ever be somebody ever able to do systematically like a lumber factory, like a manufacturer that produces cars, systematically gassing and burning human beings, never mind Jews, just somebody.</span> <span id="s860">What in the world does ever anybody ever has gotten the idea that he has the right to do that.</span> <span id="s861">How in the world?</span> <span id="s862">I just recently applied for the Wiedergud Machel because I just never wanted anything from them because I just never wanted anything from them.</span> <span id="s863">But some of my friends just talked me into it by saying, you’re going to get old, you never know what’s going to happen, why shouldn’t you be able to get something out of it?</span> <span id="s864">They took enough from you.</span> <span id="s865">So, but it’s already too late.</span> <span id="s866">Anyway I filed with the Mead organization in New York.</span> <span id="s867">They told me that they might be able to overturn something, whatever.</span> <span id="s868">You can never tell.</span> <span id="s869">But the situation is ------ Because I’m a Holocaust survivor and because of this area I have been approached many different ways, many different times, especially when they had the Eichmann trials I had been followed by reporters.</span> <span id="s870">Wanted to know what I’m going to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Reaction.</span> <span id="s873">I was also on television.</span> <span id="s874">There was a guy here on Alan King show that he was the one that hunted down Klaus Barbie.</span> <span id="s875">I was on TV because he wanted to have somebody to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Larry King?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Larry King, yeah.</span> <span id="s878">And so my last statement was that I hope that the world would learn what a horrible thing the Nazis did to the world and to the Jews especially.</span> <span id="s879">And I hope that never again would anything ever be instituted something of that nature and whatever.</span> <span id="s880">So I had quite a few calls because I was in the kosher catering and I was very well honored with dignity and respect.</span> <span id="s881">People knew me and they called mw to tell me what a wonderful thing I did and said.</span> <span id="s882">So we’re going to have a Holocaust Museum here?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: And I hope to God that it will be there to be able to that the world never forgot what the world did and a lot of it could have been prevented but the world didn’t lift a finger.</span> <span id="s885">And again we were alone and no defense, nobody.</span> <span id="s886">And the people that could do, didn’t.</span> <span id="s887">They made it that they didn’t want to be involved.</span> <span id="s888">Well, I hope to God that the State of Israel will exist and be able to because God forbid this time and God forbid if the State of Israel should ever be destroyed or overpowered that there wouldn’t be no more State of Israel and this time we will not escape.</span> <span id="s889">It will be the end of the Jewish for sure and that I can tell you because as many enemies we got now and as many ways they now know how to exterminate and will be absolutely merciless.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s891">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
