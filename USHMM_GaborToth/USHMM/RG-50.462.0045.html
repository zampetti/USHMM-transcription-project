May 9, 1983 Tape 1, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s3">JF: Mr. Nowak, can you tell me where and when you were born, and a little bit about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">WN: 1st of August, 1908, in Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">JF: Can you tell me a little bit about your family and what kind of life you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">WN: Well, my father and my mother came from Austria and when I was born, of course, we lived in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">JF: Why did they come from Austria to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">WN: I think my father just wanted to go to Germany because the opportunities were very good there.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">JF: The economic opportunities were better.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">WN: Yeah, my father had a tobacco factory in Berlin, and, of course, my mother didn’t work and we had a very good life, very good family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">JF: Your family then was fairly comfortably off?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WN: Oh Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">JF: What kind of neighborhood did you live in and what kind of interaction did you have those around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WN: It was a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s15">In other words Jews and Christians, very nice, decent neighborhood, good people as neighbors and that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">JF: Was there any difficulty in the neighborhood, was it accepted that you were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WN: Oh yes, there were no problems at that time, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">JF: So in your early years growing up you played with non-Jews and Jews alike?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WN: Oh yes, in fact my best friend was a non-Jew at that time as a school boy.</span> <span id="s20">We went together to school every morning, we lived in the same apartment building, and we would go together to school, the same walk to the school and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: What kind of school was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WN: It was, I don’t know how I can say it to you here, it was high school but in was a Gymnasium which is something different here of course and there was a Realgymnasium which would be the same type of Gymnasium but, for example in the proper Gymnasium you would have Latin and Greek languages and of course the other languages, French or English.</span> <span id="s23">In the Real-gymnasium, to say it in German, at the moment, we had Latin and French and English but we didn’t have Greek, that was the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: What did that difference mean in terms of the education at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WN: You just had another language, an old language like Greek, for example and Latin and we left the Greek out, we just had the Latin and the English and the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">JF: It was more current?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WN: Yeah, I would say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">JF: So you were in German public schools then essentially with the high schools and your lower schooling was also?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WN: No, at the time the school had what you call public school now, we had that in one building in the same school.</span> <span id="s30">We had three years of let’s say of public school for children growing up and then we had the other classes which were the languages and all that.</span> <span id="s31">It’s a little hard to compare from there to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JF: But you were in the educational system that most of the other German children were in.</span> <span id="s33">It was not a separate system, you were not in separate Jewish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WN: No, our religious, our training of learning were actually in the same building, in the same class, everything the same, but we had a rabbi who came to the school and taught us.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">JF: When was that, about what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">WN: Let me see.</span> <span id="s37">I was six years old when I started school.</span> <span id="s38">So we had three years first.</span> <span id="s39">From six to nine I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">JF: A rabbi came to the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WN: To the school and he would teach us.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JF: For how many hours a week was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WN: We had two or three days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">JF: One hour two or three times a week.</span> <span id="s45">And in addition to that were you also members of a synagogue or in any other [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WN: My parents were members of the synagogue at that time of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: What kind of synagogue were they members of?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WN: We call it liberal, here we call it conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JF: And were they very involved in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">WN: No, not too much.</span> <span id="s51">In that respect my parents were not too religious.</span> <span id="s52">At home, yes,</span></p> <p><span id="s53">but...</span></p> <p><span id="s54">JF: What do you mean at home, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WN: Well, observing Shabbos, light candles and all that business, my parents always did that.</span> <span id="s56">In the beginning during Passover we would eat no bread and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">JF: They didn’t keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WN: No.</span> <span id="s59">They observed the Shabbat and the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">JF: And did this include any kind of education for you in the synagogue or was your religious education mainly in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WN: In the school.</span> <span id="s62">We strictly went to synagogue for services.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">JF: Did you have training for Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WN: Yeah, I had training for Bar Mitzvah and that was special training at home.</span> <span id="s65">We had a teacher come to our house and I was taught for the Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: Was this an important part of the life of a Jewish child as you knew it?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WN: Definitely yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JF: This is something that most of the boys did?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WN: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s70">To give you an example, the teaching that we had for the Bar Mitzvah, that was private at home by a teacher, for example, but when it came to the actual Bar Mitzvah ceremony, we were seven boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JF: At the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">WN: At the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">JF: In one service?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WN: In one service, one after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JF: Was it that there were so many who were Bar Mitzvah at that time or that you chose?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WN: I didn’t choose anything.</span> <span id="s77">When I came, there were seven boys, we were altogether seven boys for the actual Bar Mitzvah ceremony.</span> <span id="s78">It was an exception, there were usually not that many boys at the same time but it just happened with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">JF: Your parents were involved, or your father, I guess, was involved in business with non-Jews as well.</span> <span id="s80">Did they also interact socially with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WN: Yes, we had some friends, non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">JF: In your memory was there ever any conflict for your parents at the time when they were living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JF: Was your father in the army in the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WN: No my father had one eye a little defective, in other words, he couldn’t see out of one eye, so he was never in the army.</span> <span id="s86">Furthermore, coming from Austria at that time, he was not a German citizen first.</span> <span id="s87">He then became a German citizen, he was naturalized.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JF: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WN: That was, I think it was about 1909, 1910, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JF: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WN: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">JF: But it was a physical problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WN: Oh yes, physical problem and furthermore, he was not a German citizen—born, so he was not called to the army at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">JF: So, if you were a naturalized German citizen you were not called to the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WN: No, not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JF: Do you remember the war and the effect it had?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WN: Very, very vaguely.</span> <span id="s98">I know we had some little problems with food, and we had a friend who was in the Austrian army, and he used to come to us, he was an officer and he was a Jewish friend and no, nothing otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JF: Did he report anything that you remember about his role in the army as a Jew in the Austrian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WN: No, no, no, the only thing that we knew was that a Jew had a hard time becoming an officer in the Germany army, but that’s about all that I can remember in regards to things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">JF: When the war was over and Germany had been defeated, do you have any recollections of what things were like at that time, did it affect you directly in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WN: No, I wouldn’t say that, no.</span> <span id="s103">Because all those things, look, Berlin was a pretty big city, and whenever something like that would happen, it was spread out, it was not actually centralized in one section, so I cannot remember anything after the war.</span> <span id="s104">I saw the revolution coming, of course.</span> <span id="s105">People on trucks chasing out the emperor and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JF: You remember seeing these trucks come into Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">WN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">JF: Was it frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: Did you understand what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WN: Yeah, I understood what was happening, but it wasn’t frightening in that respect, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JF: Was your father’s business or life affected in any way by the revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WN: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JF: Things went on as before?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">WN: Yes.</span> <span id="s116">Business was closed for a few days, of course, until it settled down and that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JF: Do you remember your parents talking about the revolution, whether they thought it was a good idea or not or whether they felt there would be any change for the Jews under the new regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WN: No, I can’t even remember that too much because I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JF’: And then what happened during the 20’s?</span> <span id="s120">There were certainly a lot of changes in Germany, the financial situation was severely affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WN: We had inflation, which was pretty bad, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">JF: I guess you were in the Gymnasium around that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WN: Yeah, at that time.</span> <span id="s124">The only thing that I remember was that our school building, for example, was pretty much damaged by the revolution, by the fights that were going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">JF: In what way, by crossfire?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WN: Yeah, crossfire, and our building was pretty bad at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JF: Were you ever in the building when there was firing in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WN: No.</span> <span id="s129">We were kept at home, the schools closed at that time.</span> <span id="s130">When there was any danger, they closed the schools, and, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: You were a young teenager at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">WN: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">JF: Was there any talk among the teenagers of joining in the fighting or allying with one side or another, did you sense any kind of allegiance at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WN: No, not at that time, no, not at that time.</span> <span id="s135">That came later, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">JF: Not in your early teens?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">JF: It was like something that was happening outside you?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WN: Yeah, basically my father may have been more involved in that, of course, but I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">JF: No, but you and your friends did not feel a part of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JF: You were not aware of any upset that the Kaiser had abdicated or that there would be a new...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WN: Oh Yeah, I was aware of it because I heard my parents talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">JF: But the kids did not seem to feel anything, that there was danger or anything would happen to Germany at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">JF: Were you aware of any of the early moves that Hitler made in the early 20’s?</span> <span id="s147">Was that something that was known among the group that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">WN: Well, when it started, as it was almost all over Germany, we laughed about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: In what way, what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WN: We thought they were just nuts, nothing.</span> <span id="s151">We didn’t take it serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JF: You knew Hitler himself existed but you didn’t take him seriously?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">JF: And his men were also laughable?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WN: Well, it happened, in fact it happened to me, when Hitler started, which was in '33, I don’t know if you know the expression, they had the SA men, Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s156">I was on the street and two of those SA men came by and called me a dirty Jew, and I turned around and hit one of them and then I realized what I was doing and I run away, and we had corner houses where you could go in here and come out on the other street, which I did and went up to my mother.</span> <span id="s157">My mother was a widow at that time, didn’t say anything to her because I didn’t want to frighten her, and I stayed home for about three or four days waiting if someone would ring the bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: Did they chase you?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WN: No, no one had seen me.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: Did the Brown Shirts that you had hit chase you?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WN: No, I was so fast, I went right into the next house out of the other and I never heard anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">JF: You say this was in ‘33.</span> <span id="s163">This was after Hitler was already chancellor then?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">WN: Yeah, just the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JF: Now, before that time, in the 20’s or the late 20’s, did you have any sense that this would come to pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WN We heard about Nuremberg, of course, where it started, and my parents talked about it and other people, and they all laughed about it, they didn’t take it serious, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JF: Now you were already, by the late 20’s, were out of school.</span> <span id="s168">You were -- this is after your Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WN: Yes, Yeah, Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">JF: What were you doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WN: I was an apprentice in a company.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">JF: For what kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">WN: Pharmaceutical business, and I was learning there as an apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">JF: You were learning sales or you were learning pharmacy itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">WN: Actually sales and office, at the time that’s what I was learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JF: Was your father alive at that time, you said he had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WN: He died in ‘25.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">JF: Was that expected, had he been ill or?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WN: He was ill for about four weeks.</span> <span id="s180">He had cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JF: So when he died, were you in a position to help with the family economically or was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">WN: No, not at that time because I was too young.</span> <span id="s183">I just started as an apprentice and you didn’t make money at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">JF: What was the name of the pharmaceutical company, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">WN: Yes, I remember that: Max Kahnemann [phonetic] and then you have to write in two letters, A.G., which was incorporated, stock company.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">JF: And you were in sales.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WN: No, actually I was in office work.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JF: In the office as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s189">During that time then in the late 20’s, with the depression, did that affect you in any way and your father’s death?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WN: Yes, everyday you had a different money situation.</span> <span id="s191">Let’s say the mark was 100, $1 would be 4 marks, then it was 20, then it was 100, then it was 1,000, and it came up.</span> <span id="s192">Every day they had new money.</span> <span id="s193">Because the money wasn’t worth anything the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">JF: How was your family operating financially at that point?</span> <span id="s195">Had there been enough money from your father’s company to keep you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WN: Yeah, we never had any problem, as far as that is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">JF: In the early 30’s, when so much was going on politically, were you thinking that there was any serious threat on Germany from Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">WN: Mrs. Fisher, if we would have thought about that, we would have left.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">JF: You really thought that Hitler would never make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">WN: No, because as so many of us, we did not believe in that, so we never left; we should have left in ‘33.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JF: What about, I am sure you knew people who did leave or who talked about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">WN: I have friends of my father who left, when my father was still living, in fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">JF: In the early 20’s.</span> <span id="s204">Did you think they were being over cautious?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">WN: Yeah, partially yes, because as we all, most of us thought, well, we had our living, we had no problems, so why should we leave.</span> <span id="s206">We had our home, we had everything there, so why should we leave, and where should we go.</span> <span id="s207">So there was never any... I had some friends who left earlier but otherwise, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">JF: Was there any change in the non-Jewish population attitude towards you, either people you had known or other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">WN: Other people, yes, but people that I had known, friends and so on, no, there was no change.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: When did you first feel the change in the non-Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">WN: Well, actually, you know the Crystal Night, of course.</span> <span id="s212">Well, when that started...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">JF: No, we are jumping now a few years.</span> <span id="s214">There was nothing before Kristallnacht, when the Nuremberg laws came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">WN: When the Nuremberg laws came in, yes, but I was two years in Czechoslovakia at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JF: Okay, let’s back up then.</span> <span id="s217">In ‘33, you told me about the incident with the brown shirts.</span> <span id="s218">What happened after that, maybe we can progress up until the war; you were still an apprentice at that time, or were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">WN: No, I was already working in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JF: In this pharmaceutical company?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">WN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JF: And then what happened after that, did you notice at that point any changes in the non-Jewish population towards you, before the Nuremberg laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WN: No, I still had my friends and there was no change.</span> <span id="s224">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s225">I had customers all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">JF: Non—Jewish customers and that was not a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">WN: No, no problems, whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JF: When the Nuremberg laws were instituted you said you were in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s229">So when did you go to Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">WN: I left Germany in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JF: So you were there from ‘36 to ‘38?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">WN: No, I’m sorry, ‘35 I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">JF: ‘35 to ‘37 you were in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WN: In fact I came back to Germany in January ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">JF: Why were you in Czechoslovakia?</span> <span id="s236">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">WN: Well, our company in Berlin was not doing very well.</span> <span id="s238">So the owner of the company said to me, "Willi", he was born in Czechoslovakia and he said, “I want to leave Germany and I want to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s239">I have my parents there and I want to start our business”, which we had at that time, “in Czechoslovakia with our products which we had produced, and I have already connections where I can start a factory and an office and everything.</span> <span id="s240">Would you go with me?</span> <span id="s241">Do you have any money?”</span> <span id="s242">And I said, “Yes, I have some money left from my parents.”</span> <span id="s243">He said, “Would you take that money and go with me and pay for your own expenses.”</span> <span id="s244">I said sure.</span> <span id="s245">So we left together and we went to Czechoslovakia with his car and went to Prague, and there met a chemical engineer who was willing to open up a small factory with our products, manufacturing our products.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">JF: Was this a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">WN: Yeah, it was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">JF: And was the person you are talking about Jewish or non-Jewish from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">WN: No, he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s250">We went to Prague and talked to this man together, he and I, and then we went to Brunn.</span> <span id="s251">[Brno, today] This is in, South Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s252">And that’s where this chemist had his home and his place of business, so from Prague we went together with him and started, he manufactured the products, we opened up a small office in Brunn, together he and I went, took the package you have for your beauty cream, or whatever, we took that and starting at the German border, we went with the products that we had from Germany, manufactured in Germany with the address in Berlin, and we went from one drugstore pharmacy, we went from one to the other, he on one side and I on the other side, with our German products, and we showed the people.</span> <span id="s253">“This is what we want to do, this is what we want to manufacture, this is the way it will look, of course, in the domestic language, and so on, and this is what we want you to do.</span> <span id="s254">Will you give us an order?</span> <span id="s255">And they did.</span> <span id="s256">So we collected about a pack of this and, then we went to the manufacturer and we said, “Now here are the orders which prove that we can sell that ,” and that’s how we started the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JF: Now, at the time you were in Czechoslovakia, things were still fairly quiet there as far as the Nazi party?</span> <span id="s258">Things were beginning to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">WN: On the German border, that’s where it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">JF: Did you feel it when you were up there?</span> <span id="s261">WN: Personally, no, but you could see the German attitude, compared to the Czech attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">JF: When you say the German attitude, do you mean among the Czech population who were pro-German?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WN: No, along the German border there were Germans who have come from Germany and who were living there.</span> <span id="s264">They were called Sudeten Germans, that’s along the German border, and that’s how we got started, because we couldn’t speak the other language, we spoke in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">JF: So in other words you sold initially to the Sudeten Germans and they bought from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">WN: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s267">There was no problem, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">JF: But you sensed a change in their attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">WN: I heard from talking, not to us, not against us, but I heard the attitude they had compared to the Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JF: Did they know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">WN: The Czechs?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">JF: No, the Sudeten Germans that you sold to.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">WN: No, I don’t think so because we came from Berlin and they never had any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">JF: Did you sense anything among the Czechs at all that would indicate what was going or what would happen very shortly politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">WN: You see, Mrs. Fisher, you must understand, Czechoslovakia was actually around the borders Germans, former Germans, I would say.</span> <span id="s276">Then in the southern part there were the people who spoke Hungarian and Russian.</span> <span id="s277">This is all on the southern border, and in the heart of the actual Czechoslovakia, there were Czechs, which was only a very small section.</span> <span id="s278">They didn’t even speak German, they spoke just Czech, or if they spoke German, they didn’t want to speak it.</span> <span id="s279">So, therefore, everything else was mixed.</span> <span id="s280">The real pure Czech section was only a very little section in the heart of the country , so that’s why you could do anything in certain languages, you could speak German all over, that’s how we could do business.</span> <span id="s281">and</span></p> <p><span id="s282">JF: You didn’t speak Czech then?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">WN: No, I never spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s284">So it was not hard to go with the German language and do business.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">JF: Did you have any feeling that more was going to be happening in Germany as you were in Czechoslovakia hearing these reports?</span> <span id="s286">WN: No, I’ll tell you why I didn’t know, For example, when I wrote a friend of mine who lived in Germany that I am coming back, when I made my decision I leave and go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s287">I sent him a letter that I will arrive.</span> <span id="s288">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JF: You said you had written a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">WN: I had written a friend that I want to come back.</span> <span id="s291">I didn’t even wait for his answer, I just packed my stuff, went back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">JF: And this was in January of ‘37?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">WN: Yeah, and I went to the next telephone booth because he wasn’t at the station.</span> <span id="s294">Usually when you expect someone, you go to the station and wait for the person to come out of the train, and he wasn’t there, and I was looking and I couldn’t find him, so I went out, and outside he was standing there waiting for me and I said, “What is this, why didn’t you come to the train?”</span> <span id="s295">He said, "Come on, I’ll tell you outside, not here.”</span> <span id="s296">He said, “Didn’t you get my letter?”</span> <span id="s297">I said, “No, what letter?”</span> <span id="s298">“Well, I wrote you not to come back, because if you come back from Czechoslovakia, they put you in a schooling camp for about six months which was like a concentration camp, and I didn’t want you to go through with this.”</span></p> <p><span id="s299">JF: Who were they putting in the schooling camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">WN: People who came from other countries back, like I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">JF: Who had been in Germany before?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">WN: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Tape 1, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s304">JF: This is tape 1, side 2 of an interview with Mr. Willie Nowak.</span> <span id="s305">These camps were set up purely for redoctrination?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">WN: Right, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">JF: There was some fear that you had had other political ideas being on the outside of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">WN: And, furthermore, they felt sometimes that you hadn’t been there before they started, and they wanted to indoctrinate you.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">JF: But this was for German citizens who were coming in?</span> <span id="s310">Or for anyone...</span></p> <p><span id="s311">WN: For people who lived in Germany or came in, entered to Germany, they would take those people and what they would call indoctrinate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">JF: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">WN: Before I left Czechoslovakia I went to the consulate in the last city in Czechoslovakia, and I took out my German passport out and showed them and I said, “I want you to change my residence from Berlin to in Gablenz, [phonetic] (was the city in Czechoslovakia) because I am living here now and I had taken from my landlady a certificate that I am living in her apartment.”</span></p> <p><span id="s314">JF: Does that then mean that you gave up your German citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">WN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">JF: It just meant that your residency was in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">WN: My residency was as a German citizen in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s318">This is what I wanted to prove because I knew about this so-called schooling camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">JF: You knew about this already in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">WN: Yes, I knew that and I didn’t want to go in there, naturally, so I went like that, and the first thing happened after I came back that I went to the police and wanted to register as a citizen who just returned, and wanted to give him my address and everything else.</span> <span id="s321">So they said, “Oh no, that’s not the way we do it.</span> <span id="s322">You came from Czechoslovakia, so you got to go to the Gestapo first, they have to check you out.”</span> <span id="s323">And I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s324">So I got a summons right away, the next day, to come to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s325">So this friend of mine went with me and I said, “You wait outside, because if something happens, if you see me coming out in company with someone, we don’t know each other,” because I didn’t want him to get in trouble.</span> <span id="s326">So I went into the office, and there was a typical Prussian officer sitting there with a mustache, and when I saw that I feeled already better.</span> <span id="s327">So he waited outside and I went in, and there was this real old Prussian official sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JF: He was not a Gestapo person?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">WN: No, he was working in the office; the Gestapo was downstairs.</span> <span id="s330">So I said to him that I would like to have a passport, I would like to have this changed my address as German now living in Germany, with a residence not in a foreign country.</span> <span id="s331">And he said, “Well, you go,” (I was traveling on business already, I had that arranged with a company that I knew) and he said, “Well, you have to wait four months, three months, two months, I don’t know, but you have to wait until we call you.”</span> <span id="s332">I said: “No, I can’t wait because I have work and go out and work on business.”</span> <span id="s333">So he said, “Well, you traveled and you lived here already without being a citizen, so what difference does it make?”</span> <span id="s334">I said, “Now wait a minute, first of all I didn’t know that I am not a citizen anymore.</span> <span id="s335">As you can see on my passport, I am a German citizen.</span> <span id="s336">This was arranged at the consulate at the Czechoslovakia border before I left.</span> <span id="s337">.</span> <span id="s338">So I am a German citizen who was living in another country and, therefore, I didn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s339">Here’s the passport.”</span> <span id="s340">He said, “Well, you have to return that passport, because you are not a citizen anymore.</span> <span id="s341">We took your citizenship away while you were in Czechoslovakia.”</span></p> <p><span id="s342">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">WN: Because I was a Jew and I left Germany, so they took the citizenship away, which I didn’t know, so I said, “Let me ask you a question, how do you handle this when someone is living in another country and you take his citizenship away, don’t you notify the people?”</span> <span id="s344">He said, “Well, we couldn’t notify you because you weren’t here.</span> <span id="s345">We didn’t have the address.”</span> <span id="s346">I said, “ Well, you had the address and you wanted me now.”</span> <span id="s347">He said, “Well, you could have read that it in the Official Employees of the Government.”</span> <span id="s348">(That’s a special paper.)</span> <span id="s349">I said, “Let me ask you a questions, do you read that paper?”</span></p> <p><span id="s350">JF: This is only distributed to employees of the government, which you were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">WN: No, that’s right, I was not, but they thought I should know.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">JF: And that was the only place that this law was written?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">WN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">JF: Not in the public newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">WN: No.</span> <span id="s356">So I said, “Do you read that paper?”</span> <span id="s357">And he laughed.</span> <span id="s358">He said, “No,” I said, “Fine.</span> <span id="s359">Now, if you didn’t read it, how am I supposed to read that?”</span> <span id="s360">So he laughed and I laughed, and I figured now I have won.</span> <span id="s361">So, he said “I’ll tell you what to do.</span> <span id="s362">You have to leave your passport, but you go right down to the next floor and apply for a stateless passport so that you can travel without getting in trouble.”</span></p> <p><span id="s363">JF: In other words, there was no way of getting back your German citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">WN: No.</span> <span id="s365">So I said, “Okay.”</span></p> <p><span id="s366">JF: You were a Jew and that was it?</span> <span id="s367">WN: Yeah, I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s368">I do that.</span> <span id="s369">How can I?</span> <span id="s370">Then I went downstairs and I applied for a stateless citizen pass, and they said, “Okay, you have to wait a month or two months or whatever,” and I said, “How am I supposed to travel if I have no document proving that I am living here?”</span> <span id="s371">He said, “Well, ...”; that’s when I blew up, and then he said, “You should have read that in the paper,” and I said, “You don’t even read it.”</span> <span id="s372">He said, “I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s373">What you do is you go down and apply for that stateless passport.”</span></p> <p><span id="s374">JF: This would have been at Gestapo headquarters that you would have had to apply for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">WN: Yeah, and when you do that, ask for a receipt of your application so you can’t get in trouble when you are travelling, which they gave me.</span> <span id="s376">So if, for example, it was customary during that time when you were in a hotel and you had to leave your passport with the desk, and then when you leave, you get it back, so I said, “Well, if I have no proof that I have my passport even if it is a stateless passport, what am I supposed to do?”</span> <span id="s377">He said, “Okay, I give you a receipt that you have applied, which you can take with you so that you are protected in case you have any questions.”</span> <span id="s378">And this is exactly the way it happened.</span> <span id="s379">Nobody bothered me, I had my proof that I had applied for a stateless passport, and when I returned to Berlin I got a notice that my passport was ready to be picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">JF: So you traveled in Germany working?</span> <span id="s381">Using this receipt?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">WN: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">JF: As you were travelling, what did you notice about the changes in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">WN: The first thing “Jews not Wanted” in every store and every restaurant and all over.</span> <span id="s385">That’s the first thing, the signs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">JF: Hotels also?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">WN: Oh, yeah, hotels also.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">JF: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">WN: Well, I was very well known over there because I traveled for years and I knew every hotel, so there were always small hotels which did not display that particular sign, and I used to go to those hotels and stay there.</span> <span id="s390">And I came to one hotel which I knew before, and I went into the dining room after I had taken my room and took my clothes and refreshed myself and so on, and I came into the dining room and they had greeted me already as an old friend, and I was ordering the dinner and reading the menu and giving my order, and I looked up and behind a wardrobe stand where you put your clothes was that sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">JF: On the wall behind the wardrobe?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">WN: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">JF: So that it didn’t show?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">WN: That’s where they put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">JF: So legally they had put it up, but they didn’t pay any attention to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">WN: Right.</span> <span id="s397">So I said, "Call the owner," and it was a lady.</span> <span id="s398">She came out and she said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s399">I said, “Cancel my order and cancel my room, I am leaving.</span> <span id="s400">She said, “What’s the matter?</span> <span id="s401">Why?”</span> <span id="s402">I said, “You see this.”</span> <span id="s403">So she took a coat and she hung it over the sign and she said, “Do you see that sign?”</span> <span id="s404">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s405">“What do you want?”</span> <span id="s406">This is the way they handled it.</span> <span id="s407">So I stayed there, naturally, and there was always a place where you could stay, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">JF: These were primarily people that you had known before?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">WN: Most of them, because I was staying overnight in those hotels.</span> <span id="s410">Then I met, this is an interesting part, then I met a young man who I knew as a competitor, a salesman, a competitor from another company and he said, “Willi, how are you?”</span> <span id="s411">We had actually met in a customer’s place.</span> <span id="s412">I was waiting outside because if someone goes in, we used to wait outside for the competitor to come out and then we would go in.</span> <span id="s413">So he said, “Willi, when did you come back?”</span> <span id="s414">I said, “Just a few weeks ago.”</span> <span id="s415">He said, “Let’s talk about it, I’m finished, I’ll wait for you.</span> <span id="s416">When you finish we will go and have a coffee.”</span> <span id="s417">And he was, do you know the name Horst Wessel?</span> <span id="s418">Horst Wessel was the man who actually composed the song and he was a very good friend of that man.</span> <span id="s419">But we were very good together, too, and he said, he waited.</span> <span id="s420">When we were finished, he said, “Let’s go together and have a coffee,” so we went and he said, “Where are you going now?”</span> <span id="s421">He said, “Well I’m going this week all the way down to southern Germany.”</span> <span id="s422">He said, “I have a car.”</span> <span id="s423">(I didn’t have a car at that time.)</span> <span id="s424">“How about we go together?”</span> <span id="s425">I said, “Now wait a minute!</span> <span id="s426">You are working for a competitor.</span> <span id="s427">They will know very soon that you and I are going together, and I am in your car, do you know what that means?</span> <span id="s428">You are taking a Jew in your car?”</span> <span id="s429">He said, “Let me worry about that.</span> <span id="s430">We go together.”</span></p> <p><span id="s431">JF: On the paper, this temporary application that you were carrying with you at this point before your passport, before the stateless passport came through, was there a J?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">WN: Yeah.</span> <span id="s433">J printed.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">JF: The J printed, a big J.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">WN: Yeah, but that was all over wherever you went, stateless or German, you had the same J.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">JF: So he took you in his car.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">WN: So he took me in the car and we went together for three or four weeks in his car.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">JF: Were you ever stopped?</span> <span id="s439">Questioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">WN: No.</span> <span id="s441">Nothing.</span> <span id="s442">So, when we came back to Berlin, he said, “Well, we meet again on Monday.”</span> <span id="s443">This was over the weekend.</span> <span id="s444">“We meet on Monday again and we go together again!”</span> <span id="s445">I said, “Look, you better check this, because you are going to get into trouble with your company and I don’t want this.”</span></p> <p><span id="s446">JF: This is during 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">WN: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">So sure enough on Monday, he called and he said, “Willi, I am very sorry.”</span> <span id="s449">I said, “Don’t tell me, I told you this before, I don’t want you to get into trouble, so forget it.”</span> <span id="s450">And, of course, then we split up and I took the train again, that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">JF: Did you continue to have contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">WN: Yeah, only with cards and so on.</span> <span id="s453">There was another incident which was interesting.</span> <span id="s454">When I was travelling I also set up distributors in certain areas, so I had an ad in the paper, and I interviewed them at night in a hotel to see if I can set up a local distributor for our products, and this man came to the hotel, he had applied for the distributorship, and he was a local salesman there.</span> <span id="s455">He had several companies that he already represented.</span> <span id="s456">So, we sat together and I liked him, and he also came from Berlin, and I hired him for that particular area as a distributor, and one day he came and said, “You know, this is interesting.”</span> <span id="s457">I took him together with me to train him and to introduce him to the local customers, so that they know that he will represent our company instead of me.</span> <span id="s458">So one evening we were in our hotel after we worked together and made our reports and he said, “You know, a funny thing happened.”</span> <span id="s459">There was one drugstore that had about eight branches in that city, in other words like a chain, and he said, “You know this guy what he said to me today?”</span> <span id="s460">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s461">He said, “You know the man with whom you are working together, he’s a Jew.”</span> <span id="s462">And he, the salesman laughed, would you believe that?</span> <span id="s463">Now I was fast thinking, I figured, if I say something now, I pull the rug from under his feet, so I didn’t say anything, I didn’t say yes or no or nothing.</span> <span id="s464">I just didn’t react to it and let it go, and I had made up my mind when I come back to Berlin and I meet him, then I will tell him.</span> <span id="s465">And we worked together, we continued working; everything was fine, and I left for Berlin and about two or three weeks later he called me and he said, “Willi, how are you?</span> <span id="s466">I am back here temporarily, how about having some coffee?”</span> <span id="s467">and I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s468">I had made up my mind, when he walks in, and I am sitting at the table before and I am going to tell him I am a Jew, and if he don’t like it, just don’t sit at my table.</span> <span id="s469">And he came in, and I was already waiting and I said, “Before you sit down, I want you to know” and he said, “I know that.”</span> <span id="s470">I said, “What do you mean you know that?”</span> <span id="s471">He said, “I’ve known for quite a while.”</span> <span id="s472">I said, “How come?”</span> <span id="s473">There was a Jewish girl that I knew when we were young, we grew up together in the same neighborhood in Berlin and I found her by accident in a cafe house which we were sitting, this salesman and I, and she was a prostitute, a Jewish prostitute, and, of course, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s474">He said to me, “You know that girl?”</span> <span id="s475">And I said, “Yeah.</span> <span id="s476">I know her from where we grew up together.”</span> <span id="s477">He said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s478">So I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s479">She told him that I am a Jew and I said, “You still went with me?”</span> <span id="s480">And he said, “Sure.”</span></p> <p><span id="s481">JF: This was something he knew before the trip or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">WN: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">JF: Before the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">WN: So, he just didn’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s485">Things like that happened.</span> <span id="s486">So now what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">JF: So it sounds like there were several people that you had contact with, for whom these laws were just irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">WN: Forgive me, another thing.</span> <span id="s489">I had all my customers, as I told you, and a few customers, one in particular, I remember when I came back from Czechoslovakia, he said to me, “I thought you don’t live anymore, I thought they killed you.”</span> <span id="s490">I said, “Why should they kill me?”</span> <span id="s491">He said, “Well, you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s492">I said, “Well, how do you know?”</span> <span id="s493">He said, “I know, I know for a long time,” and he said, “I also know all the people here, and they all told me that you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s494">and they all bought from me.</span> <span id="s495">So I said, “Well if that’s the case, why do you buy from me?”</span> <span id="s496">He said, “Why not?</span> <span id="s497">We are doing business together and it’s nobody’s business with whom I do business, and I know you for years and that’s all.”</span></p> <p><span id="s498">JF: Was there anybody among that group that you had known before who knew that you were Jewish, who refused to do business with you after this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">WN: No.</span> <span id="s500">Not one.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">JF: Many of them knew that you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">WN: Even after they knew, only one person that I remember, one or two, who said, “Willi, we can’t deal with you, so please don’t be angry.</span> <span id="s503">We would like to have you come by in the evening or something, but not on business."</span></p> <p><span id="s504">JF: You mean they would see you socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">WN: They wanted to, but I didn’t go,
