So I had a quiet childhood, because no noise at home, no noise, no kids, no birthday parties, no visitors.</span> <span id="s41">Sometimes I had birthday parties at my friend's house.</span> <span id="s42">She lived close to me, and I asked my friends to go to another apartment because of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s43">And always somebody was with her -- my mother or my grandfather was with her for helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">(So your mother didn't work?)</span> <span id="s45">No, she worked.</span> <span id="s46">But she worked close to my house so she could walk to her job and come back during lunch time.</span> <span id="s47">It took about 15-20 minutes by walking, so after her job she very quickly could come.</span> <span id="s48">And my grandfather, he didn't work at that time, so he usually could stay home and take care of the kids, house, cooking, everything.</span> <span id="s49">(What was his occupation?)</span> <span id="s50">He was a communist.</span> <span id="s51">That was his occupation and he... I don't remember his position, what he did before, because I was a baby when he was retired.</span> <span id="s52">He was a member of the Communist Party and he really believed.</span> <span id="s53">That's what I remember about him because the whole of life that I remember, he didn't work.</span> <span id="s54">He was retired.</span> <span id="s55">He was too old, about 65 when I was a baby.</span> <span id="s56">He had some position at the seaport.</span> <span id="s57">Odessa is a big seaport.</span> <span id="s58">The seaport administration, but it was the low level, not the high level of the position, but as I remember because the first apartment that we talked about, it was in the special building that was built by the seaport administration for the seamen.</span> <span id="s59">They had business trips by ship, and their family... that was a reason to build this house and we had an apartment in that house because of that.</span> <span id="s60">It was like a special kind of house.</span> <span id="s61">It wasn't special condition, but the reason to take this house was because we had no choice.</span> <span id="s62">It was just one chance to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s63">This was very hard at the beginning of the Sixties to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s64">So I really wanted another apartment, but I don't remember so much because I was five when we moved to this one.</span> <span id="s65">And we lived there about twenty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">(You were near the sea then.)</span> <span id="s67">Yeah.</span> <span id="s68">It wasn't too close, but we can walk to the beach and swim and in my childhood we had a big crowd and all the kids from the house... We could go to the beach about 20-30 minutes by walk, and swim.</span> <span id="s69">I was like 10-12 years old then, not a little child, because that is too dangerous.</span> <span id="s70">The Black Sea is a dangerous sea, it's not like Lake Michigan.</span> <span id="s71">Anything can happen.</span> <span id="s72">There's a guard, but it's too far.</span> <span id="s73">So it's for the best swimmers.</span> <span id="s74">So I was 10-12 years old so I could come.</span> <span id="s75">It was a beach but here nothing can happen.</span> <span id="s76">[The kids] get attention and there are other people who work to take care of everybody who's swimming, but there it's another thing where it's quiet.</span> <span id="s77">There were more people in good weather on weekends in summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">(Did you have chores?)</span> <span id="s79">I had some, not much.</span> <span id="s80">I don't really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">(Did you have political discussions?)</span> <span id="s82">Grandfather talked about being a Communist lots of times.</span> <span id="s83">And when I was a child I also believed that, some of those old stories were interesting, but I grew up so fast and like when I was fifteen, sixteen, I didn't believe in that.</span> <span id="s84">(Why did you grow up so fast?)</span> <span id="s85">I mean that the ten years in your childhood can bring you much more than the ten years between 30 and 40, 40 and 50, etc.</span> <span id="s86">So much happens.</span> <span id="s87">(What caused you to change your mind about your beliefs?</span> <span id="s88">Who were your grandfather's heros?)</span> <span id="s89">Lenin, mostly.</span> <span id="s90">We didn't talk about Stalin because at the beginning of the Sixties there's ten years from the Sixties to the Eighties, we knew everything about Stalin mostly the second year after he's dead.</span> <span id="s91">Kruschev opened the door and everything was discovered.</span> <span id="s92">It wasn't like a hero of the Soviets.</span> <span id="s93">He brought a lot of bad things to Russia, so he wasn't a hero in my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">(By the time you were ten, about 1966-67, Kruschev's revelations about Stalin changed the schoolchildren's views about Stalin as a hero.)</span> <span id="s95">Yeah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s96">(How did your grandfather react to that?)</span> <span id="s97">I don't remember his reaction because his opinion about Lenin was like a wall and nobody could destroy that.</span> <span id="s98">(Who tried to argue with him at home?)</span> <span id="s99">Nobody, because it was impossible, first of all; and he was a very strong man, for his age and his behavior was like he was owner of this apartment and my father didn't discuss anything with him because we lived so close.</span> <span id="s100">It is impossible to make the people angry and to live together.</span> <span id="s101">We are trying to be quiet because we couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s102">(So there was a lot of strain in that household?)</span> <span id="s103">Of course, but we didn't know about that.</span> <span id="s104">My parents were quiet and happy, like a couple.</span> <span id="s105">My childhood at that point was so happy because they didn't have a divorce and things like that.</span> <span id="s106">They were trying to bring the quietness in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">(What did your mother do?)</span> <span id="s108">My mother graduated the technical school like an economist.</span> <span id="s109">My father pushed her to do this because when she got married she just had the high school education.</span> <span id="s110">And my father finished at another institute of technology just before the second world war, and he was an officer in the war.</span> <span id="s111">Just in 1941.</span> <span id="s112">He finished the university in June.</span> <span id="s113">So he took part in the war and a lot of battles and he had some certificate of recognition.</span> <span id="s114">He was a good officer, anyway.</span> <span id="s115">He finished his [duty] at Bucharest, Romania in 1945.</span> <span id="s116">That was the finish of the second world war.</span> <span id="s117">So he was in it four years, from beginning to end.</span> <span id="s118">Afterward he came back and married my mother in 1950.</span> <span id="s119">In 1951 my older sister was born.</span> <span id="s120">And he pushed my mother to take the education.</span> <span id="s121">So she finished and worked as the administrator of a big shoe store, like account administrator.</span> <span id="s122">It wasn't a high position.</span> <span id="s123">But it was a quiet job.</span> <span id="s124">Even a little education is better than never.</span> <span id="s125">My father was inspector of the food industry because he finished his education in food processing.</span> <span id="s126">So he was inspector of all food storage-- all kinds of food that come to Odessa, by seaport, airport, trains, everything.</span> <span id="s127">We have this special organization to check the food, check the condition of any kind of food like milk, bread, meat.</span> <span id="s128">He had about thirty years' experience.</span> <span id="s129">He was famous in his field.</span> <span id="s130">Even somebody in the high level of the same organization in Moscow, they ask you to take a higher degree than Masters-- Ph.D.</span> <span id="s131">He started it, but didn't finish.</span> <span id="s132">I was born and was a baby, and he needs to live in Moscow and it takes a few years, and he decided not to do it.</span> <span id="s133">He continued to work until he turned sixty and retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">(Do you remember any historical events from your teenage years, etc.) I remember what has happening in Czechoslovakia because the soldiers from Odessa were sent there, because that's a special district belonging to the Ukraine which needs to take care of that.</span> <span id="s135">That was part of their job.</span> <span id="s136">So they took the soldiers from Odessa to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s137">So I remember that it was at night and they brought the dead soldiers back also at night.</span> <span id="s138">Nobody could see them.</span> <span id="s139">And I remember.</span> <span id="s140">This is a very good example: when I was after high school I was seventeen years old in the middle of the year-- It was a "good" age, Brezhnev period, I mean good in quotation marks.</span> <span id="s141">One of my classmates was in the Soviet army and his mother was alone.</span> <span id="s142">She was a very interesting lady.</span> <span id="s143">She was very highly education, she was a musician, she finished the conservatory, and she worked at the radio station.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">[CONTINUED NOVEMBER 15, 1990] She was very professional.</span> <span id="s145">She was a painter and she sewed well.</span> <span id="s146">She had unbelievable kinds of [embroidery, etc.] like that and she was a professional in this field also.</span> <span id="s147">But anyway, what happened with her.</span> <span id="s148">She was alone, divorced.</span> <span id="s149">Her husband was in Moscow.</span> <span id="s150">He was an officer in the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s151">She didn't like this.</span> <span id="s152">Her son was in the Soviet army and the KGB found that she was trying to organize some Jewish young people to get their work, like music or philosophy, not close to the political, but anyway.</span> <span id="s153">Some of that work she was trying to put on the radio, recordings, and give them some space in the radio programs.</span> <span id="s154">(So it wasn't close to being political?)</span> <span id="s155">Not one percent.</span> <span id="s156">But they were Jews.</span> <span id="s157">She was Jewish 50%.</span> <span id="s158">Her mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s159">That was the reason the KGB was watching her.</span> <span id="s160">And she lost her job and all her neighbors were upset with her and they did unbelievable things to her.</span> <span id="s161">She occupied a little room in a big apartment and a few other people lived together.</span> <span id="s162">They had just one kitchen for all of them.</span> <span id="s163">They could put something, like a dust, on her food.</span> <span id="s164">You can die from that.</span> <span id="s165">They made very angry jokes to her-- I can't find the right words right now because fifteen years have passed and I'm still upset about that because you know it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s166">I was just one person in whom she believed, and she was crazy of that.</span> <span id="s167">The situation drove her crazy, I mean really crazy.</span> <span id="s168">(How long did they treat her that way?)</span> <span id="s169">A couple of years.</span> <span id="s170">Just two years her son was in Soviet army and nobody could save her and protect her from everything like that and they called in the middle of the night; they came in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s171">You know, she lost her job and then she couldn't find another one because everybody knew-- the good person and nobody could give her a job and there's the special organization in each city like a housing authority.</span> <span id="s172">They didn't give her the permit to live anymore so she was closed to even a small room.</span> <span id="s173">So she was homeless: no job, no money, nothing for living, and it was driving her crazy because she was such a strong-feeling lady, she was so sensitive and nervous, you know, the high level of humanity and education and organization.</span> <span id="s174">So she wasn't so strong to get the war against the KGB.</span> <span id="s175">She didn't have any relatives or any friends to save her or give her even a little money.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">(She lived in the same building with you?)</span> <span id="s177">No, it wasn't.</span> <span id="s178">But I already worked, and it was close to my job and it was like downtown Odessa and a few times a week I usually came to her apartment to spend a little time with her because I was afraid, of course, for her life, because I knew her very well and I understood the situation.</span> <span id="s179">She explained to me, pretty clear, it couldn't be false, because I knew the KGB could do everything they want and especially this kind of people who couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s180">And at last she went to Moscow to the Moscow Congress to help and protect herself and at the same time I was in the Crimea where her son was in the army and I met him there.</span> <span id="s181">He knew everything but he couldn't do anything because he couldn't leave the army.</span> <span id="s182">And he asked the officer to give him a few days because of his mother's illness, and at last he went to Moscow just a couple days later, and she was now in like a special hospital for crazy people.</span> <span id="s183">They put her the same, like the dissidents, everybody who doesn't agree with the Communist party or the government.</span> <span id="s184">They put a lot of people over there.</span> <span id="s185">So they put her the same kind of place and they give her some kind of medication and at last she died.</span> <span id="s186">(How long was she in the hospital?)</span> <span id="s187">Just maybe a few days and he asked the doctors-- just permit him to take her home and he did this and she lived just a couple of months after that.</span> <span id="s188">After that I saw her just one time because it was unbelievable, you know, because she was absolutely crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">(How old was she when she died?)</span> <span id="s190">Not even forty years old.</span> <span id="s191">She was so young.</span> <span id="s192">Her son was born when she was seventeen or eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s193">So they were like brother and sister.</span> <span id="s194">There wasn't a big difference between the ages.</span> <span id="s195">He was nineteen and she was like 37, 38.</span> <span id="s196">And she had a very big, long white hair like close to a yard long, enough that they cut her hair like in the army, like an inch long-- They cut off all her hair.</span> <span id="s197">And when I saw her I couldn't recognize her.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">(Did she recognize you that last time?)</span> <span id="s199">No, she didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s200">She didn't recognize even her son because of the medication.</span> <span id="s201">It was a big stress they gave to her-- it was like a shock.</span> <span id="s202">(Her son was your friend?)</span> <span id="s203">Yeah, but it wasn't close.</span> <span id="s204">We studied together.</span> <span id="s205">Anyway, this is a usual case.</span> <span id="s206">It's not like it's an unbelievable story.</span> <span id="s207">It can happen to anybody at any time.</span> <span id="s208">Even if you're just a little bit taller or not like everybody else, the KGB could find you.</span> <span id="s209">(It didn't help to stand out in the crowd?)</span> <span id="s210">Yeah, but she didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s211">She didn't go outside and say, "I don't like this government, I don't want to live here, I don't want to be in the Communist party, everything is wrong"--no.</span> <span id="s212">She was just trying to help the Jewish young people to play music, to publish their poetry.</span> <span id="s213">She didn't do anything against anybody, but even in this case, anything could happen.</span> <span id="s214">If the people could say something outside, of course they could kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">(When you went to visit her, did you bring her anything?)</span> <span id="s216">I usually brought her some food.</span> <span id="s217">She didn't ask me for money and she didn't permit me to give her any money because she had some pictures and sold them to get a little money for bread.</span> <span id="s218">She got help from her mother, but usually I brought something to eat to her like sausage, bread, butter, cakes, mineral water, but she didn't permit me to bring her anything because she couldn't even eat-- She was so nervous.</span> <span id="s219">She lived in shock a couple of years and she was afraid to go out even to the kitchen to make tea or something like that.</span> <span id="s220">So she was afraid of everybody and everything.</span> <span id="s221">The last time I also was afraid because I saw that she was driven crazy.</span> <span id="s222">She told me I worked at the KGB.</span> <span id="s223">You know, I was seventeen years old and I couldn't say anything false.</span> <span id="s224">This was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s225">She said, "Okay, I believe you, I love you.</span> <span id="s226">You're my close friend and I appreciate your coming ..." It was like a round.</span> <span id="s227">She couldn't do anything and I saw that.</span> <span id="s228">She was sick of that, of course, but they killed her anyway by the medication, the situation - by everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">(Did she or her son regard themselves as Jewish?)</span> <span id="s230">He went to Canada with me when the door was a little open.</span> <span id="s231">We were the first people who came and he went to Canada with his friends and he has now a wife and a little son and they're together.</span> <span id="s232">He said, "I wish to forget about Russia forever.</span> <span id="s233">I even wish to forget the Russian language-- never speak Russian, because this is not my motherland.</span> <span id="s234">It's not the country in which I wish to live and I don't need to teach Russian to my son and that's all."</span> <span id="s235">(Did he leave as a Jew?)</span> <span id="s236">That didn't matter because everybody who could leave could get a permit to go.</span> <span id="s237">Nobody asked him and there's this special office for where you're going.</span> <span id="s238">If you got the Israel invitation, it was enough.</span> <span id="s239">He prepared a little story how he's a Jew because he's just a quarter Jew, and he didn't have this specific appearance, you know, he had blond hair and blue eyes, like his mother.</span> <span id="s240">I think he will get a better future now.</span> <span id="s241">Everything is open to him now.</span> <span id="s242">He's just thirty or so, that's nothing for men.</span> <span id="s243">It's not like women.</span> <span id="s244">For men, it's just the beginning of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">(What was happening in your life then?)</span> <span id="s246">I had my institute-- it's between college and university-- five years of education.</span> <span id="s247">I was in the evening division, and a full-time job.</span> <span id="s248">So I had six years because it's not each day you study.</span> <span id="s249">It's three times a week.</span> <span id="s250">So after high school I worked full-time and studied.</span> <span id="s251">(Because your family couldn't afford to send you to school?)</span> <span id="s252">No, because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s253">I finished the special math high school.</span> <span id="s254">I had very good grades after this and I couldn't try to start any university but everybody knew who gets a Jew to start or another not.</span> <span id="s255">So my wish was to go into the architectural field because I like to paint and I thought this was enough.</span> <span id="s256">But because I was a Jew... My sister finished, but in the structural division.</span> <span id="s257">The director of this institute said to my father, because directors could sometimes close things to a Jew, he said, "I'll give you a good recommendation.</span> <span id="s258">Put your daughter in any other institute but this, because she couldn't start anyway if she was like Einstein, because she's Jewish, that's all."</span> <span id="s259">They could tell you: don't spend your time.</span> <span id="s260">Don't spend your nerves.</span> <span id="s261">Just change your mind.</span> <span id="s262">(Were there quotas?)</span> <span id="s263">The quota was zero at this institute.</span> <span id="s264">This was in 1974.</span> <span id="s265">My older sister was six years older, so she was just finishing.</span> <span id="s266">She was almost 24 then.</span> <span id="s267">No matter what kind of education was before and how they passed tests--no matter--they couldn't even start it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">(What was the Jewish population in Odessa then?)</span> <span id="s269">It was big.</span> <span id="s270">I can give you a good example.</span> <span id="s271">My class in high school, this special math school, had about 35 kids and 80% were Jewish.</span> <span id="s272">So almost all of them get their education at Odessa University in the math division, just for programmers, not a wide field, just this part was possible.</span> <span id="s273">But I didn't feel math was my field.</span> <span id="s274">I didn't understand a lot of things at eighteen that I understood later.</span> <span id="s275">And my father decided to put me in the institute like refrigeration technology because he knew that it's not the best education but it's a high level of technical education, and I could find a job.</span> <span id="s276">And he paid 1,000 rubles for that to the director, from hand to hand.</span> <span id="s277">And for what?</span> <span id="s278">That's an interesting point-- for what?</span> <span id="s279">Because I had very good grades and a special math school gave me everything for five years of education.</span> <span id="s280">I had the same kinds of subjects I'd already had, so I didn't spend much time in the institute to study.</span> <span id="s281">Just the technical subjects I needed to study.</span> <span id="s282">So for what he gave the money?</span> <span id="s283">But nobody touched me during the test--nobody gave me an F for nothing.</span> <span id="s284">Just let me tell something.</span> <span id="s285">Just the same like everybody.</span> <span id="s286">And I passed all the tests with As.</span> <span id="s287">And they didn't have enough people in this evening division because, of course, not many people wish to work full-time and study at the same time.</span> <span id="s288">It wasn't enough people because in Russia they usually plan the number of people who can be... so if it's more than this number then they have a competition.</span> <span id="s289">But in this division there weren't even enough people to occupy the whole place, so they had some extra places.</span> <span id="s290">But even for this my father needed to pay.</span> <span id="s291">Just don't touch.</span> <span id="s292">I don't know, but I guess I was one of the best students because I helped everybody because I knew almost all of the subjects, drafting-- and a lot of people couldn't draft and didn't have any experience and I worked as a drafter.</span> <span id="s293">I could help everyone pass the tests, do the homework.</span> <span id="s294">It wasn't the best place.</span> <span id="s295">Kids didn't dream of this place.</span> <span id="s296">They just spent the time to get the degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">(What kind of work did you do during the day?)</span> <span id="s298">I was a drafter where about 200 people worked.</span> <span id="s299">It was a special design institute of the food processing industry and the particular job was to build plants for children's food - all kinds of kids' food.</span> <span id="s300">Maybe it's not incomparable with American because as I see it you don't have a special kind of food for first years: canned food for the wintertime, soups, vegetables and fruits, milk with fruits, yogurt, and almost all was from fruits and vegetables and not too much from meat because the problem is the processing of meat.</span> <span id="s301">That depends on the technology.</span> <span id="s302">We froze the meat.</span> <span id="s303">I worked as a drafter for six years on the automated control systems, so that was now close to my field in America because I'm an electrical designer now.</span> <span id="s304">After I finished my institute and finished my engineering degree, I worked as an engineer of refrigeration systems.</span> <span id="s305">And I prepared drawings and estimating.</span> <span id="s306">It's required to see the safety of the milk, fruit, etc. because usually the season is summer and they need to work the whole year, so they're safe for six to eight months until winter comes and they open the refrigerator rooms and took them out and in each room there was a different temperature because of the different kinds of food and each room has a different kind of machine to cool the food.</span> <span id="s307">Sometimes I went to the field to help the people who build the plants, to solve problems and make sketches for them, whatever.</span> <span id="s308">That was my job.</span> <span id="s309">And the last couple of years I had a couple of guys and we worked together and I give them a job and I was a [low-level manager], so I was like a middle-level engineer.</span> <span id="s310">(You were young--a lot of responsibility?)</span> <span id="s311">Yeah, but you know I spent almost fifteen years in Russia working so I had enough experience.</span> <span id="s312">I didn't like to be a manager because I didn't know how to do this.</span> <span id="s313">I couldn't say "that's wrong, you need to fix it; you're lazy and don't like to work."</span> <span id="s314">But sometimes I would ask the people who work with me for help and I need to check because I put my signature on the drawings.</span> <span id="s315">So I checked this.</span> <span id="s316">(Did you like this work or did you miss architecture?)</span> <span id="s317">I still loved this and I was trying to go to the Interior Design Institute in Chicago.</span> <span id="s318">I have translated my diploma, all my grades, and that was almost 55 numbers, and it cost me about $100, but anyway, I was trying to start and they require three years and close to $9,000 and the manager of the student department said that unfortunately she couldn't pass any of my grades because the fields are so different.</span> <span id="s319">And I prepared a few works for them but they weren't familiar with that and I couldn't do exactly what was required, so I just did some drawings in ink and pencil on paper and mylars and I gave them to her and she said "It's okay, but what we need is 180 degrees different."</span> <span id="s320">She showed me the students' work and I discovered that I'd have to start all over again.</span> <span id="s321">And at first I thought it would be possible to finish in two years, to combine the first and second year into one, because she would pass some of my subjects.</span> <span id="s322">But I would have to start from the first year because of the times of classes, so it wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s323">She suggested that I start all over again if I wish, and I decided that the education for my kids to go to two Jewish schools was more important.</span> <span id="s324">Even with scholarship it's $300 each month.</span> <span id="s325">So I decided to give them education first because they are growing up and need it first and after that, we'll see.</span> <span id="s326">I really don't feel I can start all over again now because it's too much.</span> <span id="s327">Last year my income was zero.</span> <span id="s328">I received money from the government because my tax was too lower, and because we had two dependents.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">(What is your work now?)</span> <span id="s330">The name of the company is Sargent and Lundy.</span> <span id="s331">It's a very big company.</span> <span id="s332">They work on power station plants-- nuclear or water, any kind, almost all nuclear.</span> <span id="s333">(In Chicago?)</span> <span id="s334">All over Illinois and in other countries-- China, Indonesia.</span> <span id="s335">But there's a pretty big company-- 3,000 employees.</span> <span id="s336">The building is downtown between Monroe and Adams on Wabash, across from the Palmer House.</span> <span id="s337">(What is your title?)</span> <span id="s338">I'm an electrical designer.</span> <span id="s339">But they have different level of electrical designers.</span> <span id="s340">I got I guess the lowest level.</span> <span id="s341">They have three levels.</span> <span id="s342">They give me some money.</span> <span id="s343">They gave me a raise twice this year, so now I've got good money.</span> <span id="s344">It was good to start with because they're a big company and can't pay big money even to designers because the designer isn't the engineering position.</span> <span id="s345">It's in the middle between drafters and engineers.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">This company prepared all kinds of drawings for power plants.</span> <span id="s347">So they have a customer who asks them to prepare the drawings-- everything-- building materials, etc.</span> <span id="s348">They did everything and they give them to customers.</span> <span id="s349">They have engineering, designing, and the field, so they work together.</span> <span id="s350">(Who are your colleagues?)</span> <span id="s351">I have not much experience in another company since it's my first job, but a middle level of employees of my company are immigrants, almost all of them-- not too much natural Americans, because they prefer a high position like engineering after the MA degree or the Ph.D.</span> <span id="s352">The people who work with me, most are immigrants or were before.</span> <span id="s353">They're from all over the world, but mostly [Eastern] Europe: Polish, Yugoslav, Hungarian, Czech, the Philippines, Indians, and a lot of Russians.</span> <span id="s354">Some of those are engineers, but most are designers at different levels.</span> <span id="s355">But to be an engineer you have to take the TOEFL engineering test.</span> <span id="s356">After that they get their MA in engineering and their own stamp with their name and registration number.</span> <span id="s357">They can put this stamp on their drawings.</span> <span id="s358">They have to be registered in the State of Illinois, or another state, maybe.</span> <span id="s359">They can get this after they pass the American test.</span> <span id="s360">The Russian diploma is not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">(Is this work satisfying?)</span> <span id="s362">I don't know exactly, because I didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s363">I couldn't find a job during the year and in Chicago there aren't too many companies where you can work as a designer in the refrigeration field.</span> <span id="s364">So I just had a few interviews and I couldn't satisfy these employers because I was a woman and that's unusual for engineering, but it's usual in Russia.</span> <span id="s365">Because of this situation in Russia I had just two possibilities-- to go into mathematics and become a programmer, or to go into engineering.</span> <span id="s366">There's no choice.</span> <span id="s367">And here that's unusual, so that's why I had almost fifteen interviews and nobody could give me a "yes."</span> <span id="s368">And maybe sometimes I was over-qualified... They always gave me "no."</span> <span id="s369">That's why I didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s370">And the friend of my friend is an engineer at this company and he recommended me, that's why they didn't pay too much attention.</span> <span id="s371">At the same time they have good experience with Russians because they had a lot of good Russian workers.</span> <span id="s372">So maybe these are the two reasons they gave me a "yes."</span> <span id="s373">(Are there other women?)</span> <span id="s374">Not too many women, but a lot of the women are from Russia or other European countries.</span> <span id="s375">Some are Filipinos but they're like secretaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">(How did you meet Alex?)</span> <span id="s377">We worked at the same company.</span> <span id="s378">I was 21.</span> <span id="s379">I had a boyfriend and was going to marry him.</span> <span id="s380">And I met Alex and in one day I knew everything was broken, and I said "no" to my boyfriend and "yes" to Alex. He was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s381">The boyfriend lives in Chicago now.</span> <span id="s382">He has a little girl, and everything's okay now.</span> <span id="s383">That was interesting.</span> <span id="s384">My daughter always asks me, "Mommy, how do you know what is love?"</span> <span id="s385">And I say, you can't answer, but you can feel.</span> <span id="s386">If it comes, you will recognize it.</span> <span id="s387">So that was love, and it came from God.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">We worked in a not very big company.</span> <span id="s389">It was like 200 people so it was close, like relatives.</span> <span id="s390">And I worked almost five- six years already and everyone knew me.</span> <span id="s391">I was seventeen when I started.</span> <span id="s392">So everyone was my babysitters, so I grew up there.</span> <span id="s393">Alex just started.</span> <span id="s394">He worked in a different division, like a manager and he organized papers outside our company to start to build a plant.</span> <span id="s395">That's the hardest job because a lot of papers are required for all kinds of authorities all over this plant because a lot of the organization, they don't know what they are doing in Russia.</span> <span id="s396">But they spend money and time.</span> <span id="s397">A big permit is needed to do something on land.</span> <span id="s398">So there's water, energy.</span> <span id="s399">So all the government organizations all over Russia.</span> <span id="s400">He was a boxer when he was young, then got an MA degree.</span> <span id="s401">(Unusual to be a Jew and a boxer?)</span> <span id="s402">No, but it helped him get into the institute.</span> <span id="s403">He was a good boxer.</span> <span id="s404">He had other Jewish friends the same.</span> <span id="s405">There was a big team and they went together to the institute and they gave them a "yes" because it was interesting to get the good sportsmen, like the big games between the cities and republics and even countries.</span> <span id="s406">They took part all over the country.</span> <span id="s407">(Sounds like an extrovert?)</span> <span id="s408">He's an unusual guy because he loved music and poetry.</span> <span id="s409">He loved sports and he was absolutely romantic.</span> <span id="s410">He didn't believe anything like everybody else in Russia.</span> <span id="s411">At the beginning of eighteen kids knew everything.</span> <span id="s412">And he went all over the country when he was a sportsman and afterward he had the same kind of job, to travel.</span> <span id="s413">So he could see everything, how the people live, what they believe and he loved to talk to people and discover what kind of life they've got, so he's had a lot of unusual conversations.</span> <span id="s414">He had good friends who can open the world of literature and culture, so he could read the books that were underground, not only books, but to hear the tapes of the poets who were killed, so he grew up in this kind of underground culture.</span> <span id="s415">(Who were these writers?)</span> <span id="s416">Like Solzhenitsyn, Mandel'stam, Galych, painters and writers like these who were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">(There were Yiddish poets who were killed.)</span> <span id="s418">A lot of writers and poets were killed because of the Soviet system... but it doesn't matter if they were Jews or not because the Russian mentality was so strong.</span> <span id="s419">For instance, Mandel'stam was an interesting poet and I love him, but he got an unbelievable mix of the Russian and Jewish mentality.</span> <span id="s420">This was usual.</span> <span id="s421">It was impossible to get just a Jewish mentality in Russia because it's such a strong culture.</span> <span id="s422">So interesting, so wide.</span> <span id="s423">We lived in this.</span> <span id="s424">The best way is to be a Russian and come here because now we're not Jews, we're just Russians because we speak the Russian language, and because to be Jews here, that means to get some part in the religion.</span> <span id="s425">But we didn't have anything like that, most of us.</span> <span id="s426">(But your children have it?)</span> <span id="s427">I wish, because I can compare how to live without any God and what's going on after that, how they took everything out, so we'll see I guess... They made animals from people, because they took out God and didn't put anything in.</span> <span id="s428">The Communist authority can't be in the same place that God occupied.</span> <span id="s429">They were trying to do this but they couldn't do anything, so it was empty space.</span> <span id="s430">An empty space can never be empty so I think that was one of the important reasons why people in Russia were made crazy, were made like animals.</span> <span id="s431">Because they grew up without God.</span> <span id="s432">They grew up without the rules of humanity, the rules of democracy that all over the world people know.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">(With Alex--was it love at first sight?)</span> <span id="s434">He was interested in me first, but he knew I had a boyfriend and was going to get married.</span> <span id="s435">And he was afraid to destroy this because of course he didn't know how strong is it and how serious is it, but he couldn't do anything with his feeling and I met him and the first time he said, "I love you and wish that you will be my wife."</span> <span id="s436">And I said, "I wish so also."</span> <span id="s437">That's all.</span> <span id="s438">It was just one moment like a shock.</span> <span id="s439">I mean, if you put two fingers in a socket you'll get the same; like a fire.</span> <span id="s440">(How long until you married?)</span> <span id="s441">About nine months, but just because of his business trips and because his mother was going to get a new apartment from the government and we were going to move.</span> <span id="s442">This required some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">(What was your wedding like?)</span> <span id="s444">I don't know how to call it because I didn't have such.</span> <span id="s445">We really didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s446">All my friends, a lot of my best friends weren't in Odessa so there was no reason.</span> <span id="s447">I have no close relatives, just my mother and father and a couple of uncles, that's all.</span> <span id="s448">So they just came once to my house, and to the government office to get married.</span> <span id="s449">It was just across from my house, so we just spent thirty minutes there and came back, and the next day we took our tourist bags and went to the Crimea.</span> <span id="s450">We spent two weeks there because we had a close friend there.</span> <span id="s451">We spent time in the mountains because Alex was a mountain man also.</span> <span id="s452">He had the special sport and loved it.</span> <span id="s453">And he spent a few years over there before our marriage and after that until our older daughter was born.</span> <span id="s454">And I said, "You need to decide which is more important because mountains are very dangerous."</span> <span id="s455">This was 1980.</span> <span id="s456">(So you've been married 12 years?)</span> <span id="s457">Since 1978.</span> <span id="s458">Anna was born two years after we got married.</span> <span id="s459">I'd just finished institute and already was pregnant.</span> <span id="s460">Just after my Masters, Anna was born.</span> <span id="s461">That's just two years.</span> <span id="s462">We were trying to get out in 1979.</span> <span id="s463">1978 was the best time to go out, but my grandfather said "never, until I die."</span> <span id="s464">And that was the truth.</span> <span id="s465">Six years later he died.</span> <span id="s466">But unfortunately at that time we couldn't get out because of the government changing their policy.</span> <span id="s467">We waited ten years more, maybe, to get out.</span> <span id="s468">We even didn't start to ask... We had an invitation and everything, but in the meantime the Russian government was trying to close the doors.</span> <span id="s469">They closed OVIR offices, so there was just one office in the whole city, and there are thousands and thousands of people who stayed in the middle of the night there to write the names.</span> <span id="s470">And we got the numbers on the hands and we stayed there for a long time... There wasn't glasnost yet.</span> <span id="s471">(Who wrote the numbers?)</span> <span id="s472">I did, because we got the hundreds-- one, two, three, and the few people who organized the line and thousands in one line, and they couldn't stay the whole day because they work so they got a number and a list of the numbers and the names of the people who stand in this line, and they checked each other because a thousand people were waiting.</span> <span id="s473">Even at that time we understood that it was impossible to get out because of the number of people.</span> <span id="s474">And the last person who left in Odessa in 1979 was my supervisor.</span> <span id="s475">Now he lives in New York.</span> <span id="s476">Alex helped him, because he brought the whole family together, and didn't have any relatives in Odessa and nobody could help them to get out.</span> <span id="s477">They checked all the papers.</span> <span id="s478">Sometimes of course they send you back.</span> <span id="s479">We have a few villages like Chop to get out.</span> <span id="s480">Even now we went through Brest'.</span> <span id="s481">Still the same villages as ten years before, which is the way to get out.</span> <span id="s482">Now when we left, my husband remembered everything because he had helped a few people to get out.</span> <span id="s483">He went with them to care for the papers, the old people because they're nervous.</span> <span id="s484">And I still am in touch with my previous supervisor.</span> <span id="s485">We call each other and on Jewish celebrations I always write a little card to him.</span> <span id="s486">He always calls me on my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">(Where did you live?)</span> <span id="s488">In those ten years after 2 and a half years we got our own apartment.</span> <span id="s489">At first I lived with my mother-in-law in a new apartment in a new district.</span> <span id="s490">She waited on this apartment almost thirty years.</span> <span id="s491">Fortunately she had a son.</span> <span id="s492">That's why she got a two-room apartment.</span> <span id="s493">If she had a daughter she just got one.</span> <span id="s494">So we got two rooms, one we occupied and the other she occupied.</span> <span id="s495">She worked and when Anna was born I moved to my mother's apartment because of the little baby.</span> <span id="s496">It was in downtown Odessa.</span> <span id="s497">My mother had three big, separate rooms.</span> <span id="s498">It was bigger and pretty close to my job, I can walk even, and Anna was one year old.</span> <span id="s499">My education was over and I needed to work, and I could walk.</span> <span id="s500">It was so helpful.</span> <span id="s501">(Who took care of her?)</span> <span id="s502">I had a part-time job, in the afternoon I worked from one to five.</span> <span id="s503">And the first part of days I took care of her, and at lunchtime and after, my father came.</span> <span id="s504">And the sister of my grandmother was so kind.</span> <span id="s505">She was the favorite of my relatives.</span> <span id="s506">And everything that I can make by hand and my heritage comes from her.</span> <span id="s507">She was babysitter for everyone in her family, nine kids, usual in Jewish families.</span> <span id="s508">She was the oldest.</span> <span id="s509">She didn't have a family, but she got the family of her sisters all over again... She had a very hard life like a lot of old people in Russia and she didn't work, just housework and take care of kids, and she was so nice.</span> <span id="s510">She died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s511">Anna was three.</span> <span id="s512">I was pregnant with Sam.</span> <span id="s513">She came to help me with the baby.</span> <span id="s514">She was almost eighty years old.</span> <span id="s515">She helped my sister...</span></p> <p><span id="s516">(Why did you and Alex decide to leave?)</span> <span id="s517">Maybe I don't remember exactly the particular reason.</span> <span id="s518">I mean, something happened and we decided.</span> <span id="s519">Because it was impossible.</span> <span id="s520">First of all, the whole life.</span> <span id="s521">I didn't have too much pressure in school, but by the way, my husband couldn't finish his high school, just the evening high school at the same time he worked, and after that he started the institute in the evening division for years.</span> <span id="s522">And after that he couldn't find a job because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s523">He did the Masters degree and everybody required those kind of people, and he couldn't find any kind of job because he was Jewish and didn't have any protection.</span> <span id="s524">He just saw the ad and came and showed his passport and they say, okay, we don't need someone anymore.</span> <span id="s525">So that was absolutely clear.</span> <span id="s526">(So the anti-semitism was the reason?)</span> <span id="s527">It was like a soap bubble.</span> <span id="s528">We were inside.</span> <span id="s529">I can't say if it was anti-semitism or not.</span> <span id="s530">It was our life.</span> <span id="s531">We knew about it from birth.</span> <span id="s532">Nobody was surprised that it happened just to him and they heard that was usual case.</span> <span id="s533">No, everybody knew that was our life.</span> <span id="s534">Yes, that was the foundation of our reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">But the push to make this decision was that my husband read too much literature and the poetry and the heretic tapes of the people who already left, and who write the best writing published about Soviet life, like Solzhenitsyn, like the Gulag Archipelago.</span> <span id="s536">Maybe it was a basic reason.</span> <span id="s537">I can't decide now what was a basic reason.</span> <span id="s538">All his friends already left.</span> <span id="s539">He was older than me, six years older.</span> <span id="s540">So his friends already discovered everything and left.</span> <span id="s541">And he was latest because he just got married and nobody knew how long it would be, if emigration will be closed or open ten years later or was going off tomorrow.</span> <span id="s542">So we couldn't plan anything.</span> <span id="s543">We just decided and were trying to do something and unfortunately we couldn't.</span> <span id="s544">But all the people who decided a couple of months before [had] already left.</span> <span id="s545">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s546">They played a political game.</span> <span id="s547">Jews were like wheat/meat.</span> <span id="s548">They sold the Jews and bought the wheat/meat.</span> <span id="s549">Like money.</span> <span id="s550">The same kind of game that Gorbachev is playing because it's nothing different.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">(How did you know you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s552">I remember.</span> <span id="s553">My parents didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s554">Maybe they did but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s555">I remember an interesting case.</span> <span id="s556">I was five years old.</span> <span id="s557">My parents just moved to a new apartment where we lived for twenty years.</span> <span id="s558">I played with my friend.</span> <span id="s559">She's still my friend, she's in Leningrad now.</span> <span id="s560">We played outside in the yard in front of the house.</span> <span id="s561">Another girl came.</span> <span id="s562">I remember her particular words.</span> <span id="s563">She asked my friend Tanya, she's a natural Russian-- she's not Jewish-- she asked her: "Why are you playing with this girl?</span> <span id="s564">She's a Jew!</span> <span id="s565">Why?"</span> <span id="s566">And my friend said, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s567">insulted, because she didn't understand her, and I didn't know why I paid attention because I didn't know what it meant either-- I was five years old--younger than my son now.</span> <span id="s568">But I remember that I paid attention to that.</span> <span id="s569">What's wrong, why nobody could play with me, why does she ask my friend?</span> <span id="s570">She was angry, upset.</span></p></body></html>
