id="s12">February 15, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Could you please tell me your name?</span> <span id="s14">A: My name is Bella Tovey.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Uh...Jacobowitz in English and Jakubowicz in Polish.</span> <span id="s17">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born on September 18 in 1926.</span> <span id="s19">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: In Sosnowiec [Ger: Sosnowitz].</span> <span id="s21">Q: Where's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: It's a city, or I would call it a city.</span> <span id="s23">A small city...uh...west, [in the] south of Poland, near the German border in Silesia.</span> <span id="s24">Uh...very close to the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Uh...Could you tell me a little bit about your childhood, your family when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I am...I was the oldest of four.</span> <span id="s27">Uh...I had two sisters, and a little brother who was born in 1933, so he was 6 years old when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s28">My...We lived on Warszawska...Warsaw Street, No. 10, lived in an apartment house.</span> <span id="s29">Most people in Poland in...lived in apartment houses if they lived in the city.</span> <span id="s30">Uh...We didn't have private homes in cities.</span> <span id="s31">Mostly, they were apartment houses.</span> <span id="s32">We had a..</span> <span id="s33">.</span> <span id="s34">uh... nice apartment.</span> <span id="s35">My father owned a factory...uh... where he would...it was a..</span> <span id="s36">uh...knitting factory, but only children's wear, infant' wear.</span> <span id="s37">I remember...I remember loving to go to the factory because it was always white, pink and blue, and light yellow.</span> <span id="s38">Pretty pastels.</span> <span id="s39">Uh...We were not rich, but we were quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s40">Most of the time, we had a maid and a cook.</span> <span id="s41">When times were really rougher in the business apparently we would only have a maid.</span> <span id="s42">Uh...Then my mother had to do the cooking, and...uh... she didn't like to do that so...uh...as soon as she could, she would get herself a cook again.</span> <span id="s43">Uh...My mother...that's not fair.</span> <span id="s44">It's not that my mother didn't like to do it, she had what she called some asthma.</span> <span id="s45">And she maintained that the asthma was...that she wasn't well when she was near the stove, that it made her cough and just not be comfort...not feel good.</span> <span id="s46">I think now, in retrospect, that my mother was highly allergic to certain fabrics...uh... wool.</span> <span id="s47">I think the factory was bad for her, and she used to go and, you know, kind of help my father a little bit.</span> <span id="s48">But even if she...and we had rugs at home.</span> <span id="s49">We had Persian rugs in the living room, and she had a Persian runner in her bedroom.</span> <span id="s50">She slept on feather pillows, and I think she had allergies to all of this because during the war when all of that disappeared my mother was much healthier.</span> <span id="s51">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Were you...uh...was your family very involved in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Uh...I..</span> <span id="s54">.</span> <span id="s55">it's hard to say.</span> <span id="s56">My father was a very traditional Jew.</span> <span id="s57">We had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s58">It was a religious home, but not...not hasidic, not...not ultra-religious.</span> <span id="s59">I think this was my mother's influence.</span> <span id="s60">My father...uh...my father was always much more religious, much more of a believing person.</span> <span id="s61">My mother was more...uh...the word in Poland would have been used modern.</span> <span id="s62">She...she was...uh...she was more maybe of a skeptic too.</span> <span id="s63">She kept a kosher home for my father and I, and she was observant.</span> <span id="s64">I..</span> <span id="s65">.</span> <span id="s66">I am sure she didn't ride on Sabbath, but she didn't...but I would catch her fixing her stocking, you know, my father didn't...wasn't around looking or something.</span> <span id="s67">In other words she was...she was much...uh....</span> <span id="s68">So in that sense...uh...was my father involved?</span> <span id="s69">I suppose so.</span> <span id="s70">I..</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">I don't know.</span> <span id="s73">I was 13 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s74">I know he used to belong to a..</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">to a little schul.</span> <span id="s77">I know he used to go.</span> <span id="s78">I am calling it a schul because it was not a temple.</span> <span id="s79">It was a little synagogue.</span> <span id="s80">My mother only went to synagogue during high holidays.</span> <span id="s81">But my father used to go every Friday.</span> <span id="s82">And I do remember.</span> <span id="s83">This is what I..</span> <span id="s84">.</span> <span id="s85">I..</span> <span id="s86">.</span> <span id="s87">, I loved my father very much.</span> <span id="s88">I..</span> <span id="s89">.</span> <span id="s90">I know he was a very good person.</span> <span id="s91">I remember that even though he was an observant Jew, he used to take money with him on Friday evening and put it....</span> <span id="s92">Somebody told me about it.</span> <span id="s93">I didn't...maybe my mom, later on....</span> <span id="s94">He used to look at the hangers, at the coats hanging; and if he found a coat that looked very ragged, somebody passing through the city, somebody poor, he used to put the money into this pocket.</span> <span id="s95">This was giving in secret, kind of.</span> <span id="s96">My father didn't know who he gave it to, and the man didn't know who he got it from.</span> <span id="s97">And my father also used to bring often what you call an ["oreach" (ph)], a guest for Friday evening, to dinner, somebody poor.</span> <span id="s98">Uh...That's the extent that I know that my father was involved.</span> <span id="s99">How he was...whether he was involved in the Jewish community or I don't really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about your daily life with your, as a child, with your siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, I was...uh...as I say, I was 13 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s102">The last year of my life I went to gymnasium, which is a high school, name for a high school.</span> <span id="s103">I had finished six grade.</span> <span id="s104">I went to public school until I was 12, and that last year I commuted.</span> <span id="s105">I went to B_dzin which is a city next to ours to a..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">a..</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">Jewish Polish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s110">I say Jewish because... uh ...the curriculum in the school was dictated by the Department of Education in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s111">I am sure was a accredited, very fine gymnasium.</span> <span id="s112">Uh...But the student population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s113">Not all the teachers were Jewish, not all the professors as we called them.</span> <span id="s114">And, of course, the important thing is that one of the languages taught in this school was Hebrew as a language.</span> <span id="s115">And then history, Jewish history, and bible.</span> <span id="s116">Uh...This was my first exposure to Hebrew, as a language.</span> <span id="s117">I had one year of Hebrew before the war.</span> <span id="s118">The reason I went to B_dzin is because...we had a gymnasium in Sosnowiec, the same type of a gymnasium; but my father came from B_dzin and my father thought that the school in B_dzin was better.</span> <span id="s119">And I think he was right.</span> <span id="s120">It was a..</span> <span id="s121">.</span> <span id="s122">a better school, and he wanted me to go to a good school.</span> <span id="s123">I was not happy about it.</span> <span id="s124">Many of my friends were going to a school in my city, and I didn't like going there.</span> <span id="s125">I used to get up in the morning and take a train.</span> <span id="s126">The train station was very near my house, because we lived one block away from the street on which there was a train station.</span> <span id="s127">I used to run for the train, take my train, go to school, come home usually after 2:00.</span> <span id="s128">We had dinner.</span> <span id="s129">I usually...I remember that dinner was about 2:30 and this is one thing I had to be very prompt for.</span> <span id="s130">My father didn't... didn't like anybody being late for dinner.</span> <span id="s131">This was for our meal that we spent together as a family everyday.</span> <span id="s132">After dinner, my father used to go back to his business.</span> <span id="s133">Uh...I usually did my homework, played with some friends, fought with my siblings.</span> <span id="s134">(Laughter) It was a very normal, usual childhood.</span> <span id="s135">I had a very happy home.</span> <span id="s136">I came from a very...I was...I was a very happy child...uh...until the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You'll have to move your hand over between the mike.</span> <span id="s138">Thank you.</span> <span id="s139">Uh...Can you tell me...uh...what recollections you have of the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Oh, I have very clear recollections because...uh...the war broke out on September 1st.</span> <span id="s141">School was supposed to start on September 1st.</span> <span id="s142">And I was supposed to go to school.</span> <span id="s143">Remember I told you I didn't like this school.</span> <span id="s144">I was very glad that the war broke out because I didn't have to go back to school.</span> <span id="s145">This is how stupid I was.</span> <span id="s146">I was just...it's amazing when I think about it.</span> <span id="s147">At 13, I think I should have been a little more...understanding, but I..</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">I suppose I was scared.</span> <span id="s150">It's not fair to say.</span> <span id="s151">But there was also that feeling of relief that I don't have to go back to school.</span> <span id="s152">And there was also a kind of change in our life.</span> <span id="s153">For instance, we had come back from the country.</span> <span id="s154">We used to go...every summer we used to go to the country.</span> <span id="s155">And we came back around August 25th, which is very late.</span> <span id="s156">War was in the air.</span> <span id="s157">I mean we...we were in the country, so we didn't hear that much.</span> <span id="s158">But in the city things were going on.</span> <span id="s159">People were being drafted.</span> <span id="s160">Things were really going on.</span> <span id="s161">I know when we came back, my mom was trying to buy some food, just make sure that there's some food in the house because she had survived the first World War and she knew that times are going to be rough in the beginning.</span> <span id="s162">And she couldn't get any...any...any food that really was...any staple food.</span> <span id="s163">She couldn't get flour.</span> <span id="s164">She couldn't get potatoes.</span> <span id="s165">She couldn't get the kind of things that you need, starch, you know, to... and we were not home so there was no...there was no food.</span> <span id="s166">But what she was able to...to get were all kinds of delicacies, because these were still available.</span> <span id="s167">So there were all kinds of canned foods and lots of chocolates and halva and...and all kinds of fancy cookies...uh...uh...dried fruit.</span> <span id="s168">She bought what she could.</span> <span id="s169">Well that was..., you know, for a kid that was also a little exciting.</span> <span id="s170">Uh...What was really strange is, it didn't take long for us to really get hungry for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s171">That was really something.</span> <span id="s172">It was... there was no bread.</span> <span id="s173">There was no...there was no meat... no...uh...there was no food, really.</span> <span id="s174">There was fun food, but you, you know, and, of course, my mom wasn't that...you know, she was holding on to it, too.</span> <span id="s175">She didn't know.</span> <span id="s176">I remember my brother being very...very unhappy when we finally were able to get some bread when the lines, when we stood in lines to get the bread after the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s177">How my brother was asking my mother for another slice of bread and my mom said, "No, just one slice of...slice of bread."</span> <span id="s178">It was...I remember it was so...it wasn't hunger yet.</span> <span id="s179">We weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s180">It was just the idea that things were missing.</span> <span id="s181">I do remember that the Germans walked into the city, marched into the city, on September 3rd, because you see we were so close to the border.</span> <span id="s182">And I remember (cough) that we were in the house, everybody.</span> <span id="s183">Everybody was...nobody was going out onto the street.</span> <span id="s184">People were afraid.</span> <span id="s185">We heard the tanks rolling into the city.</span> <span id="s186">There was tremendous noise, shouting.</span> <span id="s187">There were some shots.</span> <span id="s188">People may have been caught in the street.</span> <span id="s189">I didn't see any of it, but I heard it.</span> <span id="s190">I was afraid to go to the window even though some of our windows were going out into the street.</span> <span id="s191">And...uh...(Coughing) (drinking water) and I, as I said, I..</span> <span id="s192">.</span> <span id="s193">I just remember that we were in the house in the beginning because apparently it was either we were not allowed to go into the street or we were afraid.</span> <span id="s194">And then I suppose we started going out into the street.</span> <span id="s195">I do remember two things.</span> <span id="s196">I remember apparently being told by my parents to go out early in the morning and try to get some bread in a bakery.</span> <span id="s197">And I don't know...I don't remember whether I went with my mother.</span> <span id="s198">I think I may have gone with my mother.</span> <span id="s199">I know my mother didn't want my father out of the house, and we went and I remember we stood in line for a long time, and we did get a bread and came home.</span> <span id="s200">That was the first memory of...of something that was scary because it was dark outside and the lines were long and the Germans were standing in a kind of making sure that nobody was getting into the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">And...uh...everybody was allowed to buy one bread.</span> <span id="s202">(Cough) About 10 days or 2 weeks after we were...after the Germans came into the city...uh...they came into our house...into our apartment house.</span> <span id="s203">By the way, in our apartment house...uh...I don't know how many tenants lived there, but not all of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s204">They came into the court yard and they started to shout, "Alle Juden, Raus!"</span> <span id="s205">, which means "All Jews Out!"</span> <span id="s206">They were telling us to come down to the court yard.</span> <span id="s207">And I remember my father and my mother, the four of us went down stairs.</span> <span id="s208">I think our cook was still with us.</span> <span id="s209">She was Jewish.</span> <span id="s210">She may have come down.</span> <span id="s211">She left shortly after that.</span> <span id="s212">She went back to her town...to her home town.</span> <span id="s213">And they took my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">They took all the men, and we went back to our apartment.</span> <span id="s215">And I don't...I don't remember how long my father was gone.</span> <span id="s216">I am sure it wasn't very long.</span> <span id="s217">Maybe a week.</span> <span id="s218">What I do remember is that my father had auburn hair.</span> <span id="s219">You have auburn hair, don't you?</span> <span id="s220">My father had auburn hair.</span> <span id="s221">When he came back, he was practically grey.</span> <span id="s222">I..</span> <span id="s223">.</span> <span id="s224">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s225">He was born in 1900, so he was 39 years old.</span> <span id="s226">He was grey.</span> <span id="s227">And...uh...I also remember that not all men came back, because we heard about it.</span> <span id="s228">Apparently, they...they killed some, just at random.</span> <span id="s229">But it was also at that time that they chose, that they asked the people who...who was a member of a committee of the Jewish...uh...Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s230">If...if...every city had a Rabbi, had a Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s231">And I do remember that...uh...no, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s232">I..</span> <span id="s233">.</span> <span id="s234">I was told that the man who was chosen to be the head of our ghetto was a man by the name of [Moinyek Meren (ph)].</span> <span id="s235">[Moinyek (ph)] is a probably somewhat Polish name for Moshe.</span> <span id="s236">His name was Meren.</span> <span id="s237">He was a..</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">he was probably also in his late 30s, maybe my father's age, and he had...he had worked for us at one time before the war as a..</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">uh...I don't want to call it traveling salesman.</span> <span id="s242">He was a salesman, and he was...he had a certain area where he would...uh...go in and had customers he sold, you know, the products of my father's.</span> <span id="s243">You know, my father produced that was, you know, made in our factory.</span> <span id="s244">And he became the head of the committee of the Jewish ghetto, and probably other people.</span> <span id="s245">Uh...My father, as I said, came home; and shortly after that something else happened.</span> <span id="s246">Two things happened.</span> <span id="s247">First our factory was taken over by what the Germans called a "Treuhändler."</span> <span id="s248">"Treuhändler" means somebody that the Germans could trust.</span> <span id="s249">It was a German who took over the factory, but my father was working there.</span> <span id="s250">He was in effect probably teaching the Treuhändler and, you know, how to run the factory.</span> <span id="s251">[NB: German "Treuhändler" = trustee or custodian] And he...uh....because of that, he was allowed some...he was probably getting some money for his work, and he was given ration cards, and so was his family.</span> <span id="s252">Everybody had to work.</span> <span id="s253">The fact that my father worked was very important because then we were allowed to get...uh...cards so that we could...we were able to buy food.</span> <span id="s254">It was all rationed, but we had the coupons to buy whatever was allowed for us to buy.</span> <span id="s255">Now let me tell you a little bit about our ghetto, because it was a little different then for instance, the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">Until the end of 1942, the ghetto in Sosnowiec was what you called an open ghetto, which means that we were not...we were not walled in.</span> <span id="s257">And many of us stayed in our apartments.</span> <span id="s258">For instance, we stayed in our apartment in 1940...at the end of 1942, except that they had...we didn't have the apartment all to ourselves.</span> <span id="s259">We had to share it with other refugees, with other Jews who were....</span> <span id="s260">We've had for instance a family living with us that came in from Germany, from Leipzig.</span> <span id="s261">They were German Jews.</span> <span id="s262">Uh...Some Jews had to leave.</span> <span id="s263">It depended on...some streets became what you called "Judenrein," "Free of Jews."</span> <span id="s264">Those... uh ...the people who lived on the streets that became Judenrein, that the Jews were not allowed, they had to be moved into the streets where the Jews were allowed.</span> <span id="s265">My street was still one of the streets that was part of the open ghetto.</span> <span id="s266">And we lived in that street, on that street, as I say, until the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s267">And interestingly enough in our apartment house, there were still the Polish tenants were still living there.</span> <span id="s268">So while we were not allowed into some streets, and some of...and the Poles were allowed into some streets, the Poles could come into the places where the Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Because of that and, as I said, because it was that kind of an open ghetto, there was a possibility for some barter, for some dealings with the Poles; and maybe even with some Germans, although I don't know, or "Volksdeutsch," half-German.</span> <span id="s270">And because of that situation in our ghetto in terms of hunger, until about 42 was not that bad.</span> <span id="s271">It was...it depended...I shouldn't say that...it depended really on what your situation was because the rationing...uh...the food that you were allowed, legally, was really not much.</span> <span id="s272">But if you had some other means, you could if you had some hidden jewelry, you could get something on the black market if you will.</span> <span id="s273">So you could supplement your rationing.</span> <span id="s274">And in that sense some people in the ghetto fared better than others.</span> <span id="s275">People who were poor to start with, did worse.</span> <span id="s276">People who had something, did better.</span> <span id="s277">Now that doesn't mean that people were able to keep everything they had.</span> <span id="s278">This brings me to the other story....uh...because also shortly, that was all in the fall of 1939, there was a knock on our door.</span> <span id="s279">And there was a German woman and two SS men were with her and she...they came into our apartment, and she walked through the apartment and she turned to the SS men and she said, "Ich habe gernes.</span> <span id="s280">Alles."</span> <span id="s281">-- "I like it.</span> <span id="s282">All of it."</span> <span id="s283">And they send in some people a day later...uh...probably they brought in a truck and they unloaded, they took everything out of...out of our house.</span> <span id="s284">I'm talking about our furniture.</span> <span id="s285">All our furniture, rugs, whatever...whatever she wanted.</span> <span id="s286">She was a nice...nice lady.</span> <span id="s287">She sent us an old table, some chairs, some old beds.</span> <span id="s288">Uh...wardrobe, probably what she had.</span> <span id="s289">She must not have been a very well-to-do woman, but you see she became rich because she was German.</span> <span id="s290">So we didn't have any furniture left then and, of course, the German I am sure you know that...that there were from the beginning, they were collecting everything.</span> <span id="s291">First you had to give...give away all your gold.</span> <span id="s292">Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents, I am sure, had to give away, but I am also sure that my mom, or my parents may have hidden some things, because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food in the house.</span> <span id="s293">Uh...Then it got much worse, and about a year...1939...19...in 1940, things were semi-normal.</span> <span id="s294">I shouldn't call it normal, but life just went on.</span> <span id="s295">My father was working.</span> <span id="s296">Then my mother had to go to work.</span> <span id="s297">But I and my sister and even my younger sister were privately tutored.</span> <span id="s298">That was not allowed.</span> <span id="s299">Schools, of course, were closed.</span> <span id="s300">There wasn't....there were no schools for us.</span> <span id="s301">But my parents...my parents, you see, were hoping that the war is going to end.</span> <span id="s302">They didn't...they didn't envisage anything like that, and they felt that we needed to continue with our education so...uh...as little as they had, they paid.</span> <span id="s303">We had...there were some teachers, professors who used to teach in schools and...uh...when I say I was privately tutored, I don't mean that I was tutored on a one-to-one basis, but what we had is we would go to our...to a teacher's home during the day and there were, let's say, 12 of us, and we would learn.</span> <span id="s304">We would study Polish literature, history, geography...uh...some sciences, but that was difficult because we had no lab.</span> <span id="s305">Mathematics.</span> <span id="s306">I remember working very hard.</span> <span id="s307">This was, see, now I was very serious.</span> <span id="s308">This was important.</span> <span id="s309">I..</span> <span id="s310">.</span> <span id="s311">I..</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">I think I was in school til the beginning...(sigh) 'til the beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s314">When I say in school I was...I was getting...taking lessons, even though somewhere around '41, I think in the summer of 1941, I started working somewhere in a..</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">in one of those ghetto resorts.</span> <span id="s317">In other words, ghetto factories.</span> <span id="s318">But probably not full-time because I still had some time for lessons, and then I no longer could do it.</span> <span id="s319">I had to work full-time and I had to give up, but I know that I studied a lot, and I even took some...a lot of Hebrew during the war.</span> <span id="s320">Because it was important.</span> <span id="s321">I also tutored my younger, my kid brother who was only six when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s322">I taught him how to read and write.</span> <span id="s323">I taught him a lot of mathematics, and he was a whiz anyway.</span> <span id="s324">He was very good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s325">So I..</span> <span id="s326">.</span> <span id="s327">uh...so in that sense there were some, there was a certain amount of normalcy in our life because my parents, as I say, believed in the beginning that things are going to be okay.</span> <span id="s328">And...uh...I don't think they realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s329">In the beginning, my father, I remember, used to listen to a BBC radio.</span> <span id="s330">One of the neighbors had a hidden radio, and he would come back and tell us that France fell; and then I think that it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s331">Of course, we also had a curfew and we were not allowed into the streets, I think after 7 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s332">And that, by the way, was good in one way for me as a child.</span> <span id="s333">I read constantly.</span> <span id="s334">There were still libraries that you can borrow books from.</span> <span id="s335">Private libraries, and I used to read.</span> <span id="s336">I think that I..</span> <span id="s337">.</span> <span id="s338">I got a..</span> <span id="s339">.</span> <span id="s340">I got my really basic education during this because I was reading constantly.</span> <span id="s341">I..</span> <span id="s342">.</span> <span id="s343">I suppose my parents encouraged it, but I really was always a bit of a bookworm and I..</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">So this was, as I said, things started and...and nobody...nobody realized what...what was going to happen because, again, I am painting a..</span> <span id="s346">.</span> <span id="s347">I am giving you a kind of picture of...now, of course, with it...uh... things started to happen in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s348">People started to disappear.</span> <span id="s349">Mostly, at that point, young people were taken to...uh...work camps, labor camps in Germany and...uh... and people would just disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">They would be walking in the streets and they would be taken to work.</span> <span id="s351">People were also taken constantly to work in the streets.</span> <span id="s352">I remember coming back from somewhere and being...I was still young, so it didn't happen to me often, but it happened to my father a lot that they would take people who had to shovel show, clear the streets.</span> <span id="s353">They were always looking for something.</span> <span id="s354">You know, in addition to the fact that people had to work, they were always catching people, if you will, for some additional work, but in the ghetto, as I say there was a militia and we were again, ...how shall I say?</span> <span id="s355">The governing of the ghetto was done by the....by the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s356">Now when my....</span> <span id="s357">Okay.</span> <span id="s358">In 1942...Let me...I can't...I..</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">you don't want to take that long so...</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s363">In...two things happened in 19...things started... things started to turn towards the end of 1941.</span> <span id="s364">The winter of 1941 was really a hard winter.</span> <span id="s365">The winter before was hard, too; but this winter started it was a very cold winter.</span> <span id="s366">It was difficult to get heating.</span> <span id="s367">Food was getting scarce.</span> <span id="s368">Things were getting rough.</span> <span id="s369">By...by the end of 1941, many people had been taken out of the ghetto, but again if they were taken to Auschwitz, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s370">Most of them were young men and women taken to labor camps.</span> <span id="s371">And in 1942, sometimes around March, they came and took some...the militia people, not even Germans, came to our house and, with a list, and I was on that list, and they took me...uh...out of the house to take me to a labor camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s372">Now in order to get to the camp...uh...they didn't...we were not taken directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">We were taken to what was once a..</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">the Jewish gymnasium in Sosnowiec, which now served as a "Durchgangslager."</span> <span id="s376">"Durchgangslager" means a transition [transit] camp.</span> <span id="s377">We were put in there until, I suppose, the factory owners or people from Germany would come and select people for different ... uh ... activities or different work.</span> <span id="s378">And there was a camp for women, a transit camp for women, and for men, and that night they must have taken a lot of men and a lot of women.</span> <span id="s379">And...young, young....</span> <span id="s380">I was not quite sixteen.</span> <span id="s381">I was..., this was the beginning of 1942.</span> <span id="s382">I was born in 1926, so I was 15 and a half, and my...uh...my parents were apparently devastated.</span> <span id="s383">They shouldn't have been.</span> <span id="s384">If they had known about Auschwitz, they should have been glad that I'm not being...that I'm going to Germany, to work, but they didn't know about Auschwitz and they wanted to get me out.</span> <span id="s385">I was my father's favorite daughter.</span> <span id="s386">I don't think people should have favorites, but I think my...I was my...I was a favorite of my father.</span> <span id="s387">And he was...he was heartbroken.</span> <span id="s388">And he wanted to get me out.</span> <span id="s389">And at that time, there were still people who were able to do it.</span> <span id="s390">Now the way you did it is you paid money to a family that was poorer than you were, if you could afford it; and somebody--but this was a voluntary arrangement--and that somebody would go for you.</span> <span id="s391">And my father apparently found a family where they were terribly poor.</span> <span id="s392">There was...in other words, if we were hungry, they were hungrier, and my father apparently gave them whatever, promised to give them whatever he...I don't know, maybe he had a ring left... whatever he had...and their daughter...and I think my father....</span> <span id="s393">That was another thing.</span> <span id="s394">Their daughter was about 18 years old.</span> <span id="s395">She was a little older.</span> <span id="s396">I think what bothered my father..., I think he was very troubled, was that I was really basically still a kid.</span> <span id="s397">I was only 15 and a half.</span> <span id="s398">Now I wasn't the only one at 15 and a half taken; but for my father, this was...so they made arrangements.</span> <span id="s399">And she was supposed to come in in the morning to this transit camp, and say that she is my substitute, if you will.</span> <span id="s400">Now I didn't know anything about it except, because we were...there were...nobody was allowed to come and see us, except that I would come to the window and my father would pass by and he kind of motioned to me that...that they're trying to get me out.</span> <span id="s401">And that morning my name was called, and I..</span> <span id="s402">.</span> <span id="s403">and I was told to take my...whatever stuff I had because when they took me to this transit camp, they permitted my parents to bring some clothing for me.</span> <span id="s404">So I had some clothing with me.</span> <span id="s405">I took my bundle, whatever I had and I walked out.</span> <span id="s406">I was walking out.</span> <span id="s407">And as I was walking out, I noticed that my sister--who was born 2 and 1/2 ...who was 13--was walking in.</span> <span id="s408">And I..</span> <span id="s409">.</span> <span id="s410">I was...I was...I was...first of all, I had been in that transit camp for...for a good week.</span> <span id="s411">I was tired and hungry and dirty and sleepy and...because it was not a very pleasant place.</span> <span id="s412">So I was very...I was...I was not quite there; but I did see my sister, and when I ran out and I..</span> <span id="s413">.</span> <span id="s414">my father wasn't...people ...people are not allowed near, but when I crossed the street and I saw my father and my mother, I started to cry and I said, "What happened?</span> <span id="s415">Why is Pnina...why is my sister...why did she go in there?</span> <span id="s416">What happened?"</span> <span id="s417">And they started to cry, and they told me that that morning when this woman who is supposed to go for me was supposed to come in and they were supposed to take her, she had changed her mind and they were desperate.</span> <span id="s418">They...they had made all the arrangements, but they didn't have the substitute; whereupon my younger sister, who was a real tomboy, always was, said, "I am going to go for Bella."</span> <span id="s419">And my father...my parents thought she's crazy.</span> <span id="s420">First, of all what kind of an exchange was that?</span> <span id="s421">I mean...and she said, "Don't you understand?</span> <span id="s422">I am 13 years old.</span> <span id="s423">They are not going to keep me.</span> <span id="s424">They are going to send me right back."</span> <span id="s425">She was going to fool them.</span> <span id="s426">I don't know how my parents could ... I think that they were...I don't think that...I don't think that they were thinking clearly because it was...it was a crazy plan.</span> <span id="s427">But they allowed her to do it.</span> <span id="s428">And she was also very, my sister's a very strong person.</span> <span id="s429">She must have been very persuasive, and my parents were very depressed.</span> <span id="s430">They must have been in a very bad state, and she was very upbeat about it.</span> <span id="s431">I suppose, I..</span> <span id="s432">.</span> <span id="s433">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s434">But I know that my sister went in there, and my parents expected her to be sent out a day later and she was sent to a concentration camp in Sudetenland, which is in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s435">And...uh... I don't have to tell you how we all felt, ...how I felt.</span> <span id="s436">She went for me.</span> <span id="s437">And...uh...at that time, she was allowed to write.</span> <span id="s438">Once a month we would get a postcard from her, and she wrote cheerful notes; that she's okay, that she's the youngest in the camp, everybody's taking care of her.</span> <span id="s439">And lo and behold, three months after she was taken to this Sudetenland we got...we received a letter from the Jewish Community that she is coming home, and two days later...really three months after she had left...she went...she left home, she came in from German ... from Sudetenland to the ghetto on a train with her belongings.</span> <span id="s440">One of those unusual things, but this is very German.</span> <span id="s441">Apparently...now then she told us what happened.</span> <span id="s442">When she got to this camp she told the Commandoführer, the Lager...the German, that she was taken by mistake, that she's 13 years old, that she's a child, that she's not...and she wants to go back home.</span> <span id="s443">And...uh...it took three months, but they arranged to send her back home.</span> <span id="s444">Now one of the...as I say, Auschwitz was operating.</span> <span id="s445">They could have very...they could have sent her...they should have sent her to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Anybody getting sick in a concentration camp, anybody claiming not being able to work was always sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s447">I don't know why they didn't send her to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s448">I think it's...it was this German bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s449">Once she convinced the Commandoführer there that she didn't belong here and that there was a ghetto and her parents were in the ghetto, she was sent back to her parents.</span> <span id="s450">And...uh...she became somewhat of a celebrity, I think, in the ghetto because first of all, the fact that she managed...first of all that she went for me.</span> <span id="s451">Secondly, that she managed to come back.</span> <span id="s452">Very few people... no, I don't remember anybody coming back from a concentration camp back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">Maybe there was some case, but she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">And...uh...she was such a celebrity that...(sigh)... celebrity...that in this same year--1942, August, a very memorable time for...for me, for us--we were...orders were posted all...all over the ghetto that all the Jewish inhabitants of the ghetto have to come to the stadium.</span> <span id="s455">We had a sports stadium on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s456">And we were all told to dress nicely and to come to this stadium.</span> <span id="s457">I remember there was a discussion in the house whether we should go...uh...the warnings were that anybody that the...the German soldiers are going to go through apartment houses...anybody hid...find...found hiding will be shot immediately, and I need to tell you that we had witnessed atrocities in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s458">It isn't that the ghetto is without any incidences.</span> <span id="s459">If they caught somebody doing something that the Germans didn't think was legal, they would hang them in public and people would have to come and watch.</span> <span id="s460">In fact, our neighbor...we had a neighbor who owned a little store, and he was caught for something and he and his two sons were hung [hanged] and I remember that we were all forced to go and watch it.</span> <span id="s461">So the warning to come...that was...I don't know whether there are people who didn't come to the stadium, but I know that the six of us went to the stadium.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">And...uh...it was a very warm day.</span> <span id="s463">It was August.</span> <span id="s464">Poland is not...doesn't have a very hot climate, but it was one of those real hot days; and we were standing for hours.</span> <span id="s465">We were supposed to be there at 8 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s466">In fact...in fact, I remember something else which was terrible.</span> <span id="s467">We were walking...they were walking us, not on the sidewalks, but in the middle of the street, and the Poles...Polish people, non-Jews, were standing on both sides of the sidewalk; and again, unlike some of my friends today, I don't hate all Poles.</span> <span id="s468">I don't hate everybody.</span> <span id="s469">There were some decent Poles, but there were many who were not.</span> <span id="s470">And many were standing on those sidewalks and jeering and...and...and enjoying the spectacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">And...and calling us "dirty Jews" and...uh...some were standing and crying.</span> <span id="s472">Not everybody was that nasty, but there were many who were very... I remember that and I remember standing in the stadium for hours.</span> <span id="s473">It was hot.</span> <span id="s474">There was no water.</span> <span id="s475">There was no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Evening came.</span> <span id="s477">Night came, and we were just being pushed.</span> <span id="s478">There were some lines forming.</span> <span id="s479">We didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s480">We didn't know why we were there.</span> <span id="s481">And finally around 2, 3 o'clock in the morning, the six of us found ourselves in front of...uh ... some kind of a registration table with some people looking at all our I.Ds.</span> <span id="s482">My father was working in a place that was important for the German Reich, so he was told to get out to go to one side; and my mother who was also working and I was already working, too, and I and my younger sisters...two sisters and my brother were all sent to another place.</span> <span id="s483">And that morning (sigh) we didn't see our father anymore.</span> <span id="s484">That morning we were walked down the street to an apartment house which was apparently blocked off for the purpose of...it was made into what you call a "transit camp" now.</span> <span id="s485">They had taken a big apartment house and send in the people who, like us, were selected to go in there.</span> <span id="s486">I now know that we were selected for one of the first transports that were going from our ghetto to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s487">But I didn't know it then.</span> <span id="s488">And we were shoved into some kind of a little room with many other people.</span> <span id="s489">They brought some black coffee.</span> <span id="s490">There was screams in the court yard.</span> <span id="s491">Some people didn't want to go in, so they were beaten up.</span> <span id="s492">There was a baby crying.</span> <span id="s493">This I remember.</span> <span id="s494">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s495">And...and...and there was a..</span> <span id="s496">.</span> <span id="s497">a SS man, and he took the baby from this...her mother...his mother...her... the mother was holding the baby, and...and he just took the baby and just hit the baby against the wall and...and the baby was...you...you could...you could see the brain...you could... it was blood all over.</span> <span id="s498">I remember I started screaming and my mother pulled me in.</span> <span id="s499">And...and then I realized that something terrible was happened...happening.</span> <span id="s500">I didn't know where they were taking us, but what was happening was so horrible that I knew that there wasn't anything...anything...(sigh) that there was something terrible in store for us.</span> <span id="s501">I am sure my mother knew it, too.</span> <span id="s502">And...uh...that afternoon my mother somehow convinced my kid brother that he should try and get out of there because it was important to get out.</span> <span id="s503">My father was on the outside.</span> <span id="s504">My brother was a very cute boy.</span> <span id="s505">He was very smart.</span> <span id="s506">He was a..</span> <span id="s507">.</span> <span id="s508">he had pretty dark blond hair, big green eyes.</span> <span id="s509">As the Germans would say, he didn't look very Jewish.</span> <span id="s510">And he spoke a good German; he was really smart.</span> <span id="s511">So he walked over to the German SS man that was standing at the gate guarding the apartment complex there, and he started to cry.</span> <span id="s512">He said that his father is outside and that his...that he's all alone here and he wants to go back to his father.</span> <span id="s513">And I don't know, but apparently the man had somewhat of a heart.</span> <span id="s514">He looked down at this kid and he said...he said...he opened the gate and he said, "Run.</span> <span id="s515">Run quickly."</span> <span id="s516">And he let him out.</span> <span id="s517">Now I know that because I was standing far away.</span> <span id="s518">I had...when he went to ask him I kind of edged up so I could...I didn't hear the whole conversation, but I know what my brother was supposed to tell this SS man, but I did hear the SS man say in very loud German "Laufen!</span> <span id="s519">Lauf!</span> <span id="s520">Lauf!</span> <span id="s521">Schnell!"</span> <span id="s522">In other words, "Run quickly."</span> <span id="s523">And that's how my brother went home to my father.</span> <span id="s524">And my father was on the outside and he was trying to get us out.</span> <span id="s525">And that night somebody found us.</span> <span id="s526">There was a militia man who lived in the same apartment house, and he came in alone and he said that he is taking Pnina with him.</span> <span id="s527">That was my sister who went for me to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s528">And...uh...he said, "I am not going to let her go anywhere.</span> <span id="s529">She's got to come out."</span> <span id="s530">And he just came and took her.</span> <span id="s531">And I think he took her because, as I said, she was...they knew that she had gone for me to the camps and... That left me, my younger sister and my mother.</span> <span id="s532">And as I said, my father must have turned heaven and earth.</span> <span id="s533">I don't know what he did.</span> <span id="s534">He probably gave away everything he owned; because that night, late at night, somebody came quietly and led us out of this apartment house.</span> <span id="s535">Let me explain to you how this was...could have been done.</span> <span id="s536">Next to the apartment house in which we were being kept...this was a transit camp.</span> <span id="s537">In other words, that was made into a transit camp.</span> <span id="s538">Next to it, there was a other apartment house in which there was a bakery.</span> <span id="s539">And we were taken.</span> <span id="s540">This I remember.</span> <span id="s541">We were walked...somebody came to get us, probably risking his life for whatever he...he received from my father and he took us...it was quiet...it was night...people were sleeping...took us to this...to the roof through the attic, through the roof, through the chimney we went from our apartment house....the apartment houses were attached... You didn't have to jump.</span> <span id="s542">And I am not telling you that I was an acrobat.</span> <span id="s543">We went from the roof of this house...apartment house, to the next apartment house into the chimney again, down the chimney into the bakery.</span> <span id="s544">I remember being...by the time we came out we were all white.</span> <span id="s545">There was some dust, flour.</span> <span id="s546">It was day time.</span> <span id="s547">The curfew was off, because there was always a curfew in the ghetto; but this may have been already...Ah...I am sorry.</span> <span id="s548">They probably kept us until...because we came in it was night, but they kept us until it got light.</span> <span id="s549">I remember they brushed us off.</span> <span id="s550">We must not have looked so well.</span> <span id="s551">I remember that they were trying to make us look not...uh...how shall we say...suspicious or ..., in other words, so that people wouldn't know where we're coming from, and then one by one with such fear...I'll never for get it...we walked.</span> <span id="s552">I remember first...my Mom didn't want to be the first one.</span> <span id="s553">She sent my youngest sister first, and then I went and then she came home.</span> <span id="s554">I remember we came home.</span> <span id="s555">We were already covered with lice cause that transit camp already was filthy.</span> <span id="s556">We washed.</span> <span id="s557">This was August 1942.</span> <span id="s558">And we were home together.</span> <span id="s559">We were still a family together.</span> <span id="s560">Uh...That fall they moved us...they started to move us from the open ghetto to a ghetto that was being established out on the outskirts of Sosnowiec in B_dzin.</span> <span id="s561">It was a ghetto that was serving the whole area.</span> <span id="s562">People from Sosnowiec, B_dzin, and other... D_browa...uh...were moved into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s563">The ghetto was called, was called Srodula [Ger: Sosnowitz-Schrodula].</span> <span id="s564">I don't know whether this means anything to you.</span> <span id="s565">And I remember that we were told that we have to move to the ghetto, probably we were given a time, and we were taken to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s566">I mean...I am sorry...we... we...I don't remember whether we rented something...a..</span> <span id="s567">.</span> <span id="s568">a some...some kind of a pulley or whether it was a horse.</span> <span id="s569">I honestly don't remember.</span> <span id="s570">It may have been a horse and buggy or something...some...maybe a Polish peasant took us.</span> <span id="s571">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s572">Honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Whatever belongings we were allowed to take.</span> <span id="s574">I know that we didn't go twice.</span> <span id="s575">Whatever we had went on that one little wagon and we were moved into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s576">We were given one room in a little hut that must have belonged to a peasant.</span> <span id="s577">And...uh...we were in that house in that little room in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s578">The ghetto was closed.</span> <span id="s579">This was a ghetto where you were not allowed to go out except to go to work.</span> <span id="s580">And...uh...it was from this ghetto that my sister was taken at the end of 1942, again, this time to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s581">Nobody did anything about it then.</span> <span id="s582">And I was taken early in 1943.</span> <span id="s583">February I think, late February, to Germany to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s584">I want to tell you one story which I..</span> <span id="s585">.</span> <span id="s586">which I want to tell...I want to tell you because...I want to tell you something that...that I remember, that I think I'll never forget, that makes me feel very proud of my father.</span> <span id="s587">That we...when we were still in Sosnowiec in the ghetto, the open ghetto, but it was already towards the end when they were talking about the closed ghetto that [Moinyek Meren (ph)] who owned...who was the head of the ghetto met my father in the street and he knew my father and he liked my father.</span> <span id="s588">He had worked for my father.</span> <span id="s589">And he said...he offered my father a job of a militia man, and my father said, "Why are you asking me to become a militia man.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, you know that this is something that I would find very difficult to do."</span> <span id="s591">And [Moinyek Meren (ph)] said to him, "Terrible things are going on and people, you know, are disappearing.</span> <span id="s592">And...uh...but there is a war going on and the war may end.</span> <span id="s593">Maybe it'll end in a month.</span> <span id="s594">Maybe it will end in a half a year.</span> <span id="s595">I am trying to hold on to this ghetto.</span> <span id="s596">I am trying to hold on to as many people as I can.</span> <span id="s597">If you are working as a militia man, your chances of holding on to your family are much better."</span> <span id="s598">And my father said to him, "I am...I'm a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s599">I couldn't go and knock on anybody's house and ask somebody...take somebody somewhere where as you say terrible things are happening."</span> <span id="s600">And [Moinyek Meren (ph)] said to him, you...he got very impatient with him and he said, "I don't understand why you are...why you are refusing.</span> <span id="s601">I am trying to help you.</span> <span id="s602">I am trying to help you.</span> <span id="s603">And it's your God...I know you ... your...it's your God that's doing it.</span> <span id="s604">He looking down at this whole misery, all our suffering and he's not lifting a finger, and the only thing you can do is you can help yourself.</span> <span id="s605">He's not helping you."</span> <span id="s606">And my father said to him, "I don't know who's doing it, but if it is God I am not going to be his Malach HaMavet.</span> <span id="s607">I am not going to be his Angel of Death."</span> <span id="s608">I know about it because my father came home and told us about it because I think he felt that he owed us to tell us (crying)... I am sorry...that...that he...he wanted us to know that maybe he could help us, but he wasn't going to do it this way.</span> <span id="s609">So I do remember that story.</span> <span id="s610">And...uh...and I remember the ghetto in Srodula and it was very rough.</span> <span id="s611">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s612">We were always hungry.</span> <span id="s613">There was no food.</span> <span id="s614">There was no heat.</span> <span id="s615">Even my little brother was no longer...he was...he was so grown up.</span> <span id="s616">He never complained.</span> <span id="s617">And then...uh...I was taken to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Why don't we stop here to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s621">We're ready to go on.</span> <span id="s622">You mentioned that at the beginning of 1943, you were sent to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Right.</span> <span id="s624">I was taken to a..</span> <span id="s625">.</span> <span id="s626">what was a labor camp originally in Gräben, near Striegau [NB: Subcamp of Groß Rosen].</span> <span id="s627">It...I came from Silesia.</span> <span id="s628">This was...uh...Oberschlesien.</span> <span id="s629">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s630">I come from Oberschlesien.</span> <span id="s631">This is how the Germans called it.</span> <span id="s632">In other words, Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s633">I was sent to middle or lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s634">So it was not very far from the...from what was originally the Polish border.</span> <span id="s635">I was sent to a factory.</span> <span id="s636">Uh...They were making...uh...they were making thread out of flax.</span> <span id="s637">It was, I am sure, for uniforms or clothing.</span> <span id="s638">I remember a few things.</span> <span id="s639">I remember being walked down the street when we were...we were put on wagons and sent into Germany and then...uh...we had to walk through a little town to Gräben where the camp was, and we were, of course, walking on this street, never on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s640">And the Germans were lining the streets watching us, and what I do remember is that they were surprised.</span> <span id="s641">We were still...we had come out of our homes so we were still wearing our clothing.</span> <span id="s642">We were not in prison garb, and we were picked for good looks, if you will; good teeth, ...uh...a certain amount of strength, you know,.</span> <span id="s643">.</span> <span id="s644">uh...and some of us were very good looking girls and women.</span> <span id="s645">I was...uh...and we were ranging...I was at that point 16...uh...some of us were 17, 18.</span> <span id="s646">There were some women in their very early...early 20s, and some were really very pretty.</span> <span id="s647">And one of the things I remember was the astonishment.</span> <span id="s648">They were...the Germans were standing on the sidewalks, and they were saying, "These are Jewish women?</span> <span id="s649">They're so pretty.</span> <span id="s650">They look so...so normal."</span> <span id="s651">This was a small town.</span> <span id="s652">I don't know whether they never saw a Jew, but I do remember that these were the comments made.</span> <span id="s653">Uh... We were taken into this labor camp, and I started working in a factory, a flax factory.</span> <span id="s654">We had two shifts.</span> <span id="s655">We worked 12 hours in the day time and then the following week 12 hours at night; without a break, so that one day every two weeks was really hard.</span> <span id="s656">Because you would come in from a night shift.</span> <span id="s657">In the morning...I'm trying to remember how it was...or was there a break?</span> <span id="s658">We used to come in....I know that there was one day where we would come in at night (pause) and sleep through.</span> <span id="s659">Yah, we would sleep through, so they would give us a break and then we'd go on a night...on the day shift.</span> <span id="s660">And...uh...the work was hard because we took the job of actually the factory was manned, was wom...the people who worked there before were men, who were sent to the front.</span> <span id="s661">So we were supposed to do work that was very hard.</span> <span id="s662">And we were, of course, not getting much food.</span> <span id="s663">But I know, again, that it was not terrible, because we did get a pound of bread a week.</span> <span id="s664">We received one soup a day.</span> <span id="s665">Now the soups in the beginning were not too bad.</span> <span id="s666">There was some...uh...Kohlrabi...or some other things in it...spinach.</span> <span id="s667">Later on, they got more and more watery.</span> <span id="s668">But we did get a soup a day and a pound of bread a week.</span> <span id="s669">Some black ersatz coffee once a day and once a week we would get a small, probably a teaspoon, of margarine, a teaspoon of some jam, and I think that's it.</span> <span id="s670">But this was food.</span> <span id="s671">We were able to get some food.</span> <span id="s672">And...uh...uh...I worked in the what you call [Riefenlager (ph)].</span> <span id="s673">It was the first...it was the place where the wagons...uh...it was like...it looked like an open barn.</span> <span id="s674">There were no doors.</span> <span id="s675">Or there were doors that you could open because wagons were coming in right near that barn, and we had to unload the big bundles of flax from...from that wagon into that barn; and then inside that barn, there were big machines.</span> <span id="s676">They....they looked...they had...they looked like a machine with a big comb.</span> <span id="s677">You had to put that bundle of flax.</span> <span id="s678">I did all of this, depending on what was my...my day.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Sometimes I would unload the wagon.</span> <span id="s680">Sometimes I would stand near the machine, open up that big bundle of flax, put it underneath, because flax has little round...uh...uh....</span> <span id="s681">seed and inside...actually a round little ball, and inside the ball there is a seed and it was out of that seed that they were making oil.</span> <span id="s682">So you had to comb this through that machine and that...that would go down where they were collecting these...the seed.</span> <span id="s683">And then we were supposed to send that through a battery tube...that went to a next department.</span> <span id="s684">This was a..</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">this was a fully automated ... automated factory so... The reason that I am telling you that is that all the Germans had to do, all the...we had SS men that walked us from the camp to the factory.</span> <span id="s687">All they had to do is stand over our heads because the quicker, the faster we worked that's how quickly the whole factory worked.</span> <span id="s688">And that was very very important because..., and so we were usually given the roughest time because they were...they were always shouting, screaming at us.</span> <span id="s689">That doesn't mean that the rest of the women that were working the factory didn't have a rough time because they had to work as fast as we did.</span> <span id="s690">And it wasn't easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">In...let me tell you two things that I remember that were kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s692">One is a very unusual story.</span> <span id="s693">Our...our Kapo, if you will, was a lovely woman from our...from our city who was a little older.</span> <span id="s694">She was about 23.</span> <span id="s695">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s696">Her name was [Salka Abramczik (ph)].</span> <span id="s697">She's alive, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s698">She's in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s699">I saw her a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s700">She had studied voice before the war in Milano, I think; in Italy.</span> <span id="s701">She had a beautiful soprano.</span> <span id="s702">And...uh...she would...when we worked...and she was not a real Kapo of the kind...I mean she was...she used to come around and help us and she was always there.</span> <span id="s703">She...she was not screaming at us or anything.</span> <span id="s704">And when night fell, when we were working on the night shift, we usually would get a break, a half an hour break when they would bring the soup from the camp because on night shift, we used to eat at night.</span> <span id="s705">We would get our soup in the...at night.</span> <span id="s706">So we would huddle around kind of sitting together because it was cold and she would usually dish out the soup.</span> <span id="s707">We all...always carried with us our bowls for soup.</span> <span id="s708">And we would sit around, eat our soup and sometimes we would talk and sometimes we would be quiet and sometimes...sometimes when it moved her, [Salka (ph)] would sing to us.</span> <span id="s709">And that particular night it was very cold, and we were kinda of sitting very close to her and she started to sing Schubert's Serenade.</span> <span id="s710">And she had a very, really beautiful voice, and she was really... even with a kerchief and...and...and most of her hair gone, she really was a very pretty, very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s711">And she was singing and it was so sweet, ...it was a..</span> <span id="s712">.</span> <span id="s713">just a lovely thing.</span> <span id="s714">I remember that for those few minutes I forgot where I was.</span> <span id="s715">It felt so warm and beautiful, to listen to her sing; and...uh...suddenly I..</span> <span id="s716">.</span> <span id="s717">I..</span> <span id="s718">.</span> <span id="s719">I probably wasn't the only one, I noticed that we were not alone.</span> <span id="s720">Somebody's watching us.</span> <span id="s721">And I turned my head very kind of slightly.</span> <span id="s722">I was afraid to move.</span> <span id="s723">And I noticed that one of the SS men was standing near us, and he was looking at her singing.</span> <span id="s724">She was singing.</span> <span id="s725">She didn't notice him.</span> <span id="s726">And he was really looking at her with rapt...what you call you rapture or something.</span> <span id="s727">He really was enchanted.</span> <span id="s728">It was obvious.</span> <span id="s729">I remember I was very scared.</span> <span id="s730">And suddenly she must have noticed that he was looking at her, and she stopped singing.</span> <span id="s731">And he walked towards her and kinda of pushed us to the aside and he...she was sitting.</span> <span id="s732">He pulled her up and he started to beat on her.</span> <span id="s733">He hit on her face.</span> <span id="s734">Right, left.</span> <span id="s735">He was beating on her.</span> <span id="s736">And he was screaming.</span> <span id="s737">He was screaming so loudly.</span> <span id="s738">He probably was maybe her age, maybe a couple of years older.</span> <span id="s739">And he was screaming, "You have no right to sing to like this.</span> <span id="s740">You have no right to look like this.</span> <span id="s741">You filthy Jew."</span> <span id="s742">(long pause) I remember something else that happened in this camp.</span> <span id="s743">And that was...I don't know how much time I have and I..</span> <span id="s744">.</span> <span id="s745">I want to tell you about Bergen-Belsen because I think it's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Take all the time you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Uh...One night it was also on the night shift, we heard that one of the girls working in the...in the last of the departments there.</span> <span id="s748">I don't...I don't really know what do you call it, the department in a factory, but it was a plant.</span> <span id="s749">It was a factory.</span> <span id="s750">It was the place where they already making the thread putting it on spools; so they had big combines, big machines with big...uh...uh...I don't know what you call them...like a big tape running made out of rubber, and the women that were operating that machine...they were usually very close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Apparently one of those big combine machines...the rubber on it snapped and hit one of the girls in the eye, and apparently she lost her eye immediately.</span> <span id="s752">She...it...it swam out or.</span> <span id="s753">.</span> <span id="s754">something...in other words, she lost her eye.</span> <span id="s755">And...uh...immediately...uh...somebody took her back to the camp.</span> <span id="s756">We had what you call a Krankenstube [NB: a sickroom], a little room.</span> <span id="s757">There was a nurse, an inmate, one of the inmates who really wasn't a nurse but she knew, I suppose, how to give a..</span> <span id="s758">.</span> <span id="s759">a....a..</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">how to put a bandage...we didn't have much equipment, but if anybody was sick that's where...that's where....</span> <span id="s762">And she...uh...she was taken to this Stube, to this...to this sick room.</span> <span id="s763">Uh...We heard about it because I suppose there were some older women in our camp that had some sense of...of...of getting organized, because I know they came down to us and they said...uh...that when we come back to the camp, and we usually had to be counted...it was on "Appell."</span> <span id="s764">We had to come in into the courtyard and we were counted and then we were permitted to go to our barracks--that we are not to go back to our barracks, but demand that she...this girl whose name was Rose...be taken to a doctor because there was no help.</span> <span id="s765">She couldn't get any help there and we knew she was going to die or send...send out.</span> <span id="s766">And say it was foolish, I don't know.</span> <span id="s767">We all decided we're going to do it.</span> <span id="s768">It's one of those unrecorded things or maybe it is.</span> <span id="s769">Other people who survived my camp.</span> <span id="s770">We came back from that...from that...uh...night shift, and when we were counted and our Commandoführer--führerin, the woman--started to shout that we can go back to our barracks, we didn't move.</span> <span id="s771">And she...she was shocked.</span> <span id="s772">And she said, "What's going on?</span> <span id="s773">You are to go to your barracks."</span> <span id="s774">And we didn't move.</span> <span id="s775">And then a few stepped out and said that there was an accident in the factory at night, and we are asking that this girl be taken to a doctor because there's no doctor in the camp.</span> <span id="s776">And she...she thought it was crazy so she started beating on us, particularly in the people on the first row.</span> <span id="s777">And this was going on...she was beating us.</span> <span id="s778">I do remember that I was one of the first ones...I wasn't maybe in the first row, but I was in the second row.</span> <span id="s779">I remember being beaten up pretty badly.</span> <span id="s780">I don't even want to tell you how beat...badly, so I don't remember what happened.</span> <span id="s781">But I do remember one thing.</span> <span id="s782">That when I came to, I was told that what happened is that the people--the owners of the factory, the Germans who are still the foremen--when they heard that we are standing and not going back to our barracks, they became concerned.</span> <span id="s783">Concerned possibly that we won't be able to work.</span> <span id="s784">We'll be so exhausted or maybe there was again this kind of a sense of...of fairness that sometimes...but they insisted.</span> <span id="s785">They came and there apparently was a lot of talking between the SS men and lo and behold, this is a true story.</span> <span id="s786">That girl, Rose, was taken out of our camp with...with that nurse and with an SS man and taken to a local doctor who--apparently she had had an infection--took care of her.</span> <span id="s787">She went...I know she went about a half a dozen of times to this city, to the doctor, and they put in a glass eye in 1943 in Gräben, in Germany.</span> <span id="s788">A German doctor put in a glass eye, and the girl survived and I know because I heard she's in Israel.</span> <span id="s789">I never saw her after the war, but I know she survived.</span> <span id="s790">And that was something that we did.</span> <span id="s791">Now, of course, we could have all been killed.</span> <span id="s792">I don't think we knew.</span> <span id="s793">This is...this leads me to the next story.</span> <span id="s794">I still didn't know about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s795">I was getting cards from my parents once a month, and then mail stopped.</span> <span id="s796">And I knew something was wrong.</span> <span id="s797">And I knew on Yom Kippur in 1943, a transport came to our camp from Gräben...from Auschwitz, and among the women that came were women from our ghetto and they were different.</span> <span id="s798">They had gone through Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s799">I remember seeing somebody who I..</span> <span id="s800">.</span> <span id="s801">who may have been a neighbor, or maybe lived on the same street, and I asked, "Do you know what happened in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s802">Where are my parents?</span> <span id="s803">Do you know what's going on?"</span> <span id="s804">And I remember that she was so hard.</span> <span id="s805">She didn't even go into any...she just said, "You mean, you don't know?</span> <span id="s806">They're killed.</span> <span id="s807">They're dead."</span> <span id="s808">(long, long pause) I..</span> <span id="s809">.</span> <span id="s810">I..</span> <span id="s811">.</span> <span id="s812">I remember that I..</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">I remember two things.</span> <span id="s815">I remember the realization when she said to me...she told me they're... she...I remember she used the word...she said, "They were ...they were sent to a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s816">They were cremated."</span> <span id="s817">She was in Birkenau, and by the time she made it to Gräben, she was at least for that time a different person.</span> <span id="s818">Frieda was my camp sister.</span> <span id="s819">She was Czech.</span> <span id="s820">She and I shared everything we had.</span> <span id="s821">We were like sisters.</span> <span id="s822">If, occasionally, she got an extra soup, she would save me a half of it.</span> <span id="s823">If I got anything extra, bowl of soup or something, I did some extra work or something, I saved it for her.</span> <span id="s824">I want you to know that I..</span> <span id="s825">.</span> <span id="s826">when I would take that bowl of soup...this I, this honest, I would take that spoon and I would go around that...I would mark it off to make sure that I know which half is hers and I would come as close as it is humanly possible to her, to the part of...to that marker because I don't think...and I never...I never gave her an extra spoon.</span> <span id="s827">But I never took an extra spoon from her.</span> <span id="s828">I don't know where I took that strength.</span> <span id="s829">There were times when I didn't have that strength and I would like to tell you about it, but this time...but when it came to Frieda, I never cheated on her.</span> <span id="s830">I don't think she ever cheated on me.</span> <span id="s831">In 1944, in the fall of 1944, we were evacuated from Gräben.</span> <span id="s832">We heard rumors that the Russians are moving in, that they have occupied part of Poland.</span> <span id="s833">But these were rumors and we were sent on what you call the famous "Death March."</span> <span id="s834">It was winter.</span> <span id="s835">It was November I think.</span> <span id="s836">It was cold, and we were marched for days.</span> <span id="s837">I don't remember how long.</span> <span id="s838">Then we were put into cattle trains and...uh...I don't remember how long we were on the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s839">Some people tried to jump.</span> <span id="s840">There was always shooting at night.</span> <span id="s841">One night I thought I would jump, but I got scared and we finally were brought into Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s842">Bergen-Belsen was...was not a..</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">was not like Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s845">There were no gas chambers.</span> <span id="s846">They didn't need any gas chambers.</span> <span id="s847">It was a really death camp.</span> <span id="s848">I remember we were brought into a big empty barrack.</span> <span id="s849">There was only straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s850">We were pushed into that barrack so that you could not stretch your legs.</span> <span id="s851">We were sitting with our knees practically up to our...you know, next to our chins.</span> <span id="s852">And...uh...and you couldn't stretch your legs and it was cold and we were hungry.</span> <span id="s853">Uh...I want to tell you that it didn't take long and we could stretch our legs, because people were...people were dying.</span> <span id="s854">Almost immediately people were dying all around us.</span> <span id="s855">And...uh...we had to take out the dead people and we had to carry them out on a..</span> <span id="s856">.</span> <span id="s857">outside there were always big piles of dead bodies and I..</span> <span id="s858">.</span> <span id="s859">I carried many.</span> <span id="s860">I don't know how I kept going.</span> <span id="s861">I tell you I..</span> <span id="s862">.</span> <span id="s863">people have some way of protecting themselves.</span> <span id="s864">I know that I never...never looked at the faces, just didn't look at the faces.</span> <span id="s865">Uh...One day somebody came looking for Frieda.</span> <span id="s866">This was a Jewish woman, she was in her early 20s.</span> <span id="s867">She had survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s868">She came to Bergen-Belsen from Auschwitz, and she was in the...call it establishment.</span> <span id="s869">She was not on a barrack sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s870">She probably had a bunk; and she was working, maybe in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s871">Whatever.</span> <span id="s872">And she started calling around, "Is there a Frieda [Wringer (ph)] here?</span> <span id="s873">Frieda [Wrinder (ph)].</span> <span id="s874">And...I'm sorry...she didn't call Frieda.</span> <span id="s875">She called "Tila."</span> <span id="s876">Tila was Frieda's older sister, and she was looking for Tila.</span> <span id="s877">And when Frieda heard her name, she stepped out and she said, "I am not Tila," but I am her sister.</span> <span id="s878">What do you know about Tila?"</span> <span id="s879">Because Tila was her oldest sister and she was taken out of their house early in the war cause she volunteered...she was going to go to Israel, they thought, to Palestine, and she was one of the very early inmates in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s880">This is what Frieda found out from this girl.</span> <span id="s881">And this Tila was apparently one of those unusual women that whenever she could save somebody in Auschwitz, in Birkenau she did, and she saved this girl's life.</span> <span id="s882">She literally pulled her out...out of the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">And this woman was looking for Tila because she wanted to repay a debt.</span> <span id="s884">She wanted to...to find her.</span> <span id="s885">When she saw Frieda, she said ...immediately, she believed her because apparently... I..</span> <span id="s886">.</span> <span id="s887">I know, I met Tila after the war.</span> <span id="s888">They looked exactly the same except that Tila was dark haired and the other one was blond, but Tila had the same eyes, the same face; and she said, "Yah, I believe you that you are her sister.</span> <span id="s889">You look like her.</span> <span id="s890">And I am going to take you out of her because you will die here."</span> <span id="s891">And Frieda said, "Then you have to take Bella."</span> <span id="s892">And this woman looked at me and at Frieda and she said, "I'm not taking Bella.</span> <span id="s893">I'm taking you.</span> <span id="s894">I don't owe anything to Bella.</span> <span id="s895">If you want to come with me, you come right now."</span> <span id="s896">And Frieda was hesitating cause she wasn't going to go without me, and I said to Frieda, "Frieda, for God's sake, go.</span> <span id="s897">First of all if you can save yourself, why not?</span> <span id="s898">And secondly, maybe you can help me if you get out.</span> <span id="s899">You certainly won't be able to help me if you're here."</span> <span id="s900">So she got out and she became a..</span> <span id="s901">.</span> <span id="s902">a runner for a hospital.</span> <span id="s903">Uh...And I think that because of it, she had a little easier time of it.</span> <span id="s904">She had a bunk.</span> <span id="s905">She wasn't in this horrible place and she had a little more food, because food in Bergen-Belsen was given very sporadically.</span> <span id="s906">You never knew when you were going to get a piece of bread or anything.</span> <span id="s907">And again when she could, she would come in and bring me a potato or whatever she could.</span> <span id="s908">I would get up every morning, I was covered with lice.</span> <span id="s909">I wore one of those...uh...concentration camp uniforms.</span> <span id="s910">You know, they were grey and blue.</span> <span id="s911">Well, in the morning you couldn't see the blue.</span> <span id="s912">It was all grey.</span> <span id="s913">I was totally covered with lice.</span> <span id="s914">As long as I could I used to shake.</span> <span id="s915">I used to take this thing off and I used to shake it out.</span> <span id="s916">If I could get some cold water, I would wash.</span> <span id="s917">Later on, I am sure I didn't wash.</span> <span id="s918">I would shake out all the lice.</span> <span id="s919">I would put that thing on, and half an hour later, I was covered with lice.</span> <span id="s920">I had typhus; then I had typhoid, which is different.</span> <span id="s921">Typhus is a stomach illness.</span> <span id="s922">Typhoid is a fever, headaches.</span> <span id="s923">I don't know how I made it.</span> <span id="s924">And at the end of the war, I had paratyphoid.</span> <span id="s925">But before that...before I had this paratyphoid, after I pulled through this both typhus and typhoid, ...uh...Frieda managed to find, for me, a job.</span> <span id="s926">And she got me out of that barrack, which was the worse, into a barrack where I could have a bunk which I shared with another girl.</span> <span id="s927">So this was not great luxury, but it was a bunk and I was permitted to go to work.</span> <span id="s928">What was my work consisting of?</span> <span id="s929">It was working doing inventory, if you will.</span> <span id="s930">We would go in the morning to a big barn, big barrack, where they had a lot of clothing, and we had to separate slips from panties, blouses from..., things that the Germans took from...they must have shipped it from Auschwitz, from other camps.</span> <span id="s931">They were still...this was already...we...we came to Bergen-Belsen at...in December of 1944.</span> <span id="s932">It was a long time to be in Bergen-Belsen and survive it, by the way.</span> <span id="s933">It was not a camp to...that you could last very long.</span> <span id="s934">And this probably already March, end of... because I was liberated in April.</span> <span id="s935">This was somewhere in March, that I was working in that place, and the Germans were still doing inventory on clothing that they had...that they robbed, that they took from...from Jewish victims.</span> <span id="s936">And...uh...what was the big thing about it.</span> <span id="s937">And that was how...how could I help myself by working?</span> <span id="s938">First of all, because I was working again, I was given a soup; but I could also steal something.</span> <span id="s939">I could put on a pair of panties.</span> <span id="s940">I could go to work.</span> <span id="s941">I was allowed...under my uniform, I was allowed a pair of panties, a..</span> <span id="s942">.</span> <span id="s943">a skirt and a blouse maybe, and a sweater.</span> <span id="s944">Okay?</span> <span id="s945">Now, if I..</span> <span id="s946">.</span> <span id="s947">and maybe some stockings.</span> <span id="s948">If I went to work without wearing panties, and while I was counting if I could slip on a pair of panties on me, then I could come back to the camp and sell somebody those pair of panties for a piece of bread which I could then maybe share with Frieda.</span> <span id="s949">Well, it didn't always work because the Kapo was merciless.</span> <span id="s950">She would pick up my skirt and if she noticed I wasn't wearing panties, I couldn't bring a pair of panties.</span> <span id="s951">And she didn't like me very much because she was...she was dumb, and she didn't speak a good Polish and I spoke my Polish was too good and just didn't sit well with some...some of them, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s952">I came from a different environment for her, which maybe she came from, you know, poor stock.</span> <span id="s953">I don't know.</span> <span id="s954">She was a bitch, even though she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s955">Not all Jews were nice.</span> <span id="s956">Although I do...I do want to tell you, and I remember that...that in Bergen-Belsen, the Jewish inmates were still a little more civilized than some others.</span> <span id="s957">I don't mean it in a..</span> <span id="s958">.</span> <span id="s959">I am not putting any...passing any judgment because when you are...when you are brought to this kind of a..</span> <span id="s960">.</span> <span id="s961">when you are...when you are made...when you are so dehumanized, it's...it's very difficult to be human; but very few of us, for instance, would eat dead...you know, dead...would... would...would go in... and...and...and...and eat...uh...you know, some parts of dead people, but some of the other inmates, the Russian women particularly, but I think they...they really suffered from hunger more.</span> <span id="s962">They were bigger.</span> <span id="s963">I don't know.</span> <span id="s964">I just don't know.</span> <span id="s965">I did something at that time that was not very nice.</span> <span id="s966">And I want to say it.</span> <span id="s967">I want to, you know, because I don't want to paint a picture that it....</span> <span id="s968">it was not terrible, but I did something that wasn't nice.</span> <span id="s969">I had a friend in Bergen-Belsen, in Gräben.</span> <span id="s970">She was in the same camp, and then she was in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">And her name was Hela--Helena, Helena.</span> <span id="s972">And she was so sweet and gentle.</span> <span id="s973">She was a very sweet, lovely person.</span> <span id="s974">She was not my close friend, but she was a friend.</span> <span id="s975">And she was with us, of course, throughout this whole time and she was in that barrack, in that death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">When I managed to get out on that bunk, which I shared with another girl, she was still left behind.</span> <span id="s977">And one day, one evening she came in.</span> <span id="s978">It was late in the evening.</span> <span id="s979">And she was feverish.</span> <span id="s980">I could see she was sick.</span> <span id="s981">I had...at that point, I was well.</span> <span id="s982">I had gotten rid of typhus and typhoid.</span> <span id="s983">And she was sick.</span> <span id="s984">And she said to me, "Bella, would you let me sleep on your bunk?"</span> <span id="s985">The girl I shared the bunk with apparently was working the night shift, I think, because otherwise.... "Would you let me sleep on your bunk tonight?</span> <span id="s986">I really...I really would like to sleep on a bed.</span> <span id="s987">I am so sick and tired."</span> <span id="s988">And I looked at her, and I got scared.</span> <span id="s989">She was sick.</span> <span id="s990">And I knew if she is gonna sleep with me on that bunk, I'll get sick again.</span> <span id="s991">And I was just scared.</span> <span id="s992">And I said, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s993">You're sick, and I'm not.</span> <span id="s994">And I have to go to work tomorrow, and I am afraid."</span> <span id="s995">And she looked at me and she was very gentle, and she said, "That's okay, Bella.</span> <span id="s996">I understand."</span> <span id="s997">And she walked out.</span> <span id="s998">And she died that night.</span> <span id="s999">(Crying) And I know now that.</span> <span id="s1000">I think she knew maybe that she's dying.</span> <span id="s1001">I think she wanted to die with a little dignity.</span> <span id="s1002">And I didn't let her.</span> <span id="s1003">I.... It's funny, I never forgave myself.</span> <span id="s1004">I think she forgave me.</span> <span id="s1005">I didn't forgive myself.</span> <span id="s1006">And then...then I got sick again, and I couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s1007">I had paratyphoid.</span> <span id="s1008">And...uh...I do remember lying in bed on that bunk, I was thirsty.</span> <span id="s1009">The last 10 days...if anybody tells you that people can...cannot survive without food for whatever days, I am sure I didn't have food for ten days and I don't know how much water.</span> <span id="s1010">Frieda brought me some water a few times.</span> <span id="s1011">And she came that last night before we were liberated and she brought some water and I think she brought me an aspirin.</span> <span id="s1012">I was feverish.</span> <span id="s1013">And she stayed with me that night, and that morning the British came in and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1014">Now I showed you a picture of the bunk or the barrack in which I was, Barrack 21, which was given to me by an English soldier.</span> <span id="s1015">I think when he...when he found me...uh... I don't know that he found me, but he was...he carried me as soon as the British organized themselves, the first thing they did, they removed the sick people.</span> <span id="s1016">They took them to the hospital and, of course, the quarantined us because they were afraid of an epidemic.</span> <span id="s1017">But he...he must have been, he must have known where he took me.</span> <span id="s1018">And I don't remember how much later he came to see me, because I think I was already out of the quarantine, but he found me.</span> <span id="s1019">And he came to see what I survived because, by the way, a lot of us who were sick after the war, didn't...many died in Bergen-Belsen after the war.</span> <span id="s1020">Many died, by the way, of dysentery because the British were so sympathetic, they felt such pity, that they gave the inmates their food rationing and...and that was greasy food, you know, meat and things and people...people in, the concentration camp inmates couldn't take it so they...they died in big numbers after the war.</span> <span id="s1021">They...they developed dysentery from all of this rich food.</span> <span id="s1022">Now I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1023">Once I was taken to the hospital I wasn't given that kind of food.</span> <span id="s1024">I was given baby food probably.</span> <span id="s1025">I was very...I want you to know that when the war ended, I..</span> <span id="s1026">.</span> <span id="s1027">I weighed the equivalent of probably what is 70 pounds, and I was skin and bone; and I do remember that when that British soldier came, and asked me...he said he's...can he do something for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">And I said to him, "I'd like two things."</span> <span id="s1029">I'd like him to give me...bring me warm socks.</span> <span id="s1030">We're talking...this was already May.</span> <span id="s1031">It was warm.</span> <span id="s1032">I was cold.</span> <span id="s1033">I wanted warm socks, knee-length socks.</span> <span id="s1034">And I wanted sugar.</span> <span id="s1035">So he brought me...I was craving sugar, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1036">He brought me socks and I do remember two things.</span> <span id="s1037">I remember when he...that I put on the socks and I started to cry because I didn't have any calf.</span> <span id="s1038">I was all bones and this...the knee-length socks wouldn't stay on.</span> <span id="s1039">But I also remember that when he gave me the sugar...it may not have been more than maybe a quarter of a pound maybe, a little bag of sugar; but it was maybe, as I said, sugar, just plain sugar.</span> <span id="s1040">I took that bag and I just poured it into my mouth.</span> <span id="s1041">I just ate it like that.</span> <span id="s1042">And I remembered...I remember it, because he got scared and he ran out looking for the nurses because he thought God knows what I did to myself by eating all this sugar.</span> <span id="s1043">And I remembered the nurse said to him in German that it's okay.</span> <span id="s1044">I was probably just craving sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: What else do you remember about the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: (Sigh) Not much.</span> <span id="s1047">I wasn't very conscious.</span> <span id="s1048">I heard all kinds of stories later.</span> <span id="s1049">Uh...I heard that some prisoners who could walk around...uh...did get some...some SS men didn't get out and they did put them in a barrack, and the British were guarding them.</span> <span id="s1050">I am sorry maybe the British lined them up...the British apparently put them all, arrested them immediately and put them in a barrack, and they were guarding them.</span> <span id="s1051">And I understand that some of the prisoners, not all prisoners were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1052">And also next to our camp, there was the men camp...that the men who could walk apparently set that barrack on fire, and the British walked away.</span> <span id="s1053">But the following day, the Germans were protected.</span> <span id="s1054">In other words, I do remember hearing stories that...that first day the soldiers were so angry, and in other words, they had so much empathy for the...for the prisoners after what they saw, that they permitted it, but after that the Germans were protected.</span> <span id="s1055">I remember something else.</span> <span id="s1056">That I do remember vividly.</span> <span id="s1057">I remembering being...as sick as I was being driven out of that camp because I was on...on a truck or something, I remember how sweet the air smelled once we left that camp, that there was a terrible stench of burning bodies in that camp, and I became so aware of a different...of a..</span> <span id="s1058">.</span> <span id="s1059">and I also remember one more thing, being sprayed with DDT and loving it, because all the itching stopped, all the...all the horrible things on my body stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: What happened to you after you got out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: I went to a DP camp in...in Bergen where I stayed til the fall.</span> <span id="s1062">I..</span> <span id="s1063">.</span> <span id="s1064">my sister found me.</span> <span id="s1065">And she came.</span> <span id="s1066">She was liberated by Russians on the other side of...in other words, in another part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1067">She was lucky.</span> <span id="s1068">She never went on a death march, and that was fortunate.</span> <span id="s1069">I don't think she would have made it.</span> <span id="s1070">And she found me through Red Cross, and came and brought with her a telegram from my uncle in New York.</span> <span id="s1071">I had four uncles in New York, and one of them was extremely wealthy.</span> <span id="s1072">And...uh...then I started working on one thing.</span> <span id="s1073">I wanted to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1074">I really wanted to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1075">I was...I was filled up with a lot of anger and hatred and I..</span> <span id="s1076">.</span> <span id="s1077">I was afraid for myself.</span> <span id="s1078">When I saw children in the street, I..</span> <span id="s1079">.</span> <span id="s1080">I..</span> <span id="s1081">.</span> <span id="s1082">I..</span> <span id="s1083">.</span> <span id="s1084">I wanted to go out over them and... over to the children and beat them or something.</span> <span id="s1085">I was afraid, I didn't want to see the Germans around me.</span> <span id="s1086">I didn't want to see children.</span> <span id="s1087">I..</span> <span id="s1088">.</span> <span id="s1089">I..</span> <span id="s1090">.</span> <span id="s1091">I felt that for my own sanity I need to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1092">And I did everything I could.</span> <span id="s1093">I moved to the American...I smuggled myself.</span> <span id="s1094">It wasn't difficult, by the way.</span> <span id="s1095">That was not a heroic thing, but I did cross the border to the American zone and I managed to get a job in the HIAS...uh...and...uh...mine were one of the first papers that came to the HIAS in Frankfort.</span> <span id="s1096">I was in [Salsa (ph)] which was near Frankfurt-am-Main, and there was a consulate there and my papers...papers for me and for my sister were one of the first papers that came into that office ...into this HIAS office.</span> <span id="s1097">And in fact, I was very lucky as I said.</span> <span id="s1098">I came to this country in May 1946 with the second ship that came to these shores.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Did your sister come with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: No.</span> <span id="s1101">My sister went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1102">My sister was going to come with me.</span> <span id="s1103">We had terrible fights about it.</span> <span id="s1104">She was younger and I wanted her to come with me.</span> <span id="s1105">But she said that she wasn't going to go anywhere but to Palestine because she wasn't...nobody was going to send her to another crematorium.</span> <span id="s1106">And I said I would go with her to Palestine, but it was not possible to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1107">The gates were closed, already.</span> <span id="s1108">They were not allowing.</span> <span id="s1109">So she...so we kind of made a deal.</span> <span id="s1110">She was going to come with me to America, and then we were going to go to Palestine when and if it was going to be possible.</span> <span id="s1111">But she reneged.</span> <span

things.</span> <span id="s1116">First, I..</span> <span id="s1117">.</span> <span id="s1118">I came to this... to this country...uh...with somebody who was...who then became my husband, but he was not my husband then.</span> <span id="s1119">He was just a friend.</span> <span id="s1120">I came and I..</span> <span id="s1121">.</span> <span id="s1122">my uncles waited for me...uh... I worked in my uncle's factory.</span> <span id="s1123">My uncle was a nice guy, but not that nice.</span> <span id="s1124">Uh...maybe because he was so wealthy.</span> <span id="s1125">He didn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">They found me a room in the Bronx, and an intermediary paid for half the rent and when I got my first check, I had to pay for the rest of the rent, and I didn't have enough money to buy myself food.</span> <span id="s1127">So that wasn't a very wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1128">And I..</span> <span id="s1129">.</span> <span id="s1130">uh...I used to take the subway and go to the factory, and I worked in the factory, and my uncle... I was...I was young.</span> <span id="s1131">I was bright.</span> <span id="s1132">If he had given me just an opportunity to go to school and learn how to type or to become a bookkeeper, I would have, you know, been able to do something better than work in a factory in a wrapping department wrapping things.</span> <span id="s1133">But I think my uncle didn't... didn't think this way.</span> <span id="s1134">He didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1135">Uh...He capped my teeth.</span> <span id="s1136">I had had some teeth knocked out during the war.</span> <span id="s1137">So he capped my... you know, he took me to a very fine dentist on 5th Avenue, and they did a beautiful job putting caps on my teeth, probably as beautiful as some of the Hollywood... Hollywood.</span> <span id="s1138">I had very, you know, I..</span> <span id="s1139">he did a very nice job.</span> <span id="s1140">I had had some front teeth broken.</span> <span id="s1141">Uh...But he did not...he did not...uh...help me out any other way.</span> <span id="s1142">He...uh...Henry and I started going out about, just shortly after that.</span> <span id="s1143">Henry then went..., uh...he worked for awhile in a factory too, then he started working.</span> <span id="s1144">He had a year of medical school in Germany, so he started working in [Mt.] Sinai Hospital.</span> <span id="s1145">And... uh...then he passed the New York Boards, whatever they call them, and he was accepted in Brooklyn College and we were married.</span> <span id="s1146">He went to school.</span> <span id="s1147">I supported him.</span> <span id="s1148">We moved to Washington.</span> <span id="s1149">I started going to school.</span> <span id="s1150">I started taking courses in Maryland, then I went to visit my sister in 1959 and I became a Jew.</span> <span id="s1151">By the way, until 1959, I had a bit of a detour with my God.</span> <span id="s1152">I didn't...I was Jewish, but I wasn't particularly traditional.</span> <span id="s1153">I think Henry didn't go to work on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1154">That was the extent.</span> <span id="s1155">But when I went to Israel in 1959 and I walked through the streets of Jerusalem, I became a Jew.</span> <span id="s1156">I..</span> <span id="s1157">.</span> <span id="s1158">I came back and I decided instead of becoming an accountant, which I was considering because I was good with numbers, to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1159">I had remembered some, but not much.</span> <span id="s1160">And I went...I started studying at Baltimore Hebrew College, and I got my Bachelors of Hebrew Letters, and my license and in between while I was doing this, I was already teaching Hebrew and... Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Just maybe one thing.</span> <span id="s1163">As I started to tell you that I had a detour with God, and I did settle it.</span> <span id="s1164">I don't know whether Henry...I don't think Henry is a believing Jew.</span> <span id="s1165">I think he's an agnostic, but I do believe in God.</span> <span id="s1166">And I believe...I do want to say that.</span> <span id="s1167">I believe that God is not responsible for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1168">I think people are.</span> <span id="s1169">I think that people were given a choice, always, and taught what is right and what is wrong.</span> <span id="s1170">And the Germans are the ones who were responsible for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1171">They built Auschwitz, and I don't think God was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1172">And that's how I can live with it.</span> <span id="s1173">Otherwise, I would have a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1175">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">PHOTOGRAPHS Picture belonging to a friend from concentration camp who died before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1177">Shows two young women, one wearing the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Bella in 1942 in the Sosnowiec ghetto with a friend.</span> <span id="s1179">The picture remained with her sister during the war, and was returned to Bella after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Barrack 21 in Bergen-Belsen, where Bella was found by British soldiers liberating the camp in April 1945.</span> <span id="s1181">This photo was taken by the British to record what they saw.</span> <span id="s1182">A British soldier gave her the photo as a memento.</span></p></body></html>
