That’s a real Hungarian spelling, it’s a real Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s32">The family name was Wieisz and after the war, in 1948, they changed the family name to Varga, because of the situation in Hungary at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And how can you s -- how do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Varga?</span> <span id="s35">V-a-r-g-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And so at what time would that name change have happened, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I believe it happened after I left from home, and I left the end of ’46, so the year it happened, probably the beginning of ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And so you say they changed it because of the situation.</span> <span id="s39">Do you mean -- how do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well, I’ll go -- let me go back, let me tell you something about my mother.</span> <span id="s41">My mother’s maiden name was Julia Schwartz.</span> <span id="s42">And my mother -- actually both of my parents were born the northwest -- northeast part of Hungary.</span> <span id="s43">And my mother was born in Ungvar, and my father was born in a small town named Boatfaller.</span> <span id="s44">They were -- well, what’s the word I want to use?</span> <span id="s45">My father was quite a few years older than my mother and he waited until she grew up for them to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: How much age difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: About eight years, probably.</span> <span id="s48">And -- and by that time my father lived in a different city in -- more in the middle of the hung -- eastern part of Hungary, that’s where I was born, called Debrecen.</span> <span id="s49">And he was a well established businessman at that time.</span> <span id="s50">And my mother was a very beautiful woman and they were a very handsome couple.</span> <span id="s51">I had three sisters; there was four children in the family, all girls.</span> <span id="s52">And I lived a nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Tell me about your sisters, their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My sisters, oh yeah, I’m the oldest, I’m child number one.</span> <span id="s55">I have a sister who is almost five years younger and another one who was born three years after her and one three years after.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Martha, Mariann -- actually Marianna and Gabriela is the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Just going to move the microphone a little closer so we can pick you up better.</span> <span id="s59">Not a whole lot, but just a little.</span> <span id="s60">And they all made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: We all survived, yes.</span> <span id="s62">Well, our situation was a little bit different than my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: So we all survived together, we were all together all through that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And what has happened to your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: They are fine, we all survived.</span> <span id="s67">One sister lives in New York.</span> <span id="s68">One lives in Scotland and the youngest one stayed home -- home in Hungary to take care of our parents.</span> <span id="s69">See, the other two sisters, the two middle girls left Hungary in 1956, after -- during and after the revolution that they had in Hungary then.</span> <span id="s70">And one ended up in England and the other one made it to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So you’re the only one that left right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I left right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Well, we’ll get to that, cause that’s much of what we want to talk about.</span> <span id="s74">Were you poor, middle class, well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, it went from good to bad.</span> <span id="s76">When I was born my father was -- we weren’t rich, but well-to-do.</span> <span id="s77">And what I remember as a child growing up is hearing about things.</span> <span id="s78">When the crash of the stock market in the United States and the [indecipherable] got over to Europe by the mid 30’s, it had an effect on my father’s business.</span> <span id="s79">And then eventually, in 1938, Hitler was in power and that was getting downhill.</span> <span id="s80">And by 1942 my father was in a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Your -- your parent’s parents, your grandparents, how would you describe th-them in terms of their -- or theirs s-status financially, socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I don’t even know, I remember my grandparents as old people.</span> <span id="s83">Somehow they were always old.</span> <span id="s84">My pare -- my mother’s parents and my grandfather had a business, he was a well-to-do man.</span> <span id="s85">They lived in a beautiful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: He was a what?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: A well-to-do man.</span> <span id="s88">He -- they lived in a beautiful home, and I can still remember [indecipherable] built into the mountain there.</span> <span id="s89">And they had the business on the bottom of the -- you know, the street floor and the house was up on top, and it was a beautiful home with beautiful furniture and all that.</span> <span id="s90">We used to go there to visit and spent -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there.</span> <span id="s91">My grandmother was a beautiful woman, a very stately lady.</span> <span id="s92">And my grandfather was a sweet old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: And on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: On the other side they were -- well, it’s a strange stories because my two grandparents -- my two grandmothers were sisters.</span> <span id="s95">My parents were first cousins.</span> <span id="s96">My father’s father, he was a different kind of a man, he was -- I don’t know how to describe him.</span> <span id="s97">I just remember him during the hun -- you know, Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s98">He was a religious man, not overly, but he was you know, the both sides were very observant Jewish people.</span> <span id="s99">I remember my father’s father during the -- the Succoth holiday.</span> <span id="s100">And they always had a sukkah built in the yard, and he would sit there and take all his meals there and have his prayer book there.</span> <span id="s101">Yet, when he got angry, he could yell like -- and scream like a real Hungarian.</span> <span id="s102">He had a good temper.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And you had said in the interview that I saw that your -- your father was able to trace your ancestors in Hungary back to the early --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Well, when the troubles -- the -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: -- 1700’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: -- when the troubles started in the 30’s, you had to trace your ancestry back as far as you could go, because by 1938 - ’39, they were picking up people who were not so-called Hungarians.</span> <span id="s107">See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from Slovakia, from Poland, from other countries to Hungary, and they were mostly, I suppose at that time looking for those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Little did we know that nothing is going to help.</span> <span id="s110">And yes, my father did trace our ancestry back into Hungary to the 1700’s.</span> <span id="s111">On paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: I want to jump around a little bit, cause again we’re filling in little gaps in the previous interview.</span> <span id="s113">You went to a Catholic school when it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: High school, 1939.</span> <span id="s116">I’m curious, you had gone to Jewish schools prior to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Why not a Jewish high school?</span> <span id="s119">How did you end up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: There was no Jewish high school for girls, that’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: And this was a specialized school, and unfortunately only the Catholic school system had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Specialized in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: It’s more of an art oriented high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And you were gifted in art?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: I understand you still --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: That was where we learned dress designing, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all associated with the arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Te-Tell me about friendships that you had in high school, both with Jewish girls and non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same school where I went.</span> <span id="s131">I don’t mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes actually, so they had maybe I don’t know whether -- the first year I think maybe we had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left.</span> <span id="s132">They’re maybe were two or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish girls, other than being in the school with them no, I don’t think I was really friendly with any of them.</span> <span id="s133">That were strange over there, see, because we grew up separated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s134">We only wil -- saw Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s135">So by the time you were a teenager in your late teens in high school it’s -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Was that by choice or by official design that you’d -- you stayed amongst yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I don’t think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Would you -- how would you -- I’m thinking in terms of many American cities where blacks live on one side of town and whites live on another side of town, where -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can’t live together, they often don’t, and I’m wondering was it a similar situation or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s140">There was one area where most -- were more dominated by Jewish people, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than that, no.</span> <span id="s141">There was no area where you had to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: That was my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s145">Cause I know in some cities in Europe there had been the remnants of ghettoes from previous eras.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Shtetl, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: -- I know, and I’ve been arguing that.</span> <span id="s149">I never lived in a shtetl, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: That’s what I was trying to establish.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: At least not in my time in Hungary, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s153">So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Not close friends, no.</span> <span id="s155">But by the time I got to that high school, it was already troubled times.</span> <span id="s156">Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were -- there were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly forever, because they were nice human beings.</span> <span id="s157">But then there were others who just as soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Tell me about them.</span> <span id="s159">What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you got that feeling about?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a Catholic school and there’s -- during the time you go and you have to say some kind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this particular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray because what’s happening out in the world.</span> <span id="s161">And in those days a lot of Jewish people did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did.</span> <span id="s162">Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s163">I remember when we were in the wagon already, there was a young woman doctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s164">Her parents converted during the first World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian.</span> <span id="s165">And yet she was considered a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I’m unclear, was she saying that with malice or with concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, I think it was malice and no concern, because if it would have been concern, I probably wouldn’t remember it the way I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: What about the other kids?</span> <span id="s169">You intimated in your previous interview that you had experienced some -- some anti-Semitic --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, while we were in the class it was fine, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s171">Well, the thing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the ghetto to the brick factory, there was one of the girls that I went to school with and I used to walk with her home from school, and she thought of nothing picking up a stone and throw it at me.</span> <span id="s172">See, people -- we were walking in the middle of the road and the people were standing on both sides on the sidewalk and watching us leaving town.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: But back when you were going to school, what did you experience in terms of any -- or did you -- any problems with any of the other Gentile girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I don’t remember any, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s176">Let’s talk about the conditions of your deportation from your hometown.</span> <span id="s177">W -- How did that come about?</span> <span id="s178">You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your previous interview.</span> <span id="s179">I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and what -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it was going to happen til when you were actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: [indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the Jewish school, 1938, when our principal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every class, to tell us what’s happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect.</span> <span id="s181">And he had -- a big guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us.</span> <span id="s182">That was 1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that it was getting harder to hold a job if you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s183">I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a -- a district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s184">And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern part of Hungary that belonged to Czechoslovakia, and that time to Hungary.</span> <span id="s185">And my father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army’s uniform.</span> <span id="s186">He fought in the first World War, so he was called up again to pay the country back.</span> <span id="s187">And by 1941 he was called into labor camp, ’41 - ’42 then they let him out for awhile and then they -- took him back again.</span> <span id="s188">In 1944, March 19th, it was on a Sunday afternoon when the Germans -- German army flew over Hungary.</span> <span id="s189">I can still see it, it was a dreary, nasty day.</span> <span id="s190">No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming.</span> <span id="s191">And we saw the plane fly over our city and after that it went one, two, three.</span> <span id="s192">They came in on the 19th.</span> <span id="s193">By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s194">May sixth we were put into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s195">I was watching them building the six foot high wall all around the area.</span> <span id="s196">In my town, in Debrecen, they had to make two different ghettos because there was a main road going to the railroad station which they couldn’t cut off.</span> <span id="s197">So there was a smaller side where we lived and there was a larger side on the other side.</span> <span id="s198">So our house happened to be in the smaller area, so that’s where we were.</span> <span id="s199">And to the day the wall was finished we did not believe it, that it will happen.</span> <span id="s200">It was impossible, we lived there forever.</span> <span id="s201">I was born there, I grew up there.</span> <span id="s202">People were hoping that the mayor of the city, little did they know that he had no say so, won’t let it happen.</span> <span id="s203">But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s204">And in June --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: I hate -- I hate to say it, we are going to need to do something about the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, the only thing you can do is just take it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Would you trust me -- I’ll be happy to put it back the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Just take it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: And just let -- [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s212">One small thing, and that is, if you could make an effort not to put your hands in front of the microphone.</span> <span id="s213">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I’ll try.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: -- only -- there were -- there were -- there was one time when you were putting your hands like so.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I was coughing, I didn’t want to cough into the microphone.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: No, you were just telling a story and you had your hands --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So if you could just -- don’t be too self conscious, but just be aware --</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: -- that if you put your hand in front of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: -- it creates a problem.</span> <span id="s224">Okay, so you were locked into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s225">My question is, when did you find out that you were going to be deported, and how did that come about?</span> <span id="s226">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well when we found out --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And how did you find out, and were there others deported before you and was it something you were expecting, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: We didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s230">To this day we don’t know how we didn’t know, but we did not know what to expect.</span> <span id="s231">The way we found out we were gonna go was a Sunday morning that the people came in with the loudspeaker, walked through the stra -- the streets, it was Sunday morning and th -- they said start packing because by the afternoon you all have to be at the other side in the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s232">And then we knew.</span> <span id="s233">I mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right?</span> <span id="s234">I mean, you had to know something was happening.</span> <span id="s235">My father wasn’t home and there we were, my mother and the four of us and a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother’s nephew, her sister’s son who came with us to live.</span> <span id="s236">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s237">We started to pack whatever we could and by noon people were coming into the house to make sure that we’re not taking anything valuable with us.</span> <span id="s238">So much so that there were two guys and one woman who came to the house, and the woman took my mother into the bedroom to check her inside, literally, her inside, to make sure that she is not hiding anything in her body that’s valuable.</span> <span id="s239">And the afternoon we were over at the other side.</span> <span id="s240">And that was that.</span> <span id="s241">That was Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange reason, luckily, they brought my father back with a bunch of other people in his group.</span> <span id="s242">So at that point in time we were all together.</span> <span id="s243">My family and a -- a brother of my mother -- father and her -- his sister.</span> <span id="s244">And another cousin of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: But my question is, what was it like when they took you away from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: From my hometown --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: -- or from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: From the ghetto.</span> <span id="s250">When -- when you left --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Well, we were in our home.</span> <span id="s252">After that we were homeless.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Wh-When you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: We were homeless.</span> <span id="s255">That’s what we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: -- when you were taken fr-from the ghetto and you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: And then we stayed on the other side.</span> <span id="s258">Not long, maybe a few days, I’m not -- I don’t remember exactly what it was, four or five days maybe.</span> <span id="s259">And they were -- that’s when we were walking to the brick factory.</span> <span id="s260">And we stayed there for about a week or so, and that was a horror.</span> <span id="s261">That was absolute horror.</span> <span id="s262">We had to get into groups every day and walk down to the railroad tracks and wait in case we were going to be taken someplace.</span> <span id="s263">We didn’t know where, but we were going to be taken someplace.</span> <span id="s264">And then they started to group people together, and we ended up in a group, they had many children in the families.</span> <span id="s265">And I think I was the fifth or sixth there and finally they put us into the wagons and we started off.</span> <span id="s266">We went to the border of Hungary and Slovakia and I remember there was one of the Hungarian gendars who was on the -- standing on the back of the train.</span> <span id="s267">I guess, now in looking back I think the wagons, the car we were in, the cattle car we were in must have been the last one.</span> <span id="s268">Either that or each one of them had one of those guys standing there, traveling with us.</span> <span id="s269">And that guy, I remember when it -- they start the train and he said to us, that’s as far as I can go with you.</span> <span id="s270">God be with you.</span> <span id="s271">So he must have been somebody with a little heart, or maybe he knew where we were supposed to be going.</span> <span id="s272">And that was that and I remember at that point I had the feeling that this is it, you know, all of a sudden it just hit that I’ll probably never get out of the cattle car alive.</span> <span id="s273">And some miracle happened, for some reason we stayed there overnight and the train didn’t move and th -- early in the morning it started to roll again and we were looking through the cracks which way we’re going and we were going back into Hungary, we were in the middle of Hungary.</span> <span id="s274">Next we knew we start to now s -- go to Budapest.</span> <span id="s275">And soon after that we kept going and we crossed the border to Austria and -- and there we were.</span> <span id="s276">We ended up in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Let’s step back a little bit.</span> <span id="s278">What was th-the transport like in the car?</span> <span id="s279">What was the -- I know it wasn’t very pleasant, but can you describe what the -- what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well, if you can imagine -- you know what a cattle car looks like?</span> <span id="s281">Okay.</span> <span id="s282">Can you imagine that filled with about a hundred people or more?</span> <span id="s283">Families, children, old people.</span> <span id="s284">Small children, some who were lame and not able to move readily, you know, that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did people stand, sit, lie down?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Whatever you were able to do, that’s what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And wh-what did you do for water, or relieving yourself, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well, they -- they -- we had a bucket of water and we had a bucket for other things, and I remember when we start around the outskirt of Budapest, they gave us some fresh water there, and that was it.</span> <span id="s289">We were very lucky because we didn’t stay in the wagon very long.</span> <span id="s290">It was just one of those freak things that you don’t have an answer for.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: In your -- in your interview that I saw and read the transcript of, you say that you were supposed to have gone to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How did you learn that, that you were supposed to have -- that that train --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well, everybody was supposed to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s295">Now we found out here in the United States already, just a few years ago, there is a -- a historian, a Hungarian man, he teaches now at New York University.</span> <span id="s296">He wrote a book called, “The Genocide of the Hungarian Jews.”</span> <span id="s297">You may have heard of it.</span> <span id="s298">And he found out that at that point, where we were supposed to be crossing into Poland -- now we were told at the time they couldn’t take us through because they bombed the viaduct and the [indecipherable] the train couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s299">But what he found out was that there was a group of people who made a deal with the Germans to be taken out of Hungary from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country.</span> <span id="s300">And somebody made a mistake who was directing the -- the cattle cars, and by the time they realized that they took those people on the way to Auschwitz and called Eichmann, the -- the trainload was too far gone to bring them back.</span> <span id="s301">And supposedly Eichmann told him, whoever was in charge, to find another group with the same amount of people in it and take them to Austria.</span> <span id="s302">And supposedly that was the group we were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: What did you know ahead of time?</span> <span id="s304">What had filtered through to your community about what was going on and -- I mean, did you -- did you through the grapevine hear -- learn things?</span> <span id="s305">Did you listen to the shortwave?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: We listened -- we listened to the English radio, we listened to the American radio.</span> <span id="s307">To the very last day we were hoping and praying that Mr. Roosevelt will come and save us.</span> <span id="s308">Well, Mr. Roosevelt didn’t come to save us.</span> <span id="s309">As wonderful a man as he was, but that he didn’t do.</span> <span id="s310">We knew there was trouble, because by 1940 - ’41, many, many, many Slovakian Jewish people were in Hungary.</span> <span id="s311">They all were running away from Slovakia, only to be caught in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Had you -- I guess my question is, by the time you were on that train, supposedly for Auschwitz, what did you know of -- about the camps or -- or how people were being killed?</span> <span id="s313">Did you know any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, we didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel.</span> <span id="s318">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s319">What was life like -- I’m jumping ahead now with the questions, these follow-up questions, in -- is it Strasoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Strasoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Strasoff, before the war ended.</span> <span id="s322">What was the conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Right before the war ended?</span> <span id="s324">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s325">See, luckily we didn’t spend too much time over there, but a short time, about a month and a half while we were there, that was bad.</span> <span id="s326">There was no food practically.</span> <span id="s327">Sanitary conditions were awful.</span> <span id="s328">It was cold.</span> <span id="s329">That was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Was there any sort of organizational structure amongst the --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: We had no time for that.</span> <span id="s332">We had no time for that.</span> <span id="s333">See this -- this camp wasn’t like Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s334">We saw no killing over there.</span> <span id="s335">There was one day when the put us into the wagons and we were to be taken to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s336">And that was the only cruelty that I saw, when one of those guards, a woman, a Ukrainian woman guard hit my father on the head with a bat of some sort, a piece of wood, because he couldn’t run fast enough for her.</span> <span id="s337">But other than that there was no other what you would call, you know, cruelty like you hear from people who were in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Where were your sisters during this time?</span> <span id="s339">Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: We were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: We left our house together and we came back together.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: How did you decide to return home after the war?</span> <span id="s344">Was it an automatic decision, did you -- was there any debate?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: It was decided for us, we had no other way to go.</span> <span id="s346">When we were -- we were liberated April 10th when the Russians came in and a few [indecipherable] to the west they were still fighting, so there was no way to go except back where we came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Were you at all apprehensive about going back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Oh, of course we were.</span> <span id="s349">Then we were leaving -- we were told to leave.</span> <span id="s350">There was no choice, we were told to leave because they had to burn down the camp, it was in such an awful condition that that had to be burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So at that time there were no displaced person camps or any place --</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Not for us, no, no.</span> <span id="s353">See, there was still fighting, the war wasn’t over yet, and then we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: So you went back to your hometown.</span> <span id="s355">What was it like -- you’ve de -- you’ve described about -- well, first let me ask you how long was that trip from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: That trip?</span> <span id="s357">Over a week.</span> <span id="s358">We walked on foot.</span> <span id="s359">We somewhere along the line managed to get a wagon with a horse.</span> <span id="s360">So some of the people who couldn't do walking well enough -- see, I had a cousin of mine who had polio since he was a small child, he was two years old and he had polio and he never walked.</span> <span id="s361">And so some of those people were sitting on top of the wagon and the rest of us walked.</span> <span id="s362">We walked this way and the Russian soldiers came that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: For -- what -- what did you eat for a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: What did we eat?</span> <span id="s365">Well, we stopped at different farmhouses and whatever we could find, we took.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So they were vacant?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: The-These farmhouses were vacant?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Most of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s370">They left so fast they even left the hot food on the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And why did they leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Be -- they were afraid of the Russians, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: When you -- when you got back to -- is it Debrecen, how do you pronounce --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Debrecen.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Debrecen.</span> <span id="s376">I -- I understand from the interview you gave before that you were received very poorly by the people who were left there, that they were not --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, I wouldn’t say all the people, but when we got off the train in the station and we were walking the main street towards our home, and they looked at us -- but then, these were young people, not older, young people, they greeted us, you know, how come -- what are you doing back here?</span> <span id="s378">You were supposed to be dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You said not everybody was like that.</span> <span id="s380">Can you tell me more about the varieties of different reactions that you might have gotten from --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: You know, it was such a long time ago and what I can remember is there was really no time to look at reactions because we had nothing on our body except the clothes we left a year ago -- a year before that.</span> <span id="s382">And th -- you know, our first -- we walked into the house and there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s383">It was totally empty, everything was taken out.</span> <span id="s384">So our first priority was to look around and see if we can start a new life.</span> <span id="s385">So there was even no time to look and see what people thought and how they reacted.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: How -- just so I get an idea before I ask you the next several questions, how long were you there before you made the decision to leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Well, we got back there in 1945, May, and I think by end of the year I decided that I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So a little over six months you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I couldn’t convince my family to leave in the same time, because, see my mother have -- had at that time two sisters over here and lots of relatives.</span> <span id="s392">And I must say they were very nice, they sn -- you know, send the papers right away and everything that they needed to do, they did, to get us over here as a family.</span> <span id="s393">But it took longer than I had patience for, and I wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Let’s step back a little bit before that, I -- I’d like to talk to you about what life was like there in your hometown before you decided to leave.</span> <span id="s395">You say you were there for about six months or so.</span> <span id="s396">How did you -- you -- you came back home, there’s noth -- not a st -- there’s no furniture, there’s no nothing, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Well, we came back home and you were looking for people you knew before, to see if anybody came back, my uncle, my aunt’s husband wasn’t with us, he was in a labor camp someplace.</span> <span id="s398">Luckily he survived and he came back.</span> <span id="s399">Yet her son, who was somewhere in Germany, never made it back home.</span> <span id="s400">So we used to go every day to the center point of the Jewish life over there in that time, that was hastily put together, to look at names who they found and you know, who was alive.</span> <span id="s401">And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: But you had no money, you had no belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: We had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How did you get by, what did you eat?</span> <span id="s405">How did --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: [indecipherable] well, there was a place called the Joint Distribution Committee, if you ever heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: And they gave us some clothes, they gave us a little money to get started with.</span> <span id="s409">And the rest we just, I don’t know, see, I -- I had my parents.</span> <span id="s410">I had my father.</span> <span id="s411">He took care of all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Di-Did he find work?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: He must have, some kind of a work, because eventually he did do something to provide for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: But you don’t remember what?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did you see when you went back, former schoolmates f -- I’m ta -- I’m thinking of Gentile folks that you would have known before you were put into the ghetto and before you were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, not any of my classmates, no.</span> <span id="s418">See, it was a total chaos when we went back, it was still soon after really, so-called liberation.</span> <span id="s419">Everything was in chaos.</span> <span id="s420">The school I -- the Catholic school I went to was disbanded, there were no more nuns around.</span> <span id="s421">It was -- I don’t know, everybody was everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Of the Jewish population in your hometown, were you all on that one train that was turned around?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Oh, no, no, no, they -- they took 12,000 [indecipherable] the population of 12,000 Jewish people in that city.</span> <span id="s424">That city wa -- had a population of the w -- at that time about 120,000 people, and 10 percent were the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: And who -- how many made it back alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Not a whole lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Roughly, do you know -- have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: See, the transport we were in was they weren't only from Hungary -- from Debrecen, they brought people over there from outlying areas in different stories.</span> <span id="s429">So we had people with us from Szolnok, we had people with us from Szeged, from Miskolc, from all over the place.</span> <span id="s430">That was, I guess, the biggest city around and so they brought people over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: But do you have any idea from reading or speaking with people s-since the war has ended, any notion of how many people survived from your hometown, of the Jewish population, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I have a book, I could -- I could look it up for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Don’t worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: But I’m really not sure.</span> <span id="s435">Not -- not too many, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So what was it like for you to come back to your hometown that had treated you badly, if a -- if I’m making sense, to come back to the same people who had been persecuting you beforehand and to come back and there being such a small number of Jews that were left and I guess -- maybe I’m asking a -- an inappropriate question, that it sounds like your concerns were much more concrete, day to day, what you were going to eat, how were you going to get by.</span> <span id="s437">But I guess I’m just wondering what it was like to come back to your hometown in this chaos and such a different place than you grew up.</span> <span id="s438">Was it -- had many other people left?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: You mean, escaping from the -- the Russians, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: You mean the --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: I mean the --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: -- people who came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: No, what I’m really referring to is Gentiles from the town.</span> <span id="s445">Had they -- was it pretty much intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh, that part of it was -- th-they all stayed.</span> <span id="s447">No, they didn’t leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay, cause you were talking about the people in the countryside that had abandoned their farms with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: That was in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s451">So you decided to leave, let’s go to that part of it.</span> <span id="s452">How is it that you -- t-tell me about your decision to leave and why you decided to leave when the rest of your family was staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Well, for one thing, since I was the oldest in the family -- I saw no future there, for one thing.</span> <span id="s454">And I always, since I was a little girl, I always wanted to come to the United States of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I’m not sure exactly why, but I -- at the -- you know, when I was little child, I don’t know why, because I heard my parents talk about it so much and we have -- we had so many relatives already here.</span> <span id="s457">And that sounded like an exciting place to live.</span> <span id="s458">So after the war I had a choice of either going to Israel, where I also had relatives, because my father’s whole family was in Israel by that time, including my grandparents.</span> <span id="s459">And -- or come to the United States.</span> <span id="s460">And since my mother had two sisters who were here and they ask me, they says, please go to the United States because I want to go there someday too and be with -- be with my sisters.</span> <span id="s461">And they were very nice people, they send me the appropriate papers and here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: I want to -- I want to ask you in more detail about that, cause not many other people, it wasn’t so easy, in terms of, you know, immigration quotas and other problems.</span> <span id="s463">How long -- when did you -- whe -- from when you decided to come, til you actually came, how long did it take to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: About two years.</span> <span id="s465">Close to two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And what did you do in the interim?</span> <span id="s467">Did you spend all that time there in Debrecen?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, no, I stayed in Hungary til the very end of 1946, yeah, I worked a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: What did I do?</span> <span id="s471">It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s472">See, by that time they had a very good Zionist organization built up already and a lot of young people coming and they had all sorts of offices there, and I worked in one of those places there.</span> <span id="s473">And for -- end of ’46, in December, or -- yeah, and then I left.</span> <span id="s474">And then I went to France, I st -- I stayed in Paris for about eight weeks until I could get in a ship and then I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Let’s step back a little bit, so you spent all told about a year and a half in Hungary before you went to Paris and then eventually to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: I guess I’m trying to get a feel for a daily life for you then.</span> <span id="s478">What -- what did you do?</span> <span id="s479">What --di-did you have friends, did you simply do things with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I had lots of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: I’m -- I’m trying to get a f --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: There was lot of young people who came back from labor camps, from Auschwitz without anybody, without their families.</span> <span id="s483">So what -- those were busy times.</span> <span id="s484">If you could do away with all the other events that led up to that, that could have been a very nice time.</span> <span id="s485">But you know, that sort of thing lingering in the back of your mind, I tried to make the most of it.</span> <span id="s486">And everybody was trying to look for a way to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: When you say busy times, you tried to make the most of it, I’m trying to get a feel for what it was like for life to begin to get back to something resembling normal.</span> <span id="s488">What -- wh-wha -- socially, what did you do?</span> <span id="s489">What -- when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, like I said, [indecipherable] there were a lot of young people coming back and I had a lot of friends, and most of my friends, by the way, ended up in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s491">[indecipherable] I was friends with.</span> <span id="s492">And they were just, I guess, for lack of a better word, trying to bide our time until we could find a way to get out, is what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So everybody was looking to leave somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Everybody was looking to, there was no -- no future there.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Were there -- were those pretty much the choices, or were -- me-meaning the U.S. or Israel.</span> <span id="s496">Were people looking to go to Australia or other parts of the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Some people did, it depends, you know, where you had connections, or where your interests were.</span> <span id="s498">Or whether -- where your luck was, really, to get you wherever you wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Did you have -- let me ask you about friends of yours, or extended relatives.</span> <span id="s500">I think you’ve pretty much told me about your extended relatives and what happened to them, but did you have friends that died?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh yeah, quite a few didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s502">Yes, and some who even died before because they were taken to labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Close friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So you got to Paris, train?</span> <span id="s506">From Hungary to Paris, did you take a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And where did you stay when you were there?</span> <span id="s509">You said eight weeks to wait for your papers to come through and to get a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, see, what happened is my father took me to Budapest, put me on the train and then before the train left, he went around and see if he could find somebody who was going the same way as I was.</span> <span id="s511">And sure enough, he did find a young lady, somewhat older than myself at that time, who not only was coming to Paris, but also was going to the United States of America.</span> <span id="s512">Not only to the States, but going to the same city that I was going to and to the same neighborhood where I was going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Detroit, Michigan, yes.</span> <span id="s515">To the same area where my family lived, and so we became sort of fast friends and he -- she took care of me.</span> <span id="s516">I stayed with her in the same hotel while we were in Paris and he -- she left a few weeks before I did.</span> <span id="s517">But she had a nephew over there who was a concert violinist and he’s been living in Paris for some time by then.</span> <span id="s518">So she put him in charge of me, so to speak.</span> <span id="s519">So I was well taken care of until I got on the ship and my family took me off in the city of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What was it like -- where -- on the ship coming over, were there other Jews that were coming -- immigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: There were a lot of Jewish people coming, yes.</span> <span id="s522">Some were going to Cuba, some to the United States and some Mexico and they were going all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Do you remember at all how you felt -- I me -- that was th-that trip, about how long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: About five days, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Were you fearful, anxious, excited?</span> <span id="s526">How were you -- do you remember at all what -- what it was like?</span> <span id="s527">I mean, you di -- here, you’ve left your entire family behind, this whole horrible experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: But see, I left my family behind in the hope that within a year’s time I would be with them also.</span> <span id="s529">So I didn’t just walk out on them.</span> <span id="s530">But I guess it wasn’t mean to be because not even a year -- before the year was up after I left, I -- they closed the borders and nobody ever left from there until 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Who closed the borders?</span> <span id="s532">Who closed --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Who closed the border?</span> <span id="s534">The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So that’s why they didn’t come to join you.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s537">That’s why they couldn’t leave, when every -- everything stopped.</span> <span id="s538">And by 1956, my parents became ill, my father had a couple of heart attacks.</span> <span id="s539">My mother came down with th-the Parkinson disease and there was no way for them to leave.</span> <span id="s540">And this is why my youngest sister left home -- I mean, stayed home in 1956, because the other two were already married, and she was still single, being the youngest.</span> <span id="s541">She was just a young girl.</span> <span id="s542">When I came out here, I remember I used to send her money to take dance classes and I used to send -- I sent her money to buy a bicycle when I started to work.</span> <span id="s543">And she was the victim of it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And she stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: She stayed there and she’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: In -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: That’s 1997, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: In -- in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: In the same town, yes.</span> <span id="s550">My parents are gone and she’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Do you have any other extended family that still live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Cousins, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: No, I had two -- I had three cousins who came back from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s555">See, my mother’s whole family ended up in Auschwitz, I had four aunts -- five.</span> <span id="s556">One, two -- four -- four aunts and an uncle who all perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s557">And some younger cousins who were just small children, and the three who survived were, you know, young adults, and they made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So these were all siblings of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yeah, from my mother’s side, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Do you remember at all how she came to learn that and what that was like for her to learn wa -- that all -- was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: -- all of her siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: -- to see -- my cousins, all three of them were home long before we got home because Auschwitz was liberated in January and we didn’t get home til April.</span> <span id="s564">And they came to see us and that’s how we found out what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Was that all of her siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Mm-hm, except the two sisters [indecipherable] she had here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Do you remember what that was like, her -- I mean, how she dealt with learning that?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: That was hard.</span> <span id="s569">That was hard, but there was no other thing to do but deal with it.</span> <span id="s570">You know, there is an interesting thing that I remember, when they were taking the people, the first transport from Hungary to Auschwitz and there was -- my mother’s family were among the group, and I remember my mother walk up [indecipherable] and said, I had a terrible dream.</span> <span id="s571">She had a dream seeing the family walking down the road and there were two rows of candles on each side of them, lit, as they were walking down the road.</span> <span id="s572">Now by the time we got home it was more or less a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: How did you fi -- di -- I mean, how did you feel about this?</span> <span id="s574">Did you -- I mean, did your family grieve, did -- did you grieve, did you -- was there time for grieving?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: There was really no time to grieve like you do nowadays when somebody dies.</span> <span id="s576">You had to keep alive.</span> <span id="s577">You were alive, you had to go on.</span> <span id="s578">But I think you never really stop grieving.</span> <span id="s579">That’s also just part of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: You came to New York on the ship.</span> <span id="s581">Do you remember what it was like the first time you saw New York, the first time you saw America?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: It was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s585">I’ve never seen such big buildings in my life.</span> <span id="s586">Oops.</span> <span id="s587">It was exciting, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s588">I think I must have felt like Alice in Wonderland when I got off the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Were you emotional, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: I don’t know, I’m a very emotional person so I guess I -- that was just exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: This may be a kind of a cliché, but I’ve spoken to other people who have made that trip who were very affected by the Statue of Liberty and you know, all of that and I was wondering if that had any impact at all or was it just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I guess, the fact, it probably did.</span> <span id="s593">I remember -- oops -- oh, I have to go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: On the way to -- from Paris to the ship, you know you take a little boat that carries you out there to the sea.</span> <span id="s596">And there was a couple, an older couple sitting across from me and there I was sitting all by myself with a little book of English and Hungarian translation and I tried to read and brush up of whatever English I knew.</span> <span id="s597">And they were trying to find out who I was and what does a young girl do on a boat like this all by herself and where I came from and where I’m going and they tried to talk to me and up until that point I thought I could speak English.</span> <span id="s598">Well, when I heard them talk, forget it.</span> <span id="s599">I didn’t understand almost [indecipherable] what they’re saying.</span> <span id="s600">So I found out eventually that they were from Brooklyn visiting Europe and coming back from Europe and they were very sweet people, they took me under their arm.</span> <span id="s601">When they found out I was from Hungary, they went all over the boat searching for a person, another person from Hungary I can be with through the trip so I won’t be lost.</span> <span id="s602">As it happened there were quite a few Hungarians there, Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s603">And the person they found for me to be with and eat, you know, the meals with, was a non-Jewish person, a guy from Cleveland, of all places, who took his wife to Hungary because she was sick and took her there for some kind of treatment and he was coming back to the States.</span> <span id="s604">And when we got to New York, this lady from Brooklyn grabbed my arm and pulled me out to the, you know, end of the wherever there was in the boat.</span> <span id="s605">They says, hey look, look, that’s the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s606">So that was my introduction to the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Let me just move that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s608">Did you -- let’s see, how can I phrase this question?</span> <span id="s609">Given what you had just been through in Europe, was it difficult for you to be around non-Jewish people, period?</span> <span id="s610">Were you afraid of them, were you concerned?</span> <span id="s611">I guess what I’m trying to ask you is --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No.</span> <span id="s615">Do you mind if I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: No, not at -- not at all, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel.</span> <span id="s619">This is tape number two, side A. I was just asking you, cause I’ve heard from -- from other survivors who felt very leery to be around Gentiles when they -- when the war was over because they had been turned on by all the Gentiles in their life prior to that and -- and so they had a hard time trusting that it wouldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s620">And so that’s why I asked the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, I don’t know, maybe I’m different, but I never really had too many chances to be with Gentiles, because when we got to Paris, I had some friends already there from home whom I met, they were all Jewish people, young -- young people.</span> <span id="s622">So I had no reason to get friendly or get close to any of the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s623">And when I got to the United States my family didn’t -- weren’t friends with any Gentiles.</span> <span id="s624">So again, I didn’t have a chance to meet any.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Your family met you when the boat came in in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Now refresh my memory, did you -- you had -- did you have relatives there in New York or is everybody in Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No, they came from Detroit.</span> <span id="s629">I did have a relative from New York, it’s a cousin of my mother whom my aunt and uncle took me to visit, and they lived on Park Avenue someplace in a huge apartment with a beautiful, big, brown dog.</span> <span id="s630">And they were very lovely people.</span> <span id="s631">They were very impressed the way I looked, coming from where I came from, and that was that.</span> <span id="s632">I never saw them again after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Was it at all emotional, your family that you’d never met, I’m assuming --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: No, not too --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: -- coming to meet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Emotionally what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Well, for some other people, coming over here and meeting up with relatives was a big deal for them, for both sides.</span> <span id="s638">For the -- for the -- the American relatives, do you know, to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: [indecipherable] with my -- my aunt and my uncle, yes it was a little bit emotional, but with the cousins, these were already second, third generation Americans.</span> <span id="s640">They [indecipherable] They lived their life and that was a lot of story.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: You said second or third generation Americans, who -- who would have c -- who of your ancestors would have come over that long before?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well my -- oh well, before the tur -- way before the turn of the cen -- middle of the last century --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: -- they were coming over here, the uncles of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s646">So in addition to your --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: A-Aunts and uncles and --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: So you had quite a few relatives here, not just your mother’s sisters.</span> <span id="s649">Okay.</span> <span id="s650">How d -- did you spend much time in New York, or -- or did you go directly with them on to Michigan?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No, not a whole lot, because they had to come back.</span> <span id="s652">See, I arrived here in March and at that time I think the tax time was in March in those days, if I remember right.</span> <span id="s653">Also, my -- one of my cousins, my aunt’s daughter who picked me up had her birthday in March, so they had to come home, you know, for those reasons.</span> <span id="s654">But we drove -- they drove into New York, so we drove back and we stopped on the way in Scranton, Pennsylvania to visit another cousin of my parents, lovely, lovely people.</span> <span id="s655">And then we came home, or we came to Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Now they obviously spoke Hungarian, your --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: They obviously spoke Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: -- your -- your aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Oh yes, they still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: And the -- the men that they married, were they Americans, were they Hungarians as well, the -- were they married?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Oh yes, they all had families.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And where had -- where did these men come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Where did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Your uncles, where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: They were also Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Okay, cause I was wondering about you -- the language problem.</span> <span id="s669">You had poor English, you’ve already told us, when you went over -- when you came here, and I was wondering what it was like for you to start to --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: It’s not so much that I had poor English, because I -- I did take English lessons and I wrote -- as far as writing, I wrote very nice letters.</span> <span id="s671">My family in Detroit couldn’t wait for me to get here.</span> <span id="s672">But also, I am a rather -- well, what’s the word that I want to use?</span> <span id="s673">Bashful?</span> <span id="s674">And I don’t like to be laughed at.</span> <span id="s675">And so I tried when I got here, but then a few of -- little teasing and I clammed up.</span> <span id="s676">And I spoke no English until I met my husband-to-be.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: I don’t think that’s an unusual thing.</span> <span id="s678">My mother has told me similar things, that until she learned English well, she was uncomfortable speaking it, just for that very reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: But then you can’t learn it well unless you start talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s681">It’s a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: So, when you got to Detroit -- you were how old by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I was 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: 20.</span> <span id="s686">What -- what did you do?</span> <span id="s687">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, six weeks after I was here I went to work, they found me a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: At a tailor shop.</span> <span id="s691">Men’s -- it was a men’s shop, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And you were d-doing alterations, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And you lived with them, with your -- were there cousins your age, or similar, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, close to my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Younger, older?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: [indecipherable] not exactly my age, but you know [indecipherable] here and there, and most of them were younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Did you -- tell me about your first experiences with -- dealing with Americans other than your -- your family, who were immigrants as well, like -- like the people at the tailor shop were -- how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: They were actually very nice people and there was a very nice lady, a nice Polish lady who worked there also.</span> <span id="s700">And she was as sweet as can be.</span> <span id="s701">I guess I’m -- I’m really lucky because I fel -- I -- I met very few nasty people on the road.</span> <span id="s702">Eventually I -- I did find some of the younger American girls, the so-called -- well, I don’t want to say the American princess, but you know, that -- those type of girls.</span> <span id="s703">They had no patience for me.</span> <span id="s704">I couldn’t speak their language, so that was -- you know, but that was fine, I really didn’t need them because there were a lot of people like myself in Detroit at the time and we had a nice group of people we were friends with.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: When you say like yourself, other immigrants, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s707">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Did you develop friendships with native born people?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Mm, not right away.</span> <span id="s710">Well, maybe one couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And how would you get to know people with these -- did you -- did you go to synagogue here?</span> <span id="s712">Were they people in -- in the -- that lived in the neighborhood, were th -- with work?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, over there in those days -- well, through the families.</span> <span id="s714">See, most of the Hungarian families, you know, they all had somebody who survived and coming over.</span> <span id="s715">So that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s716">And then there was the Jewish center in Detroit, that was the center point of going to school over there and meeting people.</span> <span id="s717">They just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: You said going to school, did you pursue school?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Well, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well not -- I went -- at the beginning I went to the Jewish Center to take some English classes and then I met my husband, then that was -- you know, life became a whole different thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: How did you -- how did you meet and when did you meet?</span> <span id="s723">How long were you here before you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Well, I came in March and I met him, I think, a few months later at the Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s725">He came in to say hello to the teacher and then he looked around the class and he -- when the class was over he was outside of the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: He was outside the door, and?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: And was -- you know, we -- he walked me home after that and he -- we started to see each other and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: How long did you court?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Well, we met in -- let’s see, maybe in April, May, and we got married in February next year, following year.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: In Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Now he had also an aunt or uncle here, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: He had one aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: That’s what I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: That’s the only relative that he has.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: That -- that made it.</span> <span id="s739">That’s what I thought.</span> <span id="s740">Did you, during the time that you were courting, talk much about your respective experiences in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Some.</span> <span id="s742">Probably not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Well, what I mean is, we were mostly trying to look ahead, not back, if it makes any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Mm, I understand that, but you said probably not enough, the implication being that there should have been more.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: That ch -- maybe, but I don’t think at that time he could have taken any more of it.</span> <span id="s747">There had to be a time to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s748">We needed time to sort of settle down and live.</span> <span id="s749">Look at life instead of that.</span> <span id="s750">Eventually it came true and now we’re at the point where we almost talk about nothing else but.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s752">That seems to be a very consistent experience of people, that there was a -- a period of time, sometimes a very long period of time where it was not comfortable to talk about it amongst themselves, or with others.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: It’s not so much that it wasn’t ca -- well, first of all -- let me just go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s754">I know when I came out here I had the grandiose notion, you know, that everybody wants to hear my story so I’ll be going around and talking about it.</span> <span id="s755">Nobody want to hear the story, come on.</span> <span id="s756">We were kidding ourselves.</span> <span id="s757">Even my own family, who lost so many members, close family, you try to talk to them, they would change the subject.</span> <span id="s758">They couldn’t.</span> <span id="s759">They couldn’t bear listening to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: But you tried?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So it sounds like --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: So then you just gave up.</span> <span id="s764">I mean, there was no sense of talking because nobody -- first of all, nobody could really understand what we went through.</span> <span id="s765">We could tell them from morning til night and from night til morning and still talk and nobody can understand it.</span> <span id="s766">It’s -- it’s -- those things that happened to us, it’s -- it’s like a horror story, it’s -- in your wildest imagination you couldn’t conceive it and picture it, no less understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So, because they couldn’t conceptualize it, there was little point in discussing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Plus in the case of your -- your aunts and uncles, they had lost family, so there was, in addition to the lack of empathy for what you’d been through, there was also that -- the -- the pain and the grief of having lost the family.</span> <span id="s770">What about -- did you know other -- other than your husband, before you met your husband, did you know other survivors that were there in Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Did you ever talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: What could it be like?</span> <span id="s776">You just listen.</span> <span id="s777">Most of the people I met in Detroit, they all came from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s778">So you know, all I could say is my God, how lucky I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: This is, you know, I mean no disrespect to ask this, but did you ever feel guilty that you were as lucky as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s781">I don’t think I had or have any reason to feel guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: No, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: I just -- what they say, the luck of the draw.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: There’s no reason you should feel guilty, I just -- there are some people who do feel that.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, I heard that mentioned many times before [indecipherable] but no, I -- I mean, it never even came to my mind that I need to feel guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Was it -- do you remember the first time that you spoke to another survivor who had been in Auschwitz or any of the other death camps, and actually heard from their lips what happened?</span> <span id="s787">[phone ringing] Let’s wait til it’s finished ringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah, well, the first ones I heard from, what happened in [indecipherable] my cousins who came back, you know, we met them after we got back home to Debrecen and they came to see us.</span> <span id="s789">So by that time, you know, by the time I came here I -- I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Well, let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: It wasn’t all together, you know, new to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: But -- well then, let me ask you, when your cousins came back to Debrecen and you first heard about it then, do you remember what it was like to -- to hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: That was such a long time ago that really -- I really can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: -- I really can’t remember what I felt.</span> <span id="s796">I’m sure that it must have been awful, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s798">I just thought I would ask.</span> <span id="s799">Let’s talk about you and your husband.</span> <span id="s800">So you met.</span> <span id="s801">Do you remember at all the first time that you two talked about your experiences, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I couldn't believe -- well, first of all he’s got something against the Hungarians to begin with, but you have to know him, too.</span> <span id="s805">See, he was in Auschwitz for two and a half years by the time the Hungarian Jews arrived, and he couldn’t understand how come that we didn’t know anything about it, what was going on.</span> <span id="s806">And they didn’t run the other way, instead they ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s807">So that -- and I think in some ways -- in some ways I think he held it against me that I was free that much longer, while he was already in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: You know, when I first read yours and your husband’s stories in the transcripts that they sent me, I was struck by the disparity of your experiences, what he -- he went through and what you went through</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Oh yeah, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: And wondered whether over the years that’s been at all problematic for the two of you to have such different experiences, and w -- and whether it’s g -- that’s caused --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: -- any problems or --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No [indecipherable] I mean, eventually he understand that it was not my fault, and I had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s814">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: I don’t know if you can answer this, but because it was such a short period of time after you came to this country that you met your husband, maybe this is not a -- a question you can even answer, but I guess what I’m wondering is whether it’s -- whether you could imagine being married to someone who hadn’t had this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s817">I probably could have.</span> <span id="s818">I don’t think -- can imagine why I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: I was just wondering whether -- I mean, certainly I know people in my own life whose -- who are my age whose parents -- where one of them was a survivor and one of them was not.</span> <span id="s820">So obviously it happened, but that’s -- I’m just wondering in your life whether that was something -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s an academic question cause you did meet and you did marry, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: And that -- and that -- that was it.</span> <span id="s824">Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s825">I wonder sometime, actually, what would have been like to live with somebody who didn’t experience what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What has it been like for you because his -- h-he went through so much.</span> <span id="s827">Not that you didn’t, but what has it been like as his wife to -- to deal with his experiences secondhand over the past 50-odd years, 50 years or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Well, at times it hasn’t been all that easy, but we managed, we got through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: When you say not easy, in what way not easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well, because of his, I guess because of his personality and because -- oops -- what all those years, you know, did to him and the way he [indecipherable] may have changed his personality and what he could have been like.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did you have any -- when did you have your first child?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: 11 months after we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did you ever have any conversations, was there ever any question in your minds that you would have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No, not really, that was just the way it’s supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Well, the reason I ask is I’ve heard two different things from people.</span> <span id="s836">Number one, pondering the now cliché question of do I want to bring children into this world, knowing what I know about what is possible.</span> <span id="s837">And the flip side of that which is I want to have as many children as I can to repopulate the world.</span> <span id="s838">So that’s why I asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Well, see, in those days they didn’t have the birth control pills.</span> <span id="s840">I missed out on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And you have how many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: And where did they come -- how long -- I mean, how far apart are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s845">1949 through 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: And how f -- what are their names, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Well, there’s four, almost five years between the first two, and then the third one came 16 months later and the fourth one came seven years after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: And what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Howard, Caryn with a C, C-a-r-y-n and in the time I picked th-that name my friend really thought I was crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Because that was a different spelling of -- of Caryn.</span> <span id="s854">And today it’s all over, but for years I haven’t seen it.</span> <span id="s855">But anyway, and the next one is Linda, and the younger -- the youngest is Elaine.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: She’s the one born in ’61?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: ’61.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: When do you recall first talking to any of your children about what had happened to you and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Well, it wasn’t too long after, as soon as my son was old enough to notice things, really.</span> <span id="s860">You know, my husband has a number on his arm, which you can see in the dark, big enough.</span> <span id="s861">So, you know, children ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And how do you tell a small child about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Well, luckily my husband has a very good sense of humor, and so he’s got a way of making a joke out of most things.</span> <span id="s864">So what do you tell a four or five year old child?</span> <span id="s865">Right?</span> <span id="s866">You can’t go and tell him, cause first of all they wouldn’t understand and then, why.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: So what did he tell him?</span> <span id="s868">Or do you remember at all the gist of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Well, I remember he told him he was in jail, and he was a prisoner and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: When I was a small boy, the -- the man who cut my hair, the barber at the barbershop had been in Auschwitz and I didn’t -- of course I was -- I was the four or five year old child, and I said -- I asked him, what’s that on your arm?</span> <span id="s871">And he said, well that’s my phone -- phone number, so I don’t forget my phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah, that’s what my husband says, too.</span> <span id="s873">Not only it’s his phone number, it’s his house number.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: What about when your children were older?</span> <span id="s875">Older t -- old enough to understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Well, we told them, and they knew.</span> <span id="s877">They knew that we were a different family from all the other friends they had, because you know, we were -- there was no grandparents, there was no immediate aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s878">No cousins anywhere.</span> <span id="s879">But you know, we never made a big deal of it, so they got through it until they were old enough to understand and they began to learn in school and knew what it was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Do you remember the first time any of your children came to you asking questions in any depth and wanting you to talk about it?</span> <span id="s881">Maybe after reading -- seeing something in school or hearing something, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I think we just sort of, as we went along, you know, as they grew older we told them a little more.</span> <span id="s883">So it was a gradual process.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Was it something that you and your husband at all talked about between yourselves, about you know, was their any conscious thought about how to tell them or what to tell them or what not to tell them, or was it just sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s886">I mean, like I said, we just, as they grew older and that, we just went along with whatever they were coming up with.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: How is it that you came to leave Detroit?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Well, because of my husband’s job.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: I -- I know I’ll be talking to him tomorrow, but just basically what does your husband do, or what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: At the time he was working for a clothing company, who had several stores, you know, and so that’s why we ended up traveling.</span> <span id="s891">And then he hooked up with a big -- the discount outfit, one of the first discount stores in the country and we traveled some more.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Where did you go, briefly.</span> <span id="s893">How did you -- from -- from --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: From -- from [indecipherable] we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: -- from Detroit to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: -- and I went to Grand Rapids first -- Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan.</span> <span id="s897">From there we went to Binghamton, New York.</span> <span id="s898">And then we went -- from there we went back to Detroit again.</span> <span id="s899">That was with the discount corporation, and that’s how we ended up in Indianapolis and he became a district manager and they moved us to Indiana [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s900">That was three years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: 30 years ago, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: So you -- were your children born in different cities along the way, or were --</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Actually, all four of them were born in Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: You were there that long?</span> <span id="s906">Oh yeah, so 30 years ago, that -- so you --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Well, we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Right, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: [indecipherable] when the first three were born in Detroit now, the two of them in Highland Park and the third one was born in the city of Detroit.</span> <span id="s910">And then when the last one came about, we went -- we were back in Michigan again.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Hold on one second.</span> <span id="s912">So you came here, it’s 30 years you said, ’67.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: To Indian --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: -- Indiana?</span> <span id="s916">Indianapolis?</span> <span id="s917">Actually, we -- let me see, we came to Michigan City in 1964, and we were there five years, and then from there we came to Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s918">So we’ve been in Indiana for over 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: When -- okay, I’m gonna -- I want to come back to these questions, there’s some questions, the things that I mailed to you that they specifically want me to ask, and then I have questions that I’ve come up with on my own --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Well, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: -- just in the past day or so, having given this some thought.</span> <span id="s922">Hold on for a second.</span> <span id="s923">We talked about that.</span> <span id="s924">One of the questions -- I’m going now with things that they wanted me to ask you, what -- after having had such a horrible experience, what -- what strength did you draw on to -- to go on, to -- to make a fa -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Three minutes, four minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Take your time.</span> <span id="s928">Take as much time as you want.</span> <span id="s929">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel.</span> <span id="s930">This is tape number two, side B. -- asked -- that you’ll be asked to do.</span> <span id="s931">I was asking you before the -- the tape -- the last tape ended about what -- what -- what has helped you to -- to cope, to -- with the memories, with the -- the grief, with the -- has your faith been helpful or -- or was that something that you struggled with when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: You mean religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, I had no problem with that.</span> <span id="s935">The strength -- oh well, once we had a family and we had children, there were no question, I mean you had to go forward, that was that.</span> <span id="s936">The children were our strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: You said religion was not a problem.</span> <span id="s938">What did you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: I -- I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s940">I was born one and I always will be.</span> <span id="s941">I’m not overly religious.</span> <span id="s942">I keep a Jewish home, I raise my kids in the tradition, or I try to.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Let me rephrase the question.</span> <span id="s944">I guess some people would say that there’s a -- can be a difference between the -- the rituals of being an observant Jew in terms of ke-keeping kosher and high holidays and g-going to temple, and -- and having some sort of relationship with -- with a God, meaning -- how can I pose the question?</span> <span id="s945">I guess it’s a -- the classic question that many people have coped with over the past 50 years since th-the Holocaust, is -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Where is God?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And how could God have let this happen and all of that.</span> <span id="s948">And I’m wondering if you ever had, at any point in your life, pondered any of that, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Sometime.</span> <span id="s950">Sometime, yes.</span> <span id="s951">And I think I -- I ask where’s God after the war when my parents were so sick, when my mother suffered so much, I think that was the time when I asked where is God, why did she deserve what she got?</span> <span id="s952">After what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Did you come to any conclusions?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No.</span> <span id="s955">There is really no conclusion.</span> <span id="s956">You don’t know why.</span> <span id="s957">Things just happen.</span> <span id="s958">When we started out our life together, I kept kosher.</span> <span id="s959">I had Friday nights traditional.</span> <span id="s960">Even my own family in Detroit didn’t believe it, after what I came from, that I would do something like that.</span> <span id="s961">Howe -- my husband couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s962">My son was Bar Mitzvah because I dragged him to his classes, literally by his ear.</span> <span id="s963">And my husband kept telling me, don’t bother, he doesn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s964">I said yes, he have to do it, because that’s what he is and he have to do it.</span> <span id="s965">And so he did.</span> <span id="s966">And after we left Detroit, I don’t know, I -- there were places we lived where it wasn’t easy to keep kosher.</span> <span id="s967">There were no kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s968">So I bought the meat in the supermarket and I koshered it.</span> <span id="s969">Took it to a man who koshered.</span> <span id="s970">And gradually I did away with that, too.</span> <span id="s971">Not to the point that I ever -- to this day I don’t eat pork, and I don’t bring it in the house.</span> <span id="s972">I don’t even eat it out.</span> <span id="s973">Now today I have the four kids.</span> <span id="s974">My son has nothing to do with religion.</span> <span id="s975">My daughter lives here in town, he marry -- she married a Catholic guy who turned Jewish and today he is more religious than the rabbi, to the point where they don’t even answer the telephone from Friday night until Sunday evening when the Shabbas is over.</span> <span id="s976">So there.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And which daughter is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Which daughter is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: That’s the first one, my oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: That is the oldest of the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And then the other two daughters, what happened with --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Now, the one in New York is not married, and the youngest one is also married, a Swiss guy who is not Jewish, so -- but they did go to a Seder in Switzerland and he enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s985">And she does the traditional things for the holidays, you know, she bakes the hamantashen and the -- whatever.</span> <span id="s986">It comes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: And your single daughter in New York, does she -- is she observant at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Not too.</span> <span id="s989">She comes home for the holidays most of the time, depending how it falls, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: I’ll obviously be talking to your husband in more depth about this tomorrow, but was he -- you say he -- he wasn’t very su-sup-supportive, or maybe that’s not the right word, of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: No, that’s the right word.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: [indecipherable] he wanted to do nothing with religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Did he humor you?</span> <span id="s995">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Oh, he went along with it because I wanted to do it, but you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Did he join in?</span> <span id="s998">Did he do his part in the rituals, and -- or did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Mm, sort of.</span> <span id="s1000">Now he’s beginning to get into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1002">What about -- I’m still staying with the thread of things that have made your life meaningful since the war, and it’s -- this, the largest portion of your life, the -- the past 50 years.</span> <span id="s1003">I g -- I gather you’ve retained interest in the arts.</span> <span id="s1004">I know when you were a girl you were -- I -- I gather you’re still doing it, painting ceramics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I’m doing it again now.</span> <span id="s1006">Th-The -- these kind of paintings pulled me through between having babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Tell me about this -- your th -- your -- this passion, hobby, avocation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Ah, no, it -- well, I guess you can call it both.</span> <span id="s1009">Actually, this goes way back when I was a teenager back home.</span> <span id="s1010">See, in those days in Europe, this was a beautiful profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Why don’t you -- why don’t -- because this is an audio interview, let’s describe what this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: This is what they call a porcelain painting.</span> <span id="s1013">Porcelain art is what it is.</span> <span id="s1014">And in those days before the second World War, this was a beautiful profession.</span> <span id="s1015">And my family had a very good friend who did that, and then when -- when I became a teenager, I took lessons, not from the family friend, but from another young woman, who did some beautiful, beautiful work.</span> <span id="s1016">And it was just in the early 40’s, so we really didn’t have much time, but we were hoping, before we knew what was going to happen to us, that someday we gonna come to the United States and bring our beautiful painted porcelain.</span> <span id="s1017">Well, it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1018">Somebody else [indecipherable] otherwise.</span> <span id="s1019">So then when I came to this country -- see, if I would have ended up -- if my family would have lived in Syracuse, New York, you know, I could have been painting china for 50 years.</span> <span id="s1020">But since they lived in Detroit, there was no need for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1022">Why would Syracuse have been different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Because, I believe in Syracuse, New York, isn’t that the home of the Syracuse China Company, whatever?</span> <span id="s1024">Anyway, so -- a-and then I find out, after I was married already, that they’re giving -- they had a very good system in the schools in those days in Europe, as far as adult classes were going, and I found out there was one of these, and I went.</span> <span id="s1025">And I took some classes over there, and in between kids, you know, when I couldn’t go out of the house all day long and he would come home and watch the kids and I would go to class.</span> <span id="s1026">And I did it.</span> <span id="s1027">And then I worked at it when we lived in Flint and I did it when we lived in Michigan City.</span> <span id="s1028">And then when we moved to Indianapolis I couldn’t find anybody to work with and so I hadn’t done anything for years until about three years ago, when I met somebody by accident, and so I’m at it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: What other -- are there other arts that you are attracted to, or get joy out of or -- either doing or observing, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Well, there’s a lot of things I can do, you wouldn’t really call it arts, but yeah, I tried stained window -- stained glass.</span> <span id="s1031">But then the woman I was working with moved away from town and so that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: What other things do you enjoy doing -- that bring you joy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: I enjoy reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Fiction, non-fiction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Both.</span> <span id="s1036">History.</span> <span id="s1037">Think it’s an interesting subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Have you had other classes other than your porcelain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1041">What about any more passive things, concerts, I don’t know, opera, ballet, movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Oh yeah, I -- I worked for a ballet school for 22 years, I just retired --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: -- end of May.</span> <span id="s1045">I was running the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So you did that after your kids were grown, or did you start to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Well actually, I got into it because of my youngest daughter, believe it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: She -- well, she was a very cute, dainty little girl when she was small and I took her to ballet classes.</span> <span id="s1050">I started her actually in Michigan City and then -- for two reasons I did that with her, because she was also a very shy child and I figured that will be good and you know, bring her out a little.</span> <span id="s1051">And the older kids took wer -- when we were in Michigan City were in the children’s theater group, and they did great over there.</span> <span id="s1052">And -- but she was too young for that yet, the little one.</span> <span id="s1053">And then when we moved to Indianapolis I -- one summer there was nothing to do for her.</span> <span id="s1054">And so I called up and I took her to the Butler University ballet classes and she got hooked.</span> <span id="s1055">She wanted to be a ballerina.</span> <span id="s1056">And that’s how I got in there and now she left and I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Has she continued to dance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: She did for awhile, but then she had problem with her back and then she [indecipherable] so she stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Politics.</span> <span id="s1060">Once you came to this country, did you get involved at all with de -- politics, domestically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1062">Just on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: On the side meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I’m in -- actively involved in politics?</span> <span id="s1065">No.</span> <span id="s1066">Am I going out campaigning, and that sort of things?</span> <span id="s1067">No.</span> <span id="s1068">Well, first of all, I didn’t have time for it, it takes time and I had four kids to take care of, so you know, there was nobody else but me for them, so that was out of the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Five years to the day I arrived here, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1073">It was an -- an unspeakable feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Well, just imagine yourself being thrown out of one country and taken into another and you become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1076">On the other hand, there is always that little, small voice, you know, in the back of your head, what if it will happen here too?</span> <span id="s1077">So this is why I think when I -- I raise my kids, all I wanted them to do is whatever they do, to be independent enough so wherever life will take them, they will be able to land on their two feet, because you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: I want to talk about all three of those things, but back to your citize -- becoming a citizen.</span> <span id="s1079">It obviously was a -- a big deal to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: It said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: It still is and I take it seriously, not like some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: It’s funny, it seems like, my mother included, all the -- the people that I know that emigrated here are more patriotic, for lack of a better word, than most of the native born people I know.</span> <span id="s1084">Perhaps precisely because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Because we know what it is.</span> <span id="s1086">We know what it’s worth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did you ever, back when you were in Europe deciding what to do after the war, was there a time where you were really seriously considering going to Israel because your father’s family was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yeah, I was, because most of my friends were there.</span> <span id="s1089">And there was, you know, we needed a country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Have you ever in the interim regretted that decision to come here rather than going there or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s1092">No, no, I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: You mentioned -- kind of going all over the place here, chronologically, but you mentioned earlier about when you were in Europe listening to the radio and waiting for Roosevelt to come and help and it never happened.</span> <span id="s1094">Did that in any way lessen your, I don’t know, appreciation for this country, to know that they had abandoned their -- I don’t know how to, what to call it, their duties, their -- that they had not behaved better toward the European Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Not lessened.</span> <span id="s1096">I was probably a little bit disappointed that a big, powerful country couldn’t do more.</span> <span id="s1097">But then, you know, as you live here, you learn about the country, you learn about political procedure, so to speak and you can almost understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: How were you treated -- yo-you mentioned in passing about the -- y-you didn’t want to call them princesses, but there were some American born, presumably Jewish women that you were encountering that were less than welcoming to you, presumably because you -- you had an accent and your English wasn’t to -- to their mind --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Some still are, that’s really -- you know, people are very interesting.</span> <span id="s1100">See, I -- I did a lot of phone work, I mean answering the phone at work over there.</span> <span id="s1101">And it’s interesting how people react when they hear something different.</span> <span id="s1102">So I sort of got used to it.</span> <span id="s1103">You know, at first it was bothering me a little bit, but now I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1104">You don’t like it, that’s your problem.</span> <span id="s1105">You know when I would answer the phone and on the other end I hear, oh, did I detect an accent?</span> <span id="s1106">I said, no, you hear one.</span> <span id="s1107">Or I would say, you know, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1108">And then they wanted to know if I was from Germany, or from France, or wherever, you know.</span> <span id="s1109">And then some people I would try to answer something, they said, I don’t understand you.</span> <span id="s1110">I don’t know what you’re talking about.</span> <span id="s1111">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Did you ever feel -- a-a-and if so, how -- ill treated by other American born Jews here that you, you know, we -- espe -- like let’s say you moved to a new town, in your various moves, you know, to Flint and Michigan City --</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: -- and Syracuse, or wherever you were at, and here.</span> <span id="s1115">How were you received by the -- the Jewish communities in the places that you went, as -- as immigrants, as survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: [indecipherable] but it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1117">We made friends everywhere we went.</span> <span id="s1118">It -- it -- it depends, it’s so different, you know, the kind of people you meet, in general.</span> <span id="s1119">Some are nice, and curious and want to get to know you, some, don’t bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Do you recall any incidents in any of the places that you lived, ag-again getting back to how people, you know, would come to find out -- I mean, obviously your -- your husband has the tattoo.</span> <span id="s1121">Did you have any memorable encounters with people, I don’t know, neighbors, the grocery store --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: No, not that kind, but I had through my children, where we lived in Cleveland for a short time and my son went to school there.</span> <span id="s1123">And th -- he had a fight with a kid behind him who called him -- I was going to say a dirty Jew, but no, it was something else, but there was a Jew in it.</span> <span id="s1124">They got into a fight for something.</span> <span id="s1125">That was in Cleveland and then when we lived in Delaware, Newark, Delaware, we lived in a very nice, almost new subdivision over there and there was another family somewhere not too far from our house whose -- the father was an army officer and they had two or three kids and one was as old as my son and they were good friends.</span> <span id="s1126">And there was a little boy who was my Caryn’s age, the one who lives here in town now, and -- and she had an incident with the kid.</span> <span id="s1127">She came home one day and she says to me, Mommy, you know what -- I don’t remember his name any more -- what he told me on the way to school?</span> <span id="s1128">I said, what did he say?</span> <span id="s1129">She said, he told me that it’s too bad I wasn’t in Germany during the war because then Hitler could have killed me too.</span> <span id="s1130">And then another day when the -- after that, sometime after that, the afternoon when they come home from school, three comes my daughter with a, you know, stack of books in her hand, with a smile from ear to ear.</span> <span id="s1131">I said, what happened?</span> <span id="s1132">She said well -- and says, that boy was bothering me again, was starting again being a Jew and this and that and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1133">And she says to me, I couldn’t listen to it any more, so I picked up my books and I hit him on the head with it.</span> <span id="s1134">I said, good for you.</span> <span id="s1135">And that’s from the same family, two boys from the same family.</span> <span id="s1136">So how do you -- how do you figure, how do you account for that?</span> <span id="s1137">And the older boy would come to my house and play with my son, and then the other one was hassling my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: What about not so much anti-Semitic incidents, but you know, moving to a new neighborhood, cause you moved so much, and you know, people asking you about your survivor experiences, or it coming up in conversation or it -- neighbors --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: It’s interesting, for the most -- most people w-wanted -- they couldn’t hear enough about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Meaning they asked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1142">Sometime I think more so than the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: I don’t know why it is, but I noticed it, was -- I don’t know why, but -- but the Gentiles want to hear more about it than our own people, even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Was there a time when you were reticent to talk about it if someone asked you and would -- would th -- was there a time when you would be less than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Well, that depends who you talk to.</span> <span id="s1147">You know, there was some people you wouldn’t want to say anything.</span> <span id="s1148">There were others who you feel that they genuinely interested, so you don’t mind talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: I guess I was thinking more in terms of was there a time in your life where you or your husband were making a conscious effort to put it behind you and not talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: W-We were, probably the first maybe 15 - 20 years of our marriage, we just -- just didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Well, that -- that answers my question.</span> <span id="s1152">That’s a large period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1154">We just didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: What changed after 15 - 20 years, what -- was there anything that spurred you on to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: I think people began to read more and began to hear more.</span> <span id="s1157">When the television came about, there were more things that came out into the open, and people became interested.</span> <span id="s1158">And then -- see, when my older kids went through high school, all through school, even here in Indianap -- in -- in Indianapolis from ’69 on, never a word was mentioned in school about it.</span> <span id="s1159">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1160">In the early 70’s when they started to teach in the Sunday schools, and that’s when they were start -- beginning to look for survivors to come and -- and speak.</span> <span id="s1161">But up until then there was really nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: What was your first experience -- let me just check how we’re doing here, I think the tape is ending, hol -- [tape break] What was your first experience doing any sort of public speaking about your experiences?</span> <span id="s1163">Was this your -- being invited to your children’s school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: I think the first time it was I was asked, it was here in Indianapolis already.</span> <span id="s1165">I was asked to go to IHC, the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation where we belong, to talk to a Sunday school class, and before I got there, or before I was to speak, they were showing the film then -- oh God, I can’t remember the title of it.</span> <span id="s1166">All I know is the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: “Night and Fog?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: “Night and Fog?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1172">And it was the first time I really saw pictures of that kind.</span> <span id="s1173">And I was so shaken by it, was the word I think, that I almost couldn’t do my speaking.</span> <span id="s1174">And then the other one when I was a little bit more composed, when my youngest daughter was in junior high and she was in an accelerated class and th-the wonderful social studies teacher, and they were reading the Anne Frank story and also some other stuff related to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1175">And in one of those classes, the teacher asked the class if anybody knows anyone who was in a camp.</span> <span id="s1176">And our little one put her hand up and said yeah, my parents were there.</span> <span id="s1177">So the teacher wanted to know, so do you think your mother would come in and talk to us?</span> <span id="s1178">So she called me and I said yeah, I’ll be glad to, sure.</span> <span id="s1179">So we set up a time and I wrote up, you know, my speech, and went [indecipherable] did my speaking.</span> <span id="s1180">And I know my daughter was very upset with me, cause she said, you sounded just like a teacher.</span> <span id="s1181">But when the bell came and the class was over, the kids wouldn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s1182">They had so many questions, they wanted to hear more.</span> <span id="s1183">And the same night the teacher called me again, would I come back and tell them some more.</span> <span id="s1184">And that was when I told my husband, I said look, I already told them what I know.</span> <span id="s1185">Maybe you ought to come and hear what the kids have to ask and you talk to them.</span> <span id="s1186">And that’s when, you know, we really started to talk about it to other than us.</span> <span id="s1187">And then, about the same time there was a -- a book that came out, “The Hoax of the 20th Century,” and he got -- my husband got very upset over that and he wrote a letter to the newspaper and he wrote a letter to Northwestern University.</span> <span id="s1188">Of course, Mr. Butz never answered, but nevertheless he wrote a -- sent him a letter.</span> <span id="s1189">And that’s when he started to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: And when would that have been, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I think it was somewhere in the early 70’s, I don’t remember exactly what year, ’72 - ’73 - ’74, somewhere in there, in the 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And since then what sort of things have the two of you done in terms of speaking, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: He is the one mostly who does the speaking, I’m not very good at public speaking.</span> <span id="s1194">He is -- he is very good and he does quite a bit of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Well, let me rephrase the questions.</span> <span id="s1196">Wh-Wh-What’s, other than your -- your daughter’s class, what sort of places have you gone over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Some social clubs, you know, not -- not too many places, really.</span> <span id="s1198">I let him do the talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Can you talk about the long term impact that you think your experiences in the Holocaust have had on you raising your children, perhaps, or tr -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel.</span> <span id="s1201">This is tape number three, side A. And I was just asking Mrs. Vogel about the long term impact that your experiences have had on you in different areas of your life.</span> <span id="s1202">And the first I was going to ask you about is in your family life and in raising your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: It’s like I said before, to make sure that they’re -- become independent people.</span> <span id="s1204">We never -- tried not to teach them hate.</span> <span id="s1205">We’re both rather friendly people and we welcomed anybody who came into the house, so you know, we won’t hold grudges against people because that doesn’t get you anywhere.</span> <span id="s1206">And I hope my kids will have enough common sense that they’ll know what’s right and what’s wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: How has it affected your, I don’t know, we talked about politics briefly, citizenship, your -- your feelings about government and the possibilities of what government can do and should do and should not do.</span> <span id="s1208">Is it in any way shaped by your experience with what happened to you in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: [indecipherable] that’s -- that’s the thing, that you gotta keep your ears and eyes open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: To listen to what -- not just what people say, but what they do and what they really mean when they say some -- say something, especially in -- people in government.</span> <span id="s1212">So I go out and I vote for the best people I think there is to put in to places in the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Do you -- your -- you talked earlier about that small voice in the back of your head that says, could this happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Is that voice any quieter, dimmer than it was when you first came over here, when it was fresher in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: As a matter of fact it’s even more lou -- I think it’s -- it’s maybe louder now than it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Because of what’s going on out there and what’s happening in Washington and it’s what happening -- what’s happening in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: What things are happening that are most concerning you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: The right wing swing of the country.</span> <span id="s1223">All these fringe societies out there that could easily, given time and a situation, God forbid, can easily become a bigger threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Were you -- I want to go back in history and talk to you about some things that have happened, but do you recall how you felt when this bombing happened in Kansas City -- excuse me, Oklahoma City?</span> <span id="s1225">Was that -- did that concern you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: That was terrible.</span> <span id="s1227">It was a horrible -- it -- it -- I mean, how can it happen in the United States?</span> <span id="s1228">See, this is what I mean, people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Are there sounds or smells that you have encountered here that bring back memories for you of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Sounds yes, smells, no.</span> <span id="s1231">But words sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Maybe it’s something, that I hear something and it doesn’t take much, it just all of a sudden like a movie, everything comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: What kind of words would do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: N-Not any specific words, but you know, you read an article, you -- you hear something on television, and oh, that’s it and off you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: What about sounds, you said sounds, yes.</span> <span id="s1237">Did you mean things other than words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Like a big bang, an explosion, a siren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: And you’ve -- you’re hair stand up or you -- you -- you -- or you have a flashback or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yeah, you could call it a flashback.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Have you ever been concerned or -- or apprehensive or fearful, I don’t know, a knock on the door when you’re not expecting it, or a phone call late at night, or a sp -- anything along those lines, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Just wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1245">For the most part I feel pretty secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Is that something you’ve had to work on at all, or are there any things you do, or -- that help you feel more secure, or things that you and your husband have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I think it just -- like I said before, I think it just evolved.</span> <span id="s1248">We been, thank God, very lucky.</span> <span id="s1249">We didn't have many unpleasant experiences, as far as that goes.</span> <span id="s1250">So you sort of become accustomed to being, you know, on an even -- what’s the word I want to use?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Keel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: I wanted to talk to you about some -- oh okay, all right, let me -- I’m checking off these questions they wanted me to ask.</span> <span id="s1254">Your dream life, have you been troubled in your dreams by nightmares, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Oh, I have crazy dreams all the time.</span> <span id="s1256">But I’m not sure that it’s related to where I come from.</span> <span id="s1257">Not necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So you don’t -- none -- you don’t ha -- specifically have dreams that you’ve had over the years that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: -- related directly that you’re aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No.</span> <span id="s1262">I had some -- a nightmare not too long ago, I woke up screaming, somebody was going to come and get me.</span> <span id="s1263">But I don’t think it had any relation to -- not consciously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: You went back to Hungary some -- not -- many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, we went back, oh, it’s about 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: What was that like for you to go back there after so many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: It was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1268">It was like I was in a strange country, like I’ve never been there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Just because physically it looked different, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yes, yes, and it’s strange, I mean, things that I remember that I grew up with is not there any more.</span> <span id="s1271">There was a big, beautiful street in the middle of the city, and we walked through there and I looked and I s -- kept saying, it’s -- doesn’t look the same as I remember.</span> <span id="s1272">It used to have, when -- what I remember, it used to have two rows of huge, beautiful trees, and in the summertime it would -- you know, all the branches and the green would come out and then all come together, it’s like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: A tunnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: -- tunnel going through it.</span> <span id="s1275">And I’m looking and I said, it’s not there.</span> <span id="s1276">I kept asking, I said, what’s missing from here?</span> <span id="s1277">And my sister said to me, oh you’re looking for the trees that’s no longer there, they cut it down.</span> <span id="s1278">And went back to the street where we used to live, and I na -- had such an eerie feeling.</span> <span id="s1279">So that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: I know your husband went, did you go together to the Holocaust gathering, the survivor’s gathering in the early 80’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1282">The one in Israel?</span> <span id="s1283">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s1285">What was that like for you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: That was emotional, very emotional.</span> <span id="s1287">It was -- it was nice.</span> <span id="s1288">At that time I was still looking, trying to find out what happened.</span> <span id="s1289">See, I have an aunt who we never really found out what happened to her and her daughter.</span> <span id="s1290">That’s the sister of my mother I mentioned earlier whose -- the husband was taken away in 1941, I believe.</span> <span id="s1291">They took him to the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1292">’42 and early ’43, the news came that he died.</span> <span id="s1293">And my aunt was left with a small child who was about four years old at the time and a daughter who was a young teenager.</span> <span id="s1294">And she decided to liquidate whatever she had over there and then to come to live with us, because they were very close [indecipherable] my mother.</span> <span id="s1295">And she wanted to be with us til the war was over.</span> <span id="s1296">And my parents went in September between the high holidays, between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur to bring the child over to our home, so she should be free to take care of her business and then would follow.</span> <span id="s1297">Well, it took her longer than she thought it would, and then around Christmas, December, they came over and -- Christmastime they came over and wanted to take the boy home and he wouldn’t go, he wanted to stay with us.</span> <span id="s1298">And then in the spring my parents wanted to send the child back to her, and my father almost found somebody who was going there with her -- with his daughter and at first they agreed that okay, they’re going to take a chance and take the child back.</span> <span id="s1299">In the last minute they said no, we’re afraid to take a child because if they find out you’re taking a Jewish child, we get in trouble too, so they didn’t take him.</span> <span id="s1300">And as it happened, he survived, today he is a doctor and he lives in Texas, and his mother and sister is gone and we don’t know how and -- but they died in Auschwitz, both of them.</span> <span id="s1301">And they were young enough to be able to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: What other things happened when you went over there, did you see people you knew, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I met a lot of people I knew, yes, and so did my husband.</span> <span id="s1304">And I went to one of the museums in Tel Aviv called the dias -- Diaspora Museum.</span> <span id="s1305">And to my surprise I found in one of the computers, my whole families’ history written up.</span> <span id="s1306">So that was interesting.</span> <span id="s1307">And I saw my aunts I had [indecipherable] I haven’t seen since I was a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did you -- other than that gathering, have you had much contact with other survivors living here in the States?</span> <span id="s1309">Do you have any friends who are also survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I have a girlfriend I went to school with, she lives in New York, and that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1311">I really don’t -- and the few here in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: About how many people are there here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Real survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Well, some of them already passed away.</span> <span id="s1316">Not really a whole lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Five, 10 - 20?</span> <span id="s1318">[indecipherable] 30?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: There are a few who came over here as young children before -- just before the war, came from Germany.</span> <span id="s1320">But others [indecipherable] real -- real survivors are us and maybe three, four other people, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: So th -- what about in other places you lived before you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: The only place that we met survivors were in Binghamton, New York, where I met some people from my hometown, and Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1323">Other than that, in Michigan City there, we were, I think, the only survivors there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1325">Well, I was just thinking it must have been a -- a profound experience having had only sporadic contact with other survivors since you came here, to all of a sudden be there with thousands there in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1327">In some ways I think it was a relief, because you know, when two survivors get together, the only thing they talk about, what they went through and what they survived.</span> <span id="s1328">A-And I think in order to save your sanity, so to speak, you need -- you need some time away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: So it sounds like a blessing that -- that you haven’t had that many encounters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: In some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: That’s my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1334">Do you need to communicate at all bef -- cause there’s more that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: I don’t know, how much more do you have to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Well, that’s really up to you.</span> <span id="s1337">There are a few key things that I definitely.</span> <span id="s1338">Can you spare another 15 or 20 minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1341">I would ask you about a -- a handful of things that happened in the past 50 years that -- that I’m wondering what your thoughts were about, or feelings about, as it relates to your own experience.</span> <span id="s1342">The bomb, the atom bomb.</span> <span id="s1343">The -- the n -- the nuclear age, the -- the fear of annihilation that was so prevalent in the 50’s and you know, where -- you know, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</span> <span id="s1344">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: That was nerve-wracking, that was scary.</span> <span id="s1346">The Cold War was scary because you never really could trust the Russians, so the -- as far as the -- what, the atom bomb in Japan, it was a terrible thing to do, but it had to be done, otherwise we would still be fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: What about the -- the trials after the war, the Nuremberg trials and other trials that happened with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: They didn’t catch enough of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Did you follow them very closely?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1351">See, the Nuremberg trials were what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: ’47, I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: ’48?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Something in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: ’47 - ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Those were the years, I don’t know, I was really trying to find myself, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1359">During that time when you were perhaps not so apt to be thinking about, talking about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Were you aware of how many Nazis came here, and if so how did you feel when you s -- when you learned of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I was a little bit surprised and a little bit disappointed in the American government for letting them in.</span> <span id="s1363">There were way too many in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: And they weren’t just here, they were, you know, working on NASA and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: -- you know, the CIA and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Well, they needed them, they had to -- those people they had to bring in because they needed the knowledge.</span> <span id="s1368">But even with that, where were our American scientists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: I have a general question to ask you.</span> <span id="s1370">Who do you blame for what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: For what happened in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: The holo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: -- you mean for the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1375">Who -- who -- where is your anger directed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I think the whole world.</span> <span id="s1377">There isn’t one person you can pick because all the governments in the world knew what was going on and nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s1378">It’s hard to believe but none of those smart people in the government couldn’t see through what Hitler was about and they went along with him, country after country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Do you have any more anger toward the Germans than other people who collaborated with them or went along with them or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: I wouldn’t call it anger, I have no sense of being angry because that just destroys you.</span> <span id="s1381">I feel sorry for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: That they have to live with this, maybe to centuries to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Have you had any encounters ever with any younger Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1386">We were in Germany a few ye-years ago, my husband was testifying against some Nazi people from the camp.</span> <span id="s1387">We met some lovely German people, they didn’t know what to do for us.</span> <span id="s1388">As a matter of fact we became friends.</span> <span id="s1389">And she practically saved my life while we were there because I became sick over there and she had a friend who was a doctor and you know, she -- she took care of me.</span> <span id="s1390">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Are you aware -- I’m assuming you are, of the -- how the American Jews reacted to what was going on and what they did and didn’t do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: They didn’t do a whole lot either, did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: I was wondering how you felt when you learned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Disappointed I suppose, but then I don’t think it would have make any difference, because even though this is a free country, it’s still the government that decides.</span> <span id="s1395">It’s Washington who makes the decisions.</span> <span id="s1396">So regardless of what they did, if they would have done more than what they tried, if it would have been any help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: I’ve been told that there were Jewish leaders who went out of their way to lobby Washington not to let European Jews into the country, back in the late 30’s, early 40’s because they were afraid of pogroms here and -- and the backlash cause of the depression, that there would be all these immigrants coming over and taking jobs away from Americans and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Well, you see, that started the trouble in Germany.</span> <span id="s1399">That’s why it all started.</span> <span id="s1400">So this is what I mean when I said earlier they -- that’s mostly -- see, the Jewish people are not so eager to hear our stories, the real American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Wh-Why do you guess that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Why do you guess that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Well, that’s what it is, what you just mentioned, that they were lobbying not to have in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s1405">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: What a -- what about the conduct of European Jews who -- like the -- the Jewish councils, the -- th-the people who -- I don’t know if you had any encounter in -- in your hometown where there must have been Jews who were in charge of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: They were [indecipherable] in every city, it -- that was the same everywhere the Germans went.</span> <span id="s1408">But see, in -- in Hungary they didn’t have much time any more.</span> <span id="s1409">That was -- everything was done in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1410">Like I said, from March 19th, by the end of June there were no Jews left in Hungary, everybody was gone except the one who lived in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: So there wasn’t much time for any sort of infrastructure to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: There was no time for it, no.</span> <span id="s1413">They were gone one, two, three.</span> <span id="s1414">By that time they knew what they were doing and th-their machinery was oiled pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Back to things that happened in the interim, between then and now.</span> <span id="s1416">Were -- what was it like the whole McCarthy era and the red scare and the people who were being persecuted here for, you know, rumors that they were communists and wha-what did you go through with that?</span> <span id="s1417">Did you know anybody caught up in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Not personally, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: What was it like to observe that, having come from the experience that you came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Well, it was unsettling to say the least, because if it goes one way it could go the other way, too.</span> <span id="s1421">So there we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Si -- explain that, if it can go one way it can go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Well, if one -- one day you persecute the communists, the next day you gonna find somebody else to do the same for, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1425">What about the -- the way blacks were treated here, and the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement and -- what was it like for you -- I mean, there are very few blacks in Europe probably, when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: I never seen any.</span> <span id="s1427">One I’ve seen as a child, Joe Louis was in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: So what was it like for you to come to this country and see the -- the segregation and the -- the way, in essence, the blacks were in -- they were -- the ghettoes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Oh, talking about segregation, listen, when I came to this country in 1947 in Detroit, one of the nicest neighborhoods, I remember standing with my aunt waiting for a bus to go downtown, and I look across the street, a big, beautiful apartment building, and there is a plaque on the door.</span> <span id="s1430">It said no dogs -- I’m trying to remember exactly how it was worded.</span> <span id="s1431">No dogs, no Jews and no blacks allowed in the building.</span> <span id="s1432">That was in 1947.</span> <span id="s1433">And I turned to my aunt and I asked, how could you stand for this?</span> <span id="s1434">To me it was outrageous.</span> <span id="s1435">But that took me awhile to -- like all of us who come to this country, you know, from somewhere else and this is a whole different life, and to get to know it, where it came from and what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s1436">No, it’s not fair, it’s not fair to treat anybody like that, regardless of color.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: I guess I was wondering if you felt any particular affinity or connection of -- watching the way they were treated, versus how you were treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Connection, no, not really, because it’s two different things altogether.</span> <span id="s1439">No, it’s -- it’s not the same thing, and you can’t really bring it to the same level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: I sense I’ve touched a -- a nerve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: No, not really, but it’s -- it’s not -- that’s not the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: How is it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Because it’s true they were treated badly, they were segregated, some of them were lynched, but they weren't taken as a group to the gas chamber as the Jews were.</span> <span id="s1444">And that is the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: I guess I -- what I was asking -- I was not myself making the equation of the two things, I was wondering if you felt particularly disturbed at all or anything, when you came over here to -- to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yes, it was disturbing because no -- no human being should be treated like that, there’s no reason for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Were you at all, when the Civil Rights movement was happening, did you -- were you involved at all in that, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Involved?</span> <span id="s1449">To some extent, but I wasn’t involved in any of the marching as such, but you know, I was for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Just wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: What about the whole upheaval that went on around the Vietnam war and all the demonstrations and Kent State and you know, the riots and you know, that -- that whole period abou -- of upheaval.</span> <span id="s1453">Did that frighten you at all, did that concern you?</span> <span id="s1454">Did that -- did you have any familiar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Frighten me?</span> <span id="s1456">No, but it was rather -- what’s the word I want to use?</span> <span id="s1457">This is America.</span> <span id="s1458">That’s the United States.</span> <span id="s1459">People can do anything they want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Is that a good thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: In some ways it is, as long as they know what really matters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: I’m -- I’m winding down.</span> <span id="s1463">What about the whole Watergate scandal and finding out in depth the level of corruption and shenanigans that were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: That just shows that you can’t trust the politicians in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So it wasn’t a particular surprise or shock or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1467">That was a shock because it happened in the United States and I guess in -- we’re supposed to be a little bit better than anybody else in the world, but I guess we’re not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: What about various -- how do I characterize them as a group?</span> <span id="s1469">In the past 50 years there have been some horrible things, either that we just learned about, like in the case of the revelations about what happened with Stalin in Russia and all the millions of people that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: [indecipherable] that just a -- that’s another thing that nobody wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1471">I was there.</span> <span id="s1472">Some people knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: I take it you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Well, we heard stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Hold on, let me just check.</span> <span id="s1476">I think I have to turn this over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel.</span> <span id="s1479">This is tape number three, side B. And I was asking you about things that have happened in terms of other -- I don’t know what to call them?</span> <span id="s1480">Catastrophic events in history, such as the -- the various ways that Stalin did away with millions of people in Russia, in Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Well, of course it was shocking, when something like this comes into the open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Or, you know, Mao in China or Pol Pot in Cambodia, or Idi Amin, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: And the starving of the kids in what was that country in Africa where all those kids were starving awhile back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Just recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Well, it’s been a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Well, Somalia, then -- that’s what you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: No, Somalia is a latecomer, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Ethiopia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: -- there was another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Biafra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Maybe that’s what I’m tal -- thinking [indecipherable] sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Biafra was the late 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Yeah, I think that’s the one, when all those kids, children were starving and where was the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: I guess what I’m wondering is, when you, over the years have learned about something horrible that’s in the midst of happening, like in Rwanda all the -- they were both, you know, massacring left and right the -- you know, the -- the two ethnic groups there.</span> <span id="s1497">Or what has gone on in the past five years in -- in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: I was just going to say -- mention Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1499">Now that, when we saw the pictures coming from there, we looked, I said, my God, it’s like concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1500">There was no reason for that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: I guess my question to you is, when those things have -- when you’ve seen those things in the news, or read about them, does it frighten you, does it concern you that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: No, it makes you angry.</span> <span id="s1503">It brings back all the memories, all that we went through and it makes you angry that the world didn’t learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Have any of those events caused you to take any action, or -- or-or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Action as far as what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1507">Giving money, mobilizing support for -- I -- I’m -- I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: For who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: I don’t know, I’m -- I’m inventing things here.</span> <span id="s1510">I’ll take that the answer is no.</span> <span id="s1511">Last question, I know I’ve taken a lot of your time already.</span> <span id="s1512">Not my last question, but the last thing that they wanted me to ask you about history.</span> <span id="s1513">What about observing Israel becoming its own country in ’48 and then the trials and tribulations of the past almost 50 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: It’s 50 years, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Has that been -- have there been things that have happened there that have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: It will be 50 years next year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Next year.</span> <span id="s1518">Has -- has anything that had happened there concerned you, disturbed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Everything that happens there concerns me, of course.</span> <span id="s1520">It’s a beautiful country and it’s long overdue.</span> <span id="s1521">I mean, Jewish people need the country like that.</span> <span id="s1522">And they work very hard for it, those people over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Let me rephrase the question, when I said concerns you I -- I meant disturbs you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Some of the thing that happens over there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Oh, all the problems and bombings they have, where innocent people, innocent children die for no reason.</span> <span id="s1527">I mean, there is -- there is no -- there is no reason for it, for that.</span> <span id="s1528">That’s -- it’s a concern for, I think, the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: How did you feel when the -- the whole Intifada started to happen and the -- how -- maybe I’ll ask in general how you have felt about the Israeli government’s treatment of the Palestinians within their country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: See, we just came back from Israel.</span> <span id="s1531">And what we hear on the news over here and read in the paper, it’s a whole different thing than what goes on over there.</span> <span id="s1532">So we really can’t -- can’t judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1534">I’ve just got a couple of questions in closing to ask you and then I’ll let you to your dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: What would you like people to understand?</span> <span id="s1537">Someone, let’s say of my generation who certainly did not go through what you went through.</span> <span id="s1538">Or for that matter people who are of your generation, who were here, or elsewhere and didn't experience what you and your husband experienced.</span> <span id="s1539">What would you like people to understand that perhaps they don’t understand or fully appreciate about the Holocaust and the experiences you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Well, let me think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Is there something you would most like people to come away from hearing this interview understanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Not so much understanding, but maybe more aware of what goes on in the world, and maybe quicker to react on what happens on the other side or wherever it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Meaning elsewhere in the world?</span> <span id="s1544">On the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I mean, yeah, around the world.</span> <span id="s1546">Because the world is getting smaller every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: The last question I was going to ask you seems related to your answer, maybe you’re already answered it.</span> <span id="s1548">How do we keep this from happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Tolerance, and be aware, and teach your children not to follow blindly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: So if a leader comes up who starts promising things that sound too good to be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Question it, and don’t believe it til you see it.</span> <span id="s1552">And let’s hope that the younger generations will be smart enough to see through somebody like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Has there been anybody, any politician si-since you’ve been in this country that’s particularly worried you or any not necessarily politician but figure that’s particularly ba -- concerned you, that could be, I don’t know, a charismatic enough leader to cause trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Yeah, except I can’t think of the name of the person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Give me a hint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: But there was one not too long ago in the picture.</span> <span id="s1557">Pat Robertson is one.</span> <span id="s1558">Is it -- have I got the right name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1560">Oh, hold it, which -- which Pat?</span> <span id="s1561">There’s Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson, Pat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Well, the both of them.</span> <span id="s1563">One is the politician, the other [indecipherable] and the other one the -- the religious guy, and they’re equally bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Is that -- is one of those who you were trying to think of or is there somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: [indecipherable] well, there are probably some others around that not too well known at this point, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1567">By any chance, did you ever read the book, “It Can Happen Here?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: It was written in the mid-’30’s about how a fascist state could start in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: And it’s quite a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Did you read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: It is available in the library?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Sure, it’s by Sinclair Lewis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1577">I think I’ll go get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: It’s -- it’s quite a book.</span> <span id="s1579">He wrote it in the middle of the 30’s, two years -- 1935, two years after Hitler came to power, and he wrote a very persuasive scenario of exactly how da -- you know, the right politician and the right mix of bad economic situation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Mm-hm [indecipherable] that’s all it needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: -- and the right people to scapegoat and the right crisis to mobilize the country and give the president the proper powers and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: The only hope in this country is that -- who they gonna pick for the scapegoat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Well, they can pick the blacks, they can pick the Jews, they can pick the Hispanics.</span> <span id="s1585">Who they gonna pick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Well, there’s also the sort of generic, whoever the last people came into the door, you know, as the most recent immigrants that are taking the jobs away, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Well, I guess we’re back to square one again, huh?</span> <span id="s1588">There we go for the Jews, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: I really appreciate all the time you’ve given us this afternoon.</span> <span id="s1590">This concludes -- is there anything you’d like to say in closing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Just one more thing.</span> <span id="s1592">I hope for the government of the United States, that will stay forever what it was written to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1594">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel, on the ninth day of July, 1997.</span></p> <p><span
