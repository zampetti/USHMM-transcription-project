Edith Millman] interviewing Mrs. Sybil Niemoeller, widow of famous pastor Martin Niemoeller.</span> <span id="s3">Please tell me where you were born and a little bit about your family background.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">SN: I was born in Potsdam, which is now in East Germany.</span> <span id="s5">Potsdam, the cradle of Prussianism.</span> <span id="s6">Both my families came from Prussian backgrounds.</span> <span id="s7">Three of my four great-grandfathers were Prussian Generals.</span> <span id="s8">My two grandfathers were Prussian Generals.</span> <span id="s9">The rest were landowners, military statesmen and military leaders, and had been for centuries.</span> <span id="s10">My father was one of four sons of my grandparents, the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s11">The other three were killed in World War I.</span> <span id="s12">He wanted to be a diplomat, but after the defeat of Germany in 1918, his career was crushed and he lived in poverty until in the mid-twenties when Kaiser Wilhelm appointed him to be administrator and financial advisor.</span> <span id="s13">So the family moved to Berlin-Dahlem in 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">EM: Did you or your family know any Jews as you were growing up?</span> <span id="s15">Did you have any close Jewish friends at all during your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SN: Yes, I did as a child, and my parents did as grownups.</span> <span id="s17">In my school in Berlin- Dahlem, we had a number of Jewish students, of Jewish children in my class, most of them coming from affluent Dahlem families and with the exception of one, who was my closest friend.</span> <span id="s18">They all left Germany in time.</span> <span id="s19">My closest friend, Anita Frank, namesake of Anna Frank, died in Bergen-Belsen like her namesake, Anna Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">EM: Do you recall specific church teachings about the Jews which you yourself heard as a young woman and then as an adult before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">SN: No, I was too little.</span> <span id="s22">I do not recall any such teachings.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">EM: About how many Jews lived in your immediate town or city?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">SN: Well, I lived in Berlin so I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s25">There were many, many thousands.</span> <span id="s26">In our neighborhood of Dahlem, there were a number of houses that were owned by Jews, but all of them left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">EM: Were they conspicuous in particular occupations?</span> <span id="s28">Or can you describe general attitudes among Christians in the city towards Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">SN: No, not without generalizing.</span> <span id="s30">I really couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s31">I was too small then.</span> <span id="s32">I was too small a child.</span> <span id="s33">I only really became aware of what happened because of the shock of November 9th, 1938 where I saw--not in Berlin but in the little town of Eberswalden north of Berlin where I was in boarding school, where I saw the synagogue burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">EM: What do you recall of the atmosphere during the early ‘30s among people you knew, that is before 1933?</span> <span id="s35">Were you familiar with any members of the Nazi Party?</span> <span id="s36">If so, do you recall their reasons why they joined?</span> <span id="s37">Were you aware of any articulated Nazi feelings or activities?</span> <span id="s38">Please describe in detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">SN: Well, that’s many questions.</span> <span id="s40">First of all, [tape off then on] what do I recall of the atmosphere during the early ‘30s among people I knew?</span> <span id="s41">Among people I knew, there were no Nazis in the immediate family.</span> <span id="s42">My father had already turned to be an anti-Nazi long before Hitler came to power because he had read Mein Kampf and always predicted what would happen if the man came to power.</span> <span id="s43">Was I familiar with any members of the Nazi Party?</span> <span id="s44">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s45">One of my mother’s brothers turned Nazi.</span> <span id="s46">And the only reason why he did that, because he was too dumb to make good in any profession.</span> <span id="s47">The Nazis came along, and he became a big Nazi, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s48">And after they came to the house, he and his wife demanded that we children join the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s49">My father threw them out.</span> <span id="s50">That was what happened in my family, but there is a black sheep in almost every family.</span> <span id="s51">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s52">EM: When did you first become aware of Dr. Niemoeller’s opposition to the pro-Nazi position of most of the Protestant churches?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">SN: Well, very soon, because Pastor Niemoeller was like a member of my own family.</span> <span id="s54">He had come to Dahlem in 1931.</span> <span id="s55">I was present as a seven-year-old child at his first service.</span> <span id="s56">And the families soon became close friends.</span> <span id="s57">We were neighbors.</span> <span id="s58">And I was made aware that he took a stand very soon against the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EM: How extensive do you think this opposition was?</span> <span id="s60">How did it express itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">SN: You mean, I don’t quite understand the question.</span> <span id="s62">His opposition?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">EM: His opposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">SN: His opposition was extensive.</span> <span id="s65">It was very outspoken, and he expressed himself in his sermons in the pulpit.</span> <span id="s66">And his church became more and more mobbed as the years went on, until he was arrested in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">EM: Can you tell us what you recall of the beginnings of the Confessing Church and Dr. Niemoeller’s role in its formation?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">SN: Well, I really do not recall too much myself, only what I heard later from my parents and what I read after the war, because I was too small to be filled in on all the details.</span> <span id="s69">But I remember the Confessing Church was founded as a counterpart against the Nazi-ideology-supported Christian German Church.</span> <span id="s70">And my family, my father and my mother, became members of the Confessing Church.</span> <span id="s71">And the leading figure that emerged was that of Pastor Niemoeller.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">EM: On what grounds were the pastors of the Confessing Church, including Dr. Niemoeller, imprisoned?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SN: Well, because they spoke out against Adolf Hitler, mainly in their pulpits.</span> <span id="s74">And after 1936, a declaration was sent to Adolf Hitler about the persecution of the Jews that was becoming more and more obvious and a problem that became very urgent.</span> <span id="s75">After 1936, after that declaration was sent to him, 700 pastors of the Confessing Church were imprisoned and sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s76">And the first one to be murdered there was a Jew by Hitler’s laws, Pastor Friedrich Weitzler, who by being murdered in Sachsenhausen in 1937 became the first Jewish martyr of the Confessing Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">EM: Please tell us about your activities in the early years of the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s78">Did you at first believe that the regime would only last a short time?</span> <span id="s79">Do you recall the early measures passed against Jews; the Aryan Paragraph, the boycott, the book burnings?</span> <span id="s80">Within your own circle, was there acceptance or disapproval of these actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">SN: Well, of course I was too young for any activities at that early stage of the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s82">I can only talk about my parents.</span> <span id="s83">Did they first believe that the regime would last only a short time?</span> <span id="s84">They hoped it would.</span> <span id="s85">And with them, most of the people hoped, including the Jews who didn’t leave Germany while there was still time.</span> <span id="s86">They couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s87">Therein lay Hitler’s strength.</span> <span id="s88">He planned crimes of such magnitude, and he took time, you know, too dreadful for any human to grasp.</span> <span id="s89">So that is optimism.</span> <span id="s90">We all were optimistic.</span> <span id="s91">My parents, even though they were pessimists, I must say, they hoped it would somehow come to an end.</span> <span id="s92">And do I recall the early measures passed against the Jews?</span> <span id="s93">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s94">In school there were, the children in my class stayed in the school until ’37, ’38, ’39, whenever their parents left, with that one exception.</span> <span id="s95">Otherwise, early measures against the Jewish friends of my parents?</span> <span id="s96">I do not recall.</span> <span id="s97">Because the closest friends they had went to Theresienstadt; but only in 1941.</span> <span id="s98">And they survived.</span> <span id="s99">The Aryan Paragraph, I do recall vaguely.</span> <span id="s100">The boycotts I knew about, but I never saw because we lived far outside in Dahlem.</span> <span id="s101">We never went, but just once before Christmas did we ever go into the city of Berlin.</span> <span id="s102">And there was no TV.</span> <span id="s103">And of course the radio would report only one side of it, if anything at all.</span> <span id="s104">So I never witnessed anything.</span> <span id="s105">And of course my father would talk about the book burnings.</span> <span id="s106">And was there acceptance or disapproval in our circle?</span> <span id="s107">Of course, there was disapproval only.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">EM: Were you aware of any help rendered Jews by non-Jews up to 1935?</span> <span id="s109">And please describe any.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">SN: No.</span> <span id="s111">I do not have any recollections that far back.</span> <span id="s112">I was too little.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EM: How about later?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">SN: Oh later?</span> <span id="s115">I know of people who hid Jews.</span> <span id="s116">And in our own house, we harbored several Jewish people disguised as gardeners and seamstresses.</span> <span id="s117">I do not recall any names, except one lady, and her name was Frau Tieler.</span> <span id="s118">Her real name was Frau Bietenberg [phonetic], and her whole family had already been sent to the camps in the East.</span> <span id="s119">She, I know for a fact, did survive, and she went to England.</span> <span id="s120">With our family, four other Dahlem families took part in that underground railroad, and I would like to mention their names.</span> <span id="s121">It was the Aktiweiter [?]</span> <span id="s122">Frank and his wife.</span> <span id="s123">It was Dr. Leist and his Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s124">It was Walter Nikel and his Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s125">And Dr. Walter Egers and his wife, and my family.</span> <span id="s126">And none of us were ever reported.</span> <span id="s127">None of us were ever found out.</span> <span id="s128">What happened to the Jews after they left our house, I, at least, do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EM: Were you aware of any non-physical resistance or opposition to the regime in the early ‘30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">SN: I can’t answer that question.</span> <span id="s131">I was too little.</span> <span id="s132">My only way of resisting was that I never joined the Hitler Youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EM: Do you recall Nazi repressive action against non-Jewish opponents of the regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">SN: Oh yes, of course!</span> <span id="s135">Anybody who would not join the Hitler Youth, for instance, had to face the consequences.</span> <span id="s136">I can talk about me personally.</span> <span id="s137">I could not graduate from high school, because I was at that point, together with a half-Jewish girl who is still my best friend in Bonn, could not graduate from high school because I was not a member of the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s138">And there are probably others.</span> <span id="s139">I cannot at this point tell you any names.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EM: Can you please describe conditions of your own life between 1935 and 1945?</span> <span id="s141">Where you lived, how the policies of the regime impinged on your life, and what work that you did.</span> <span id="s142">What you knew about the fate of Jews in Germany as they were sent East.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SN: Well, in ’35 I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s144">I went to boarding school.</span> <span id="s145">I could ultimately not graduate from school, but I could do one thing--I went to acting school.</span> <span id="s146">There were no questions asked, because actresses in Nazi Germany had really, like in Soviet Russia special status.</span> <span id="s147">They were practically untouchable.</span> <span id="s148">So I became an actress, was an actress for two years, and then came the 20th of July plot, the plot to assassinate Hitler, in which my family participated.</span> <span id="s149">And my father, my cousin, First Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, and Hans Bernt von Haeften, who was a diplomat.</span> <span id="s150">There were meetings in our house at nighttime, between the years of ’43 and ’44, and my mother was in the house; I was in the house.</span> <span id="s151">We were never told what was going to happen, but we had a pretty good idea of what was being planned.</span> <span id="s152">So many attempts on Hitler’s life had failed, and we knew they were building up to another one, which should be the last one.</span> <span id="s153">And now the question--[pause; tape off then on] After the plot my, both my cousins were killed, and my father and I were both arrested on July 23rd.</span> <span id="s154">I was let go after several very nasty interrogations.</span> <span id="s155">My father went to Lehrterstrasse Prison and later died in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s156">The fate-</span></p> <p><span id="s157">EM: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s158">Was this after the attempt on Hitler’s life?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">SN: Yes, that was as a consequence of the attempt.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">EM: Could you describe more or what you know about it and how do you spell the name of your two cousins who took part in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">SN: Well, the one who took part in the plot itself was Werner von Haeften--H-A-E-F-T-E-N.</span> <span id="s162">He was the adjutant at that time of Colonel Klaus, Count von Stauffenberg.</span> <span id="s163">And those two men actually went to Rastenburg and planted the bomb.</span> <span id="s164">While Werner’s brother, my other cousin, Hans Bernt, was arrested, you know, kith and kin, and he was hanged.</span> <span id="s165">[tape off then on] As far as the fate of the Jews in Germany, I can talk about our own friends, Dr. and Frau Otto Stargalt, close friend, since World War I, of my parents, who lived in Dahlem, and they were sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s166">And they survived there, a day before the last transport went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s167">About the fate of the Jews, we heard on the BBC.</span> <span id="s168">Of course, names like Auschwitz, Treblinka were meaningless to most of us, till after the war.</span> <span id="s169">I mean, Elie Wiesel describes in his book, The Night, how they arrived in Auschwitz in cattle cars, and people near the windows saw the sign of the station outside and they were asked, “Where are we?</span> <span id="s170">Auschwitz?”</span> <span id="s171">Nobody had ever heard the name as late as ’44!</span> <span id="s172">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s173">EM: Were you personally ever in danger of being imprisoned or punished in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">SN: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s175">In absolutely acute danger ever since the 20th of July, 1944, and probably even before.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">EM: Were you aware of the so-called euthanasia centers in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">SN: Yes, because a neighbor’s son, who developed epilepsy as a 16-year-old boy, was sent to one of those hospitals like Hadama, and the parents received notice that he died of a heart attack or…</span></p> <p><span id="s178">EM: Natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">SN: Pneumonia, of natural causes.</span> <span id="s180">And they knew then that something was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">EM: Did your father ever talk about any of these euthanasia programs?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">SN: Oh yes, from him I would know about it, because I was too small myself to know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">EM: Did you know any other people involved in the July, 1944 effort to overturn the government?</span> <span id="s184">Please describe what you knew of these events.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">SN: Well, I knew practically everybody involved.</span> <span id="s186">Personally, most of them personally, some of them not personally.</span> <span id="s187">We still meet the survivors.</span> <span id="s188">We still meet on every 20th of July in Berlin for ceremonies.</span> <span id="s189">So we were either related or we just knew one another.</span> <span id="s190">And what happened then you can read in any book.</span> <span id="s191">And many books have been written about the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">EM: How was your father involved, if at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">SN: My father was, had he lived, was supposed to be the liaison man between the new regime, which would be headed by Goerdeler, between the new regime and the negotiations with England.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">EM: Were you aware of any German Jews who were sent to the Polish ghettoes in 1941, up to 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">SN: Was I aware?</span> <span id="s196">Only what we heard through the grapevine, and from the Jews that came through our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">EM: Do you remember ever hearing of Lublin reservation?</span> <span id="s198">Or Madagascar, as a reservation for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">SN: Lublin, never.</span> <span id="s200">Absolute news to me.</span> <span id="s201">Madagascar, I remember very well that being talked about, where the Jews would be sent to.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">EM: Did you hear of Adolf Eichmann or any other Nazi officials connected with the deportation of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">SN: Adolf Eichmann’s name, I never heard.</span> <span id="s204">Kaltenbrunner was the one; Heydrich was the one we heard about.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">EM: Did you know about the gas chambers, or hear about Auschwitz or Treblinka or Mauthausen or Majdanek before the end of the war?</span> <span id="s206">If so, what did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SN: No, if we heard the names, I didn’t recall them until I maybe heard them again after the war.</span> <span id="s208">They were just nameless places to us.</span> <span id="s209">But they were places, and we heard about them on the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">EM: In looking back over the Hitler period, do you believe that in general Hitler was supported by a large number of Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SN: Absolutely yes, the vast majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EM: When, if at all, might effective resistance to him have been possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SN: Not later than ’34 probably, because he saw to it that no massive resistance was possible, after taking first the Communists, then the trade unionists, then the Socialists and then the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EM: Do you have the impression that Holocaust history is being seriously studied by substantial number of German students today?</span> <span id="s215">Either formally in school, or through Church education, pilgrimages to Israel, etc.</span> <span id="s216">?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">SN: I would say not in the first 20 or 30 years after the war.</span> <span id="s218">Practically everything was swept under the carpet.</span> <span id="s219">Strangely enough, the mediocre series of Holocaust on television, which was forced upon the air by my brother, who was then the manager of the largest German radio and TV station against the advice of his board.</span> <span id="s220">After that mediocre series, especially the very young then turned around to their parents and then grandparents and asked, “What did you do?</span> <span id="s221">Why don’t we hear about this?</span> <span id="s222">Why aren’t we taught about this?”</span> <span id="s223">Yes, I think history is at this point being, as far as schoolbooks go, rewritten.</span> <span id="s224">I hope it is.</span> <span id="s225">And, Church education, I’m really not well enough informed about.</span> <span id="s226">Pilgrimages to Israel and to Poland for that matter, by German, very young people, yes, all the time.</span> <span id="s227">I personally know of dozens of young Germans who are eager to go to Israel, eager to reconcile, live in kibbutzim, build roads in Poland.</span> <span id="s228">It’s been done.</span> <span id="s229">It’s been done more and more.</span> <span id="s230">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s231">EM: Could you please tell me something about your marriage to Pastor Niemoeller?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">SN: Well, as I told you earlier on the tape, I met him when I was seven.</span> <span id="s233">And I was 14 when he went to prison, and I didn’t see him again for 31 years.</span> <span id="s234">I came to this country, the United States, became an American citizen.</span> <span id="s235">I came into this country in ’52, became a citizen in ’57, and met my husband again in New York City when he was traveling and when he was lecturing and preaching in a Brooklyn church.</span> <span id="s236">And we met again for the first time in 31 years.</span> <span id="s237">I had no husband anymore.</span> <span id="s238">His wife had been killed.</span> <span id="s239">And so we ultimately got married, and I settled with him in Wiesbaden, even though he was willing to come and live in the United States with me.</span> <span id="s240">But he had all his sisters and brothers there.</span> <span id="s241">He had his roots there.</span> <span id="s242">He was then 79 years.</span> <span id="s243">When I met him he was 76; when we married he was 79.</span> <span id="s244">I felt I could not transplant an old man like that.</span> <span id="s245">So we settled in Wiesbaden, West Germany, but we traveled a lot during the next, at least, 12 years.</span> <span id="s246">He traveled, and he preached.</span> <span id="s247">And wherever he went, he asked forgiveness for his part in the guilt of the German people, his part for not having done enough while he was still a free man between 1933 and 1937.</span> <span id="s248">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s249">EM: Will you please tell me what you know about his suffering after he was in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">SN: Well, he spent one year in prison, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s251">And that was still rather civilized.</span> <span id="s252">He got mail, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EM: What, excuse me, what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SN: He was arrested the first of July, 1937.</span> <span id="s255">And his trial came up in March, ’38.</span> <span id="s256">And in March, ’38 the trial took place and there were still, at that late date in Germany, honest judges.</span> <span id="s257">Surprisingly enough, he was practically acquitted.</span> <span id="s258">He was accused of insubordination, of treason, of disobedience, of all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s259">But since he’d already spent nine months in prison, he was let go.</span> <span id="s260">And he was arrested on the steps of the courthouse on his way home where his family and his friends waited for him.</span> <span id="s261">And he was kidnapped by the Gestapo and taken to a place unknown for a number of weeks.</span> <span id="s262">It turned out to be Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s263">In Sachsenhausen, he was turned over to the Kommandant with the words, “This is the Führer’s private prisoner.”</span> <span id="s264">And that man didn’t know what to do with my husband.</span> <span id="s265">If he treated him like any other prisoner, mistreated him, maybe it wouldn’t be right.</span> <span id="s266">And if he treated him too well, it wouldn’t be right either.</span> <span id="s267">So he just threw him into solitary confinement, into a bunker cell, where he spent the next three years.</span> <span id="s268">And solitary confinement for my husband was the worst punishment.</span> <span id="s269">This man, who had to share every sentence, every sentiment, every thought with someone else, there he was.</span> <span id="s270">And the only company were the S.S. guards who brought him his food, and where the screams that pierced his cell from the fellow prisoners who were mishandled all the time, to which he protested aloud and was threatened by the S.S. that if he didn’t stop protesting he would receive the same punishment, or even be put to death.</span> <span id="s271">They never laid their hands on him.</span> <span id="s272">They were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s273">But that status, that special status, there or later in Dachau, could change any moment if it so pleased Hitler.</span> <span id="s274">Why Hitler did not execute him will forever remain speculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">EM: Mrs. Niemoeller, is there anything that you would like to add to what we have talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">SN: Well, my husband, as I told you, went around the world asking forgiveness for his part in the guilt.</span> <span id="s277">Reconciliation was one of his main concerns.</span> <span id="s278">To reconcile the Protestants with the Catholics, and the Christians with the Jews.</span> <span id="s279">Reconciliation is a word often misunderstood.</span> <span id="s280">A Christian cannot just go to a Jew and say, “Let’s forget it and start anew.”</span> <span id="s281">The first step in the direction of reconciliation has to come from the Jews, the precondition being for a Christian to say to him, “I am guilty.</span> <span id="s282">Please forgive me.”</span> <span id="s283">That is the first step.</span> <span id="s284">That is the pre-condition.</span> <span id="s285">And from there, maybe reconciliation will come.</span> <span id="s286">But that has to be up to the Jews, the ones who have been hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">EM: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s288">We really appreciate your coming.</span></p></body></html>
