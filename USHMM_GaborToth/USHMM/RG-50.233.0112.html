birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">My birthday, August 12, 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Okay, where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">In Amsterdam, in the downtown center where mostly Jewish people lived.</span> <span id="s7">We called it the ghetto but it was not a ghetto at all because everybody was free to move out or to move in and there lived a lot of non-Jews.</span> <span id="s8">But we called it the ghetto because a lot of Jews lived there.</span> <span id="s9">The Jews who were in better financial status, they--slowly they moved out to better parts of the city.</span> <span id="s10">But people who without means, like my family, we stayed in town.</span> <span id="s11">till--about the downtown, you call it downtown there; we stayed there until I was about nine years old and then we could move out.</span> <span id="s12">My father, he was born in 1875.</span> <span id="s13">His name was Herman Rood and he was married to my mother.</span> <span id="s14">My mother was born in London, England.</span> <span id="s15">She came later with her parents to the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s16">Her mother was English also.</span> <span id="s17">They came to the Netherlands in Amsterdam because they were what you call a diamond family.</span> <span id="s18">They worked in the diamond industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">What did they do exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Diamonds, polishing, cutting and polishing.</span> <span id="s21">Whatever comes to pass in the diamond industry, my grandfather was in that work, did that work.</span> <span id="s22">It was his trade.</span> <span id="s23">I haven't known my grandfather because he died when I was about two or three years old.</span> <span id="s24">My grandmother the same thing.</span> <span id="s25">They died shortly after each other.</span> <span id="s26">So where we lived in Amsterdam, my mother was born in--I told you when my father was born, 1875.</span> <span id="s27">My mother was born 1881.</span> <span id="s28">So it was a six-year difference.</span> <span id="s29">They got married, my mother was thirty when she married and my father was about six years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s30">My oldest brother Aaron was born in April, 1912, he was born, so five years older than I am.</span> <span id="s31">Then my sister came two years later, Maria Rood.</span> <span id="s32">She came also in April.</span> <span id="s33">That will celebrate a birthday in April.</span> <span id="s34">My sister, as I said, two years younger than my brother and then I came.</span> <span id="s35">I, 12 August, right?</span> <span id="s36">Another brother followed two years after me.</span> <span id="s37">My father and mother kept strict distance between the children.</span> <span id="s38">Two years after each other all the time.</span> <span id="s39">Then my brother.</span> <span id="s40">Jonas, was born 1919, August 23, 1919.</span> <span id="s41">Then came my other brother, Machiel, two years after that and he was born 12 October 1921.</span> <span id="s42">Then my mother took a pause.</span> <span id="s43">In 1925 our baby sister came.</span> <span id="s44">That was the most darling little girl that you ever can imagine.</span> <span id="s45">We were all very proud of her and her birthday was in March, shortly after my mother's birthday and she was born 1925.</span> <span id="s46">Elizabeth, as I said, was the most beautiful girl that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s47">She had four brothers who spoiled her rotten but she was not spoiled.</span> <span id="s48">I never--that I have known her till I got deported when I saw her for the last time.</span> <span id="s49">I cannot remember that we--where you saw her, you had a smile.</span> <span id="s50">Such a lovely girl, she was.</span> <span id="s51">She never complained about things that girls do sometimes, you know, especially adolescents.</span> <span id="s52">I cannot ever remember hearing a complaint from her lips.</span> <span id="s53">Even as I said, when boys start looking at her when she was sixteen years old, 15, 16 years old, and the war was already in progress--boys start looking at her.</span> <span id="s54">She had four brothers to look after her and nobody could look too long on her, believe me.</span> <span id="s55">We were all there watching it.</span> <span id="s56">She was our baby, she was our little angel.</span> <span id="s57">You will see her picture, it will be enclosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Okay.</span> <span id="s59">What about your--was your father of Ashkenazi descent?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Yes.</span> <span id="s61">My father was what we call high-Deutsche, high German.</span> <span id="s62">That doesn't mean that he came from Germany.</span> <span id="s63">They came via Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Do you know when his family came to the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">In the sixteenth or seventeenth century, the name was already known.</span> <span id="s66">In the beginning of the 16th century, the Netherlands Jewish population started out about 1492 when Columbus sailed to America.</span> <span id="s67">About the same time, Spanish and Portuguese Jews got the order that they had to leave the country if they did not convert to Christianity.</span> <span id="s68">They had to leave the country within three months.</span> <span id="s69">They formed a community in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam which was open because the Netherlanders, that was north Spain then; Spain was all over Europe.</span> <span id="s70">The Netherlanders protested against the yoke of the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s71">The Catholic Church had a hold on the state, on the government.</span> <span id="s72">The Spanish king was wax in the hands of the Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s73">In the north of the Netherlands, Belgium at that time was also the Netherlands, yeah?</span> <span id="s74">They revolted, they had a revolution.</span> <span id="s75">They followed the doctrine or they followed the example of Jonah Huss from eastern Europe and Martin Luther who protested against the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s76">The Netherlands followed that up.</span> <span id="s77">The leader of the rebellion was a prince, a Spanish prince, but he was born in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s78">He was Spanish prince in the order of the royalty, Spanish royalty, but he was also the prince of the Netherlands, also a prince of part of Germany, also a prince of part of France.</span> <span id="s79">The name was Orange and you have a part of France that is still called Orange and we call that family--we still have that family.</span> <span id="s80">We call them by their last name, that is Orange.</span> <span id="s81">From Orange, from France that is how they are called.</span> <span id="s82">Well, during that revolution there were also big pogroms going on in the east of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Poland, Russia, Rumania, Hungary.</span> <span id="s85">People start fleeing to the west, Jews, away from the pogroms.</span> <span id="s86">They arrived by hundreds and later by thousands in the same city, Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s87">But the Spanish Jews who had money, who were very educated, and were, many of them, from Spanish nobility.</span> <span id="s88">They formed a congregation there and the Spanish had a big synagogue, which we called a shul which is a German or Yiddish word for synagogue--school that means--house of learning.</span> <span id="s89">The Ashkenazim grew and lived in a short while in certain amount that they didn't need to search to pray with ten of them, 10 or 12 people anymore.</span> <span id="s90">But they had the means to build a church of themselves and they built it right across from the Portuguese, the Spanish we call Portuguese Synagogue.</span> <span id="s91">So now you have two big synagogues across from each other.</span> <span id="s92">The Ashkenazi grow so fast that they had to build another shul next to it.</span> <span id="s93">So you have the Great Shul, this was in competition with the Portuguese, Spanish shul.</span> <span id="s94">They called it, the Ashkenazi called themselves the Great Shul, and next to it there came another shul even bigger than that and that is called the Neie Shul, the New Shul.</span> <span id="s95">That was too small.</span> <span id="s96">They built especially for service through the week, they built a smaller shul next to it and kept mostly the big shuls for holidays, big holidays.</span> <span id="s97">They build a small weekly prayer shul next to it and that became, got the name of the Dritte Shul.</span> <span id="s98">The Dritte Shul that means the third shul.</span> <span id="s99">They still have not room enough.</span> <span id="s100">So they built a shul on top of the Dritte Shul and that became the Abovene Shul, the shul above.</span> <span id="s101">That were the official names.</span> <span id="s102">Next to it they got their own slaughterhouse so the Ashkenazim community grows much faster than the Portuguese community but the Portuguese community always was the richest.</span> <span id="s103">The Ashkenazim has mostly very poor members.</span> <span id="s104">My father was one of these.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Did he work in the diamond industry also?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">My father was not a diamond man.</span> <span id="s107">My father had, as as a small child, an accident.</span> <span id="s108">He was about six years old and that cost him a part of his foot.</span> <span id="s109">His heel was missing so he was--his mother thought he was not ready for that.</span> <span id="s110">Old time children, six years old had to work for a living.</span> <span id="s111">They were put in the family labor force.</span> <span id="s112">He was already--he had to go out already and make a living.</span> <span id="s113">He liked nursery business, plants and flowers and trees.</span> <span id="s114">In the middle of a city where there was no grass growing no more, you know, so crowded it was with people and houses.</span> <span id="s115">But that's what he did and that's what he grew up in.</span> <span id="s116">When I was a child, my father was always in the nursery business.</span> <span id="s117">If you know the Dutch climate, that is not so good for a peddler because he had to be a peddler with a hand-push cart and peddle his wares around the houses, mostly on the outskirts of town because there is where the people had little gardens and that is why he also could sell his merchandise.</span> <span id="s118">The weather is rainy, windy.</span> <span id="s119">If the sun, it is too hot so most of--at least half of his merchandise could not be sold any more by the end of the day because it was ruined from the climate.</span> <span id="s120">So he always barely scraped a living for his wife and six children.</span> <span id="s121">The street where we lived was a very long street and that was called the Rapenburger Straat.</span> <span id="s122">That's just a Dutch name.</span> <span id="s123">In the center of Amsterdam this street was a little better than other slums around it.</span> <span id="s124">Where people lived in apartments, that means one room, barely any windows and no sun there.</span> <span id="s125">We had sun there, we had a kitchen, we had one room with built in the walls, cabinet-like beds.</span> <span id="s126">You could open up the doors and there you had a kind of a bed there.</span> <span id="s127">That is what we had.</span> <span id="s128">Furthermore, when the family grew, in the apartment, we got some beds set around the walls.</span> <span id="s129">It was a big room, very light.</span> <span id="s130">In the back of the building was a home for the older people and they had a beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s131">We lived, you could say, in the top of the trees because we lived on the third floor and the trees just reached up to our windows.</span> <span id="s132">We had the doves and the birds always in front of the window and beautiful flowers to look at in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s133">We were not that bad off although we were very, very poor but that you only realized later because everybody was poor.</span> <span id="s134">So you didn't know you was poor.</span> <span id="s135">Everybody had the same struggle to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s136">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Can you tell me about the observance, the Jewish observance?</span> <span id="s138">Did you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">That is what I just wanted to start with.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Oh, good, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">The street where I lived, the Rapenburgerstraat had seven shuls.</span> <span id="s142">The street came out on the market, on that square where we had the big shuls across from each other.</span> <span id="s143">But then you also had the little--what you call a gevere shul.</span> <span id="s144">You understand that, gevere shul from Gawwer?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Chaverim.</span> <span id="s147">If you have ten people together, they could form a kehilla, a gemeinda and a community.</span> <span id="s148">So we had seven of these in the street and we have a seminary where people were trained to be rabbis.</span> <span id="s149">We had across from there a big shul where we went to school with hundreds of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s150">We used to work for the Hebrew work___(143) for a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s151">We just said Jewish, the School of the Jews.</span> <span id="s152">That is how we called it.</span> <span id="s153">In fact I said there were hundreds of children when we were at that school.</span> <span id="s154">The education at that school was not too much.</span> <span id="s155">We learned Hebrew but we never knew what we were saying.</span> <span id="s156">We didn't learn too much of translation.</span> <span id="s157">We were too young for that--already at nine years old I moved to the outskirts.</span> <span id="s158">As I just said, we moved to another part.</span> <span id="s159">That is how it was downtown for people to scrape a living together and where people were also watching out for each other.</span> <span id="s160">If there was a family, they knew they had no food, then they always get something from the neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">But did you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">My mother tried to; my father had to work on Shabbos because on the weekend people had money.</span> <span id="s163">That was his best day.</span> <span id="s164">My mother tried to keep kosher.</span> <span id="s165">We called ourselves the Jews of the white Hamoutse tablecloth.</span> <span id="s166">On Friday night, moutze was made, kiddush was made and there was a white tablecloth on the table.</span> <span id="s167">If you didn't have much food during the week, on Shabbos there was always something to eat.</span> <span id="s168">Shabbos was always an extra thing.</span> <span id="s169">We had a wonderful family--my mother had several sisters and brothers and they hung together like glue.</span> <span id="s170">Saturday night, I remember, that we always came together by one of the sisters or the brothers in the house.</span> <span id="s171">All the brothers with all the children and believe me, there were more than forty children sometimes in the small houses.</span> <span id="s172">We slept everywhere because it was too late for the children to move out and the parents wanted to sit around a little bit to tell--to mind each other's business, you know, and to tell stories and sing together a little bit.</span> <span id="s173">We call that shabbosmachen.</span> <span id="s174">Then the children, they slept wherever they could find a place and by eleven or twelve o'clock, every parent picks up his own children and then we went to our own house, the children sleeping.</span> <span id="s175">I remember my father always two children in his arm, my mother had one, my oldest brother had one.</span> <span id="s176">That is how we went to our own apartment which was not--we lived a few blocks from each other.</span> <span id="s177">The distance was not very much.</span> <span id="s178">But it could be that there's a small child; he was playing in street; that was our place to play, in the streets.</span> <span id="s179">Then suddenly he was picked up by somebody and you heard the voice, oh, Shatsy, Shatsy, Liebling, you know.</span> <span id="s180">They are the wonderful names that they call small children; by my treasure, by my wonderful baby, you know.</span> <span id="s181">There you was in the arms of an aunt or an uncle.</span> <span id="s182">They just have to pick you up, they recognize you, you was one of the brothers' or sisters' children.</span> <span id="s183">They have to hug you a little bit and kiss you all over.</span> <span id="s184">You sit down wet from that and then they always give you a penny or they give you a piece of candy.</span> <span id="s185">Yeah, we were--the families were wonderful together, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">That's nice, it sounds--.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">If I can, if I find a way to do it tomorrow morning, I will make a little statistic, how many brothers and sisters my father and mother had; how many children all have together and how many came back after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Oh, that will--.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">I will try to make a statistic tomorrow morning and enclose it.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">That will be great.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">But it will be handwritten.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Because I hate to use the typewriter.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">I'm a one-finger typewriter man.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">So when we were nine years old--, when I was--.</span> <span id="s198">We went to shul, the shul was such that, I say shul, I mean the religious school, the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s199">It was such: in the morning, 7:30 I had to go to one of the seven little shuls in the street where we lived and say my morning prayers.</span> <span id="s200">I was not yet 13 years old so I did not wear a tallis but I wear, I had to wear a arbcanfous.</span> <span id="s201">You know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Yes, tzitziot.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">I used to wear that, my brothers and me, we all did.</span> <span id="s205">My mother used to knit them together and a neighbor who know exactly how to knit the tzitzis we called them, he know and he made them on the corners.</span> <span id="s206">We had to wear them under our clothes.</span> <span id="s207">But I remember that we never showed them.</span> <span id="s208">We put the tzitzi in the clothes that you can see always a picture, you see of Jews, tzitzi are hanging out.</span> <span id="s209">No, we didn't have such a thing.</span> <span id="s210">We used to--well, the law said, the Jewish law said you have to wear them visible.</span> <span id="s211">No, we didn't do, we just put them in our pants.</span> <span id="s212">Then at the school, they also took care--very several charity of these people, also organized charities that we, the poor kids, got by Chanukah, that we got some new clothes.</span> <span id="s213">Our whole school, all the boys wearing the same sweater.</span> <span id="s214">Because that was bought en masse and handed out to the children.</span> <span id="s215">And the same shoes, the same kind of stockings, the same cap.</span> <span id="s216">Then that became uniform in the time that I remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">So you attended--?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">(Interjects) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s219">In the morning, we did our morning prayers, that was about thirty minutes.</span> <span id="s220">Then I went home I got my breakfast from Mother and by nine o'clock I had to be at the elementary school, public.</span> <span id="s221">That was the government school.</span> <span id="s222">You know where you had to--the deal was--nobody could get away from that.</span> <span id="s223">You had to be at school and get your education, your Dutch education.</span> <span id="s224">By 12 o'clock we were out and we were expected to be, by 1 o'clock back, in the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s225">So we had time from 12 to 1 to eat, go back to eat, ______.</span> <span id="s226">Until about a quarter to two, we got our Hebrew lessons and then rush up to the elementary school back till 4:30.</span> <span id="s227">Five o'clock, Jewish school again.</span> <span id="s228">Six o'clock or 6:30, they let us go and we could go home where we got a bite to eat and I had to be for my night prayers, we call it xlaymen, what we said, okay.</span> <span id="s229">At eight o'clock we had to be back at shul and by nine o'clock I came home and you didn't know no more the whole day because everything flooded to each other.</span> <span id="s230">Then by nine o'clock we were back in bed.</span> <span id="s231">That is in that part of the city.</span> <span id="s232">Then when we moved to the outskirts of town because the houses were so dilapidated while we lived downtown that they razed that part of the town.</span> <span id="s233">They razed it and built new houses.</span> <span id="s234">The city, the government city, the city government found us new places to live.</span> <span id="s235">That was on the outskirt of town.</span> <span id="s236">Also was a little Jewish congregation, I right away became a member of.</span> <span id="s237">We lived there for three years on the outskirt of town where we played, just like downtown, we played in the street.</span> <span id="s238">We fought with the non-Jewish children like you have to.</span> <span id="s239">That didn't fight us because they were antisemite.</span> <span id="s240">No, we were not of their religion so they had to fight us and we had to fight them because they were not of our religion.</span> <span id="s241">Sunday morning, we had also some Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s242">In order not to disturb the citizens who wanted to go to church, we could not play in recess out in the street.</span> <span id="s243">We had to go up the roof of the school.</span> <span id="s244">It was a high building and a big fence around the roof and we had to play there till recess was over.</span> <span id="s245">The few people--I was not the nicest kid--we wanted to play tricks on people, you know, like young people do, all kind of little, mean things.</span> <span id="s246">So as soon as we were up on our way to the roof, for recess, we slipped out with five or six boys from the same class and we went to a school that was just around the corner; a Sunday School for the Catholic people.</span> <span id="s247">The Bethesda school, they called it.</span> <span id="s248">That's where we got a cookie, that's why we went there, for the cookie.</span> <span id="s249">They knew we were coming and they had a few chairs ready for us and we ate the cookie and then they let us go, real fast.</span> <span id="s250">Then we went to another street about three blocks farther and there was a Salvation Army Sunday School That was much nicer because they played music there, the trumpet and the drums and we listened there and then we got a cup of chocolate.</span> <span id="s251">So we got a chocolate and we got a cookie and they let us go because everybody knew that the Jewish children had to be back at recess on time.</span> <span id="s252">Then we went up to the roof just in time to make it back in class.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Yeah, that is how we spend our Sunday, our Sunday mornings.</span> <span id="s255">Like I said, I learned, I start learning Hebrew when I was three years old, I had to go already.</span> <span id="s256">That was normal and I was about 13 years old when I had my Bar Mitzvah; we lived already in the other part of the town again.</span> <span id="s257">So I had about nine or ten years of Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s258">When I was through with it, I still didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s259">I had a wonderful Bar Mitzvah--at that time we lived also in another part of the town.</span> <span id="s260">There were also government houses, you would call it here projects; were for poor people who couldn't pay the normal rent.</span> <span id="s261">We lived there and then when I was 13 years old and I did my Bar Mitzvah in the neighborhood where we just came from, that was the Indies (262) quarter.</span> <span id="s262">We called it the Indies quarter because all the streets there had names of the Netherlands Indies.</span> <span id="s263">Where we lived, now that was what you call the South African quarters, the Transvaalbuurt quarter because that's where all the streets have names from South Africa.</span> <span id="s264">Because they live so many Dutch there.</span> <span id="s265">I went back to the Indies quarter to do my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s266">Right after that I quit the whole thing and became a member of a Social Democratic Youth organization.</span> <span id="s267">I will enclose a picture in there where you see me about that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Yeah, when we were members of that organization.</span> <span id="s270">This was-o-you can compare that if you have ever heard, with the Bund in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">You have heard of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Well, our organization was something like that but we were not strictly Jewish, that was not in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s275">In the Netherlands, I don't know if you know that, but the big organized movement started about out in the Netherlands and we had several Jewish leaders who really built a labor movement in the Netherlands, better than in Germany or in France or in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">No, I didn't --.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">We had a very strong Social Democratic movement and when I became an adolescent later on, I went to--I tell you my story there in a minute from the school.</span> <span id="s278">In my adolescence, we fought on the one side the communists and on the other side, we fought the fascists, but that was already in the thirties, I guess.</span> <span id="s279">I was eleven years old when I finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s280">My oldest brother was sure he was already through with school and he learned how to be a baker.</span> <span id="s281">My sister had to be a seamstress.</span> <span id="s282">When I came from school, the principal told my father that I had to go to a school for higher learning.</span> <span id="s283">In the higher learning, my father didn't see too much of a future in that because the Depression was on that time.</span> <span id="s284">Remember, I was born 1917, 1929 the Depression started.</span> <span id="s285">So by the time I was out of school people started roaming the streets for work and for food.</span> <span id="s286">All over the world.</span> <span id="s287">It was very bad in western Europe too.</span> <span id="s288">My father didn't want me to roam street; he thought if you go to higher school, you don't learn a trade and only with a trade you can make a living.</span> <span id="s289">So I had to learn to make a living and I went to a trade school.</span> <span id="s290">I was close to fourteen years old, I was still 13 years old, when I finished that trade school but it forced me to learn--to be a pastry maker.</span> <span id="s291">I wanted to be a tool and die maker, I liked that very much, to build machine and machine parts but they told me that I was better to be a pastry maker.</span> <span id="s292">I became a pastry maker and after I came out of school, they took care that I had a job in a place.</span> <span id="s293">That was a place where I got very sick because I couldn't stand--I couldn't handle the atmosphere, the climate in a bakery, hot, dusty, stinking, dirty, terrible, always floating dust.</span> <span id="s294">The air was always thick from the flour and the sugar and the baking from the oven.</span> <span id="s295">I got very sick and after about a year, my father took me out there.</span> <span id="s296">My mother said let him go back to school now.</span> <span id="s297">You know what the principal said, he needs to be in education, in higher learning.</span> <span id="s298">My father said no, he's going to be a tailor.</span> <span id="s299">Everybody needs a patch in his pants.</span> <span id="s300">By then it was 1931, about, and I became a tailor.</span> <span id="s301">I cried my heart out but it didn't help; I had to be a tailor which I still am.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">I'm in the tailoring because I have a very--my ability to learn is pretty good--and since I had to be a best tailor--if I had to be a tailor, I wanted to be the best that there was.</span> <span id="s304">I studied hard and later on I became a master tailor which is a high degree.</span> <span id="s305">Then I got my business diploma but that was afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">But it--.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">In 1939 I started out for myself.</span> <span id="s308">All this time from 1931 till about 1937, I was an apprentice.</span> <span id="s309">In 1937, I had to go for the military draft but my brother--it was still Depression--my brother at that time planned to go to Spain to fight in the International Brigade against Spanish; there was a civil war going on.</span> <span id="s310">He wanted to fight against Franco, the fascist.</span> <span id="s311">There was some problems, he never had work, my brother, so I was practically the breadwinner in the family.</span> <span id="s312">I didn't make much but I was the breadwinner so I got a year's suspension from--I don't know how you call that, suspension, a year later I needed to come into the draft, military.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Deferment.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Deferment, okay.</span> <span id="s315">I don't even know that word.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Now you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Now I know.</span> <span id="s318">In 1938, it was my turn to be--to go back into the military but then I decided instead of going to be back in the military, I wanted to take an extra service, a special service.</span> <span id="s319">That means you stay civilian, but always ready to be called in and do your duty as a military.</span> <span id="s320">Meanwhile you can go on in your civilian duty as long as it is social work, you know, doing--.</span> <span id="s321">I wanted to do that anyway so I became a nurse in the Jewish Invalid which was a hospital by that name.</span> <span id="s322">The only hospital in the whole world that we know, that took care, that took people from the street, out of the gutters, homeless people as long as they were Jewish and gave them a home.</span> <span id="s323">Paralyzed people, demented people, mentally ill people; they all found a home in that particular house.</span> <span id="s324">It was a big hospital right in the center of Amsterdam and I became a nurse there.</span> <span id="s325">One of the nurses there, the most beautiful one, she became my wife.</span> <span id="s326">She pushed me out after about a little over a year and she said if you want to get ever married with me, then you better make a living as a tailor because here you don't make a penny.</span> <span id="s327">In the hospital, they work for just board and room and since we couldn't get a room; the male nurses couldn't get a room in the hospital, there were the female nurses.</span> <span id="s328">That is the thing, why should you, you could not sleep in the same house, you could not live in the same house.</span> <span id="s329">The female nurses had a place to sleep, they all had their rooms but the men you had to find them outside and for that you got five guilders a month to pay.</span> <span id="s330">And they would send the five guilders to my mother because I slept at the house.</span> <span id="s331">But I ate, always came from the hospital where I lived.</span> <span id="s332">Then I went away from the hospital.</span> <span id="s333">My older brother took my place; he finally got a job that way and I went back in the tailoring business.</span> <span id="s334">Right after that, the mobilization started because Germany made noises and you know it attacked Poland in '39.</span> <span id="s335">The Netherlands start mobilizing and I thought that since I am a tailor and most of the people in the private market, they started to work in the black market because a lot of things--imports were forbidden.</span> <span id="s336">A lot of things had to be done for the government.</span> <span id="s337">I decided I go to the military warehouse and apply to be a tailor there.</span> <span id="s338">I could better work there, you understand.</span> <span id="s339">That somebody you get together had no means to prepare to compare with what you could make on the black market but I was never a black market man anyway.</span> <span id="s340">I thought that I will do my duty for the country and I will help with the mobilization and make uniforms as fast as I can.</span> <span id="s341">By that time, I became a cutter in the warehouse and within a week that I was there I got my draft notice because I was still in special military, you know, civilian military.</span> <span id="s342">I went to my major, the manager of the warehouse and I said I have to go and report to my detail in Utrecht in another city.</span> <span id="s343">He said what are you going to do there?</span> <span id="s344">I said well, as I see here, I am going in air force.</span> <span id="s345">That means we have to shoot airplanes down from the ground.</span> <span id="s346">How you call them, the ground service, you know.</span> <span id="s347">But it was part of the air force.</span> <span id="s348">As I see here.</span> <span id="s349">He says what do you know about it.</span> <span id="s350">I says nothing, I never served.</span> <span id="s351">It is the first thing I get about it.</span> <span id="s352">So he called the commander in Utrecht, the other city, and he said I have a tailor here who is a good tailor and knows more about tailoring than he knows about shooting planes down.</span> <span id="s353">I keep him here and let's change services and make him a military here.</span> <span id="s354">I became a civilian military in military service in Amsterdam in the military warehouses where I was a cutter and we cut uniforms as fast as we could, thousands a day.</span> <span id="s355">They were sent out to sweatshops where they made the uniforms so the military could get dressed.</span> <span id="s356">The same way weapons were made, we were part of that complex.</span> <span id="s357">When the war started, May 10, I was in the night shift because we worked two shifts, three shifts in 24 hours.</span> <span id="s358">Early in the morning, it start dawning a little bit, light enough, four o'clock in the night, it start getting away, light enough.</span> <span id="s359">We saw the Germans planes coming over; we were also a target because we were military warehouses.</span> <span id="s360">I was trained already, a few months before, as the head, the commander of one of the air raid shelters, we had four air raid shelters, 350 persons could sleep in an air raid shelter and I was the commander of one.</span> <span id="s361">I had to stay there for the eight hours service as tailor and then eight hours service as an air raid shelter man.</span> <span id="s362">I still had eight hours left in the 24 hours and I repored for the city and became an ambulance man for the, what you call the National Guard.</span> <span id="s363">I became part of the National Guard.</span> <span id="s364">Because I had the training as a male nurse so they could use me in the ambulance.</span> <span id="s365">My mother never knew in this five days' war that we had, was where she could me bring me food because nobody had food for you.</span> <span id="s366">We just went from one place to the other to do our duties and my mother just had to find out, since one of my brothers had a bicycle, find out where Rood is and bring him his lunch, or bring him his dinner, or bring him his breakfast.</span> <span id="s367">That is how we went though the war and then the war was over and everybody was very distraught about it that the Germans won.</span> <span id="s368">Lots of Jewish people, especially prominent Jewish people, killed themselves.</span> <span id="s369">We had a big contingent of German refugees, Jewish, in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s370">They knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s371">We heard a lot before.</span> <span id="s372">When I worked as a male nurse in the Jewish hospital, that was on a square in the middle of the Jewish neighborhood in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s373">Very modern hospital, very modern, beautiful building, grass all over.</span> <span id="s374">Across from that hospital, there was a hotel, in the middle of town, Hotel Rotterdam was its name.</span> <span id="s375">The leaders of the hospital put me in the night shift because they figured I was politically motivated for the following jobs.</span> <span id="s376">In the Hotel Rotterdam, across the street, German refugees who came over the border without passports, without clothes many times, were chased out of Germany, fled out of Germany, many times broke, desperate at the borders and chased into the Netherlands while the state police was waiting to send them back to Germany because they had no papers, they had no nothing.</span> <span id="s377">So they had to be smuggled into the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s378">Already a few years before, especially since 1938, Kristallnacht, I was part of the--a member of a group that caught people that came over the border and smuggled them farther in to Amsterdam where there was shelter available for them.</span> <span id="s379">The Jewish community took care of them.</span> <span id="s380">It was forbidden so we were always chased by the state police.</span> <span id="s381">In the Jewish hospital, they know my background.</span> <span id="s382">They put me in the night shift in order to catch the people, to receive the people which Hotel Rotterdam sent over to our hospital.</span> <span id="s383">It was such, Hotel Rotterdam that they harbored illegal German refugee Jews.</span> <span id="s384">The police, once in a while, raided that hospital.</span> <span id="s385">When they catch these people, they put them in prison and drag them back to Germany where they would be killed.</span> <span id="s386">There was also in the police--we had some good help.</span> <span id="s387">They warned Hotel Rotterdam in advance that there was a raid coming; that the police would come and catch whatever they had in the house, that were not legal.</span> <span id="s388">The Hotel Rotterdam right away called across the street to the Jewish hospital and said open your doors, five men are coming over, ten men are coming over, two men are coming over, whatever he had in the house.</span> <span id="s389">I rushed, I got the calls and that is why I was placed in the night shift, I got the calls, rushed downstairs to the back entrance.</span> <span id="s390">It was in the middle alleyway down to the street, open the fence doors, the gates, we had a little gate there.</span> <span id="s391">I had the keys, opened the doors and then I saw these people dressed in a bedsheet, without shoes many times, some of them are dressed.</span> <span id="s392">They start running over, there were little grass fields on the square, running over the grass fields, I had the door open, got them in there, put them in the elevator, upstairs and put them in the beds between the other patients.</span> <span id="s393">Many times we had the police checking because there was a suspicion that we smuggled patients into the country--that is refugees into the country.</span> <span id="s394">Then we gave these people many times, very hot coffee or very hot tea and then they blowed up.</span> <span id="s395">We said drink, drink, drink, and they look like they have a fever and then the patrol came, you know, and they check the beds in the wards and in the rooms where we had these people hidden and they saw them laying.</span> <span id="s396">We told them, we looked at the so-called police and said, high fever, oh, boy, nah, this is contagious.</span> <span id="s397">Then they went back.</span> <span id="s398">That kind of tricks we have to play to save the people life.</span> <span id="s399">As a matter of fact, the men that came later, my brother-in-law came into the country that way, a German Jew.</span> <span id="s400">In one of the statements, I think he will be named in there.</span> <span id="s401">Julius Stern, he married my sister-in-law, my wife's youngest sister.</span> <span id="s402">He was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s403">later on he opened a business.</span> <span id="s404">He was a butcher, what they called him a meisterwurstmacher, you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Salami-maker.</span> <span id="s407">He was a master in it like I was a master in my trade, he was a master in that.</span> <span id="s408">He opened his business and did very well till he got deported.</span> <span id="s409">German Jews got deported first.</span> <span id="s410">But anyway, -- Is this--, is your wife's sister, Ursula Stern?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">No, no.</span> <span id="s412">They are not related.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">They're not.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">You are talking about Ursula who was in show before?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">No, no.</span> <span id="s417">I do not know about that lady because I think she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s418">I only know from Weinberg-- what is her name-- Yeah, Selma Engle, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Engle, Yeah Weinberg.</span> <span id="s420">Only from her I know; I spoke with her several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Anyway let's go back to 1940.</span> <span id="s423">The war was over in five days, not because the Dutch couldn't fight but the Netherlands is not a country where you can fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">I have to stop you because I have to flip the tape over.</span> <span id="s425">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Okay.</span> <span id="s427">(End of Side A).</span> <span id="s428">. . . by the warehouse.</span> <span id="s429">A lot of Jewish tailors, we had lots of Jewish tailors in Amsterdam and also diamond workers, but the tailors that were working, we went to our work.</span> <span id="s430">We were closed out.</span> <span id="s431">The Jews were closed out, only the non-Jews could come to work.</span> <span id="s432">But we have to report two times a day, every time on a different location.</span> <span id="s433">We had to put, there was a stamp to place on our card, that we reported for work.</span> <span id="s434">We were not allowed to work because the Germans did not want any Jews in that place of work.</span> <span id="s435">That went for a while.</span> <span id="s436">We got our salary paid because we were still Dutch employed, we never got fired.</span> <span id="s437">We just wanted to work.</span> <span id="s438">Then came the time that I wanted to get married and we should get married September the first, the 4th, the 4th.</span> <span id="s439">September 4, my father was very sick by that time, the year before he was already in the hospital, he had a bad heart and stomach ailment.</span> <span id="s440">The doctor said you can keep the diet and live for, I don't know how long, but you can eat all you want and I give you just one year to live.</span> <span id="s441">My father said, I have so little to eat in my life, I can eat all I want.</span> <span id="s442">A year later, he died.</span> <span id="s443">Now September 4, we should get married.</span> <span id="s444">My father was very sick the night before.</span> <span id="s445">There was curfew' by eight o'clock you had to be into your house.</span> <span id="s446">My wife-to-be and me, we had an apartment fixed.</span> <span id="s447">______(16), you didn't live off your parents.</span> <span id="s448">As soon as you could, you let your parents live off you.</span> <span id="s449">You took care that money came into the house so that everybody had a bite to eat.</span> <span id="s450">Also an apartment, a good apartment, yours!</span> <span id="s451">We put furniture in there, we put food in the cabinet, put your beds up there.</span> <span id="s452">You know, make an apartment living, able to live in.</span> <span id="s453">You did it all yourself.</span> <span id="s454">You saved your money for that.</span> <span id="s455">So we saved our money for two years in order to have a house of our own, a decent apartment.</span> <span id="s456">The last rent (22) we put on the apartment, it was now about seven o'clock at night and we were waiting for my father and mother to come and look at our apartment and say ah and oh, you know, like parents are supposed to say.</span> <span id="s457">It became seven o'clock, my wife had to be back in the hospital where she still worked as a nurse and it was curfew, she couldn't be on the street.</span> <span id="s458">I took her to the hospital but it was not too far.</span> <span id="s459">You had to do everything real running.</span> <span id="s460">I went to the hospital and then I went straight home from the center to the east part of the town and I just made it at eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s461">I came in the house and told my mother you should come and look at the house, you didn't do it, what happened?</span> <span id="s462">She said Father just got very, very sick.</span> <span id="s463">Look at him.</span> <span id="s464">There I saw my father laying down and covered with black blood.</span> <span id="s465">When we know black blood, that was the stomach.</span> <span id="s466">He had a, how you call that, a rupture, a stomach eruption?</span> <span id="s467">you know and the blood come out on the top and on the bottom.</span> <span id="s468">My mother said, we had big bedrooms in that house, let Father sleep in the bed next to it and you and Aaron and all the brothers sleep together tonight so you both can keep an eye on Papa.</span> <span id="s469">Because if something happens, I have to make--I cannot help him by myself.</span> <span id="s470">That was too heavy for her.</span> <span id="s471">That is what we did.</span> <span id="s472">My father went, he was not conscious that time and he went to sleep in the bed next to us.</span> <span id="s473">In the morning, as my habit was six o'clock I came out the bed, first because that was my wedding day, my suit was hanging already that I made for myself special; we didn't have many things.</span> <span id="s474">The good suit you made for yourself, to get married in.</span> <span id="s475">It was hanging there, beautiful and I went to the bed of my father and I saw that he was dead.</span> <span id="s476">I had to tell my mother that Father passed away and then we couldn't get married.</span> <span id="s477">I had to go to my fiancee to the hospital to tell her that the wedding for the day was off because Father died.</span> <span id="s478">Now that week came out an order from the Germans, the Germans now, that was the people what told the government what to do, the Dutch government.</span> <span id="s479">The government itself, the cabinet and the queen they fled to England.</span> <span id="s480">We had a skeleton government left in the Netherlands who had to do the German orders.</span> <span id="s481">The order came that gatherings were not allowed no more for Jews.</span> <span id="s482">Jews could not be seen on the streets demonstrating.</span> <span id="s483">Now the lawaaye, the lawaaye that is the funeral, the procession had to go from our house--my father was laid out in our house.</span> <span id="s484">Lawaaye, you know what that is?</span> <span id="s485">And chewre kadusja?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s488">They came to our house and took care of everything.</span> <span id="s489">They coffined my father.</span> <span id="s490">I was the only, at that time, I was the only one who had a tallis because you remember my past, I was very orthodox, my past.</span> <span id="s491">We tore the tallis, you cannot put a good tallis into--with a corpse--you have to destroy it partly.</span> <span id="s492">So we tore the tallis up and we buried it with my father.</span> <span id="s493">My father, it was forbidden to have behind the hearse more than one automobile.</span> <span id="s494">It was forbidden because more automobiles would be a demonstration.</span> <span id="s495">The people from everywhere know that this was a funeral that could not have a procession.</span> <span id="s496">People came from everywhere and walked on the sidewalks up with the hearse.</span> <span id="s497">The hearse in the middle, we, the family in the automobile and then on the sides were people walking.</span> <span id="s498">The few streets and then we have to speed up and go to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s499">My wife and me, we had to get married because we have an apartment.</span> <span id="s500">If you have an apartment in those days, every thing was very suspicious.</span> <span id="s501">Those days you wasn't trust for anything.</span> <span id="s502">If I have an apartment and I didn't move into it, I could be arrested.</span> <span id="s503">They arrested you first and then ask let's find out what you did.</span> <span id="s504">You was arrested first.</span> <span id="s505">We know already by experience, once you were arrested by German SS and the Nazis, it was very hard to get out in one piece.</span> <span id="s506">A week later we got married for the city, my wife and me.</span> <span id="s507">Then we could move in our apartment.</span> <span id="s508">We didn't but we made it as somebody lived there, it looked like.</span> <span id="s509">then a week after that, the 18th, we got, what we called our chuppah, you know, for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s510">Same thing, no demonstrations, no gatherings.</span> <span id="s511">In the street where I lived as a child, that long, long street with the seven shuls, there was the seminary as I told you already and both of next door was the central rabbinate.</span> <span id="s512">The head rabbi had his office in the house where the shul was.</span> <span id="s513">That's where we got married.</span> <span id="s514">The shul, itself, didn't held too many people.</span> <span id="s515">I think two hundred people could go in that shul.</span> <span id="s516">That was not too many for what you were used to in the old country.</span> <span id="s517">They opened the windows wide because people gathered in the streets, not for our wedding but for the demonstration.</span> <span id="s518">To defy the German occupiers, you know, and they over in the street to be part of our wedding.</span> <span id="s519">The whole wedding was broadcasted out of this window.</span> <span id="s520">We didn't have microphones or radio, broadcasted out in the street.</span> <span id="s521">My father's funeral and our wedding was the first public demonstrations against the Germans.</span> <span id="s522">We defied the Germans.</span> <span id="s523">That is how we got married in 1940.</span> <span id="s524">The next morning I had to go--remember we had to report to the warehouse that we were still there, we had to get a stamp on our card; otherwise if you refuse to go to work, you could be arrested.</span> <span id="s525">Somewhere else you would be fired.</span> <span id="s526">No, they--whatever reason they could find, you would be arrested.</span> <span id="s527">We went there and we found out that we are fired, all the Jews were fired so that was a very pleasant no-work.</span> <span id="s528">The same day I found very sarcastic no, no, sarcastic is not the word, ironical, very ironical.</span> <span id="s529">I found work for a place that took old suits and turned them inside out.</span> <span id="s530">Made new suits with the inside out.</span> <span id="s531">That people, that was a company that also cleaned clothes for citizens, normal cleaning, dry-cleaning but also had a lot of work for the German army.</span> <span id="s532">They put me to work.</span> <span id="s533">I got to work in a business that lived off the Germans and I had to put suits inside out, you know, the inside out.</span> <span id="s534">I made so good money that time that I could have--I was out of the house, I could take care of my mother, a widow by then and she had a stroke by then, too and my little sister and my younger brother.</span> <span id="s535">I could hire a few people.</span> <span id="s536">My second brother, Jonas, was still POW by the Germans but if they could get work, if they had guarantee of signed declaration that they could find work, they could go in the city of--society; they let them go.</span> <span id="s537">I signed the papers and I got my brother Yonas work so a lot of people got work in my little business which I was very proud of.</span> <span id="s538">That went on till I was deported, till I had to report myself for a labor camp which I sent you also pictures of.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Oh, great.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">With, you will see me.</span> <span id="s541">I will cross, you know, mark the one who I am when I send you the pictures.</span> <span id="s542">That's about it.</span> <span id="s543">The 1930's, the depression years, I was a member of the Social Democratic Youth Organization which, by the way, this year, in September, in the Netherlands, we will have a reunion.</span> <span id="s544">We are all in our seventies and eighties then.</span> <span id="s545">At that time, we were very young people, very demonstrative, very hard, active in the Spanish Civil War, fighting against the Germany, we had Nazis in the Netherlands too, fighting against the German influence, fighting against the Nazis, and on the left side, fighting against the communists on the other side.</span> <span id="s546">The Social Democrats were right in the middle.</span> <span id="s547">I was already, when I was 15 years old, I stayed out all night.</span> <span id="s548">Father and Mother didn't even know that I was not in bed.</span> <span id="s549">I snuck out of the house with my older brother and we painted and we put on posters on walls, you know, and put fliers up.</span> <span id="s550">All political work, that's what we did.</span> <span id="s551">I got a very political but also a very cultural education in that youth organization because they thought poor children who barely got an education; we have a duty to educate the poor children.</span> <span id="s552">I was one of them, got a good education in that organization.</span> <span id="s553">We learned a lot about world history, nature, education that you would get in the lower classes at the college, at the college, yes.</span> <span id="s554">That is the kind of education we got.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Can I ask you--your organization it was called the Social Democratic Youth or did it have a specific --?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">No, our organization did not have the name Social Democratic in it although we were.</span> <span id="s557">We were called AJC.</span> <span id="s558">Just like here in American Jewish Congress?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">The same initials.</span> <span id="s561">I am a member again of the AJC.</span> <span id="s562">The Dutch name is Arbeid Jeugd Centrale.</span> <span id="s563">That means Labor Youth Central.</span> <span id="s564">That was international, that organization.</span> <span id="s565">I know a closer picture when I am very young in that organization, about 13 years old, 13 or 14 years old, I will have a picture in there that we are of a little group.</span> <span id="s566">That will be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">In that organization, as I said, we got a very cultural education.</span> <span id="s569">They saw in me somebody who could use his mouth a lot, not always for the good, but I did.</span> <span id="s570">They decided that besides me to become one of the leaders, I had to get an education in theater and get a training to be an actor.</span> <span id="s571">That is what I learned, you got it from professionals, yeah.</span> <span id="s572">We played in a lot of plays, we played a lot of Shakespeare, we played a lot of Lessing, we played a lot of Moliere.</span> <span id="s573">Oh yeah, we played all Greek plays, Midsummer Night's Dream, that was one of our favorites.</span> <span id="s574">That is what we got and for a little poor boy who had to go to work when he was not 14 years old, had to go to work, that was quite a bit.</span> <span id="s575">I'm very proud of it, that I got that education.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">I'm sure.</span> <span id="s577">It's very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">It made me very strong-willed, not stepping aside for anybody which I still don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Good.</span> <span id="s580">Are there any incidents or episodes that you didn't recount to me.</span> <span id="s581">Perhaps something that happened in your family--?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">That happened in my family--.</span> <span id="s583">As I said we were very poor, but that was normal.</span> <span id="s584">Sanitary, my mother always took care of that, that we have that.</span> <span id="s585">She was a very strong, willing woman and very good brains.</span> <span id="s586">I was very sick already when I was three years old.</span> <span id="s587">I got an eye sickness.</span> <span id="s588">Amsterdam is a sailor town and big harbor was there.</span> <span id="s589">Sailors brought the sickness in which they called trachoma.</span> <span id="s590">They brought it in and it became an epidemic in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s591">My little brother was barely two years old and I was close to four years old.</span> <span id="s592">No, we were--he was two years old when I was four, we both got that sickness.</span> <span id="s593">We suffered on that for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s594">Hospital in and hospital out.</span> <span id="s595">The medicare, no medicare is here, the care, the medical care for poor people was quite organized.</span> <span id="s596">That was taken care of.</span> <span id="s597">There was a professor, a doctor in Eie Care.</span> <span id="s598">He was always one of the leaders in the Social Democratic movement and he took care of poor people a whole lot.</span> <span id="s599">He healed us, my brother a little faster than me.</span> <span id="s600">We both were blind for awhile and then when I was ten years, that was the last I saw him.</span> <span id="s601">Still when I go to the doctor that finds leftovers on my eyelids, they can tell that I have trachoma when I was a child.</span> <span id="s602">There are scars on each side of there.</span> <span id="s603">Then I have several children's sickness, juvenile sicknesses, like the measles and diphtheria.</span> <span id="s604">I was quite a long in the hospital as a child.</span> <span id="s605">My mother always, day and night, she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s606">Then I had several operations like all children have -- appendix, and the throat, you know, what you call them, throat operations?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Tonsillectomy?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Tonsillectomy and all time there was no--few years was operated without any sedation.</span> <span id="s609">Well, the appendicitis, yes but my throat no, they just open your mouth, they cut the ____(170).</span> <span id="s610">They cut your ear and that was how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">School, sanitary care at the schools was very good.</span> <span id="s613">A lot better than I see here in the United States now.</span> <span id="s614">I'm talking about 70 years ago.</span> <span id="s615">There were--nurses came around from the government, from the city or from the government itself, came around always checking out children.</span> <span id="s616">When they found something that they didn't like or that was suspicious, you got a little note to the doctor and you went to the doctor and you was treated.</span> <span id="s617">There was no cost, not that I ever remember.</span> <span id="s618">We were treated a lot, especially the poor children because there was a lot of undernourishment.</span> <span id="s619">What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">This is probably, in terms of what I will need to fill in the information for our project, this is probably very, very comprehensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">My wife that I married, my first wife, she was not from Amsterdam, she worked in Amsterdam as a nurse but she was way out in the south of the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s622">Her father was a farmer, a cattleman, a Jewish cattleman in that little village, yeah it was a village.</span> <span id="s623">A very old village, older than 800 years at least.</span> <span id="s624">The Spanish were, there was a--they made a bridge there over the river, then the Spanish were fighting the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s625">The Netherlands revolted against the Spanish, the armies came in.</span> <span id="s626">That was one of the fighting points there.</span> <span id="s627">That little city, Geertrvidenberg, that's where my wife came from.</span> <span id="s628">At the time that I knew her, there were two Jewish families and there was a little shul smaller than a bedroom.</span> <span id="s629">That still is there but now it is a monument in the city of Geertrvidenberg because the Jews are no more there.</span> <span id="s630">There were two Jewish families.</span> <span id="s631">My father-in-law was a farmer, my mother-in-law, her brother, a bachelor and several sisters, they lived--that was all the family.</span> <span id="s632">They lived close to each other.</span> <span id="s633">My wife's oldest sister, she was kind of sick always and the Uncle Sam and the sisters took her in because they thought my mother-in--law had enough to do without her four children.</span> <span id="s634">They wanted her, they wanted the child in the house too and they lived close together anyway.</span> <span id="s635">So Betrina, the oldest, came in their house and was deported with them when the Germans deported them, they deport with them.</span> <span id="s636">My wife's--the next daughter--the one who was two years older than my wife was, she still is alive.</span> <span id="s637">She went safe underground and made it through the war.</span> <span id="s638">The next daughter, she went with the German vurstmacher, Julius Stern, went away.</span> <span id="s639">She lived in Amsterdam too.</span> <span id="s640">Her name was Hennie; Hennie that was from Hendrika.</span> <span id="s641">She lived next to the Franks--Anne Frank's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">When the Franks were underground, I have known these people.</span> <span id="s644">I have seen them.</span> <span id="s645">Because my Hennie, she lived in the family.</span> <span id="s646">She was at Meyer's the housekeeper and the family Meyer lived next to it.</span> <span id="s647">Same canal, same gracht.</span> <span id="s648">Then there was a brother, the youngest brother and he came through the war.</span> <span id="s649">He died beginning of this year, 1992, but he made it through the war.</span> <span id="s650">During the war, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, the second daughter, my wife and the youngest daughter, they all went underground.</span> <span id="s651">My wife was the only one active in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s652">The rest of them just were helped by other people and stayed underground until the war was over.</span> <span id="s653">That is my family-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">They were fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">They lived way out in the country and didn't follow any orders from the Germans that they had to go to Amsterdam to be registered and live in another house because that was promised.</span> <span id="s656">We take care of your house and we take care of your work, you will be working.</span> <span id="s657">That was all the lies around the deportation.</span> <span id="s658">They didn't believe them and they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s659">By that time, I was already in a labor camp, April 25, that you find in my register.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">I want to thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Did you get enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Okay.</span> <span id="s664">Now I'm going to take from you. . . .</span> <span id="s665">My sister was married to a non-Jew who was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s666">This Dutch people lived in Neurenberg, Germany.</span> <span id="s667">There he was born so he grew up a German.</span> <span id="s668">When Hitler came in power, all the--that is how Hitler had a solution to the unemployment in Germany.</span> <span id="s669">Sent all the people who are not Germans out of the country.</span> <span id="s670">So my brother-in-law Norbert, he had to go out of the country.</span> <span id="s671">He came into the Netherlands where he knew he had family and that's where he met my sister.</span> <span id="s672">He got a job, he married her, not my wife, my sister.</span> <span id="s673">He married her and saved her during the war.</span> <span id="s674">She was arrested once and he stepped into the headquarters or in the office where she was in the cell.</span> <span id="s675">He bossed them around because born in Germany, he know exactly how to talk to them and bawled them out, barked like a dog, you know, Let my wife go, what is the matter with you people?</span> <span id="s676">That is how he went.</span> <span id="s677">When he tried to save my mother, I was already in a labor camp, he only could see that the truck that was loaded just left the street.</span> <span id="s678">And he came to save her and he just came too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Well, that's too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">But he saved my sister during the war, my sister during the war.</span> <span id="s681">We are very grateful so he was my brother too.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Is it okay if I stop the tape now?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">That is fine.</span> <span id="s684">We had it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">NOTE: Corrections, both typographical and grammatical, were made by Mr. Rood
