Strauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born in Germany, Leipzig, on the 14th of July, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even before 1800.</span> <span id="s16">We were all Germans.</span> <span id="s17">My mother came from a little town named Luthenbeck, which is on the River Main.</span> <span id="s18">Uh...I know that my grandfather dealt in collecting fat to make soap.</span> <span id="s19">We're going back into the 1800s.</span> <span id="s20">And my father, named Leopold...uh...was born near, which is a little town...uh...the area is called.</span> <span id="s21">And his father dealt in animals.</span> <span id="s22">He was a trader of animals.</span> <span id="s23">My father...uh...grew up and was sent into an apprenticeship... uh...at a merchant, and he became a merchant, eventually specializing in the sale of specialty oils.</span> <span id="s24">He had a very interesting patent as a matter of fact, a patent where he...he was the sole distributor of that particular oil, made it possible to wash out lubricating oils which would spill from the weaving looms from bearings where it should lubricate, on to the fabric.</span> <span id="s25">And that made secondhand fabric which the cloth manufacturers could not sell.</span> <span id="s26">And his oil was the only oil in all of Germany that could be washed out, a washable lubricant.</span> <span id="s27">And with it, he became extremely successful.</span> <span id="s28">Uh...My father at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I, and because of that he had received one of the early automobiles as a war veteran.</span> <span id="s29">There was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s30">He was just a veteran and he very proudly all these years until the...1936-38 wore his...you know the iron cross on his lapel with great pride every day.</span> <span id="s31">He wouldn't go out without his decorations because he was very, very German.</span> <span id="s32">We were...like I am an American today with knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German.</span> <span id="s33">We routed for the German team to win in the Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the American sprinter, won several races.</span> <span id="s34">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s35">At that time I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s36">Uh...Germany said the black man is not a human being.</span> <span id="s37">They're more...or closer to animals and that's why he win and that's why he beat the Germans.</span> <span id="s38">That gave me an awful shock even though I knew what anti-Semitism was but...uh...but the fact that Hitler declared the black people animals, even as a young kid already, I smelled something that was very distasteful, and I stopped routing for the Germans and when I stopped routing for the Americans...Germans, and I started routing for the Americans.</span> <span id="s39">An interesting psychological thing that happened in 36.</span> <span id="s40">Well.</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">uh...my</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Tell me...tell me.</span> <span id="s44">.</span> <span id="s45">tell me a little bit about your siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s47">Uh...I had a sister, Marion, which is 8 years younger than I am....uh...born in Leipzig also.</span> <span id="s48">We had a very comfortable income.</span> <span id="s49">My father was one of the highest tax payers connected to you name it from the highest officials in the city down to...uh...being a..</span> <span id="s50">.</span> <span id="s51">uh.</span> <span id="s52">.</span> <span id="s53">executive...not executive director...on the executive board of the, which later came to haunt him because when he was arrested in 1939, he was arrested because his name was on this roster.</span> <span id="s54">Uh...My sister, Marion, and I went to school in the 30s.</span> <span id="s55">Went to public school until...I am not totally sure about the date, but I think 1933, 1934, all Jews were expelled from public schools.</span> <span id="s56">We felt fairly comfortable in the public schools except, and that is interesting that the Jewish kids automatically sat together.</span> <span id="s57">Don't ask me how we found each other.</span> <span id="s58">Now we were...we were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds.</span> <span id="s59">The Jewish kids automatically felt they ought to protect themselves.</span> <span id="s60">They ought to sit together.</span> <span id="s61">We always sit together.</span> <span id="s62">And nobody told me who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s63">But until 33, 34, public school was fairly comfortable.</span> <span id="s64">My father and my mother, like all Jewish parents, tried to shield the kids from the reality.</span> <span id="s65">Uh...We knew that certain things were going on.</span> <span id="s66">I know that and I remember distinctly where there were shops and store where said, Juden.</span> <span id="s67">That means 'No Jews.</span> <span id="s68">Don't buy here.'</span> <span id="s69">And I know there were often signs on windows, bands on stores, 'Don't.</span> <span id="s70">You Jews cannot buy here'.</span> <span id="s71">There were discriminations, but our parents didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it.</span> <span id="s72">So we bought our clothes some other places.</span> <span id="s73">There were Jewish warehouses, and we went and bought there.</span> <span id="s74">But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover.</span> <span id="s75">I mean they happened, but I know that more from historical facts than from personal experience.</span> <span id="s76">But after the Olympics, and after Hitler put on a good show and because the world came to the Olympics in 36...after 36 things drastically changed.</span> <span id="s77">Whether that was or the Nuremberg laws or whatever that was...you couldn't go to a dentist or any other doctor any more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were prohibited from practicing and from occupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh...trades.</span> <span id="s78">We felt that it was becoming increasingly difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was the Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, add the name Israel and my sister and my mother Sarah.</span> <span id="s81">I remember one incident probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my bicycle and I made a wrong turn of some kind and a policeman came and said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s82">And I said, "Martin Strauss."</span> <span id="s83">And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss."</span> <span id="s84">And I said, "Yes, Sir."</span> <span id="s85">The identification by saying Israel (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say Israel, it said Jew Strauss.</span> <span id="s86">Martin Jew Strauss.</span> <span id="s87">That's what Israel said.</span> <span id="s88">And of course I was guilty and I got a..</span> <span id="s89">.</span> <span id="s90">a..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">a fine payable at the police station and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten away with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what.</span> <span id="s93">Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s94">Uh...Schools no longer admitted us, or we were thrown out of schools.</span> <span id="s95">So the Jewish community created Jewish schools, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning.</span> <span id="s96">And we found that very comfortable, us kids, simply because we were not harassed.</span> <span id="s97">We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles.</span> <span id="s98">We played football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a fight.</span> <span id="s99">Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said, "We're not playing with any Jews."</span> <span id="s100">So a big fight erupted between the two football teams because the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that team.</span> <span id="s101">Uh...These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't bother you.</span> <span id="s102">It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident.</span> <span id="s103">And that's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living with it.</span> <span id="s104">It's a system.</span> <span id="s105">But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their occupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave Germany, thusly saving their lives.</span> <span id="s106">But my father and many others was quite wealthy, very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is going to go away.</span> <span id="s107">We're going to wait.</span> <span id="s108">Even if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still some big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special."</span> <span id="s109">And he said, "We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will."</span> <span id="s110">And thusly we stayed.</span> <span id="s111">My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters, followed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the country and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders.</span> <span id="s112">They had enough to eat, and they were living off the farm, and they didn't need much.</span> <span id="s113">They said, "If Leopold Strauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either."</span> <span id="s114">And I am ashamed and with great sorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the country.</span> <span id="s115">Meaning they all perished.</span> <span id="s116">There are 24, maybe 26.</span> <span id="s117">We are not totally sure.</span> <span id="s118">But 24 confirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too late, meaning 1939.</span> <span id="s119">Uh...We have confirmation of various concentration camps where they perished.</span> <span id="s120">They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their children amounting to a minimum of 24 people.</span> <span id="s121">They are all confirmed.</span> <span id="s122">That's on my father's side.</span> <span id="s123">On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart enough to leave.</span> <span id="s124">From 36 to 39, which is a..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">uh...period of strengthening, growing anti-Semitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away automobiles.</span> <span id="s127">You could not own a car anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in Leipzig who had permission to have an automobile because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I.</span> <span id="s128">He was a decorated veteran.</span> <span id="s129">He had connections to city hall, and he was permitted to keep an automobile, the only one in a city of large proportions.</span> <span id="s130">Everybody else had to take the street car, provided he stands up.</span> <span id="s131">You could not sit down in a street car.</span> <span id="s132">Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got used to it.</span> <span id="s133">It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been taken away from each individual.</span> <span id="s134">A little chip at a time until the time came that you had to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the gutter because you couldn't walk on the side...sidewalk.</span> <span id="s135">And...uh...a little chip at a time until you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing.</span> <span id="s136">But it happens step by step.</span> <span id="s137">It isn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts on this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning.</span> <span id="s138">They were taught to be anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s139">There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which is...I am sure we still have records of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about.</span> <span id="s140">But many grownups took it as...as the truth.</span> <span id="s141">And I..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">I still remember about Passover where they accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please.</span> <span id="s144">You can edit it out.</span> <span id="s145">Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for Pass...for Passover.</span> <span id="s146">We laughed about it.</span> <span id="s147">But I am sure that many other people took it serious and accepted it.</span> <span id="s148">So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky we...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out.</span> <span id="s149">All ended up in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s150">And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second.</span> <span id="s151">Uh...We had our Jewish schools and we felt very comfortable because we were together and nobody harassed us when we went to school, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we studied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s152">And there came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on trains or on trucks and shoved back into Poland.</span> <span id="s153">That day I remember quite clearly.</span> <span id="s154">We lost many of our teachers.</span> <span id="s155">One thing we lost our English teacher.</span> <span id="s156">I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened.</span> <span id="s157">The teachers were rounded up, put on trucks and shoved out.</span> <span id="s158">My teacher...uh...asked me to please go to her house and fetch a little suitcase.</span> <span id="s159">We were very close to the teacher.</span> <span id="s160">She was often at our house, which is the custom you know.</span> <span id="s161">The teacher is the honored person in a..</span> <span id="s162">.</span> <span id="s163">was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so forth.</span> <span id="s164">Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's house and got a little suitcase and threw it over a fence to her prior to her getting on to a truck.</span> <span id="s165">And I was school yard.</span> <span id="s166">I fetched her little valise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the fence, and she had it.</span> <span id="s167">Whatever it meant.</span> <span id="s168">It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation and...uh...she went off to Poland.</span> <span id="s169">Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out of Poland, went to England, became teacher in England, and now lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s170">It was a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s171">How she got out I..</span> <span id="s172">.</span> <span id="s173">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s174">In any event, we lost a great deal of our teaching staff, and the school after that was not any more because there were substitute teachers.</span> <span id="s175">They were lay...lay teachers.</span> <span id="s176">The school didn't function like it should.</span> <span id="s177">Uh...Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents shielded us.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: You mentioned that before...you told me...why don't you tell me a little bit about your Bar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s180">Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came from a fairly orthodox house.</span> <span id="s181">Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date may not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to make a choice.</span> <span id="s182">Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the decision was made 'no more meat in the house.'</span> <span id="s183">And my mother would keep it absolutely.</span> <span id="s184">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s185">No meat.</span> <span id="s186">So we became vegetarians.</span> <span id="s187">Again one of those conditions steps.</span> <span id="s188">It's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat.</span> <span id="s189">It was just one more of those steps that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted that we do not break the laws of kosher.</span> <span id="s190">And the reason I remember this...because of my Bar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends.</span> <span id="s191">My father was still well known in the city, and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu included kosher meat.</span> <span id="s192">Where do you get kosher meat?</span> <span id="s193">You fly...not fly it, you truck it.</span> <span id="s194">I guess they...they didn't fly it...from Poland where there was kosher slaughtering, and they trucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at tremendous cost because of freezing refrigeration was almost not heard of in those days.</span> <span id="s195">That means it had to be slaughtered today, trucked tomorrow, to Leipzig to the Bar Mitzvah and a big...I'm not sure that the kosher meat wasn't more of an attraction than my Bar Mitzvah, but it was one of those memorable affairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the...let's day...Nazis who would not allow us to have kosher meat.</span> <span id="s196">And the Bar Mitzvah, of course, was well attended by all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s197">Many of our Gentile friends in the upper echelon would not attend, but would send gifts.</span> <span id="s198">Again, one of those conditioning affairs.</span> <span id="s199">We understand you cannot attend for political reasons, but we accept that.</span> <span id="s200">Uh...Going back to 1939, school was very difficult and one day, the school is burning.</span> <span id="s201">I go to school in the morning.</span> <span id="s202">The school is burning, and I didn't understand it because there were no fire engines and people were standing around.</span> <span id="s203">No explanation.</span> <span id="s204">My father is looking for me, and my mother is looking for me and when I walked into the house, they are delighted that I'm okay.</span> <span id="s205">What I didn't know is that Kristallnacht was about to happen.</span> <span id="s206">It didn't happen yet.</span> <span id="s207">Uh...During Kristallnacht, of course, we are aware that all the synagogues, including ours, the Reform Synagogue and the Orthodox Synagogue, were burned.</span> <span id="s208">Some people who went in to save some of the scrolls were killed.</span> <span id="s209">Uh...Furniture came flying...during the night came flying out windows, that the word Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s210">Uh.</span> <span id="s211">.</span> <span id="s212">People, not in uniform, but in civilian clothes...I remember that distinctly because normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the uniforms...but when when it came to looting stores and when it came to throwing furniture out and robbing households and beating up people, most of these...as a matter of fact, I don't remember any incident where they were in...they were in uniform.</span> <span id="s213">They were all in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s214">And...uh...we went home and closed ourselves in, meaning we wouldn't open the door for anybody.</span> <span id="s215">We would just wait it out sort of.</span> <span id="s216">Well, at...at night around midnight, maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s217">Solid knock on the door.</span> <span id="s218">And three people, civilian clothes again, pressed pass my mother into the apartment, and said, "Where is Mr. Strauss?"</span> <span id="s219">"Mr. Strauss was in bed."</span> <span id="s220">And we then knew that all Hell had broken loose because for one reason or another...and we, to this day, don't know, somebody called us on the telephone and shouted into the telephone,.</span> <span id="s221">That means 'Run Away.'</span> <span id="s222">So some nut called us.</span> <span id="s223">We didn't know how real this was, but we know something was up.</span> <span id="s224">Uh...They go to my father and say, "You're coming with us."</span> <span id="s225">My father said, "Give me some time.</span> <span id="s226">I have to put on my artificial leg."</span> <span id="s227">So they were standing around while my father strapped on his artificial leg, and my mother took me out of my little bedroom on the other side of the house and said, "Up, under the rafters you go."</span> <span id="s228">She had enough presence of mind to hide me.</span> <span id="s229">I was 16 years old then.</span> <span id="s230">And I immediately went up to the roof under the rafters, kept very quiet.</span> <span id="s231">Uh...They took my father, left my mother, left my sister.</span> <span id="s232">And he went to the city jail.</span> <span id="s233">For 3 days we didn't know what was happening, what was going on.</span> <span id="s234">We knew the city was burning.</span> <span id="s235">We knew the synagogues were burning...synagogues were burning.</span> <span id="s236">Fire engines standing by doing nothing.</span> <span id="s237">We then knew that this was an official sanctioned, government.</span> <span id="s238">It wasn't something that happened by coincident on a local level.</span> <span id="s239">We knew then that it was a national scheme.</span> <span id="s240">I have to go back now a little bit and tell you about my father's business where we had something like 10 Gentile employees.</span> <span id="s241">Of course, most of these, if not everyone of them were members of the SR..</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">uh...of the party, and some SS which was the...like God.</span> <span id="s244">Uh...They were all members of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s245">Nevertheless, since my father was a good employer, paid tremendous wages...when I reflect upon the size of his operation, he had his own railroad...uh...uh...approach.</span> <span id="s246">You know where...where the tank cars would come to his yard where the oil was pumped into his tanks directly from railroad cars.</span> <span id="s247">He had a substan...very substantial business, and he paid employees extremely well.</span> <span id="s248">Being an amputee, of course, he had a driver, and the driver...uh...also being a party member, liked my father, was beholden to him.</span> <span id="s249">Uh...He was a party man, but not a Jew hater because he had experienced a Jew who was decent to him, who paid him better than average wages.</span> <span id="s250">And that was the salvation and maybe the reason we are still alive and we are here to talk about it.</span> <span id="s251">After 3 days, which is the time that they assembled Jews either in the city jail or down a river bank because there was so many Jews that they couldn't have them all in...in city jails.</span> <span id="s252">They drove them down into a river bank where they could control that you couldn't run away.</span> <span id="s253">One side was water.</span> <span id="s254">The other side was two bridges, and they...they were hemmed in there prior to transportation to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s255">Back to the chauffeur, the driver of my father's, he went to the city jail and said, "I need to extract the Jew Strauss."</span> <span id="s256">I don't know whether you know German mentality...uh...but in my opinion, there is a superior and there is a follower, and there is nothing in between.</span> <span id="s257">And if a superior, an officer, says, "I want the Jew Strauss," and what was the life of a Jew.</span> <span id="s258">"I want him," and he took him out.</span> <span id="s259">He was able to extract my father from jail and bring him home, and I will never...never ever, as long as I live, forget my father's face after he came out of 3...only 3 days of jail.</span> <span id="s260">We're talking about people who have been in jail for years and years.</span> <span id="s261">My father after 3 days had become a skeleton.</span> <span id="s262">His face...he was unshaven, of course, and that added to...to the impression.</span> <span id="s263">Well, the chauffeur took him, brought him to our house, and he said, "Mr. Strauss, it's time to get out.</span> <span id="s264">You have a few days.</span> <span id="s265">Try and get out.</span> <span id="s266">I'll take you to the train and we'll see what we can do."</span> <span id="s267">Because the chauffeur had our car, and he kept the car.</span> <span id="s268">So for a number of days, we...the kids...my daughter...my sister and myself, were home.</span> <span id="s269">And my mother and my father went out, looked for visas to get out.</span> <span id="s270">That's very interesting because the Jews were hunting for visas, and the Nazis were hunting for Jews, so unless they were recognized as Jews, they could travel on a street car or go to the Consulate and stand in line and look for visas.</span> <span id="s271">And we said, "We will go anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s272">Just let us get out."</span> <span id="s273">There was, of course, no way to find out what brothers and sisters were doing.</span> <span id="s274">Telephones were disrupted, disconnected, were listened too.</span> <span id="s275">We couldn't make any calls that amounted to anything.</span> <span id="s276">And we decided we will go anywhere where we can get a visa.</span> <span id="s277">But no visas were to be had.</span> <span id="s278">Who wanted us?</span> <span id="s279">The Swiss didn't want us.</span> <span id="s280">Europeans didn't want us.</span> <span id="s281">America...and I bow my head in shame...history will show that America had 8,000 visas for Germany in 1939, but not one single, extra visa was ever issued to accommodate any Jews.</span> <span id="s282">And I don't have to go into the history of ships arriving to the States and were turned back where most of the people lost their lives after they were turned away from the American shores.</span> <span id="s283">No visas for America.</span> <span id="s284">No visas anywhere.</span> <span id="s285">The only opportunities were either Shanghai, which you could buy.</span> <span id="s286">For marks, you could buy visas for Shanghai and many people went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s287">History will show you.</span> <span id="s288">Then there was Israel.</span> <span id="s289">A limited amount of visas on the British mandate were available.</span> <span id="s290">And then there was England, and we were waiting for either one of Shanghai, Israel, or England visas to give us permission to leave.</span> <span id="s291">And the Israel visa came first.</span> <span id="s292">Two days later, the England visa came, but fate wanted us to go to Israel or Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s293">Uh...the chauffeur took us to the railroad, dumped us into a car, got us to Italy where, at the border line, the Germans knowing we had the passports, knowing that we were immigrating took us apart.</span> <span id="s294">But taking us apart, I mean literally.</span> <span id="s295">They took my father's wooden leg off and searched it for money, contraband.</span> <span id="s296">But we knew better than that, because by that time we already had learned our lesson.</span> <span id="s297">Uh...They took and stripped my mother, totally naked, and checked in places you wouldn't dream of checking, and they took my little sister who at that time was an 8 year old kid, and stripped her.</span> <span id="s298">I don't know exactly how much they checked her, but I know my mother told me that she was totally and utterly checked.</span> <span id="s299">And then they put us back together again, our luggage and so forth, and we got to Italy.</span> <span id="s300">From Italy, we got to then Palestine.</span> <span id="s301">And, of course,...uh...that shaped my life and my attitude and my...my total thinking.</span> <span id="s302">We did not know what happened to our relatives.</span> <span id="s303">The fact that they perished we only found out after the war.</span> <span id="s304">My father and I went to concentration camps, Buchenwald, Dachau.</span> <span id="s305">We looked up records and so forth.</span> <span id="s306">Uh...I don't know whether the following is relevant, but it is interesting because I had changed in my total attitude in life, and in Israel I became so aware of the fact...we're talking about 1940, 41, 42...there were hundreds and thousands of refugees trying to get out of Europe, trying to leave concentration camps.</span> <span id="s307">Old people that had been...had escaped, especially after the war ended in 44.</span> <span id="s308">There were thousands of Jews trying to leave Europe and get to Israel.</span> <span id="s309">The British mandate blocked Israel and I became a volunteer, a social worker, a photographer, a radio operator...you name it, trying to help in bringing in illegal immigrants in addition to the fabulous training and schooling that I got in Haifa.</span> <span id="s310">And in 1947, I got caught by the British again, and for 3 months I went into a British camp called, and...uh...I stayed there because I was a trouble maker, and they told me, "We will either take you to Cyprus or you can go back to Germany or you can go anywhere you want, but we will not let you back into Palestine."</span> <span id="s311">So...uh...as fate would have it, I had an uncle on my mother's side in New York who gave us a visa, and the German quota was totally unused.</span> <span id="s312">And here I end again as a refugee in New York, welcomed with open arms, immediately found a job, and again I became not only a..</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">a fairly successful businessman.</span> <span id="s315">In other words, I earned a lot more than I ever thought and hoped I would earn.</span> <span id="s316">And I become again a social worker and...uh...I am amongst other things, Chairman of the Russian Resettlement Committee of the Jewish Social Services agency here in Washington, and I have been active there for 25 years.</span> <span id="s317">And it's a privilege to be in the United States because I am...and this is what I, I am a better American or as good as an America as my parents.</span> <span id="s318">May they rest in peace.</span> <span id="s319">We're Germans because we had the opportunity to flourish.</span> <span id="s320">We had the opportunity to become citizens.</span> <span id="s321">And this is what happened to me in this country, and I appreciate what this country's done for and I appreciate the freedom and the freedom of the press which was really the...the most devastating vehicle with which Hitler was able to brainwash the German population.</span> <span id="s322">You see it in print, you believe it.</span> <span id="s323">It's...it's...uh...hard to define, hard to understand, but I think it was propaganda machine was the vehicle to convince the Germans to do what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did your family come to the United States with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No.</span> <span id="s326">My...my family.</span> <span id="s327">This is another... Can I interrupt for a second here.</span> <span id="s328">An interesting of the entire story was the fact that my father found it very difficult temperature heat-wise, mentality-wise to make it in Israel and he became very, very poor.</span> <span id="s329">We had...we literally sold some of the belongings from my father to buy a ticket back to Germany.</span> <span id="s330">And he went in 1950 back to Germany.</span> <span id="s331">He said, "I have a lot...lot that this country owes me."</span> <span id="s332">And he had documentation like any...uh...good businessman, he had certain records and...uh...I have for instance the penalty...the photograph of the penalties that were imposed when Rath was killed by Grynzspan...uh...and there was a substantial penalty imposed on the Jewish people in all of Germany.</span> <span id="s333">Everybody had to pay 20 percent of whatever he owned.</span> <span id="s334">House, cars...uh...not only cash, but 20 percent of what you own as payable as a penalty to the German government because the Ambassador in France was killed by Grynzspan.</span> <span id="s335">He had those papers and he went back and he said, "Not only do you people owe me the pension that you promised me when I lost...and I gave my leg for the Fatherland...uh..., I think I'm entitled to my pensions and...uh...we had a house, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s336">And I believe and a little more research has to be done, that the law of restitution was created after my father went back and demanded and had a lawyer pursue the restitution.</span> <span id="s337">Uh...He went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s338">He passed away in Germany, and my mother passed away in Germany.</span> <span id="s339">My mother followed my father.</span> <span id="s340">Uh...My sister stayed in Israel for a long time.</span> <span id="s341">Then she joined me in the United States because I didn't want to live alone.</span> <span id="s342">And she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s343">And I'm blessed with two lovely kids and grandsons, and it's been a very good country to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Let me just ask a couple more questions.</span> <span id="s345">Back...uh...back in Germany, when you were growing up and becoming...you were still in the school, a regular public school, did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s347">Very few.</span> <span id="s348">An interesting thing happened during that time.</span> <span id="s349">Uh...In class, there was a class given by some German educator who was teaching the kids how to recognize Jewish features.</span> <span id="s350">Of course, that was all a bunch of garbage, but somehow or other darker hair and...and bigger noise and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s351">Anyhow, this is...I remember this vividly...uh...I was in a German class and he called me up and says, "Strauss, Come up front."</span> <span id="s352">He did not know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s353">Okay?</span> <span id="s354">And I came up front and he said, "This man even though he is not Jewish has very Jewish features."</span> <span id="s355">And he pointed to my noise and my chin and my...etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s356">I turned around to him.</span> <span id="s357">I said, "I'm sorry to contradict you Sir, but your diagnosis of me being a Jew is correct.</span> <span id="s358">I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s359">And he was terribly embarrassed in front of the class.</span> <span id="s360">I was taken out of the class immediately because a Jew wasn't supposed to attend that class in the first place.</span> <span id="s361">But that was another one of those little steps that...uh...for a 14, 15 year old kid, it's embarrassing, but it doesn't really tell you that...uh...some day I'm out to kill you.</span> <span id="s362">So in the German schools until, I would say, 1933, 1934, we were fairly well tolerated,...uh...but as I said before, some how or other, the Jewish kids always sat together.</span> <span id="s363">And...uh...I think I had one Gentile friend.</span> <span id="s364">The rest were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s365">All the time.</span> <span id="s366">Maybe it's a defense mechanism.</span> <span id="s367">Maybe it's distinctively some how...uh...and we always helped each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: After school, were you involved in...in the afternoons, were you involved in scouting or Jewish youth groups or summer camps, those kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s370">Yes.</span> <span id="s371">We went to summer camps.</span> <span id="s372">We went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s373">We had sports... uh...which was...I..</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">I don't think we ever tried even into any Gentile environment.</span> <span id="s376">It was the sheltered environment that our parents built for us.</span> <span id="s377">Uh...We had a summer camp.</span> <span id="s378">We had the sports camp.</span> <span id="s379">We had...uh...Hebrew classes.</span> <span id="s380">We were a..</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">a small entity always well protected.</span> <span id="s383">The Jewish community efforts were always tremendous.</span> <span id="s384">And, of course, efforts were made...uh...to...to give us strength to overcome the insults because as kids we only had two mechanisms to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s385">Run or fight.</span> <span id="s386">And I think we were better at running than fighting, which leads me to another story that...uh...might be interesting.</span> <span id="s387">In 19...the Nuremberg laws I think came out in 1936.</span> <span id="s388">Uh...They decreed that every Jew has to turn in every weapon in his or her possession.</span> <span id="s389">There was a law.</span> <span id="s390">And...uh...of course, many people had from World War I weapons that they brought home, souvenirs, sabers, a long saber they carried these tremendous sabers, and some had guns and many had knives and a law was passed, “No Jew is allowed to have any weapons, any knife over a certain length, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s391">Turn them in.”</span> <span id="s392">The regulation was if you don't turn it in, you can be punished by death.</span> <span id="s393">And if my memories serves me right...I have to be very careful whether it is memory or whether it's written documentation that I read...some people were punished.</span> <span id="s394">Not only the person that didn't turn in the weapon, but also the rest of the...of his family.</span> <span id="s395">When that happened, we all turned in knives and guns, what few guns the Jews had, including my father.</span> <span id="s396">That, of course, led to a..</span> <span id="s397">.</span> <span id="s398">led to a another disaster many years later.</span> <span id="s399">When people asked many years later and people says, "Why didn't Jews defend himself...didn't defend themselves."</span> <span id="s400">I say, "With what?"</span> <span id="s401">We turned in everything we had, and...and besides the fact that we were brought up as peaceful people, the arguments today with the National Rifle Association vis-à-vis the right to be armed is...has much more depth to it than meets the eye.</span> <span id="s402">This is what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s403">And a free press and laws passed by a ruler rather than by democratic government, all this step by step, led to the deterioration and eventual downfall and eventual murder of 6 million Jews and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: When you were in Israel...uh...at the height of the Holocaust, how much...how aware were you of what was going on and what...since there wasn't a lot of immigration at that time, what kind of...what were you doing, if anything, that did concern the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Well, the only thing we knew in 44 really, during the war years Israel did not know...or I did not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much, but we were very concerned in Israel about our own survival.</span> <span id="s406">Don't forget.</span> <span id="s407">Rommel was within 400 miles of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s408">Uh...We saw the flashes of the fighting on the horizon.</span> <span id="s409">Literally at night we saw the guns blazing.</span> <span id="s410">Uh...We were very much concerned with where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s411">We were much concerned with the Arab problems.</span> <span id="s412">The Arabs were pursuing the Jews and we were running around with the Haganah and the Underground and...uh...defense mechanisms and trying to build things and...uh...and we had the air attacks some air attacks of German and Italian aircraft...uh...uh...on Israel.</span> <span id="s413">The Haifa refinery was set ablaze and we were living 5 miles from or 10 miles from tanks that burned so bright that you could read the newspapers...uh... refineries were ablaze.</span> <span id="s414">Uh...We were concerned with...with Arabs whether they were friendly or not.</span> <span id="s415">Uh...We had to...uh...I remember when I helped but screens on so the stones wouldn't go through the windows, we...uh...we were very much concerned with our own survival in Israel fighting both the Arabs who had declared loyalty to...to Germany...uh...being concerned about the invasion from the West...uh...and maybe the news didn't filter up.</span> <span id="s416">But in 44, we knew immigrants were at the shores and in 44 we knew people coming...practically swimming across the Mediterranean on...on boats that I wouldn't cross the Potomac with.</span> <span id="s417">Uh...They were boats that were loaded so they were practically capsized.</span> <span id="s418">Uh...I remember one ship, the Patria, which was a French liner, with three or four smoke stacks that was loaded with immigrants that the British had captured at the...in the Mediterranean open sea and had...uh...brought to Haifa, and they wanted to deport the ship...the passengers to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s419">And the ship was scuttled in Haifa Harbor.</span> <span id="s420">Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good job because the ship instead of sinking and going down slowly...uh...tipped over on its side.</span> <span id="s421">It turned turtle, and when it fell over to the sides, we had many immigrants they drowned.</span> <span id="s422">Others came out over the side, and they slid down over the hull of the ship, which was encrusted with barnacles, and the barnacles cut their flesh open while they were going into the water.</span> <span id="s423">At that time, I was a student at the...uh...Naval Academy in Haifa and we had passes to get to the Harbor.</span> <span id="s424">And we went into the Harbor, and we tried to rescue some of the people that had gone overboard and into the water.</span> <span id="s425">And if you don't think that leaves any...uh... specks in your mind or any...uh...memories that change your life, that affect my attitude toward people...my relationship with the rest of the world...uh...believe me, it does change you.</span> <span id="s426">But the...the early indications are indeed that we did not know during 42, 3 and...42, 43, we did not know what happened to the people.</span> <span id="s427">44 we were keenly aware.</span> <span id="s428">The news came across.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Now, from what you said before, I understand that you mentioned that you...you helped...uh...when...when the ship's illegal immigrants came ashore, you helped the people.</span> <span id="s430">Can you describe one of those events.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Uh...Well, I will describe one of the events.</span> <span id="s432">Uh...Ships came and...uh...tried to...if they managed to pass the British ship blockade, they tried to come ashore at night, simply by beaching the ship.</span> <span id="s433">And then everybody helped.</span> <span id="s434">Ropes, little boats.</span> <span id="s435">The infirmed, the elderly, the kids had to be carried ashore through the water, and...uh...one of the last occasions was a ship that landed not far from Tel Aviv, and the people crawled ashore and you just have to help.</span> <span id="s436">There isn't...there isn't any question of do I or do I not do it.</span> <span id="s437">In addition to that, I was a photographer.</span> <span id="s438">I wanted to document these events, and I took some pictures and then suddenly out of nowhere, the British showed up from both sides and captured all of those who were involved in the landing, including me and my camera and on a truck we went and off we went to...and they took us...at that time...now it's the West Bank.</span> <span id="s439">At that time, it was the.</span> <span id="s440">It was called, which was a British camp.</span> <span id="s441">In the middle of the desert, all it had was some tents.</span> <span id="s442">It didn't have any fence around it because you couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s443">It was all desert and the only way to escape was along the railroad line so anybody that tried to escape would wonder around the railroad line.</span> <span id="s444">In the morning, the British would take a little Piper Cub, fly around the railroad line, and find out whoever was trying to escape and run them back.</span> <span id="s445">Uh...So nobody ever escaped.</span> <span id="s446">And many people did not know where we were.</span> <span id="s447">My parents didn't...uh...for a period of 8 weeks, I think, had no idea where the Hell I was cause the British didn't publish...publish anything.</span> <span id="s448">And then Jewish Agency got a hold of all the prisoners list.</span> <span id="s449">We were better than 300 at one time, and my mother read in the paper where her son was in the British prison camp, and she went to my father and said, "Now, we know where our son is."</span> <span id="s450">So...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Were you a member of the Haganah at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Uh...No, I was not a member of the Haganah.</span> <span id="s453">I was a helper.</span> <span id="s454">Whether you...uh...In those days, let me explain to you.</span> <span id="s455">Even if you are a member of the Haganah, you not necessary know who or where you...you just try to do the right thing, and I was not...I was neither leader nor...nor...uh...officer.</span> <span id="s456">I was the guy that was helping.</span> <span id="s457">And, of course, it was a organized help.</span> <span id="s458">It wasn't...uh...but...uh...we tried to do the right thing.</span> <span id="s459">I was never Underground.</span> <span id="s460">I was never.</span> <span id="s461">I was never or anything of that kind.</span> <span id="s462">I was a humanitarian that needed to help because I knew my relatives could be on that boat.</span> <span id="s463">Unfortunately, it wasn't so.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s466">As soon as we finish, I'll probably think of something.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Linda had...had a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s468">She wanted you to talk a little bit about...uh...what it was like for you when you first come to the United States and your...</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s470">Good question.</span> <span id="s471">(clearing throat) Uh...You know the things that...that shape you for life are your experiences obviously.</span> <span id="s472">I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s473">I had a small box of tools and 46 cents.</span> <span id="s474">I arrived in New York, and my aunt on a very rainy day picked me up and...uh...took me in.</span> <span id="s475">I slept on the living room floor, but I was welcome.</span> <span id="s476">I was home.</span> <span id="s477">I was safe.</span> <span id="s478">Two days later, I had a job at Columbia University Medical at night and a daytime job downtown in the photographic industry.</span> <span id="s479">I built photographic equipment, both for the medical center as well as in New York for the...uh...at that time Time-Life, Time and Life magazine, New York Times, did all the camera repairs, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s480">But the opportunity to come to a country...and there's one of the things I will never forget.</span> <span id="s481">There was this little immigrant coming off the boat, has to go through customs and immigration, and the immigration officer said...after he opened my passport I had a which is not a passport, but is a piece of paper that means, "Let him pass," translated.</span> <span id="s482">Uh...It's a travel document.</span> <span id="s483">And the immigration officer opening the travel document read my name and he said, "Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss."</span> <span id="s484">Those were actually the first words I heard in the United States from a..</span> <span id="s485">.</span> <span id="s486">It made such a profound impression.</span> <span id="s487">It is now...this was in 1947, so that is 40...</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: 44 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: 44 years ago, but I can still see the man's face, just as much as I can see the faces of these Nazi officers that came to get my father.</span> <span id="s490">I remember this officer who said, "Welcome, Mr. Strauss."</span> <span id="s491">Used my name and said, "Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss."</span> <span id="s492">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s493">And quite frankly, it's been going up ever since.</span> <span id="s494">And...and therefore I have become an American who... who is politically involved to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s495">Uh...Let us say, I am not politically involved.</span> <span id="s496">I am involved with humanitarian efforts.</span> <span id="s497">An immigrant...you know, this is an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s498">A Russian Jew and a German Jew, we're so far apart because the German Jews were...were very prejudice, solid, integrated people.</span> <span id="s499">They were more German than they were Jews.</span> <span id="s500">And Russian Jews were second...second-class citizens, which was, of course, all craziness.</span> <span id="s501">But today if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take by the hand and give him part of my America and return him to self-sufficiency as a way of life, that justifies all the efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return.</span> <span id="s502">It gives you...uh...dignity.</span> <span id="s503">You give away dignity to others.</span> <span id="s504">The dignity that Hitler robbed us, the dignity that we didn't have extended to us by the British.</span> <span id="s505">And here welcome to America.</span> <span id="s506">This is the country where we...we simply we have to do everything we can to defend this democracy to make it a better democracy.</span> <span id="s507">Surely, many things that are wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: No.</span> <span id="s509">No.</span> <span id="s510">That's fine.</span> <span id="s511">I think we're out of tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Good.</span> <span id="s513">We're through.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: I think they're going to put another tape if there's anything else that you want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Don't you want to show some of the pictures that I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: How does that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You described how these three men burst into your house and ordered your father to fix up...uh...his leg.</span> <span id="s519">You know we know your father had his leg on and your mother was hiding you up in the rafters.</span> <span id="s520">Can you describe if you can what your...what your feelings were at that time and what was going through your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s522">Uh...When they burst through the door, it's like a burglar coming into your house.</span> <span id="s523">Your house is violated.</span> <span id="s524">Everybody is terribly, terribly scared, and I must admit my mother had more wits about her.</span> <span id="s525">They were not taking any women that particular... On Kristallnacht, they were hunting men.</span> <span id="s526">Men and young men.</span> <span id="s527">Uh...And while my father put on his leg which was a big procedure.</span> <span id="s528">It was a wooden leg with straps around the shoulders and so forth, my mother left the bedroom.</span> <span id="s529">The three people were watching my father, but didn't care about my mother.</span> <span id="s530">Whether they knew about my existence or whether they were not paying attention in the confusion, one doesn't know.</span> <span id="s531">Uh...My mother immediately took me to the roof rafters and said, "You stay there.</span> <span id="s532">Don't do anything.</span> <span id="s533">Be very quiet."</span> <span id="s534">Whether they ever asked my mother for me, I doubt it because my mother would have told me.</span> <span id="s535">They probably did not ask her.</span> <span id="s536">But the feeling inside of me being hunted like an animal is a fear that settles in your stomach and a fear for your father.</span> <span id="s537">We knew then that all these little steps that were taken...the Jews...to discriminate, the Jews are bad; the Jews are murderers, had come to a..</span> <span id="s538">.</span> <span id="s539">to an explosion.</span> <span id="s540">It finally erupted.</span> <span id="s541">We knew that, and...uh...the...the feeling in your stomach almost to a point of throwing up the...the being scared feeling is one that you will never forget.</span> <span id="s542">You forget...I..</span> <span id="s543">.</span> <span id="s544">I have a feeling that you may forget pain.</span> <span id="s545">Pain is something that goes away, but mental...being afraid doesn't go away.</span> <span id="s546">It stays and I..</span> <span id="s547">.</span> <span id="s548">I still remember that.</span> <span id="s549">And of course my mother was fairly cool and composed and I..</span> <span id="s550">.</span> <span id="s551">she told me the following story amongst other things.</span> <span id="s552">Uh...In order to determine whether we had played with any funds and taken any money illegally out of the country, they interrogated my father in one room and took my mother into another room and asked them, "What money do you spend for household budget every week?"</span> <span id="s553">And, of course, my parents had all these years tried to save money and get it Switzerland and get it out.</span> <span id="s554">That was my mother's insistence.</span> <span id="s555">So my father when asked in his mind doubled the amount in order to account for missing money which was a good presence of mind.</span> <span id="s556">And in order to find out whether he spoke the truth these SS officers took my mother into another room and asked her the same questions.</span> <span id="s557">And I don't know whether God guided her or something.</span> <span id="s558">She also doubled the amount.</span> <span id="s559">The two answers, which was not prepared, never spoken before...in the interrogation, the two answers absolutely agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Had your parents succeeded in getting money out?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yes, my parents had gotten money to Switzerland in...in...from 33 to 39, they were able to get at great losses...there were couriers that took money to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s562">Many of the couriers vanished and never showed up again.</span> <span id="s563">But it was a amount of money that my father being quite wealthy was able to get out and it really helped us to live on it for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s564">But then it eventually all vanished and blew up with the devaluation and etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s565">But he became from a very rich man, he became a very poor man and part of...let me...let me sing praise of my mother's...uh...was an extraordinary woman.</span> <span id="s566">We had in Germany in the "good old days" we had servants.</span> <span id="s567">I don't mean one.</span> <span id="s568">We had a number of servants.</span> <span id="s569">And we had a chauffeur and we had a car, we had houseman.</span> <span id="s570">We had a housemaid, etcetera, etcetera, and my mother went to Palestine and within l week from Germany she scrubbed floors in Palestine and she never complained.</span> <span id="s571">And she never had any compunction about...uh...saying she's unhappy.</span> <span id="s572">We were alive.</span> <span id="s573">We had escaped.</span> <span id="s574">We were grateful for what we had.</span> <span id="s575">We were satisfied.</span> <span id="s576">And...uh.</span> <span id="s577">.</span> <span id="s578">it so happens that Israel was able to give me a first class education at the in Haifi and I was very privileged and this is why, again, I support Israel with everything that I have.</span> <span id="s579">Another story that may interest you is...uh...when in 1948 Israel was declared a state and the war broke out with the Arabs, there was a Legation in New York.</span> <span id="s580">Israel didn't have a embassy then, and I told them I am willing to go back to Israel and fight for Israel because I had just arrived in the United States.</span> <span id="s581">And he said, "Well, we don't have any planes...any place on a..</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">on a plane to take you back.</span> <span id="s584">You're not important right now.</span> <span id="s585">But as soon as we have space, we will notify you."</span> <span id="s586">I'm still waiting for them to notify me.</span> <span id="s587">(laughing) I'm still here.</span> <span id="s588">So this is really how it happened, and I met a lovely young lady in Washington, got married, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Just a couple more questions.</span> <span id="s590">When you were at Kristallnacht and your father came home and you were able to get the visas, you mentioned...you described the search at the border.</span> <span id="s591">Can you describe the...what you remember from the train ride from Leipzig to the border and then also what happened in Italy and...and your feelings about running away from Germany and going to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Uh...When my father got out of jail, he again was a free man to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s593">Business was finished.</span> <span id="s594">He called up...it's an interesting sideline...he called up some of the...uh...big factories which were really German Aryan factories that, "I have oil...I have a tank car full of this and that.</span> <span id="s595">I'm willing to give it to you at half price."</span> <span id="s596">And a number of these big factories says...said to my father, "Mr. Strauss, we do not want to take advantage of your misfortune."</span> <span id="s597">The misfortune of being Jew and having to leave.</span> <span id="s598">"We will pay you the going rate."</span> <span id="s599">And it so happens that they bought an awful lot of oil which they didn't need and they put it in tanks and it turned out that during the war, they couldn't get any oil and they were the lucky...they had helped the Jew, but they were the lucky ones, because they had oil for many years to come.</span> <span id="s600">So that's one of those...uh...quirky fates that happen in life.</span> <span id="s601">Uh...I lost my tread.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: The leaving...the trying to leave home.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s604">The departure itself was very dramatic because when we got to the train and the train moved, my father had never cried.</span> <span id="s605">I had never seen my father cry in his life.</span> <span id="s606">My father cried because...because we knew that it was the end of a total existence.</span> <span id="s607">A man who...who was an officer who was a leading citizen, a man who was respected left with a suitcase even though we had some money in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s608">We wasn't in immediate danger of...of starving.</span> <span id="s609">There wasn't.</span> <span id="s610">Uh...but we knew it was the end of an era and my father and my mother held each other and cried, but they're very lucky because they got away.</span> <span id="s611">Many others never had a chance to cry.</span> <span id="s612">Many others were separated and had to wave to each other, including...we have some reports...there was one uncle who picked berries in Germany in the woods to feed himself and allegedly either was shot there or went to a concentration camp and was killed there for picking berries.</span> <span id="s613">Any excuse will do.</span> <span id="s614">So my family, particular family, was extremely lucky to have had the means.</span> <span id="s615">Now you will ask how come you had the means?</span> <span id="s616">And I will tell you many did not have the means to escape and pay and buy their way out.</span> <span id="s617">My father had a big apartment house which he had to sell under duress, but that apartment house was paid for and that gave us after he paid Hitler his 20 percent of everything he had, gave us still enough money to buy a ticket to get out.</span> <span id="s618">Many people perished because they could not afford the train fare to get out.</span> <span id="s619">And once we were in Italy...uh...we were able to pay for our hotel room.</span> <span id="s620">We got on a ship...on the ship legally.</span> <span id="s621">The ship called the S.S. Jerusalem which was an Italian ship, took us to Haifa Harbor where we were welcomed by an uncle who took us in, who had rented from an Arab an apartment for us.</span> <span id="s622">True, we did not have any lights and electricity and it was very bare.</span> <span id="s623">I wired the house.</span> <span id="s624">It was one of those little miracles that a 17, 16...17 year old was able to wire the whole house with electricity, and when the inspector came, he said, "That's not done by a professional.</span> <span id="s625">We were absolutely worried he would cut us down.</span> <span id="s626">He said, "It's too neat."</span> <span id="s627">So we survived the electrical inspection.</span> <span id="s628">Uh...But the...the shaping of a man's dignity, of a man's humanitarian attitude toward his fellow man is what the Holocaust is all about.</span> <span id="s629">If you...if we don't learn and pass on to our children what we have learned, what I have learned and...because I am very lucky.</span> <span id="s630">I'm here to talk about it.</span> <span id="s631">Those that have learned the bitterest lesson of them all are not here to talk about it.</span> <span id="s632">We have to take what we can and convey and...and make sure that the next generation really understands...uh...what inhumanity to man by man can be.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: One last...uh...one last question.</span> <span id="s634">You mentioned...uh...you mentioned the chauffeur who...uh...who helped your father and got your father out of...out of the jail and</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And then helped get them...take the train station.</span> <span id="s637">Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: The chauffeurs name was Berma, and...uh...he was a professional driver who from what we hear became a tank or some other driver in the German army.</span> <span id="s641">He perished on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s642">We know that from other fellow employees that we later on spoke in Germany to.</span> <span id="s643">As a matter of fact, I will be going to Germany in July, and I expect to visit my German nanny who is now in her 90s.</span> <span id="s644">She is still alive.</span> <span id="s645">I am still keeping touch with her.</span> <span id="s646">I expect to see her in July to visit her for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s647">Of course, they were under Russian occupation for many, many years, but we kept touch, and we kept greeting each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: So this is the first time you've seen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: First time I going back to my house which is still...still there.</span> <span id="s650">Uh...The house to the left is bombed out.</span> <span id="s651">The house to the left...to the right is bombed out.</span> <span id="s652">Our house is still standing, and from photographs I have seen there, this is interesting.</span> <span id="s653">There's a carved door, with lion heads, wooden carved door.</span> <span id="s654">Tremendous door, and I remember it as a kid because of I was afraid of these lions' heads on the door.</span> <span id="s655">Would you believe they're still there?</span> <span id="s656">The same doors 60 years later?</span> <span id="s657">They're still there, and I'm going to see them in July.</span> <span id="s658">But...uh...I..</span> <span id="s659">.</span> <span id="s660">I want to say to you Germany was poisoned and Germans are guilty (coughing) and Germans are guilty, but not all of them.</span> <span id="s661">There are human beings out there that still have retained their righteousness.</span> <span id="s662">And thank God for these.</span> <span id="s663">Otherwise, the world would just not have any hope.</span> <span id="s664">So we kept in touch with most of the employees or many of the employees.</span> <span id="s665">Most of them are dead by now anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Okay, I think...I think that will wrap it up.</span> <span id="s667">Thank you.</span> <span id="s668">They're now going to bring the bulletin board out.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: This is a photograph of my father, Leopold Strauss.</span> <span id="s670">The interesting thing is (coughing) the picture hasn't been taken in...roughly 1933.</span> <span id="s671">You will see the iron cross wearing in his lapel.</span> <span id="s672">He would never leave the house, never go anywhere unless he would show with pride the iron cross he had received in World War I, where he also had lost his leg for the Fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228 PAGE 15</span></p></body></html>
