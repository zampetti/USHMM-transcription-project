1992.</span> <span id="s5">I am here with Mrs. Miki Pear of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and she is here at the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum today to tell her story of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6">Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was born in Warsaw, Poland on May 14, 1935.</span> <span id="s8">My father was a violinist and a professor of music.</span> <span id="s9">My mother came from a very large family -- my father was an only child as far as I know.</span> <span id="s10">He had a tiny family.</span> <span id="s11">My mother came from an enormous and very well known family in Warsaw, a very prominent family.</span> <span id="s12">My grandfather had a soda, carbonated beverage manufacturing family.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: On your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My mother’s side.</span> <span id="s15">I don’t know very much about my father’s side.</span> <span id="s16">I know only that he came from a family of intellectuals, professors, linguists and I don’t know what all.</span> <span id="s17">I do remember his parents.</span> <span id="s18">I remember meeting them once.</span> <span id="s19">I remember going to their home, I remember the room that I was in.</span> <span id="s20">I remember that there was a red oriental rug, very highly patterned, intricately patterned and the walls were lined with books.</span> <span id="s21">.</span> <span id="s22">That was very impressive because first of all, I had never seen anything quite like it and second of all because my father’s parents, like my father, were very short.</span> <span id="s23">They were even much shorter than my father was.</span> <span id="s24">I remember that --the room so clearly because I remember thinking how do they reach those books which went so high up.</span> <span id="s25">The ceilings in Europe were very high and I don’t remember and I was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Were you crawling on the rug?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No, I was walking on the rug.</span> <span id="s28">I had to be four years at that point.</span> <span id="s29">I remember thinking how could my grandfather who was so pale and delicate looking climb?</span> <span id="s30">There were ladders on each side of the room, which I guess must have been on wheels or however those things worked.</span> <span id="s31">But I remember imagining how could my grandfather who looked so frail and tiny reach those books.</span> <span id="s32">That’s the impression that I have of my grandparents and I remember absolutely nothing else about them nor do I know anything about them.</span> <span id="s33">Only that my father was an only child.</span> <span id="s34">However, my mother’s side of the family, I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s35">And they were exactly the opposite in every conceivable way.</span> <span id="s36">They were very loud and noisy and gregarious.</span> <span id="s37">My mother was the youngest of eight siblings.</span> <span id="s38">There were nine originally, one died at a young age, maybe in childhood, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s39">But she was one of five daughters, she was the youngest, and three sons.</span> <span id="s40">The oldest child was a daughter, the oldest child, my mother’s sister, married a physician who was her childhood sweetheart and they moved to Russia.</span> <span id="s41">This would have to have been in the twenties.</span> <span id="s42">They had two daughters who I know became -- one became a merchant ship captain, captain of a merchant ship and the other daughter, this would have been my cousin, became, I believe, a physician.</span> <span id="s43">But that entire part of the family was lost to the other, to the rest of the family because they were in Russia.</span> <span id="s44">So I know nothing …</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Soviet citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: --Soviet exactly.</span> <span id="s47">So I don’t know any more about them but I imagine that these two cousins, anyway, who would probably be twenty or thirty years older than I am, might still be living.</span> <span id="s48">I imagine my cousin is a sea captain, provocative thought.</span> <span id="s49">Hopefully their descendents are living somewhere in Russia and hopefully they’re enjoying a peaceful life.</span> <span id="s50">The rest of the brothers and sisters -- all the sisters married and all of my mother’s sisters, all four of my mother’s sisters had families of three or more children.</span> <span id="s51">And all of those families perished.</span> <span id="s52">Of the three brothers, the oldest was banished to Siberia with his wife and child.</span> <span id="s53">He survived the war and it was he who later found me where I was hidden in the Ukraine, where I survived.</span> <span id="s54">The other two brothers -- the middle brother escaped sometime during the first World War and the story goes that he was, what’s the word?</span> <span id="s55">… He punched a senior in the jaw for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: This is in the Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: In the Polish army.</span> <span id="s58">He was in the Polish cavalry.</span> <span id="s59">The Polish cavalry during the first World War was kind of interesting because if you could afford your own boots, or at least this is what I am told, if you could afford a fancy uniform with boots and so forth, you sort of automatically became an officer.</span> <span id="s60">If you could afford to bring your own horse, you became an officer in the cavalry.</span> <span id="s61">So he was a horseman and he had the means to afford all this grand stuff.</span> <span id="s62">So he was an officer in the Polish cavalry.</span> <span id="s63">He was quite rebellious and kind of a smart ass and apparently he got into some, I don’t know, fracas, and punched out a senior officer and they were going to shoot him for insubordination.</span> <span id="s64">He jumped over the wall, I don’t know, I may be romanticizing this.</span> <span id="s65">These are facts that I was told and eventually escaped and made his way to America where there was some distant relative who took him under his wing.</span> <span id="s66">Morris Berliner, this middle uncle became in later years, the rich uncle in America.</span> <span id="s67">He’s the one that we came to, he was our sponsor in the United States.</span> <span id="s68">The youngest of my three uncles who was just the next sibling to my mother, my mother was the younger and he was next; he was Martin Berliner.</span> <span id="s69">He and his bride -- he was a student in Paris -- he went to college there and became an engineer.</span> <span id="s70">He and his new bride were fortunate enough to have come to the United States in 1939 on the last ship which was admitted into New York harbor.</span> <span id="s71">So he was a surprise to us when we arrived here because we had no idea of his whereabouts at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You had known him before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Possibly.</span> <span id="s74">I don’t remember him at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Hard to keep track of all your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Well.</span> <span id="s77">yeah.</span> <span id="s78">Also he was in Paris.</span> <span id="s79">He was a student in Paris.</span> <span id="s80">Although he was very close with my mother because they were closest in age, I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s81">Or if I knew him, it would have been only very casually, very briefly.</span> <span id="s82">But my uncle Jacob, the oldest was closest in the family to my mother.</span> <span id="s83">The two were each other’s confidant, they were friends.</span> <span id="s84">They were friends, socially.</span> <span id="s85">They just had a very close friendship even though they were a number of -- quite a number of years apart, perhaps fifteen years apart.</span> <span id="s86">And he was her protector and he loved her a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: He had remained in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes, he remained in Warsaw and he remained in my grandfather’s business.</span> <span id="s89">He ran the finances of the business and apparently one of the reasons that he was so -- that he did that is because he was so honest and so trustworthy and so forth.</span> <span id="s90">He was the kind of the controller and the business head of the business.</span> <span id="s91">My grandfather was part inventor, entrepreneur and dreamer and my grandfather … For example, my grandfather was the first to introduce fresh fruit juice or syrup to carbonated water.</span> <span id="s92">That juice was raspberry and he was at the beginning of creating fruit flavored soft drinks, sparkling soft drinks.</span> <span id="s93">The fledgling company which he called Fraise, the French word for raspberries because that was the first fruit flavoring that he experimented with, with his carbonated water.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you get to drink any?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I don’t remember at all.</span> <span id="s96">I don’t remember that at all.</span> <span id="s97">But I remember that life at my grandparent’s kind of revolved around the siphons.</span> <span id="s98">I remember their home -- I have wonderful memories of my grandparents’ home and here comes the lump in my throat.</span> <span id="s99">My grandparents’ home was sort of on the outskirts of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s100">My uncle Martin, the youngest of the brothers, was interviewed for a book, ‘Voices of the Holocaust’ and I believe, in that interview is the -- if not the address, the location of, you know.</span> <span id="s101">I’m not very good with the names and the places because I was so young.</span> <span id="s102">But that information is known.</span> <span id="s103">And apparently my grandfather, who was extremely tall, unusually tall, he was the tallest member of the entire family.</span> <span id="s104">My grandmother was quite small and she had beautiful blue eyes, she was the only one with blue eyes.</span> <span id="s105">She had a beautiful singing voice which could have been operatic but she preferred just to share her singing talents with her family.</span> <span id="s106">She was the family songbird.</span> <span id="s107">She sang all the time as she cooked and so forth.</span> <span id="s108">My grandfather was extremely, highly respected in the community.</span> <span id="s109">He was sort of the unofficial Jewish mayor of the area and was the … He was the one who kind of communicated with the official government and the gentile community.</span> <span id="s110">He was the -- I can’t think of the word.</span> <span id="s111">Well, anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Community leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s114">Well, more than that, he was also kind of the wise man.</span> <span id="s115">People came to him for advice and he settles disputes.</span> <span id="s116">He loaned people money.</span> <span id="s117">He was very loved and respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: An elder statesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: He was truly that and looked the part too.</span> <span id="s120">He was a great big tall man with a white beard.</span> <span id="s121">Oh, and I have a wonderful photograph of them too, if your archives might be interested, of my grandfather and grandmother.</span> <span id="s122">Oh, G___, They’re gorgeous!</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Was your family orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I believe my grandparents were …</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: On your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes, I know really nothing about my father’s side.</span> <span id="s127">Everything I’ve told you is everything I know and there is no more.</span> <span id="s128">But my -- I think my grandparents were probably orthodox .</span> <span id="s129">I don’t know that but I think so.</span> <span id="s130">My grandmother also has a wonderful reputation.</span> <span id="s131">She took the teachings of the Torah rather literally in some respects.</span> <span id="s132">Every Friday and on every holiday, she would go and collect beggars from the street and she would feed them in her kitchen.</span> <span id="s133">On the high holy days, she invited them to share our holiday meal in our dining room.</span> <span id="s134">I remember my grandmother’s dining which because she had eight children, all of whom were married and had children of their own; the table could seat I don’t know how many people, maybe twenty.</span> <span id="s135">I remember the beautiful crystal chandelier which hung over it.</span> <span id="s136">I remember a little story of a peasant from the Ukraine who came to work as a sort of maid, or I don’t know, helper, and my grandmother told this servant to go and turn out the light in the dining room.</span> <span id="s137">When the servant didn’t reappear for a long time, my grandmother went to search and found this peasant standing on top of the table trying to blow out the electric lights in the chandelier.</span> <span id="s138">So I remember little antidotal facts like that.</span> <span id="s139">Stop me from telling you these stories because it will take me forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What kind of home did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Well my father was a teacher.</span> <span id="s142">He taught at one of the universities.</span> <span id="s143">I really am not sure which, either the University of Warsaw -- there were two universities, I believe.</span> <span id="s144">I think he might have taught in the smaller of the two because there was great anti-Semitism at that time and difficulty within the university system.</span> <span id="s145">So he might not have taught in the Warsaw University but I’m not really sure.</span> <span id="s146">In any case, he also gave private lessons at home.</span> <span id="s147">My father was not successful in the field of making money.</span> <span id="s148">He was kind of a disappointment and disgrace within the family because my mother’s family was all very aggressive and very well to do.</span> <span id="s149">Everybody did exceedingly well and apparently they thought that that was very important and everyone was talented in a different way but everyone was sort of well off.</span> <span id="s150">My mother was not.</span> <span id="s151">It was very disappointing to the family that my mother married my father because she married him on the rebound.</span> <span id="s152">She had been in love with a local boy who apparently was a great Zionist and gave her the choice of -- or asked her to go with him to build Palestine.</span> <span id="s153">When she refused to leave the family nest and go to such a faraway place, he left without her.</span> <span id="s154">I’ve often wondered which hero in the State of Israel might have been my mother’s childhood sweetheart and so I romanticize about that.</span> <span id="s155">Anyway on the rebound my mother married one f her teachers.</span> <span id="s156">My father was quite a bit older than my mother and it was against my mother’s family’s wishes that she rebelliously married him.</span> <span id="s157">I was their only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: How long had they been married before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s160">My mother was very young so I imagine they were just married a a short time and I was their first child.</span> <span id="s161">In 1939 when I was four, I remember with great clarity, the blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s162">I mentioned that my grandparents lived on the outskirts of Warsaw in a section, the name of which I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s163">And we lived, my mother and father and I, in an apartment that I can describe to you in detail, the apartment building and, in fact, a little bit of our apartment too, but I won’t.</span> <span id="s164">In any case -- well, I’ll describe only this much.</span> <span id="s165">That it was a red brick building and was built with a courtyard inside but I think a lot of buildings in Europe were.</span> <span id="s166">That there were iron gates through which you entered the courtyard.</span> <span id="s167">The gate, the handle of the gate was a monkey’s paw.</span> <span id="s168">I don’t even know though if that’s all that unusual.</span> <span id="s169">But I remember that clearly and I remember that gypsies came and entertained and there was a gypsy wagon.</span> <span id="s170">The people leaned out of the windows and looked down into the courtyard and threw coins down.</span> <span id="s171">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s172">The circus troupe came and I remember that.</span> <span id="s173">I remember looking out of the window and I remember that a line was strung from window to window.</span> <span id="s174">I looked out of the window one morning and a ballerina was walking on a rope, right in front of my window.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Across the courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Across the courtyard.</span> <span id="s177">I remember that she held an umbrella and she smiled at me.</span> <span id="s178">I looked down and there was a bear standing on its hind legs and clowns.</span> <span id="s179">It’s such a clear memory, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: A visiting circus?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: A visiting circus in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s182">And the people threw down coins and that’s how they were paid, these itinerant entertainers.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Do you remember whether this was a Jewish neighborhood or was it mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I don’t know, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s185">I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s186">In any case.</span> <span id="s187">I do remember that there was a trolley.</span> <span id="s188">We took a trolley to my grandparent’s house.</span> <span id="s189">The trolley, there was a kind of circle.</span> <span id="s190">The trolley was turned on a -- like a lazy susan.</span> <span id="s191">And that -- that was the end of the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Then the terminal was near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: That was where we lived, at the end of this trolley line.</span> <span id="s194">We went all the way to the other end of the trolley line where there was another turn-a-round.</span> <span id="s195">Within a walk from there was where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s196">So I could probably look on an old map of Warsaw and identify where both dwellings were.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: I have one such map downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: We’ll look this up after ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I’d like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: During the break.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s205">Oh dear, -----</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: We’re talking about your apartment …</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, I won’t go into detail bout the apartment.</span> <span id="s208">It’s not really all that critical.</span> <span id="s209">What I remember was that very hurriedly getting out of it with a lot of bundles and having a ….</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">My father, I must tell you, my early memories of my father are incredibly warm.</span> <span id="s212">My father never raised his voice.</span> <span id="s213">My father would play with me on the floor with toys and make -- he was very artistic, apparently and very creative.</span> <span id="s214">We played with different colored clay which we made animals and whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s215">My father would spend hours in play with me whereas my mother was always busy.</span> <span id="s216">She was always baking and cooking and sewing and knitting and doing all sorts of -- she was always busy.</span> <span id="s217">She was always going in and out and coming and shopping and going.</span> <span id="s218">My father spent a lot of time at home, probably waiting for students or doing -- marking papers or whatever he did.</span> <span id="s219">In any case, I remember that he and I spent a lot of time in my childhood.</span> <span id="s220">I remember my fourth birthday.</span> <span id="s221">I remember about it that my father had decorated the entire house with streamers that he had made into… He had cut different colored shiny paper, very shiny paper of different colors and he made chain by gluing loops of varied colors.</span> <span id="s222">He decorated the room, I guess it was, with these paper chains which hung from the ceiling in loops and around the walls and so forth.</span> <span id="s223">I remember that, I don’t know, 20 children or whatever of my age came and they all brought presents.</span> <span id="s224">I had a hysterical fit because I had received two sets of dominos and I lay on the floor and kicked and had a tantrum.</span> <span id="s225">How wonderful and understanding my father was and how impatient and annoyed with the whole nonsense, my mother was.</span> <span id="s226">So my mother was a kind of down to business personality, probably like I am.</span> <span id="s227">And my father was soft and sort of a dreamer.</span> <span id="s228">It fits -- the memory that I have of him -- fits with the family version of what he was, which they sort of feel was sort of a failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: An idealist?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: An idealist or whatever and an intellectual, he spoke many languages, among them German, with great fluency.</span> <span id="s231">He was a poet, he read and wrote poetry and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s232">He was an intellectual.</span> <span id="s233">My mother was more of an earth mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: We spoke Polish, a very intellectual Polish.</span> <span id="s236">Everyone was very well educated.</span> <span id="s237">My mother’s brothers and sisters were all very involved in the arts.</span> <span id="s238">Each one had a different interest.</span> <span id="s239">One in theater, another one in opera and another one in, oh, I don’t know this and that, whatever.</span> <span id="s240">All of the guests and friends and so forth and their individual circles of friends were all, you know, famous.</span> <span id="s241">They were all celebrity sort of people in the arts.</span> <span id="s242">At parties, they were all well known -- they were sort of the jet set of -- you know, of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Were you old enough to get any lessons from your father or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s245">I was not.</span> <span id="s246">I was four years old.</span> <span id="s247">I was not.</span> <span id="s248">I just remember sitting on the floor and drawing or making, playing with clay.</span> <span id="s249">I remember cooking with my mother, baking.</span> <span id="s250">My mother -- I remember the cookies she baked.</span> <span id="s251">I think they’re called Linser tarts or tortes or something like that.</span> <span id="s252">They’re little round -- they were made little round cookies with some jelly and then a second cookie with a hole in it on top.</span> <span id="s253">That was one she made a lot.</span> <span id="s254">Then she made a cookie which a friend of my father’s who visited quite frequently, I believe he was a professor, Professor Zuckerman, which means sugar man.</span> <span id="s255">These were cookies with coarse sugar sprinkled on top and my mother used to call them -- because this gentleman particularly enjoyed those cookies -- so she called those Zuckerman cookies.</span> <span id="s256">I remember making those with her.</span> <span id="s257">I remember sitting -- preparations in my grandmother’s kitchen for the holidays.</span> <span id="s258">I remember my mother and her sisters and my grandmother all baking and cooking and I remember the challahs that they made.</span> <span id="s259">These great long challahs braided with a little braid on top.</span> <span id="s260">They always made a little one for me or they gave me dough to play with.</span> <span id="s261">I remember that they sat me in a high chair kind of across the -- from, you know, the opposite side of the room from where the ovens were, the heat was.</span> <span id="s262">To entertain me, they would say, Mirka, open your mouth.</span> <span id="s263">They would fling a raisin across the room and I loved raisins and I would open my mouth and try to catch the raisin.</span> <span id="s264">There were great peals of laughter when it hit my nose or never reached near or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s265">I just remember that with such clarity, it’s incredible and I was four years old.</span> <span id="s266">Then I recall that we left our apartment in great haste, schlepping all sorts of bundles.</span> <span id="s267">I remember a big hysterical fight with my mother because I insisted on bringing my favorite possession which was an enormous teddy bear, almost my own size.</span> <span id="s268">It was a Stief teddy bear and my grandmother had bought this teddy bear on the day I was born and gave it to my mother.</span> <span id="s269">I grew up with this teddy bear and he was my companion and I remember that I called that teddy bear by my grandfather’s name which was David.</span> <span id="s270">And that teddy bear had to go with me.</span> <span id="s271">We left the apartment and I don’t remember by what means we got there.</span> <span id="s272">I doubt that it was the trolley.</span> <span id="s273">I don’t remember that part but we arrived in my grandparents’ home where there was enormous excitement in the courtyard, the factory, the house and the people who worked in the factory all lived in surrounding little bungalows on their land.</span> <span id="s274">There was enormous excitement, people being loaded into trucks and also into the horse drawn carts which had been used to deliver the soda all over Poland and probably all over, I don’t know, Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s275">Everybody was getting into trucks and there were sirens and the light was fading.</span> <span id="s276">Then I remember being pushed up into the back of an open truck.</span> <span id="s277">I remember my uncle being told to drive and orders being yelled at my father -- I just remember the entire scene and I…</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you have David with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I had David and I sat on my mother’s lap.</span> <span id="s280">I remember my mother put her hands -- I sat in her lap with my back against her breast.</span> <span id="s281">My mother put her hands in front of my face trying to shield my eyes and I tore at her fingers trying to get a view of this incredible thing that was going on.</span> <span id="s282">Huge explosions of light streaking across the sky and fireballs and explosions and noise and whistling and screaming!</span> <span id="s283">And the horses screaming and automobiles horns and people screaming and bundles flying!</span> <span id="s284">All this made excitement and then we moved out in a caravan and joined a -- did you ever see ants following in a trail making a road?</span> <span id="s285">Well, that’s how we were -- like a river of humanity in carts and horses, on foot and screaming and it got darker and darker.</span> <span id="s286">And then behind the skyline of the city, fires and explosions and that’s how we left Warsaw and life as I knew it, ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You had no idea why or who or what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s289">Could we take a break?</span> <span id="s290">I need a glass of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: … people who take care of the horses and there were people who worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s293">Then there were these cabins on the land where the workers lived and whole families lived there.</span> <span id="s294">My grandfather sort of took care of all these people and these people were all peasants.</span> <span id="s295">Most of them came from the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s296">They came and they lived there and they worked and then they would go home and some relatives would be sent back and so forth.</span> <span id="s297">Whole families lived from my grandfather and his… But my grandfather was very involved with his horses and his big dream was to have a team of horses -- you know the Clydesdale horses that, you know, deliver the beer, I’ve forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Budweiser?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A?</span> <span id="s300">Budweiser beer.</span> <span id="s301">Well these were teams of horses like that.</span> <span id="s302">I mean they weren’t Clydesdales with the feathered feet but they were just teams of big brown…</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Belgian type horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Right and they were all dark, big dark horses.</span> <span id="s305">But my grandfather’s dream was to have at least one team of all white horses.</span> <span id="s306">I remember that -- and my grandfather fought this new fangled business of using trucks.</span> <span id="s307">He was enamored of his horses and the idea of the horses and having the white team of horses.</span> <span id="s308">He bought -- he kept buying white horses and each time he had a failure.</span> <span id="s309">The horse would get sick and die or break a leg or whatever happened and he could never quite collect a team of horses.</span> <span id="s310">I remember an incident before the blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s311">He had just bought a new white horse, a stallion, I don’t know, whatever.</span> <span id="s312">He was very proud of this huge white horse.</span> <span id="s313">I remember being shown this horse along with my mother and father.</span> <span id="s314">My uncle Jacob who was the, I, told you before, the oldest and he was the controller, was very proud of this horse.</span> <span id="s315">My grandfather led the horse out of the stable and into the central courtyard of his domain and walked the horse around.</span> <span id="s316">He said to Jacob, here you take the horse or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s317">Anyway the horse -- and I remember this and it’s a very important story a little later in my life -- the horse reared up and kicked my uncle Jacob in the chest.</span> <span id="s318">He bucked, you know, with his hind foot, he hit uncle Jacob in the chest and knocked uncle Jacob unconscious.</span> <span id="s319">They carried uncle Jacob into the house.</span> <span id="s320">I remember that back room through which we would go -- it was in the back of the house and faced the courtyard.</span> <span id="s321">The front of the house where we lived was a little more formal.</span> <span id="s322">But you see, the soda manufacturing plant was in the back and the courtyard was all earth, no concrete.</span> <span id="s323">So when it rained, it was sort of muddy.</span> <span id="s324">Also inside the soda manufactory, it was all water.</span> <span id="s325">So the plant was -- had boards nailed together, you know, wooden….</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Planks.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Planks so that the water could go through and underneath.</span> <span id="s328">All the workers wore wooden shoes, you know, like the Dutch shoes.</span> <span id="s329">So they would leave their shoes at home and everybody had sort of a little mud room and they would put on wooden shoes and then go into the manufactory, you know, through the courtyard and into the manufactory and work.</span> <span id="s330">Then, when they came home, they would leave those wooden shoes in the mud rooms and put on their shoes or boots or whatever they had.</span> <span id="s331">Well, our mud room was -- my grandmother’s mud room -- was this big room and it had hooks on the wall on which coats hung and then sort of shelves underneath that where the wooden shoes sat when they weren’t in use or the boots, you know.</span> <span id="s332">There was a leather sort of a bed.</span> <span id="s333">It wasn’t a sofa, it was like a flat low thing.</span> <span id="s334">I guess they must have sat there to put on their boots.</span> <span id="s335">So when my uncle Jacob was kicked by the horse, they carried him into this mud room and they put him on this leather sofa bed or whatever it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: A cot.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: A cot, yeah, I guess, cot.</span> <span id="s338">Well, it was more elegant than a cot.</span> <span id="s339">It was a big upholstered thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: It was leather.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: But it was leather, yeah.</span> <span id="s342">It was dark leather, brown leather.</span> <span id="s343">I mean I remember that thing.</span> <span id="s344">You know I remember the squeak of the hinge of that back door.</span> <span id="s345">I can hear it in my memory.</span> <span id="s346">The room where I slept when I stayed at my grandmother’s must have been above or somewhere near that door.</span> <span id="s347">Because I remember it opening and closing in the morning when my grandfather went into the factory and my grandmother went out to get the chickens or whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: You spent a lot of time with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes, and I loved being there.</span> <span id="s350">And I guess because my parents worked, you know.</span> <span id="s351">My mother must have worked and my father, I don’t know -- I must have spent a lot of time there and I liked it .</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you love horses?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s354">I really don’t remember any interaction with horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So everyone else is more excited about horses than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, I remember being awed, but you know….</span> <span id="s357">I remember spending my time with the cooking and that sort of thing, in the kitchen sort of and around my aunts.</span> <span id="s358">I remember being in the factory.</span> <span id="s359">My grandfather must have taken me there.</span> <span id="s360">I remember sitting behind their house on big barrels.</span> <span id="s361">He had big barrels which must have contained something to do with the soda plant.</span> <span id="s362">I don’t know, whatever fruit or, I don’t know, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s363">We would sit there on the barrels in the sun.</span> <span id="s364">That part of the house faced south.</span> <span id="s365">In the afternoon, the sun was there.</span> <span id="s366">My grandfather and I would sit there and he would tell me stories.</span> <span id="s367">I remember one day, he gave me Hanukkah gelt.</span> <span id="s368">I remember he was explaining to me about Hanukkah gelt and I just remember him giving me coins and sitting in the sun and talking about Hanukkah gelt while inside wonderful things were being cooked and delicious smells were coming out of the windows and across the courtyard.</span> <span id="s369">Anyway, getting back to the story of my uncle Jacob being kicked by the horse, I remember -- oh now -- uncle Jacob, because he was the controller, he wasn’t really involved in the factory nor the stables.</span> <span id="s370">He was in the office so he didn’t wear wooden shoes or boots.</span> <span id="s371">He wore shoes with laces, you know, like a businessman.</span> <span id="s372">So when he went out into the courtyard, it must have been a muddy situation because he was wearing his shoes.</span> <span id="s373">When they brought him in and laid him on the couch, I remember, while they were all running around excitedly calling for doctors and what should we do?</span> <span id="s374">You undo his belt and you get cold water to put on his forehead and blah, blah.</span> <span id="s375">My aunts and everybody was quite hysterical.</span> <span id="s376">I remember untying his shoelaces.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t know why I remember doing that but that’s what I did while they were all -- they were undoing him and I undid his shoelaces.</span> <span id="s378">Years later, when uncle Jacob found me, he -- well shall I tell you about it later or shall I tell it now?</span> <span id="s379">He said to me, do you know me?</span> <span id="s380">I said of course I know you.</span> <span id="s381">He said but you were so little when you saw me last, how do you know me?</span> <span id="s382">I said well I remember you perfectly and then I told him this story.</span> <span id="s383">He was amazed because he figured out that I couldn’t have been three.</span> <span id="s384">I must have been like two and a half when this happened because he knew when it was before the blitzkrieg because that was probably the last time he saw me.</span> <span id="s385">.</span> <span id="s386">So I had to have been less than three years old.</span> <span id="s387">He found it so amazing that my memory was so clear and that he remembered that and how much he had loved me because I was the only -- I was the youngest of his nieces and was the only child of his favorite baby sister.</span> <span id="s388">So I was very special and that act of taking off his shoes was very special for him and the fact that I remember that with such clarity meant a great deal to him.</span> <span id="s389">But I’ll get back to that period later.</span> <span id="s390">The next couple of years of my life are very fuzzy.</span> <span id="s391">The family all stayed together for a very brief period of time and then my grandparents insisted on returning to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: So you actually left Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes, the entire family and all the workers and everyone who lived there.</span> <span id="s394">Everybody -- we went in the truck because we -- the family went in the truck.</span> <span id="s395">But everyone else was given the cars and carts and horses.</span> <span id="s396">Take what --run for your lives -- take --save yourselves.</span> <span id="s397">Everybody got n the road, we all got on the road and, I guess, dispersed on the road, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Your family remained together?</span> <span id="s399">You were in two open trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes, the family was together in two open trucks.</span> <span id="s401">We stayed together.</span> <span id="s402">I don’t know where we went.</span> <span id="s403">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s404">We left the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Do you have any idea whether it was a short distance or a..</span> <span id="s406">?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I really honestly -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s408">I mean I’m sure I went to sleep and I don’t know and hours or years could have elapsed… I really can’t tell you, I’m very fuzzy there.</span> <span id="s409">I only know -- I only remember isolated instances.</span> <span id="s410">I don’t remember history, I remember antidotal sort of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Were you in a city or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s413">We were in cities.</span> <span id="s414">I know we were in cities.</span> <span id="s415">I remember, as I said, antidotal incidents.</span> <span id="s416">I’ll tell you just a few and that might help.</span> <span id="s417">I remember that -- I know that my mother’s family were very close, as I have already indicated.</span> <span id="s418">Apparently my grandparents decided that they wanted to die in Warsaw in their home and they insisted on going back.</span> <span id="s419">I know that some of the sisters went back with them.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t know where Jacob and his family went or wound up and I learned later that he refused to sign the communist whatever -- he had to pledge -- and therefore he was banished to Siberia.</span> <span id="s421">The youngest brother, as I told you, was in Paris so he’s out of the picture.</span> <span id="s422">Where the aunts all went, the four -- well one was in Russia with her family so the other three, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s423">They might have all returned to Warsaw with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s424">I know there was another branch of the family in Pinsk.</span> <span id="s425">I know we went to Pinsk, oh that helps, right?</span> <span id="s426">We went to Pinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: That’s the Russian occupied part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: That’s the direction we -- oh thank you.</span> <span id="s429">You’re helping me too.</span> <span id="s430">So that is where we went -- to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s431">That’s where we must have gone.</span> <span id="s432">I don’t know if we went there immediately or what.</span> <span id="s433">Then I remember that my parents had furious arguments because my mother wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: To Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: To her parents, to her family, you know.</span> <span id="s436">They had horrible fights and didn’t get along very well.</span> <span id="s437">I remember screaming and whatever.</span> <span id="s438">Then we probably left Poland because I remember an incident where one night I heard my mother crying and my parents were arguing and I came out of bed.</span> <span id="s439">There was a fireplace, you know, most ________ was the central heating most places in Europe.</span> <span id="s440">My parents were burning Polish money; they were burning the bills.</span> <span id="s441">My mother was crying because she was lamenting all the sacrifices that she had made to save this money.</span> <span id="s442">My father was telling her instead, forever the romantic, look at the beautiful colors of the flames.</span> <span id="s443">Don’t think about what it is.</span> <span id="s444">There is no paper in the world that burns as beautifully as that.</span> <span id="s445">Look at it, look how it sparkles.</span> <span id="s446">Look, come here Mirka.</span> <span id="s447">Sit by the fire and watch.</span> <span id="s448">Isn’t that beautiful?</span> <span id="s449">You’ll never see anything like this again as long as you live and of course I never have seen anyone burn money, particularly Polish money.</span> <span id="s450">I remember, oh my G___, I remember being with my parents once in some other city.</span> <span id="s451">We were in a community of people and my mother -- we were on the edge of a forest.</span> <span id="s452">It was a city on the edge of a forest.</span> <span id="s453">My mother knew about mushrooms.</span> <span id="s454">You know in Europe there are wild mushrooms, wild mushrooms are picked, there was much more interest in mushrooms that we have in the United States and there was a great deal to know about them because some of them are poisonous and whatever.</span> <span id="s455">Well, my mother apparently was a mushroom maven.</span> <span id="s456">A group was organized to go to the forest on a picnic and mushroom picking expedition.</span> <span id="s457">Several families went in a horse drawn carriage and we drove to the edge of the woods -- or maybe two carriages, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s458">But anyway, we got to the edge of the woods and there was a little boy about my age and we had a picnic on blankets at the edge of the woods, a clearing in the woods, very sunny and pretty, clearing and grass.</span> <span id="s459">We had this lovely picnic.</span> <span id="s460">Then my mother told this little boy, you keep an eye on her.</span> <span id="s461">He was a little older.</span> <span id="s462">You take care of her and we’re going into the woods.</span> <span id="s463">Don’t worry, we’ll be back, you stay here and play right here.</span> <span id="s464">Don’t go further than this spot or whatever she told him.</span> <span id="s465">And he and I began to play and run around.</span> <span id="s466">We got to bushes suddenly, big bushy things and I said to him, look those are berries, they’re raspberries, I’m sorry, blueberries, you know, blueberries.</span> <span id="s467">He said, yes.</span> <span id="s468">There were several kinds of berries growing and we began to pick these berries and eat them and stuff our mouths with them.</span> <span id="s469">I had on a dress with a pinafore or apron or something and I took the skirt and made a sort of pouch and held it in one hand and put the berries into my apron.</span> <span id="s470">He began to pull the berries off the bush and he climbed up and we had my apron filled when we heard some noise.</span> <span id="s471">Suddenly all the adults came flying out of the forest and I was so excited to show my mother what I had found.</span> <span id="s472">My mother started to scream, come it’s raining and she took the berries and put them in something and she just -- there wasn’t time to be excited.</span> <span id="s473">My mother was impatient.</span> <span id="s474">I already told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Practical woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Practical, yes.</span> <span id="s477">She said come, it’s raining, it’s beginning to rain.</span> <span id="s478">We started to go toward the --where our carriage, cart, horse cart was, and we began to walk in a line.</span> <span id="s479">The adults held up the blankets over our heads -- made like a ceiling of blankets.</span> <span id="s480">The little boy and I and there were several other children who were older and who had gone into the woods with the mushroom pickers.</span> <span id="s481">We were among their feet, you know, underneath the blankets.</span> <span id="s482">The taller adults held the blankets aloft over us on the four corners.</span> <span id="s483">Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to fall.</span> <span id="s484">With that, two airplanes came flying out of the sky and strafed us and began to shoot.</span> <span id="s485">We scattered.</span> <span id="s486">They made a pass and my mother said, I remember my mother screaming something like the blankets wouldn’t protect us from bullets, scatter.</span> <span id="s487">We began to scatter and I wound up in a ditch.</span> <span id="s488">When the excitement of the planes and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended, the little boy who had been picking berries with me was lying dead next to me.</span> <span id="s489">So that’s an anecdote.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And you still didn’t know why or what or who?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, I knew.</span> <span id="s492">I did understand.</span> <span id="s493">You know, it’s like nobody ever explained the facts of life to me, nobody ever had a sex talk with me but I knew.</span> <span id="s494">Nobody ever explained the war to me, but I knew.</span> <span id="s495">I was old before my time and understood without explanation.</span> <span id="s496">I don’t think I ever asked a question.</span> <span id="s497">I remember men disappearing.</span> <span id="s498">I remember the gathering of jewelry to pay some kind of ransom.</span> <span id="s499">Somebody was imprisoned -- Zuckerman!</span> <span id="s500">Dr., Professor Zuckerman, we had to… My mother gave some jewelry and we collected jewelry because he was detained.</span> <span id="s501">We never did get him back.</span> <span id="s502">I remember that.</span> <span id="s503">Shortly after that, my father went foraging for food somewhere and he was in a farmer’s field.</span> <span id="s504">They went to steal food from a farm at night.</span> <span id="s505">I remember my father coming back and saying that the soldiers were running -- were chasing them and that he hid in a furrow, you know….</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Irrigation ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Or something, I don’t know, in a furrow on the farm between the rows of whatever was growing.</span> <span id="s508">And that a soldier stepped on the brim of his cap and very soon after that, my father disappeared and my mother said that he had left and that he would send for us.</span> <span id="s509">My mother and I were left alone.</span> <span id="s510">I remember asking my mother, many, many times, when will father come for us or send for us.</span> <span id="s511">She always answered in exactly the same way.</span> <span id="s512">It’s really one of the half dozen Polish words that I remember.</span> <span id="s513">She always said, Crusscoov and that means soon.</span> <span id="s514">But of course, he never came.</span> <span id="s515">Then my mother and I moved to another city and I wish to G___ I could tell you where.</span> <span id="s516">But that city was in the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: So you never returned to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, no, we never returned to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s519">Oh, I remember, another incident.</span> <span id="s520">My parents and I were on a train and the train was bombed.</span> <span id="s521">Several of the cars fell down into a ditch and there were many dead and screaming and G____ knows what.</span> <span id="s522">We were in the last car of the train and I think that was the only one that was left standing on the track and was not hit.</span> <span id="s523">So I remember that.</span> <span id="s524">Anyway my mother and I were alone and we wound up in this city, probably in the Ukraine, and very near the village where I was ultimately to be hidden.</span> <span id="s525">My mother supported us, it’s a terrible word.</span> <span id="s526">I mean she provided the little we had by knitting.</span> <span id="s527">I know that sounds ridiculous but my mother would take your old sweater with the holes in the elbows and she would rip out the yarn and out of that torn, holey sweater, she would make you a vest or a short sleeve sweater or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s528">She knitted day and night.</span> <span id="s529">I remember listening to my mother’s knitting needles, even in the night.</span> <span id="s530">My mother smoked.</span> <span id="s531">I remember seeing her cigarette in the dark.</span> <span id="s532">My mother was an exceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark without having to look.</span> <span id="s533">I remember going into bomb shelters during air raids and my mother would say to me, I’m here, just listen to my needles and you know I’m here.</span> <span id="s534">You needn’t be afraid as long as you hear my needles.</span> <span id="s535">If she wasn’t knitting, she was smoking.</span> <span id="s536">She’d say, watch, that’s my cigarette.</span> <span id="s537">I would watch her face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her cigarette.</span> <span id="s538">But most of the time she was knitting.</span> <span id="s539">She knitted all the time.</span> <span id="s540">She would ask me to hold out my hands.</span> <span id="s541">When she ripped a sweater, she would wind the yarn around my hands.</span> <span id="s542">My two outstretched hands.</span> <span id="s543">Then she would wind it into a ball from my hands.</span> <span id="s544">I remember holding out my hands and getting very tired and complaining a great deal but that was how she supported us.</span> <span id="s545">I know that at night, she would sneak out after the curfew and she would go to the parts of the city where she wasn’t allowed to go be, to deliver her goods.</span> <span id="s546">One time she took me with her.</span> <span id="s547">That was rare, usually she left me back in our room with my teddy bear, my David, my treasured possession.</span> <span id="s548">She took me with her into the city and she said she was taking me to a lady who, I must be very careful and I must not speak only to say please and thank you and to be very polite, other than that to not speak.</span> <span id="s549">If I’m asked a question only to say yes and no and not to say anything.</span> <span id="s550">Because where we were going was very dangerous but this was a very generous lady and she would probably serve tea and cake or cookies.</span> <span id="s551">That was why my mother was going to take a chance and take me because we might get something very delicious to eat, or jam, jam.</span> <span id="s552">So we went and we crossed into a section that I don’t remember by what means or what but I know we weren’t allowed o be there.</span> <span id="s553">We went into a house and I just seem to remember that it was a white house and it had a door.</span> <span id="s554">We went inside and inside was a very cozy home, a cozy room with lovely upholstered furniture and a lot of pillows.</span> <span id="s555">There was a piano and it had a shawl over it and a beautiful vase filled with flowers.</span> <span id="s556">There were photographs and there were a lot of pictures and paintings and things on the walls.</span> <span id="s557">We sat on an upholstered, lovely carved settee with a table in front.</span> <span id="s558">Just as my mother had predicted, this lady brought out a tray with a tea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful things.</span> <span id="s559">I ate and oh it was so wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: You hadn’t had anything like that in a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I hadn’t had anything like that, my G___!</span> <span id="s562">Oh, it was so wonderful.</span> <span id="s563">With that the lady said to my mother, come into my bedroom and I’ll show you what I made.</span> <span id="s564">It turned out that this lady was a -- well she did beautiful needlework.</span> <span id="s565">She did these pictures which were framed which were both embroidered and appliquéd.</span> <span id="s566">For example, there was one -- well I’ll tell you about that one because it almost caused our death.</span> <span id="s567">Also the reason she called my mother into another room is because this lady also made dolls which were fully clothed adult dolls but they were apparently anatomically correct.</span> <span id="s568">So she showed this lovely doll but then invited my mother into this next room so that she could undress this male doll and show my mother that it had all its anatomical parts.</span> <span id="s569">Well, while my mother and this lady were out of the room I turned and looked at the wall behind me on which hung a picture that this woman had also made.</span> <span id="s570">The picture was of a sort of cottage and a yard filled with chickens and there were flowers against the cottage and there were little windows with shutters and a door and so forth.</span> <span id="s571">There was a girl throwing feed from an apron, just like I had described before, throwing seed out to chickens.</span> <span id="s572">There were chickens all over, feeding and flying around and whatever.</span> <span id="s573">All of this was appliquéd and embroidered and so on and very intricate.</span> <span id="s574">Suddenly I realized to my horror or fascination that the girl feeding the chickens had a yellow star on her chest.</span> <span id="s575">When my mother came out of the other room with this lady, I absolutely couldn’t help but point it out.</span> <span id="s576">Look she has a yellow star.</span> <span id="s577">With that this woman flew into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and said, you did that, it wasn’t there before, you’re responsible, you did that!</span> <span id="s578">She screamed out of the door for the police.</span> <span id="s579">My mother and I ran out.</span> <span id="s580">There were two police and I can’t tell you what they were but I think they had brown….</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Brown uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Brown uniforms.</span> <span id="s583">That’s -- I think -- my memory serves me -- they were brown.</span> <span id="s584">One blew a whistle and ran around the corner for the truck or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s585">The other one had a rifle or a gun or something, I don’t remember, and he was holding on to my mother.</span> <span id="s586">I realized the import of what was happening and I began to scream and I bit the hand of this policeman.</span> <span id="s587">He began -- pulled away his hand in pain and screamed out.</span> <span id="s588">My mother grabbed me and we ran and hid and we got away.</span> <span id="s589">At that time, my mother and I shared a room with another lady in a sort of a boarding house which must have been all Jews.</span> <span id="s590">I don’t know whether the woman who owned this home was Jewish or not, I only remember that she -- I remember a lot about her actually.</span> <span id="s591">One of the things that I remember is that she kept talking about her son who was in the army and who was going to come home.</span> <span id="s592">She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked and she had it in packages under a cabinet.</span> <span id="s593">She showed us that she had baked this and she was saving it for her son, it was his favorite thing.</span> <span id="s594">As soon as she knew where he was, she would send it to the front, send some to the front.</span> <span id="s595">But if that wasn’t possible that was okay, because he would be home soon and then she would have this for him.</span> <span id="s596">My mother and the lady who shared the room with us gave each other a knowing sort of look and then my mother, every night, proceeded to steal some of the cookies.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Was this an Ukrainian woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s599">One day, my mother went out and she came home very, very excited, very happy.</span> <span id="s600">At that time we were literally starving.</span> <span id="s601">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s602">It was summer and we were eating, it’s a weed that grows.</span> <span id="s603">It’s kind of a jagged leaf and it has a kind of gray, silky, shiny surface.</span> <span id="s604">It grows here in the United States and every year is a ritual, I eat some.</span> <span id="s605">It kind of tastes like spinach.</span> <span id="s606">That’s what we ate that summer, that and the stolen cookies.</span> <span id="s607">Every now and then something else my mother was able to forage.</span> <span id="s608">But my mother came home one day extremely excited and happy.</span> <span id="s609">She had made a great coup, a conquest.</span> <span id="s610">She brought home this treasure.</span> <span id="s611">She carefully unwrapped this thing.</span> <span id="s612">I couldn’t wait to see what it could possibly be.</span> <span id="s613">She kept on unwrapping this handkerchief.</span> <span id="s614">It was in this piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s615">Finally there was this two- inch square of -- or maybe it was one inch, I don’t know -- it looked like a big domino of something white.</span> <span id="s616">I’d never seen it.</span> <span id="s617">I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s618">I said to my mother, what is it?</span> <span id="s619">It was such a treasure!</span> <span id="s620">She said, it’s fat, which didn’t mean anything to me but it did finally mean that she was able to fry those greens and they had a little taste rather than eating them raw or boiling them.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Earlier you mentioned that you saw this embroidered picture with the star, a person wearing a star.</span> <span id="s622">Did you see any people, real people wearing those stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes, I was one of them and so was my mother.</span> <span id="s624">My mother was very talented at all needle work.</span> <span id="s625">She was a wonderful seamstress.</span> <span id="s626">My mother had made me a beautiful -- she must have made it -- well I guess it could have been after the blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s627">Maybe it was a birthday present, in fact, maybe I think it was a birthday present.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: A birthday after the blitzkrieg?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Possibly or the one after that, I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s630">That period is very -- it’s all very fuzzy.</span> <span id="s631">I mean my memories are more anecdotal than they are historic.</span> <span id="s632">There’s no real sequence.</span> <span id="s633">I guess they’re in some sort of sequence but it doesn’t really tell you much, well maybe it does.</span> <span id="s634">So my mother made me this coat and I remember this lovely spring coat.</span> <span id="s635">It was a very pale gray tweed and it had little nubs of color, little colors.</span> <span id="s636">The colors were all pastel, little bumps all over this fabric.</span> <span id="s637">They were beautiful, pale lavender and pink and light green and blue and just sort of a capelet, a little cape on top of the shoulders.</span> <span id="s638">I remember that I couldn’t wait for it to get warm enough to wear this wonderful treasure that my mother had made.</span> <span id="s639">When I finally -- it was time to wear to it my mother sewed this very ugly yellow star on my left shoulder and my left shoulder blade.</span> <span id="s640">And I protested vehemently and she simply told me not to discuss it.</span> <span id="s641">It was a fact and to ignore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: This was your first yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Then this was before you had seen that -- the embroidered picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s646">Well, the yellow stars became common.</span> <span id="s647">I also remember my mother coming home one day.</span> <span id="s648">She had a navy coat and it had a black fur collar, a shiny -- a seal.</span> <span id="s649">It must have been a seal collar or a black Persian , or I don’t know, something, a black fur collar.</span> <span id="s650">When she came home -- and the coat had yellow stars on it -- when she returned home from wherever she had been, the fur had been removed from her coat.</span> <span id="s651">She explained to our roommate that all fur had to be donated to the German army because they needed it.</span> <span id="s652">Of course, the coat was ruined.</span> <span id="s653">So I remember that.</span> <span id="s654">One day my mother came home and she had this young girl with her.</span> <span id="s655">She was a teenage girl and I was supposed to remember her, but I only vaguely remembered her.</span> <span id="s656">Apparently this girl had been a student of my father’s in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s657">My mother, by chance, bumped into her somewhere in town and brought this girl whose name was Rya.</span> <span id="s658">She sat me on her lap and in her no nonsense sort of way, she said to me, you must go with Rya and when I can, I will come for you.</span> <span id="s659">When will you come for me?</span> <span id="s660">Crusscoov.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: You heard that one before?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Of course, my mother never came for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Do you have any idea when this was?</span> <span id="s664">How many winters, for example, had passed since you had been wandering?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I know that this incident was at the very end of summer.</span> <span id="s666">It was probably the same summer which the preceding spring had brought the pretty coat and the yellow star experience and all that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: The same year that you had the incident with the picture, the embroidered picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yes, probably although --.</span> <span id="s669">I would imagine that that was very close, those events were very close to each other.</span> <span id="s670">The events that I told you before, traveling with my father, the train, the bombing with the blankets over the head and all that; I think that was probably a year before.</span> <span id="s671">So that might have been, say 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Pretty good guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did you see German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s676">Well, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: More so than before?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes, I didn’t really see a great deal of German soldiers when I was still with my mother, although yes, some.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Any explosions, aircraft, bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: A lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s681">I told you about listening to my mother’s knitting needles in bomb shelters and cellars and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s682">That was nothing, that was daily, sometimes twice daily.</span> <span id="s683">Many times, that was --that was just ordinary.</span> <span id="s684">In fact, at one point, I was pushed down some stairs, or a ladder or something and my nose was broken.</span> <span id="s685">It wasn’t even known until the next day that my nose was broken because we were in the dark.</span> <span id="s686">It wasn’t until the light that my mother saw that I was completely bruised -- my nose had been shattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: You were someplace in the western Ukraine, late summer, end of summer ’41 and your mother is now giving you to this young woman who was also from Warsaw originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A No.</span> <span id="s689">Now I have to give you a little bit of background.</span> <span id="s690">First of all, Rya was no more than a teenager at that point.</span> <span id="s691">I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s692">I would have been say five and a half, six.</span> <span id="s693">So Rya was, I don’t know, ten years older.</span> <span id="s694">A little background… In the Ukraine, what I know of the Ukraine, there are little villages.</span> <span id="s695">Obviously, there are big towns but the countryside of the Ukraine was… This is another life, now I’m giving you history that I -- this is where I lived.</span> <span id="s696">There were little villages which were connected to each other by dirt roads.</span> <span id="s697">During the summer these roads were traversed by horse drawn carriage, not carriages but carts.</span> <span id="s698">The villages -- surrounding these villages were the farms.</span> <span id="s699">The land had been divided after the fall of the Czars, Czar, First World War, had been divided among the peasants.</span> <span id="s700">Previous to that, it was owned by the Church.</span> <span id="s701">So that now although the people were very religious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was no longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they had been during the time of the Czars, during White Russia.</span> <span id="s702">But because the peasants were religious, the priests lived a far better life than did the peasants.</span> <span id="s703">Now it’s the Greek Orthodox Church, the Bible is in Greek.</span> <span id="s704">The priests marry and have families.</span> <span id="s705">The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village.</span> <span id="s706">The children of the priests became the postmaster, the school teachers, the mayor, if there was such a thing.</span> <span id="s707">They sort of ran the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: They could read and write?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: They could read and write.</span> <span id="s710">Some f them were very highly educated.</span> <span id="s711">The more wealthy was the priest, the better educated were his children.</span> <span id="s712">In order to be educated they were sent “abroad”.</span> <span id="s713">Abroad meant great cities in Europe like Warsaw where this particular Rya, child of a priest in an Ukrainian village would up studying in Warsaw with my father.</span> <span id="s714">Apparently she took private lessons at home or somehow or other got home to meet my mother and became enamored of my mother and became a frequent visitor.</span> <span id="s715">I told you earlier about the generosity of my grandmother and her warmth and so forth, and I am sure that my mother befriend this young girl from the Ukraine in a similar sort of way, although this girl was not of peasant stock.</span> <span id="s716">But my mother liked her and they had a relationship.</span> <span id="s717">Therefore, when my mother bumped into her in town and explained our plight, Rya must have asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than four -- and Rya must have played with me or possibly babysat or whatever.</span> <span id="s718">So when my mother explained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and religious teenager said, well I’ll take her home and hide her with me, without any thought to the consequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the entire village, the future, I mean, you know, nothing.</span> <span id="s719">She simply offered and my mother jumped at the opportunity.</span> <span id="s720">So my mother sent me off with a little package of clothing wrapped around a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was.</span> <span id="s721">I remember walking down the front steps.</span> <span id="s722">I remember my mother standing on the stairs saying don’t turn around.</span> <span id="s723">Just go, walk through the gate and don’t turn around, keep walking.</span> <span id="s724">Remember what I told you, remember what I told you.</span> <span id="s725">We walked through the -- down the stairs and through the garden.</span> <span id="s726">I remember that the garden was overgrown and unkempt and wilted and a great mass of jungle.</span> <span id="s727">It had been cultivated at one time.</span> <span id="s728">That’s why I -- it was late summer.</span> <span id="s729">I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and Rya with the bundle.</span> <span id="s730">We walked out and I turned once to look at my mother and she was holding a handkerchief up to her face.</span> <span id="s731">She yelled again don’t turn around, keep walking.</span> <span id="s732">That’s my last memory of my mother.</span> <span id="s733">I don’t even remember getting to the village or anything about it.</span> <span id="s734">I don’t remember arriving, I don’t remember any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Had you remembered Rya from before?</span> <span id="s736">Or were you -- as far as you were concerned this was a stranger?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No, I might have -- I don’t know, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s738">I don’t remember whether I remembered then or…I was just an obedient child and I went… If my mother said she would come for me, she would come for me.</span> <span id="s739">If she said that I would be safe and I should go, that was it.</span> <span id="s740">I trusted my mother and I knew not to argue with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Were you wearing your yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s743">I don’t imagine so, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s744">I’m not sure that that yellow star was on summer clothing.</span> <span id="s745">I think it might have only been on outerwear.</span> <span id="s746">I really don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: But Rya knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Rya.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Rya.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s751">So now we arrive in the village of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s752">I’ll describe the village to you.</span> <span id="s753">There was a dirt road through which you got to the village.</span> <span id="s754">When you got to the village, there were houses, there’s one in these pictures somewhere.</span> <span id="s755">There’s a man standing in front of it -- I was looking at it before and now I can’t find it.</span> <span id="s756">It’s kind of log cabins with thatched roofs.</span> <span id="s757">Why don’t you turn that off for a moment and I’ll look for the pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: There were houses like I pointed out to you with thatched roofs, log cabin kind of houses, but whitewashed; whitewashed log cabins.</span> <span id="s760">Then the road split like a wishbone.</span> <span id="s761">In the crook of the wishbone sat a small, white church with steps going up.</span> <span id="s762">It had a large door and two windows.</span> <span id="s763">When I looked at it, it looked like a clown face because it had a big window on each side of the door and the steps -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out.</span> <span id="s764">It had a sharp point at the top of the cross with the slash underneath.</span> <span id="s765">The road went around it.</span> <span id="s766">Behind the church was a small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses.</span> <span id="s767">There was a legend that the cross of the priest whose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year.</span> <span id="s768">The people wee so superstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about him grew.</span> <span id="s769">Anyway, the houses continued as the road -- the two roads…</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Diverged.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Diverged, exactly behind the church.</span> <span id="s772">I would say that at the very most there were 30 to 50 houses.</span> <span id="s773">That was the entire town.</span> <span id="s774">On the left side behind our house, which was the most elegant house, it was a clapboard house, very different from the other cabins…Further back behind our house was a stream and then a forest.</span> <span id="s775">On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I was facing the church was a road that led out to the fields where all of the various wheat and grain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was.</span> <span id="s776">That was the entire town.</span> <span id="s777">There was no electricity, there were no automobiles, there were no telephones.</span> <span id="s778">The donation that I made to you, I wrote a little piece to go with it.</span> <span id="s779">The little dress we grew our own hemp.</span> <span id="s780">We spun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn.</span> <span id="s781">It was loomed at home, on a loom.</span> <span id="s782">I sewed it by hand.</span> <span id="s783">Life was primitive.</span> <span id="s784">I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries before.</span> <span id="s785">That was the life of the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: So I’ve described the village to you.</span> <span id="s788">Okay, the household.</span> <span id="s789">I mean I could describe our house.</span> <span id="s790">Very briefly, I’ll tell you that life was centered for the most part around the kitchen, primarily because it was the warmest place.</span> <span id="s791">There was no central heating of any kind, in fact.</span> <span id="s792">There is usually a fireplace in one room and the wall against which the fireplace is in one room is the bed wall in the adjacent room simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth.</span> <span id="s793">There was one room which must have been the back of the kitchen , the wall behind where the oven where we baked our bread was.</span> <span id="s794">We used to sit in that room a great deal.</span> <span id="s795">Or if not sit, we would stand with our hands behind our back leaning on that warm wall.</span> <span id="s796">We would take turns because only one spot on the wall was really warm and so we would take turns.</span> <span id="s797">That was how our evenings were spent.</span> <span id="s798">We would tell stories.</span> <span id="s799">In fact, Rya devised a game.</span> <span id="s800">She would start a story.</span> <span id="s801">She would say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic.</span> <span id="s802">When they got out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she would point to me and I would have to pick up the story.</span> <span id="s803">Then I would take the story to some precipice and the next person would go on with it.</span> <span id="s804">This is how we entertained ourselves at night and then we would all go to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Just you and Rya?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: No and other members of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Were there other brothers…?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A Yes, I’ll tell you about that.</span> <span id="s809">That’s how our evenings were spent.</span> <span id="s810">There wasn’t much to the evening because we woke up to the roosters.</span> <span id="s811">They took off with the first light, they would crow.</span> <span id="s812">Life would start at five in the morning or whatever it was and I am sure we were all in bed and asleep by dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Candlelight?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps.</span> <span id="s815">Okay, the members of the family.</span> <span id="s816">The priest had died some years before, two, three, five, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s817">The wife of the priest was very highly revered in the town and she was, in fact, feared.</span> <span id="s818">She was spoken of in the third person, you know.</span> <span id="s819">Enormous respect was accorded her.</span> <span id="s820">She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a god or a monarch, or whatever.</span> <span id="s821">Very highly respected and revered.</span> <span id="s822">People paid court.</span> <span id="s823">There were obligatory visits that they had to make.</span> <span id="s824">They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit her.</span> <span id="s825">They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the window or not, nod toward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s826">Now she was a very bright woman.</span> <span id="s827">It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke fluent Polish -- she was very well educated.</span> <span id="s828">She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going to be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in Poland and I was that sister’s child.</span> <span id="s829">That was -- since I came from, I don’t know where, wherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse.</span> <span id="s830">I was brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or her relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different.</span> <span id="s831">I didn’t look exactly like them and that was my beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: You were given a new last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s834">So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name.</span> <span id="s835">Theirs was a Russian name, obviously.</span> <span id="s836">I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think.</span> <span id="s837">In any case, so I was --well, it’s irrelevant, okay, I won’t give you all that.</span> <span id="s838">In any case, this woman had five children.</span> <span id="s839">The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn’t take too terribly well to education.</span> <span id="s840">I don’t think he was ever sent abroad.</span> <span id="s841">He was sort of more interested in farming.</span> <span id="s842">He was very practical, he was the farmer.</span> <span id="s843">He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his own cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon.</span> <span id="s844">You know, he was more like a peasant.</span> <span id="s845">He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know.</span> <span id="s846">Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious.</span> <span id="s847">He ultimately ran off to the forest and was with the partisans.</span> <span id="s848">In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s849">At one point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather.</span> <span id="s850">He once or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back.</span> <span id="s851">But I hardly remember him because he left.</span> <span id="s852">I don’t even remember his name.</span> <span id="s853">I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it’s funny because it’s an expression that I’ve used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature.</span> <span id="s854">She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood.</span> <span id="s855">I don’t know whether that was a Russian saying but I’ve heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person.</span> <span id="s856">The youngest son was two years older than I was.</span> <span id="s857">His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed.</span> <span id="s858">I was, I don’t know, five and a half, six; he was two years older.</span> <span id="s859">I can describe him perfectly.</span> <span id="s860">He was very tow headed.</span> <span id="s861">He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s862">It was just above the widow’s peak where his hairline began.</span> <span id="s863">He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at that point.</span> <span id="s864">Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off.</span> <span id="s865">Because had it not been, it probably wouldn’t have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction.</span> <span id="s866">So he has this Russian version of a crew cut.</span> <span id="s867">So those were the three sons.</span> <span id="s868">The two daughters were Rya, who I’ve already told you about and the older one whose name I really don’t remember and whom I didn’t get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town.</span> <span id="s869">So she had some sort of office type job.</span> <span id="s870">Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the house.</span> <span id="s871">Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don’t know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack.</span> <span id="s872">So that was the household.</span> <span id="s873">Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness.</span> <span id="s874">I wasn’t sheltered or shielded or loved at all.</span> <span id="s875">I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love.</span> <span id="s876">I was never complimented.</span> <span id="s877">If I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment.</span> <span id="s878">Furthermore, I was from the city.</span> <span id="s879">I was urbane and Vali was a peasant.</span> <span id="s880">He had never been to the city.</span> <span id="s881">I described the building in which I lived which had four floors.</span> <span id="s882">He couldn’t understand that there was a room above a room.</span> <span id="s883">I explained to him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to another -- and stored things.</span> <span id="s884">Also like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his house had three floors.</span> <span id="s885">But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms and, you know, apartments.</span> <span id="s886">I described one apartment building.</span> <span id="s887">He couldn’t conceive of such a thing.</span> <span id="s888">He couldn’t conceive of such a thing as chocolate either.</span> <span id="s889">So that when we were finally invaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already mentioned.</span> <span id="s890">But then they went back and forth and in and out.</span> <span id="s891">They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth.</span> <span id="s892">So they were there several times, in and out.</span> <span id="s893">At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers.</span> <span id="s894">They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate.</span> <span id="s895">I would then take the chocolate and give it to Vali.</span> <span id="s896">Until the mother found out about this and put a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening.</span> <span id="s897">Well, anyway I never really had any love.</span> <span id="s898">I was incredibly lonely.</span> <span id="s899">I kept thinking about my mother.</span> <span id="s900">One day, it just occurred to me that she’s not living and she’ll never come back.</span> <span id="s901">Meanwhile the mother, Vali’s mother, Rya’s mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl.</span> <span id="s902">Taught me all the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit although it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron pots.</span> <span id="s903">You know, children couldn’t physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was peeling the potatoes.</span> <span id="s904">In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled ten truckloads of potatoes, that’s all I did.</span> <span id="s905">I peeled potatoes.</span> <span id="s906">I read with the mother and at first she would read to me.</span> <span id="s907">She read me Bible stories.</span> <span id="s908">She would read to me and she would point to the words with her finger.</span> <span id="s909">I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would turn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story.</span> <span id="s910">She would continue the story and I kind of fell in love with one story.</span> <span id="s911">I kept asking her to read it over and over.</span> <span id="s912">It was the story of the prodigal son.</span> <span id="s913">I don’t know why I liked that one especially but somehow… So she read it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she said, you read, and I did.</span> <span id="s914">And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so many times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story.</span> <span id="s915">At one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little bridge over a -- you know -- like a little stream.</span> <span id="s916">Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little bridge, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water underneath.</span> <span id="s917">Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown.</span> <span id="s918">I said what is that and she explained to me about angels.</span> <span id="s919">I said everybody has an angel?</span> <span id="s920">She said every child has an angel to protect it.</span> <span id="s921">I said even Jewish children?</span> <span id="s922">She said yes, even Jewish children and even you.</span> <span id="s923">You have a very special angel.</span> <span id="s924">So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was.</span> <span id="s925">I was absolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because I had a Jewish angel.</span> <span id="s926">No harm would come to me.</span> <span id="s927">I knew that I would be all right.</span> <span id="s928">I can tell you a lot of stories about life in that village.</span> <span id="s929">I was there two Christmases and three Easters or maybe the other way around.</span> <span id="s930">It’s the other way around.</span> <span id="s931">One day, you’re not going to believe this, you’re not going to believe this… One day in the middle of the severest winter, a horse drawn sled came into town on the road, which was an event.</span> <span id="s932">I mean nothing came in the winter.</span> <span id="s933">Sometimes, you know, if the German army was there, the trucks came but we never saw anything like cars or….</span> <span id="s934">In fact, once a car came and all the children of the village gathered around the car and stared at it as if it was a flying saucer.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: You had seen one before, hadn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Well, I mean to me, it was cars, I mean it was nothing, I had been in cars.</span> <span id="s937">My grandfather had a yard full of big shiny black cars and I remember sitting on his lap and blowing the horn, it was outside the car, you know, one of those things you squeezed.</span> <span id="s938">I mean cars -- was nothing to me.</span> <span id="s939">I was a city child.</span> <span id="s940">I remember being fascinated watching all these children staring at the car like it was something really.</span> <span id="s941">But in any case, it was a great event in the middle of winter, a sled came from -- into town.</span> <span id="s942">Also a wagon, you know, a sled came from -- into town.</span> <span id="s943">Also a wagon, you know, a sled pulled by a single horse with a bell and a guy huddled up and dressed in -- bundled with a whip.</span> <span id="s944">He came right to our house and Rya came to me and she said Mirka do you remember your uncle Jacob.</span> <span id="s945">This is a note from your uncle Jacob.</span> <span id="s946">He’s waiting for you.</span> <span id="s947">I was put on the sled the next morning.</span> <span id="s948">That morning, Vali, the little boy who was two years older than I, disappeared and hid with my teddy bear.</span> <span id="s949">Finally the sled driver was anxious to leave and we could wait no longer and I had to leave without my teddy bear.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: For the first time in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s952">That teddy bear is alive and well and living in the Ukraine and I know that.</span> <span id="s953">Because that --that artifact would never be destroyed or discarded, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: They loved ____teddy bears?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I know that teddy bear is living and well somewhere in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s956">So several hours later, by sled, we got into town and a tall extremely handsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he looked kind of like Clark Gable or possibly….</span> <span id="s957">.</span> <span id="s958">No, no even more distinguished than that, not as romantic a figure but the one who -- what was that great war movie, Mrs. Miniver, who was the husband of Mrs. Miniver?</span> <span id="s959">Not Gregory Peck, Walter Pidgeon.</span> <span id="s960">So my uncle Jacob, looking like Walter Pidgeon, in black shiny boots, very natty, very straight like a soldier, lifted me out of the wagon and set me down.</span> <span id="s961">I looked up at him, up, up, up; he was so tall.</span> <span id="s962">He said, do you remember me?</span> <span id="s963">I said, of course, you’re uncle Jacob.</span> <span id="s964">How do you remember me?</span> <span id="s965">And he carried me into the house and I told him the story of when the horse kicked him in the chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Those were the days.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Well, uncle Jacob and I traveled around Europe.</span> <span id="s968">We went to a number of capitols.</span> <span id="s969">I remember that we went to -- I think we were in four or five countries.</span> <span id="s970">We traveled by those same railroad cars, looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s971">We lived in rooms that were incredibly cold.</span> <span id="s972">I’d like to tell you about one experience but first I’m sure you’d like to know how it was that uncle Jacob found this needle in the haystack hidden in a village in the Ukraine when he had been in Siberia.</span> <span id="s973">So now I’ll tell you a story that you will not believe.</span> <span id="s974">Uncle Jacob left Siberia where he had been put in charge because he was, I had told you before he was so trustworthy and efficient and good at everything, so he had been put in charge of the food supply, mainly the meat.</span> <span id="s975">He was the head butcher in charge of -- he never touched the meat but he was in charge of all the food.</span> <span id="s976">With the little bit of black marketing and finagling that he did, he was able to fill several suitcases or bundles with goods, ladies’ silk underwear… I don’t know where he got all this stuff.</span> <span id="s977">I’m sure they were payoffs for favors or whatever but as we traveled around Europe later, after he found me, those suitcases got lighter and lighter because their contents is what kept us fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: That was your money?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: That was our money.</span> <span id="s980">He also kept a journal.</span> <span id="s981">Unfortunately, at one point, we had to cross a border where I was told that I was to play the part of a deaf mute since we were going -- I didn’t speak the language of wherever we were going.</span> <span id="s982">He was so fearful that he burned the journal and it was the history of the entire war, day by day, from the time he left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s983">So unfortunately a great treasure was -- and I watched that burn, I watched that burn.</span> <span id="s984">That was a daily log.</span> <span id="s985">Anyway Jacob left Siberia and traveled until he -- traveled to many places.</span> <span id="s986">At one point he wound up in this town.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: The town that’s near the village where you had been staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s989">The way the Jews – there were no train schedules, you know.</span> <span id="s990">People would -- if they wanted to go east, they went to the platform where the train was heading east was going and they sat on the platform for a day, for an hour, for a week, whatever, until the train came.</span> <span id="s991">When the train came, they boarded the train and they went east.</span> <span id="s992">When the train stopped, they got off or they kept going or whatever and that’s how people got around.</span> <span id="s993">So there were always people sitting on the platform.</span> <span id="s994">They were going either east or west or wherever they were going, north, south, waiting, sitting on platforms.</span> <span id="s995">Well, apparently, Jacob got off the platform and I have already described to you that he was extremely handsome, very nattily dressed, which was very unusual, highly unusual.</span> <span id="s996">So this handsome guy gets off the train with two bulging suitcases and the women were extremely attracted to him.</span> <span id="s997">He began to talk to a woman who was waiting for a train which was going east -- in the opposite direction -- into, towards Siberia.</span> <span id="s998">Is that east?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: The direction from whence he had come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: From whence he had come.</span> <span id="s1003">So he gets off the train, he’s on the platform, he begins to chat with this woman.</span> <span id="s1004">What is your name?</span> <span id="s1005">That woman was the only human being who knew my whereabouts.</span> <span id="s1006">She was the woman who had shared the room with me and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Before your mother gave you to Rya?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1009">Had her train come first---.</span> <span id="s1010">It was absolute sheer chance!</span> <span id="s1011">He said Berliner, my mother had changed her name, she was no longer using her married name because she was so disillusioned with her husband, my father.</span> <span id="s1012">So she had gone back to her name, Berliner.</span> <span id="s1013">This woman said oh your name is Jacob Berliner.</span> <span id="s1014">My dear friend was Berliner.</span> <span id="s1015">My uncle -- I’m hearing this -- apparently fainted.</span> <span id="s1016">Her train came.</span> <span id="s1017">She got on the train and disappeared.</span> <span id="s1018">He wasn’t sure what niece.</span> <span id="s1019">He didn’t get all the facts.</span> <span id="s1020">He knew the village, he knew a child.</span> <span id="s1021">He thought it might be me but it could have been any number of his nieces.</span> <span id="s1022">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1023">He fainted.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t know how long he was on the platform.</span> <span id="s1025">Anyway, he was found passed out by someone who I think was also a priest.</span> <span id="s1026">He was taken home to that person’s house, maybe because he looked wealthy, I don’t know whatever.</span> <span id="s1027">In any case, apparently he was sick, delirious, ill, I don’t know, whatever for a number of days.</span> <span id="s1028">In that time, he told us later that he had a dream.</span> <span id="s1029">In the dream, he dreamed he was back in Warsaw, it was before the war.</span> <span id="s1030">He was wearing his tails and top hat because he had come from a ball or gone to the opera, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1031">He was walking along the street with his walking stick and as he got near the street lamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety clop of an oncoming carriage.</span> <span id="s1032">It was a very foggy night and out of the fog approached this horse drawn black carriage.</span> <span id="s1033">He tried to peer inside but he couldn’t see because of the fog but it stopped right under the street lamp.</span> <span id="s1034">A woman leaned forward and she was all dressed in white.</span> <span id="s1035">Here comes the lump in the throat.</span> <span id="s1036">It was my mother, his young sister.</span> <span id="s1037">She said, Yacov, take care of my child.</span> <span id="s1038">He knew who it was and it was the next day that he sent this sled to get me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: She was your guardian angel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Perhaps, you’re right, perhaps you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: So that it was on a hunch, limited information, and a dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: And a dream.</span> <span id="s1043">An absolute meeting by chance.</span> <span id="s1044">Two trains coming from different directions – people chatting on a platform.</span> <span id="s1045">It wouldn’t have happened if he was raggedy like all the rest but he was so natty and so attractive and this woman began to -- she was attracted to him and began to chat with him.</span> <span id="s1046">I just want to tell you that when I was born, apparently I was a very sickly infant.</span> <span id="s1047">The story goes that I couldn’t be cured.</span> <span id="s1048">I apparently had all of the childhood diseases, all at the same time.</span> <span id="s1049">Anyway I was given up for dead.</span> <span id="s1050">I had everything including whooping cough, all at the same time.</span> <span id="s1051">They gave me up, this child will never live.</span> <span id="s1052">Finally my mother in desperation said well, then she’ll die at home.</span> <span id="s1053">She took me out of the hospital away from the specialists and so forth and took me home to a room that she had painted white, everything including the floor.</span> <span id="s1054">She had prepared this room for me.</span> <span id="s1055">She took me into this room and no one was allowed in the room.</span> <span id="s1056">She cared for me herself.</span> <span id="s1057">No one could come into the room until her brother Jacob came.</span> <span id="s1058">She said to him, Jacob, I know this sounds ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1059">Everything has been done for my child and my child is given up for dead.</span> <span id="s1060">There are no more medical cures.</span> <span id="s1061">I know you’ll think it’s silly but there’s one last thing that we haven’t done.</span> <span id="s1062">We haven’t tried to fool the dybbuk, the dybbuk wants my child.</span> <span id="s1063">He says tell me, I’ll do anything.</span> <span id="s1064">My mother said, we must fool the dybbuk into thinking this is a different child.</span> <span id="s1065">He said well what, what should we do?</span> <span id="s1066">So she said to him, well I will sell you this child and you will give her a new name and she’ll be yours and then the dybbuk won’t want her anymore because it’s not the child that the dybbuk wants.</span> <span id="s1067">He said all right.</span> <span id="s1068">How much do you want for her?</span> <span id="s1069">She said well what is a child’s life worth?</span> <span id="s1070">Give me your hat.</span> <span id="s1071">He took off his hat.</span> <span id="s1072">She said okay take this hat, fill it with pennies, bring it back and I will give you my child.</span> <span id="s1073">So he went and he filled the hat with pennies and he came back and he bought me.</span> <span id="s1074">She said, Jacob, what is your child’s name?</span> <span id="s1075">He said her name is Chai Berliner.</span> <span id="s1076">Chai because it means life.</span> <span id="s1077">And I survived and I got well.</span> <span id="s1078">So I was very precious to Jacob.</span> <span id="s1079">All that bubba meinsa fits, you see.</span> <span id="s1080">It just was meant that Jacob would find me.</span> <span id="s1081">All right, so Jacob and I traveled.</span> <span id="s1082">We stayed in all kinds of places.</span> <span id="s1083">There was one time I remember, he woke me very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1084">We were in a room somewhere.</span> <span id="s1085">We had slept -- it was so cold.</span> <span id="s1086">I used to sleep on top of him, huddled on top of his chest, snuggled up.</span> <span id="s1087">I was tiny, teeny.</span> <span id="s1088">He woke me, he said quickly get up, we must get dressed.</span> <span id="s1089">But Wujaszek I called him Wujaszek, wujak in Polish is uncle, wujaszek is diminutive, a loving --.</span> <span id="s1090">But Wujaszek, but it’s still dark, it’s so cold, I can’t get dressed.</span> <span id="s1091">He said here you dress inside the bed, under the covers.</span> <span id="s1092">While you dress, I’ll get you the milk.</span> <span id="s1093">I have milk.</span> <span id="s1094">He reached for the milk which was sitting in a bottle on the corner but the bottle was full and it had -- the milk had frozen and the bottle had cracked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: But it was still frozen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yes, but it was still frozen.</span> <span id="s1097">That’s how cold our room was.</span> <span id="s1098">Anyway we dressed and he said come we must go to the market.</span> <span id="s1099">To the market, why are we going to the market?</span> <span id="s1100">It’s the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1101">He said, come, we must rush, we must run.</span> <span id="s1102">He explained nothing.</span> <span id="s1103">I dressed and we walked and walked and walked.</span> <span id="s1104">It was still dark and we got to the market in the first light of morning.</span> <span id="s1105">Instead of the usual stalls, the farmers selling their produce, there were just hundreds and hundreds of people in this cobblestone marketplace.</span> <span id="s1106">As the morning dawned, Jacob said I’m going to put you on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1107">I want you to watch and no matter how horrible the sight, I want you to keep your eyes open and watch.</span> <span id="s1108">I said, Wujaszek, what am I going to see?</span> <span id="s1109">Why are we here?</span> <span id="s1110">He said they’ve caught some German officers and they are going to hang them and I want you to watch.</span> <span id="s1111">Why?</span> <span id="s1112">He said because I don’t want you to have any hate.</span> <span id="s1113">The man you’re going to see hanged is the man who murdered your mother.</span> <span id="s1114">He sat me on his shoulders and I watched three men being hung.</span> <span id="s1115">He just didn’t want me to hate.</span> <span id="s1116">He wanted it all to -- he wanted me to be healthy -- to let it all out in this one traumatic, ugly, horrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: How did he know that this officer killed your mother?</span> <span id="s1118">Did he know where your mother had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Obviously he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1120">It was just, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Therapy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: It was just therapy.</span> <span id="s1123">It was his way.</span> <span id="s1124">There was no connection whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1125">He just didn’t want me to hate anyone.</span> <span id="s1126">I have to admit 50 years later that it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1127">I can’t hear German spoken without -- it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1128">He used to leave me alone in the room.</span> <span id="s1129">He would say, here’s food, here’s my watch.</span> <span id="s1130">I’m going to be gone for eight hours.</span> <span id="s1131">I’ll be back at seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s1132">I want you to sit here and listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s1133">Here’s paper and pencil.</span> <span id="s1134">Just listen.</span> <span id="s1135">If you hear -- don’t change the station -- it’s on just the station.</span> <span id="s1136">Listen carefully, if anything sounds familiar, write it down.</span> <span id="s1137">I would listen all day to coded messages, messages like Wujaszek is searching for the little girl who untied his shoelaces -- only usually shorter.</span> <span id="s1138">Or there would be lists of names.</span> <span id="s1139">The following are documented to have died in Treblinka and then an hour of names.</span> <span id="s1140">He would come home, what do you have?</span> <span id="s1141">While I was doing that, he was going to various agencies, searching and looking and authenticating and documenting deaths and looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s1142">There were none.</span> <span id="s1143">Finally one day he said that’s it.</span> <span id="s1144">We got into one of those boxcars of which there is a photograph that I gave you.</span> <span id="s1145">It’s only many years later in the United States that I realized what was written on the exterior of that boxcar.</span> <span id="s1146">It’s in English and in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1147">It says “To Liberty.”</span> <span id="s1148">And “From Auschwitz to New York.”</span> <span id="s1149">You know when I arrived in the United States I didn’t speak any English whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1150">I knew two words; they were okay and I reasoned that if okay meant yes then obviously nokay meant no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: The little schooling you had would have been…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: The little schooling I had was at the knee of the Ukrainian mother.</span> <span id="s1153">A little bit of schooling in the village but only until it got too cold for me to walk barefoot to the school because I had no shoes Then in the D.P. camp to which we went in that boxcar and the D.P. camp was in Munich.</span> <span id="s1154">We were in the D.P. camp for, I can’t tell you how long, maybe a year or more.</span> <span id="s1155">In the D.P. camp, Jacob had the job of being in charge of the social hall which meant he was the electrician, the plumber; he set up the chairs, he took them down, he was the stage manager and he was the emcee of all the various goings on.</span> <span id="s1156">Being handsome and charming and witty, he was the perfect emcee.</span> <span id="s1157">I went to school in the morning but school was mostly the learning of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1158">Because most of the people in the D.P. camp, all of them, were going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1159">It was kind of embarrassing or shameful to admit that we were going to America.</span> <span id="s1160">So I went to school and studied Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1161">When I came to the United States, I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1162">I could understand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little bit of German and somewhat more, I was able to understand but not speak fluently, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1163">If I’m not mistaken, that’s seven languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Had you known any Yiddish before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Well, my grandparents in their home spoke Yiddish and Polish so I heard it.</span> <span id="s1166">There was no Yiddish spoken between my parents.</span> <span id="s1167">Of course, I heard it after my experience in the Ukraine as we were displaced persons traveling from place to place.</span> <span id="s1168">I left out one part of the story and I will tell it to you as briefly as I can.</span> <span id="s1169">The one part of my story which I never really told and the reason I’m telling you now is that earlier today, I told it in front of my children.</span> <span id="s1170">It’s the first time my children ever heard it.</span> <span id="s1171">So now I feel at liberty to tell it to the world.</span> <span id="s1172">It’s not something of which I’m proud of but it’s a significant part of my life.</span> <span id="s1173">My father left us.</span> <span id="s1174">I can’t with all honesty say that he deserted us.</span> <span id="s1175">But it sure felt that way.</span> <span id="s1176">My father was a blue- eyed blond.</span> <span id="s1177">My father was a linguist, he was fluent in German and he could pass.</span> <span id="s1178">Whereas, he promised to send for us, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1179">It could easily have been impossible.</span> <span id="s1180">It’s not something I’ll ever know.</span> <span id="s1181">But I resented my father and when my mother became Berliner again, changing her name back to her maiden name, I simply went along with that.</span> <span id="s1182">I went along with my mother’s attitude about my father which wasn’t generous.</span> <span id="s1183">It wasn’t severe or bad either but their last months together were not affectionate.</span> <span id="s1184">So I felt that my father had betrayed and deserted me throughout the war and I never thought about him.</span> <span id="s1185">In the D.P. camp, while Jacob was working at the duties in the social hall which was an all day and evening job, I went to school in the morning where I studied Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1186">Then when school ended in the morning, I would have lunch with Jacob and then I was free in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1187">Now Jacob told me that we were going to go to America on a ship across a big ocean.</span> <span id="s1188">The ship would sway back and forth and there was a good possibility that I would be seasick.</span> <span id="s1189">I had never been seasick but he described it.</span> <span id="s1190">To avoid that, it would be a wonderful idea if I acclimated myself to the swaying motion by going to the playground and spending my time on the swings.</span> <span id="s1191">So I spent every afternoon on the swings.</span> <span id="s1192">Now the swings faced a cyclone fence.</span> <span id="s1193">On the opposite side of the fence, this was Munich, there was a bench, a bus stop and in the afternoon a bus would come.</span> <span id="s1194">Now I sat on the swings, swinging back and forth every day.</span> <span id="s1195">Every day about an hour before the bus came, or half an hour, an old woman would come and she would sit on the bench and she would take out of her bag, a little package of crumbs.</span> <span id="s1196">She would throw the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1197">She would turn around and she would nod to me.</span> <span id="s1198">This happened afternoon after afternoon so finally we began to chat.</span> <span id="s1199">Then one day she said to me, why are you spending so much time on the swings?</span> <span id="s1200">So I explained I’m going on a long voyage on a ship.</span> <span id="s1201">I’m going to America and I know that I’m going to get seasick and I explained the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1202">She said, you know, I have a brother in America.</span> <span id="s1203">Some day, I’m going to go to my brother when my quota number comes up.</span> <span id="s1204">I said well if you’re going to go on a ship, then you will be wise to get acclimated to the swaying also.</span> <span id="s1205">From then on, instead of feeding the birds and sitting on the bench, she would come inside and she would sit on the swings.</span> <span id="s1206">We would swing back and forth criss-crossing each other and chatting away.</span> <span id="s1207">One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk about our backgrounds.</span> <span id="s1208">.</span> <span id="s1209">She began to ask me questions.</span> <span id="s1210">What is your name, who are you, where are you from?</span> <span id="s1211">I told her about my life before the blitzkrieg in Warsaw, my father had been a violinist and a violin teacher.</span> <span id="s1212">She said tell me his name.</span> <span id="s1213">I told her his name.</span> <span id="s1214">The next day she returned and we sat on the swings and she said to me, tell me, do you have any marks on your body?</span> <span id="s1215">Anything that could identify you?</span> <span id="s1216">Anything that’s different from anything that anybody in the world has?</span> <span id="s1217">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1218">I have a beauty mark on my right forearm, shoulder.</span> <span id="s1219">When I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tease me by making believe he took the beauty mark off my right forearm until I began to cry.</span> <span id="s1220">Then he’d say, don’t cry, don’t cry, I’ll give it back.</span> <span id="s1221">Then he would give it back to me on my left forearm or shoulder and I would look and there it would be.</span> <span id="s1222">So she left and came back the next day and she said, that was a very interesting story about your grandfather but isn’t there anything else on your body, any scars, anything that’s different and unique?</span> <span id="s1223">I said well, I don’t like to talk about it but we have a family trait and I was born with it also.</span> <span id="s1224">We have six toes.</span> <span id="s1225">My uncle Jacob has six toes on one foot.</span> <span id="s1226">When I was born, I had six toes on each foot.</span> <span id="s1227">They were surgically removed and I have a scar on each foot.</span> <span id="s1228">The next day the woman came and brought my father.</span> <span id="s1229">I don’t know where he survived but I think in Germany.</span> <span id="s1230">Well my father insisted that I stay with him but we were going to sail two weeks hence.</span> <span id="s1231">Having waited for our quota number, having found the uncle in America.</span> <span id="s1232">I mean all of these -- years of waiting and uncle Jacob said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1233">They argued and uncle Jacob had the same resentment or appeared to have the same resentment towards my father that my mother had had.</span> <span id="s1234">I didn’t show him great warmth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did you recognize him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Oh, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1237">So they argued and finally uncle Jacob said to me, okay, it’s her choice.</span> <span id="s1238">Of course I insisted on going to America.</span> <span id="s1239">Well about a year later, my father followed me and he knew where we were.</span> <span id="s1240">By the time he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not begun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in assimilating into American life, just like the chameleon I learned to be in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1241">I did, once again, of necessity, in the United States.</span> <span id="s1242">.</span> <span id="s1243">I had arrived here on June 24.</span> <span id="s1244">By September, I was in school.</span> <span id="s1245">On my first day of school, I called the teacher outside and said to her something like I am greenhorn, do not call on me, I will not answer.</span> <span id="s1246">When I am ready, I will raise my hand.</span> <span id="s1247">Then you call me.</span> <span id="s1248">Shake?</span> <span id="s1249">We shook hands and she never called on m until I raised my hand only a very short time later.</span> <span id="s1250">I remember the amazement of the class and the round of applause.</span> <span id="s1251">I even remember the question and the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Garbo talks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Something like that.</span> <span id="s1254">Anyway, suddenly my father shows up and he wants to take me back -- he wants to make an immigrant of me again.</span> <span id="s1255">He doesn’t speak a word of English, I’m going to be living again with displaced persons who’ve just arrived somewhere in Brooklyn, where I have a life.</span> <span id="s1256">My name is Berliner.</span> <span id="s1257">I’m starting to have friends.</span> <span id="s1258">I speak English, I’ve grown, having gone from the smallest child in the class to the tallest, all in one semester.</span> <span id="s1259">I’m appearing in their amateur hour and winning a prize doing my krazotsky and singing Russian songs.</span> <span id="s1260">Suddenly he wants to take me -- he wants to turn the clock around, back to when I’m going to be da greena, look, the greena!</span> <span id="s1261">Which was pejorative.</span> <span id="s1262">Of course, 50 years of time have turned the greena a pejorative into the survivor.</span> <span id="s1263">This exalted, you know as if I did something phenomenal, I simply lived.</span> <span id="s1264">Just like that little dress, that schmata that I’ve had for 50 years today became an artifact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Just a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No, it was a schmata, trust me, a schmata.</span> <span id="s1267">Now they have it hermetically sealed or G__ knows what and it’ll be there for a thousand years or whatever, in a museum.</span> <span id="s1268">Oh my G__, it’s incredible what 50 years will do.</span> <span id="s1269">But there was my father and he wanted to undo the year of very hard adjustment.</span> <span id="s1270">So I said no.</span> <span id="s1271">He argued with my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s1272">I now was living with the rich uncle in America and his American wife and going to school in Forest Hills, Long Island, P.S.3.</span> <span id="s1273">My teacher was Mrs Riskin and the principal was Mrs. Morris.</span> <span id="s1274">My G__, how do you remember all that Miki?</span> <span id="s1275">Anyway I didn’t want to go back with my father.</span> <span id="s1276">My father persisted and now my birthday came and my father sent me a gift.</span> <span id="s1277">Actually a very beautiful gift.</span> <span id="s1278">A box of oil paints and brushes.</span> <span id="s1279">However he addressed it Mirka -- I still can’t say it, his last name -- in care of Berlinrer.</span> <span id="s1280">I was mortified because the mailman knew and the doorman might know.</span> <span id="s1281">The girl who lived on the floor below might find out.</span> <span id="s1282">Everyone might find out and oh my G___, it’s all going -- he’s going to turn it all around for me.</span> <span id="s1283">They’ll start to point at me again and I’ll be da greena again.</span> <span id="s1284">And there was huge arguments between my aunt and uncle and my father who persisted.</span> <span id="s1285">Then my uncle offered my father the -- he said he wanted to legally adopt me.</span> <span id="s1286">It didn’t mean that my father couldn’t have a relationship with me, we could have any relationship that we mutually wanted.</span> <span id="s1287">I could visit him, I could go on a travel with him or whatever.</span> <span id="s1288">But he wanted to legally adopt me to give me the benefits of his moderate wealth and American citizenship and so forth.</span> <span id="s1289">Of course my father refused.</span> <span id="s1290">The arguments went back and forth.</span> <span id="s1291">Then one day my father sent a letter which named a sum of money for which he would sign the adoption papers.</span> <span id="s1292">That caused my aunt and uncle to tell him to get lost.</span> <span id="s1293">Consequently, I was not adopted until I was 21.</span> <span id="s1294">Now I already told you the story of the chocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the monthly packages and the family who had a child under ten received the added chocolate bar.</span> <span id="s1295">So my uncle Jacob registered me as being a year younger.</span> <span id="s1296">Consequently, I was really, in fact, 22 when I became free to sign the papers myself and I became a citizen in that year.</span> <span id="s1297">I was also engaged to my husband who gave me an engagement ring on the very anniversary of my arrival in the United States which was June 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: That was the anniversary______?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Exactly, well yes, this is June 12.</span> <span id="s1300">It’s really strange that so many events and things have happened to me in June.</span> <span id="s1301">Today was a wonderful day and a very beautiful weekend at which I have my family with me.</span> <span id="s1302">My husband, my daughter Mural, my daughter-in-law,Gina and my son Andy.</span> <span id="s1303">We are staying in a beautiful suite, in a lovely hotel in Washington and the sun is shining.</span> <span id="s1304">And I’ve survived the ordeal of this tape and life is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Let’s hope it remains so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1308">This is still June 12, 1992 and we’re about to add a postscript to our interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yes, a tiny anecdote which might help to clarify the date.</span> <span id="s1310">My uncle and I and his two suitcases were somewhere.</span> <span id="s1311">It was in the middle of winter and we were in a tiny railroad station.</span> <span id="s1312">It wasn’t a big city railroad station.</span> <span id="s1313">There weren’t platforms, you know train platforms.</span> <span id="s1314">It was a track and there was a little tiny building and inside the building it was just one room smaller, or perhaps the size of this room which is 12 by 20 or 15 or something like that.</span> <span id="s1315">In the corner, there was a potbelly stove and there was a desk and on the desk was one of those tick-tick machines, what is that?</span> <span id="s1316">A telegraph, right.</span> <span id="s1317">Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s1318">There was a guy who sat huddled up next to the pot-bellied stove with this telegraph machine.</span> <span id="s1319">In the back of the room, sitting on the floor, when we came in from a blizzard, walked into this building… I don’t know where we came from, I don’t remember how we got there.</span> <span id="s1320">I know it was a blizzard…</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: This was shortly after you had been taken…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: After he found me, okay, and we were going somewhere.</span> <span id="s1323">We were going to wait for a train.</span> <span id="s1324">The train is going somewhere and we’re going to wait for a train.</span> <span id="s1325">It’s night, it’s a blizzard.</span> <span id="s1326">It’s night, it’s cold, it’s freezing.</span> <span id="s1327">We walk from whatever conveyance brought us to this station.</span> <span id="s1328">I remember seeing the little building with the light inside and so forth.</span> <span id="s1329">Anyway we walk in, a blizzard of snow flies in with us.</span> <span id="s1330">There’s this guy sitting at the desk and there are maybe half a dozen people who look like ruffians, men, very rough looking characters sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s1331">Some are smoking, and they are sort of lounging on the floor on bundles, obviously waiting for the train.</span> <span id="s1332">We walk in and Jacob is very well dressed and he has these two important looking suitcases and this little child all bundled up.</span> <span id="s1333">We walk in and there was one other item which I forgot, extremely important.</span> <span id="s1334">The guy at the desk has this telegraph machine and a small radio with a great deal of static and he’s listening to this radio.</span> <span id="s1335">We come in and we sit separate from these rough looking men.</span> <span id="s1336">Jacob goes and talks to the man and explains to him that we want to get on the train.</span> <span id="s1337">The man argues with Jacob and says no, no, you can’t get on the train.</span> <span id="s1338">They argue back and forth.</span> <span id="s1339">Jacob offers him goods, whatever, he’ll pay.</span> <span id="s1340">The man says no, no.</span> <span id="s1341">Jacob says what about these men?</span> <span id="s1342">No, they’re going to sit on top of the cars on the roof of the cars and you have a child and those boxes and you can’t… Jacob pleads with him and suddenly the radio starts crackling and the man says, quiet, quiet, listen.</span> <span id="s1343">They all listen and suddenly the men jump up and run to the radio and they crowd around and I have no idea what is going on.</span> <span id="s1344">The static and the men are all excited and suddenly they all begin to cheer, Warsaw is liberated!</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: That would have been January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: G___ bless you, thank you so much.</span> <span id="s1347">Isn’t it wonderful, it’s so great.</span> <span id="s1348">You see, I really belong in history!</span> <span id="s1349">Anyway, Jacob opened one of his suitcases and he took out the most treasured of all the possessions, a bottle of vodka!</span> <span id="s1350">We passed it around, everybody drank from it, these ruffians…</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No.</span> <span id="s1353">The ruffians became our best friends.</span> <span id="s1354">Suddenly in the middle of this revelry, we heard the train, toot, toot.</span> <span id="s1355">The train came and we all rushed outside and the man behind the desk said to Jacob, listen these men are going on the roof.</span> <span id="s1356">But if you will do it, you can stand in front of the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1357">There’s a little guardrail.</span> <span id="s1358">You’ll stand, hold on to the guardrail.</span> <span id="s1359">Your little girl will stand in front of you.</span> <span id="s1360">Put your coat around her.</span> <span id="s1361">Remember, we’ll tie the suitcases on front of the locomotive and remember you’re going to be heading directly into the storm.</span> <span id="s1362">I don’t guarantee that you won’t freeze to death but if you want this train, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1363">We got on the front of the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1364">Jacob -- I stood in front of him against the guardrail.</span> <span id="s1365">Jacob’s coat was wrapped around me.</span> <span id="s1366">I leaned against him.</span> <span id="s1367">The train took off into this blinding snowstorm and I don’t know where we went but we were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: You know this scene reminds me of you and your mother and David on the truck, not knowing where you were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: It’s the same, it’s the same.</span> <span id="s1370">But you see, I fit into this context of time, that’s so exciting!</span> <span id="s1371">I am so excited.</span> <span id="s1372">I can’t tell you, it’s so important.</span> <span id="s1373">January 1945.</span> <span id="s1374">Fantastic!</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: How long had you been in this village?</span>
