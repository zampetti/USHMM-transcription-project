id="s2">GS: To begin with, would you please tell us where you were born, what year, and a little about your family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">SM: I was born January the 6th, 1922 to a typical Jewish family in a small town in Poland.</span> <span id="s4">The name of the city is Przasnysz, near the Prussian border.</span> <span id="s5">As all Jewish children age four, I went to cheder, learned all kind of Jewish studies, then went to a Jewish public school.</span> <span id="s6">And after that to a Jewish high school, which was in an adjacent city, Mlawa.</span> <span id="s7">The reason was that my father wanted me to know Hebrew and further Jewish education and culture.</span> <span id="s8">I was a high school student when the war started, and since we were only twenty miles from the border, the German army occupied our city the next day.</span> <span id="s9">But, a day before that, most of the Jews left the city.</span> <span id="s10">Our family went to a neighboring city, Ciechanów, where we had relatives.</span> <span id="s11">My brother and myself, we went further, toward Warsaw.</span> <span id="s12">Unfortunately, the German army preceded us.</span> <span id="s13">It went faster than we could walk, and after a week we returned to our home in Przasnysz.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">GS: Excuse me, are you speaking of the entire family, your eight brothers and sisters, the parents, all returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">SM: Yes, all.</span> <span id="s16">Only one sister was already in Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s17">And one sister stayed in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s18">She was in Warsaw and she was, since Warsaw was at that time encircled, she couldn't come home.</span> <span id="s19">Several weeks after the war started, which probably made it toward the end of September, the German commander of the city ordered all Jews to come to the market.</span> <span id="s20">He put us on trucks and he did not want to have any Jews left in that place.</span> <span id="s21">He took us across the river Narew, where supposedly, they was suppo-, where supposedly the border, the new border between Russia and Germany was supposed to be drawn.</span> <span id="s22">Later, we were there a couple days, but later we had to leave on foot.</span> <span id="s23">We were told to go toward the Russian border.</span> <span id="s24">The atmosphere after we passed toward the part of Poland occupied by Russia was day and night.</span> <span id="s25">In the Russian part we could, there were movies, we could, there was light, while in the other part, in the former part, was darkness.</span> <span id="s26">We didn't have any electricity, and we were afraid to go out in the streets.</span> <span id="s27">The whole family, except those which were moved, our family moved to Bialystok, but there was no place to live, because there were too many refugees there.</span> <span id="s28">People, families, were occupying a corner of a room, in one room we were sleeping four, five, six families.</span> <span id="s29">The Russians offered us to go to, into deep Russia, and find work there.</span> <span id="s30">We waited, because a sister of mine was still in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s31">One day, every day I was going to the train, waiting, hoping, that maybe she will return, she will come, she will find out that where we are.</span> <span id="s32">And indeed this happened one day, because when Warsaw was taken, she came to look for us, and she heard what happened.</span> <span id="s33">She organized a group of people in another city where my relatives were, and she came with them to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s34">And I was standing at the train when she came out, stepped out from the train.</span> <span id="s35">I, of course I was already planning and trying to find other people who will go with me, ‘cause I did not want to go by myself, and try to bring them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">GS: During this time, it was not, was it possible for any students like yourself to attend classes?</span> <span id="s37">Was there any school that you could go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SM: Yes, the Russians organized schools, and I went to a Jewish school, interesting, the, but it was for me a little bit, how to, strange, because the language, the teaching language was Yiddish, while I was accustomed to having it in Polish and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s39">But nevertheless, I attended, the few months which I was in Bialystok, I attended school.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">GS: Was it possible to attend synagogue in Bialystok at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">SM: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s42">But it was difficult to pray, because most of the, a lot of people were sleeping in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s43">There was not enough place.</span> <span id="s44">All synagogues were occupied by refugees.</span> <span id="s45">After, about two months after my sister arrived, we all registered to go deep Russia, where, wherever it is, it will be.</span> <span id="s46">We didn't know where they will send us, but to have, in order to have a place to, to live, to stay.</span> <span id="s47">We were sent to the Ural mountains, on the border of Europe and Siberia.</span> <span id="s48">And everybody about age 16 was supposed to work.</span> <span id="s49">We were earning the wages of what, like what the same thing what the Russian people did earn.</span> <span id="s50">They were trying to build apartment houses for miners who were develop-, who were buil-, and other people develop-, who were trying to develop the wilderness of the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s51">Conditions were a little bit harsh, because we were supposed to work on construction ‘til minus forty degrees.</span> <span id="s52">At minus forty-one we could go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">GS: What kind of clothing did you have?</span> <span id="s54">Did you have warm enough clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">SM: We did not have, but the Russian people often helped us.</span> <span id="s56">They often gave us special warm clothes what they, what they had, and what we, wherever we could, we bought warmer clothing.</span> <span id="s57">You cannot wear shoes there winter.</span> <span id="s58">You have to have special, not made of leather, but boots made of felt.</span> <span id="s59">Otherwise one freezes, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">GS: Did all of your family members have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">SM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">GS: Your brothers and sisters, and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">SM: Yes, except my younger two brothers.</span> <span id="s64">They were, they went to school.</span> <span id="s65">I have learned to speak Russian after about couple months, and through the fact there was a young gentleman who was told from Warsaw, who was told by his father that he once had a brother in Minsk, and he had an old address there, where he used to write ‘til 1920, '25.</span> <span id="s66">And after that he received no letters.</span> <span id="s67">So, he came to me and asked me to write for him a letter on the old address of his uncle.</span> <span id="s68">And to his great surprise, he received answer from a cousin who told him that he received the letter and asked him to come to Minsk.</span> <span id="s69">We were hired to work in the Ural mountains for one year.</span> <span id="s70">And indeed when the year was over, we were free to go wherever we wanted.</span> <span id="s71">And this young man went back to Minsk.</span> <span id="s72">We did not know where to move.</span> <span id="s73">We wanted to leave the Ural mountains, our family, because of the very harsh conditions.</span> <span id="s74">My sister and brother-in-law—my sister in the meantime married, met a young gentleman from Warsaw, they married—and they tried to go back to the eastern part of Poland since he had friends in, not far from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s75">And he thought that there the conditions, at least climatic conditions, were much more reasonable.</span> <span id="s76">Unfortunately, he was stopped at the border, at the former Polish-Russian border by the N.K.V.D. [Russian secret police], and told them they cannot go there.</span> <span id="s77">So he remembered the friend for whom I used to write letters in Minsk, and they went to Minsk.</span> <span id="s78">They found this man, and his cousin arranged for them an apartment and a job.</span> <span id="s79">Maybe for people who don't know, it would be, it should be explained that life in the, in Russia at that time, in the Soviet Union, in a large city like Minsk, Moscow, was different from the place where we were in the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s80">In Minsk you can go in, and buy eggs in a store.</span> <span id="s81">You can go into a store and buy sugar.</span> <span id="s82">In the Ural mountains, sugars were seen by the people three times a year, on the first of May, on the October Revolution, on the anniversary, and on New Year.</span> <span id="s83">But in Minsk you could go in and buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">GS: Can you tell us a little about the living conditions other than this terribly cold climate?</span> <span id="s85">What kind of housing did you live in?</span> <span id="s86">What was the food situation other than this sugar shortage?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SM: Each family had a room, so the whole family slept in one room.</span> <span id="s88">The, and this is what I said, we were building houses so they wanted to develop it, and but obviously, initially, the nice apartments were given to the members of the party and engineers and so on.</span> <span id="s89">And we were living in the older section.</span> <span id="s90">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s91">GS: Were there many Jewish families there?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">SM: We came there about fifty Jewish families.</span> <span id="s93">Previously there were no Russian Jewish families.</span> <span id="s94">But we met there a couple Russian Jewish engineers.</span> <span id="s95">They were very nice, tried to help us as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">GS: What was the attitude of the non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">SM: Oh very nice.</span> <span id="s98">They tried to help us in as much as they could.</span> <span id="s99">We were called there "the westerners" and they told us the suits which we had on, what we'll never see such a suit in Russia, that we should wear to work different clothes and they tried to help us as much as they could.</span> <span id="s100">As a whole, I was left with very good, fine memories of the people.</span> <span id="s101">Some of them were sent there because they said something against Stalin or they were previously land owners and were sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">GS: So these people were being exiled from their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">SM: So some of them were exiled, some had to live there—they were free to move, but if they wanted to go, they had to go to the N.K.V.D. and receive permission to, to, so it was as a whole, a place where people were sent away.</span> <span id="s104">But there were also a lot of volunteers who came to, found work there, and lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">GS: But generally you found that they were hospitable...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SM: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">GS: The Soviets were helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">SM: Very, very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s109">Very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">GS: Were you asked to register for Soviet citizenship?</span> <span id="s111">Was that offered to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">SM: We received, we were not asked, we were told everybody is supposed to have a passport, and we had Russian passports.</span> <span id="s113">Like any Russian, there is nationality written, nationality, we had written Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">GS: So you weren't given a choice as to whether you wanted to remain a Polish citizen?</span> <span id="s115">You were just given the passport and made a Soviet citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SM: Passport, and that is that.</span> <span id="s117">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">GS: Did you ever think about going back, as your, was it your sister and brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SM: They did, but they tried to go, it was still Poland.</span> <span id="s120">It was still the Soviet Union but a part of Poland...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">GS: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SM: Which they went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">GS: Right.</span> <span id="s124">So they were not leaving the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">SM: No, because if to leave it would have been to leave to Russia, to Germany, and, there was no comparison, because here it was cold, but you still could go to a, to a movie, and you, and there the libraries were open, and you could go read and, or travel.</span> <span id="s126">I even went back, because my mother became sick, and we, and she stayed in a hospital in Bialystok, and then when she was all right, I went back and brought her to, no, to the Ural mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">GS: You had this freedom of motion.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">SM: Oh yes, we could, yes, we could, we were not, we signed an agreement that we will work for this company one year.</span> <span id="s129">And for this they paid our transportation.</span> <span id="s130">And we were supposed to work, although we did not understand what we signed, but with everybody signed, because everybody wanted to look for a place where to, to live.</span> <span id="s131">So after the year was over, my sister and brother-in-law settled in Minsk.</span> <span id="s132">And since we did not have enough money for everybody to go, so I was the next one who left to Minsk, because they described conditions were like day and night, the difference between Minsk and the Ural mountains where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">GS: During that year, that first year in the Soviet Union, did you have contact with any Jews in other cities, other parts of the Soviet Union, or in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">SM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">GS: No, you had no contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">SM: No.</span> <span id="s137">The only contacts in other cities, other came in Minsk via this friend who worked and because I was his translator, or, I did write the letters for him and this is how they called me actually... and his cousin married a young, a Jewish officer in the army, who was able to arrange for these things.</span> <span id="s138">In Russia you have to know the right people in order to be able to, to arrange certain things.</span> <span id="s139">And a lot of people want to live in large cities, but you cannot live in the large city unless you have a job.</span> <span id="s140">And you cannot get a job unless you have, you live in the city.</span> <span id="s141">So for, if somebody who wants from another place to come to a Minsk-like, a city like Minsk, Kiev, or Moscow, or Leningrad, it's impossible.</span> <span id="s142">Practically impossible, unless you know the right person who can arrange.</span> <span id="s143">This cousin of, for whom, of this guy for whom I, to whom I wrote the letters, he was such a guy who knew to arrange.</span> <span id="s144">He arranged for his cousin to stay, after that for my sister and brother-in-law, and when I came, he arranged also for me to get a job so that I can stay.</span> <span id="s145">But what I did not know is that the next war approaches.</span> <span id="s146">I managed to come three weeks before the Germans attacked Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">GS: So now two years have passed, now 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">SM: Was a year-and-a-half, no, a half, like, because I did not move immediately.</span> <span id="s149">It took time...</span></p> <p><span id="s150">GS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">SM: Because at first this guy from Warsaw moved and then my sister, and it took time ’til they became organized, and then they said, "Hey, the next one can come."</span> <span id="s152">And so slowly we wanted the whole family to move out from the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s153">When the war started, we tried initially to walk toward, toward, toward Moscow, but it happened again after two or three days on the way that the German army was, we found the German army in front of us.</span> <span id="s154">And we didn't have any other choice but to return, because we thought at least in Minsk is a large city, maybe we'll be able something to, somehow to survive.</span> <span id="s155">The, about a month after the Russians... the Germans occupied Minsk, the ghetto was organized, and we moved in into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s156">At that time my sister had also a little girl, so we were four people in one room.</span> <span id="s157">We, initially, we could go out to work.</span> <span id="s158">We were getting food.</span> <span id="s159">We were getting very little, but somehow we tried always to organize.</span> <span id="s160">My brother-in-law and myself, we used to leave the ghetto and go, go out, into the Russian sector, into villages, bring food into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">GS: How did you get past the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">SM: This was relatively easy to do, because it was not like a ghetto, Minsk, in Warsaw where they made walls, built walls around it.</span> <span id="s163">This was still made of, with wire, so we always carried pliers to cut the wires and then wherever we went, we left, we twisted them back, and it was not so difficult to leave.</span> <span id="s164">The question was, when you leave, what do you do then?</span> <span id="s165">After a short time, the so-called, we called it simply pogroms, started.</span> <span id="s166">The Ukrainians and S.S. were coming, occupying a certain section of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s167">There were about 120,000 Jews initially.</span> <span id="s168">And they, they cleaned out 5,000, 6,000, took them out, and killed them.</span> <span id="s169">We, after that even knew where they were taking them to shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">GS: Were there particular people they were taking?</span> <span id="s171">In other words were there people who were involved with, was there a Judenrat?</span> <span id="s172">A council?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">SM: There was a Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">GS: And were the members of the council taken?</span> <span id="s175">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">SM: No, initially the members of the Judenrat...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">GS: Just indiscriminate?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">SM: Indiscriminate, they just took a certain section.</span> <span id="s179">And we had been, had we been in this, we would have disappeared, like the others.</span> <span id="s180">When this happened, we started to build places to hide.</span> <span id="s181">Also they were catching people to take to work, and we wanted, while we wanted to work, because by going out to work we could always organize something to bring food, to bring something into the ghetto, we wanted to choose where to work and not be taken to work.</span> <span id="s182">So we built in our, in the room where we, where we lived, we built a double wall where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s183">Whenever some of our neighbors used to wonder, how come that we used, everybody was trying to hide somewhere, and we were running fast into the house?</span> <span id="s184">And then they saw Germans or Ukrainians going in, and not taking us.</span> <span id="s185">They, they came in, looked, but they apparently did not know, we did not tell too many people except later we told our neighbors, that we had a double wall where we could hide.</span> <span id="s186">When the Germans started to take women and children also in, for, for the so-called, these Aktionen they called, but it was, we called them, pogroms, then we built something different for my sister and her little girl, because little child was, it was dark between the two walls, and she was crying.</span> <span id="s187">So we built something under the ground on the first floor, a deep opening.</span> <span id="s188">I used to let them in, them means my sister, brother-in-law, with their child, and then I used to go back and hide in the double wall.</span> <span id="s189">We survived like this for about a year, but we saw that we cannot, it will not, we cannot, the ghetto became smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s190">They brought in Jews from Hamburg, from Germany, and slowly killing them too.</span> <span id="s191">We decided we have to escape, go away.</span> <span id="s192">We tried to look for contact with people who were fighting the Germans, and finally we did reach.</span> <span id="s193">We were hiding in our place somebody whom the German were searching for.</span> <span id="s194">And in this way we wanted to go out into the forest and join the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">GS: This is now about one year later after...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">SM: About a year later, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">GS: The Nazis took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">SM: It was about a year-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s199">We, but the problem was we could not leave a little child.</span> <span id="s200">We couldn't go with a little child into the forest, into a forest where we did not know where we will be.</span> <span id="s201">But, in a place where my brother-in-law and sister worked was a decent German soldier, who tried as much as possible to help us.</span> <span id="s202">We asked him if he can find a place for the child, in a, in a orphanage home.</span> <span id="s203">And he arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">GS: How old was this child?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">SM: Two years.</span> <span id="s206">We taught her a Russian name and this soldier took her and after that for some time he was taking my sister out to see, to see her, but not close so that they will not, that she will not see her, see them.</span> <span id="s207">Actually, we did it because there was one pogrom four days long where all not working women and children were killed.</span> <span id="s208">My sister did hide into, in the place where we had made, so she survived it, and after that, this child was the only child in ghetto.</span> <span id="s209">And we, so this was the reason we decided either we'll all die, or we have to do something, arrange some place for the child to be.</span> <span id="s210">About a month after the child was, was accepted by, in this orphanage, we left.</span> <span id="s211">I joined a partisan group which was about twenty people.</span> <span id="s212">My sister and brother-in-law were in another, in another group.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">GS: Excuse me, were these Jewish, or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">SM: Mostly non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s215">There were some Jews, but,...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">GS: And they accepted you?</span> <span id="s217">What was the attitude of the people in these partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">SM: Oh these groups were, accepted us without,...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">GS: Fully.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">SM: Fully, obviously, there were cases of antisemitism, there is no doubt about it, but there were many Jews in the, in the partisans.</span> <span id="s221">As a matter of fact, in the group where, which I came to, there were initially twenty people.</span> <span id="s222">Actually I left this group and went to another one which was larger.</span> <span id="s223">And there were a number of Jews.</span> <span id="s224">The person who organized all the, or maybe, let me talk what did we do?</span> <span id="s225">What was our objective?</span> <span id="s226">Most of it was not to fight the German army, but German communication.</span> <span id="s227">We were blowing up bridges, blowing up trains.</span> <span id="s228">This was the main thing.</span> <span id="s229">And the guy who organized all this blowing was a Jewish lieutenant.</span> <span id="s230">Unfortunately he did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">GS: When you say lieutenant, had he been in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">SM: He was in a, he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s233">GS: So he...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">SM: A Russian...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">GS: Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">SM: He was a Russian in the Russian army, and,...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">GS: But he worked with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">SM: But he was the, instead of during the, during, at certain fight he was wounded, left, he did not want to, was surrounded, he did not want to go into captivity.</span> <span id="s239">He escaped and then joined.</span> <span id="s240">Most of the partisans were former soldiers.</span> <span id="s241">Some of them were leaders of the Communist local government who were afraid that they will be killed by the, taken, and slowly also local people started to join.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">GS: Were you the only Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">SM: No, after that there were two more, two more.</span> <span id="s244">In other way, local people.</span> <span id="s245">There were several people who were hidden in the forest, and they, they were doing, one was a shoemaker, and we were going to him and after that he joined to, to, to give him some work, and after that we told him, "C'mon, join us."</span> <span id="s246">So he became also a partisan.</span> <span id="s247">He was a local guy from a nearby village who escaped with a family and lived.</span> <span id="s248">He built himself a hut in the forest, and since it was a big forest, the Germans were scared to go in there.</span> <span id="s249">And there were about 10,000 partisans in this forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">GS: Can you describe what your daily life was like?</span> <span id="s251">What were your living conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SM: Oh, we moved from place to place initially.</span> <span id="s253">After that when the movement, the partisan movement grew, we have like permanent, built permanent huts in the forest, with about...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">GS: Were there families with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">SM: Later, in our place were not...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">GS: Just men.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">SM: No families.</span> <span id="s258">But, there were, there was a group of about 400 Jewish family people who were not far away, who escaped, and they were allowed, they lived under, so to say, the umbrella of the other partisans.</span> <span id="s259">The, usually in the morning we're getting up like, either standing guard and so on, and each time from time to time we had to go to do something, to go blow up a train.</span> <span id="s260">Usually it was done by about ten people.</span> <span id="s261">Most of the bombs were homemade, devised by this Jewish lieutenant.</span> <span id="s262">We didn't have enough ammunition.</span> <span id="s263">We didn't have enough explosives.</span> <span id="s264">It was later that Russian planes started to arrive, land in our forest, bring ammunition and take the wounded back.</span> <span id="s265">But initially everything was homemade.</span> <span id="s266">Our initial bombs were simply large shells left from the Russian army when they were escaping when the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s267">We used to drill holes, put there the, I don't know how it is called in English, from a hand grenade, the, the one which starts the explosion, put it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">GS: Material, or the...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">SM: Not the material.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">GS: Was it the pin?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">SM: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">GS: The pin that gets pulled?</span> <span id="s273">The activator?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">SM: We used to open the pin, the part which has the, with the pin, we used to put it in into the, into the fifty...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">GS: Shell.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">SM: Pound shell or, we used, around the pin put a long string, and hide behind a tree.</span> <span id="s277">When the train, put this under the rail, the railroad.</span> <span id="s278">When a train came, we pulled with the string.</span> <span id="s279">We didn't have electric, like I see here in the movie.</span> <span id="s280">We pulled the string, and the pin was, was out and it blew up.</span> <span id="s281">We always chose a place where there is a certain, where it is high so that the explosion was always blowing off the whole train down the, down a slope.</span> <span id="s282">Initially we didn't need much explosive to put in, because the trains were going fast.</span> <span id="s283">After that, the trains were going very slowly, or they saw, they thought in beginning that these are automatic, so they put two, three wagons of sand in front, the Germans.</span> <span id="s284">But we didn't care whether because we did it manually.</span> <span id="s285">Usually we tried to blow whether we saw fuel or people.</span> <span id="s286">When the train started to go slowly, we had to make larger size bombs to put under the, under the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">GS: Was most of the planning, the strategy done by this Russian army lieutenant, or did you make decisions on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">SM: No, this was, usually we said, you, this, there was a commander, and he was choosing for each time another, we were divided in groups of twenty people and from these twenty people each time another group had to go and blow up, try to blow up a train, train.</span> <span id="s289">The terrain where to do it was always, we had local guys.</span> <span id="s290">They knew the place, and they knew the best, because not only was it important to blow up, it was also important to escape after that, not to, and not to lose people.</span> <span id="s291">Because the objective was not, the most important for us was do something damage and run away alive, so that we can do, continue to work.</span> <span id="s292">Later when we started to get contact with the Russian army, when we were started, and planes started to come and bring us TNT, it was easier and the objective changed.</span> <span id="s293">Instead of blowing up trains, we started to blow up the railroad itself.</span> <span id="s294">So we used to call it a concert.</span> <span id="s295">We go to arrange a con-, for a concert, because we stopped going a small group, eight, ten people, but 200 people who went out to the railroad and the German, the Germans used to have every five miles they used to have posts.</span> <span id="s296">But there used to be three, four, five people.</span> <span id="s297">When they saw a bunch of 200 people running toward them, they used to escape.</span> <span id="s298">And we used to divide into groups and I was usually the one who was putting the mines.</span> <span id="s299">This was my job.</span> <span id="s300">Blowing up certain things was my job always to do in our group.</span> <span id="s301">So we used to then put in only 200 grams TNT under each trai... railroad.</span> <span id="s302">And while we were walking behind us were going people with matches and lighting it, setting it off.</span> <span id="s303">So it started to blow while we were still planting mines a little bit further up, and this is why we called it we go for a concert.</span> <span id="s304">And usually such a thing was happening, we knew, when we went for a concert we knew that the next day the Russians will start an offensive.</span> <span id="s305">And they wanted us to destroy the railroad so that no supply will come to the front.</span> <span id="s306">As a matter of fact, we were all starting to move backwards into Poland each time when they came to Minsk, we were moved back toward Bialystok, to keep on doing this, blowing up the railroads.</span> <span id="s307">And soon they were running out of railroads, the trains, because if we blew up a train, one, they pushed this off and a half an hour later other trains could pass.</span> <span id="s308">But if we blew up for two, three, five miles, all the, all four lines of the track, they didn't have enough rails to fix it.</span> <span id="s309">Very often for a week or two weeks they was, they could not use the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">GS: You mentioned that a guard, a German guard seeing a large number, 200 people coming, would run away.</span> <span id="s311">Were there ever large groups of soldiers sent knowing that, once you started to do this, did you ever encounter any large groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">SM: Oh yes, there were many.</span> <span id="s313">We were several times encircled by the German and Ukrainian armies, 50,000, 100,000 soldiers used to be taken from the front and circled our, our place and they tried to, to destroy it.</span> <span id="s314">They even wrote, in one letter wrote the whole partisan movement destroyed and even the name of our commander was that he was dead.</span> <span id="s315">I remember I showed it to my commander and said, "Oh Sam, go if so.</span> <span id="s316">Next week go show that we are alive."</span> <span id="s317">And they sent us to blow up a train.</span> <span id="s318">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s319">GS: Ahhh...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">SM: So, something like this...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">GS: Do you remember the last name of that commander?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">SM: Commander?</span> <span id="s323">Yeah, Zeitzer.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">GS: Zeitzer.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">SM: He was a Russian, but there were many Jewish, Jews not far away.</span> <span id="s326">Actually more south in Polesha was a, I heard only stories about him, that,...</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s328">GS: This is side two of the tape with Samuel Makower speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">SM: This gentleman was a legendary figure in the partisan movement.</span> <span id="s330">He was called Dyadya Vanya.</span> <span id="s331">And he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s332">Today I remember, I used to know after that his name, his, but today I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">GS: This is the Uncle Vanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">SM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">Then there was a group of, a Jewish partisan group.</span> <span id="s336">Several hundred Jews from, they were from, mostly Vilna, Minsk, Bialystok, from this area.</span> <span id="s337">And they were also in one of the, in one of the forests of White Russia.</span> <span id="s338">I today forgot the name of their otryad [detachment], is in Russian the name of the group, of the partisan group.</span> <span id="s339">Occasionally, on trips and on walking I used to meet Jewish people, and from time to time I used to get regards from my sister and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s340">My brother-in-law was wounded, and he was, and he and his sister were taken out by plane to, into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">GS: You said your sister and brother-in-law joined another partisan group, and both of them were working with this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">SM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">GS: That was a group, I would assume, that had both men and women, but the group you were in was all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">SM: No, there were women, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">GS: There were women also.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">SM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s347">Not many remember, but there were women.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">GS: Right.</span> <span id="s349">But, for the most part, single people, or some married, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">SM: Some married, but mostly single people.</span> <span id="s351">Initially I was the youngest in my group, but after that a younger, a younger kid [laughs] came and,...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">GS: When you joined the part-, this is the first partisan group, how old were you?</span> <span id="s353">In '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">SM: Actually I was already, it was '42, so I was twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">GS: Twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">SM: But all, most of the people who were, were soldiers already.</span> <span id="s357">They had been to the, to the army, so they were all older than I, than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">GS: Older, right.</span> <span id="s359">And then how long did you remain with that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">SM: ‘Til 1944.</span> <span id="s361">In 1944 it was a funny way how I met the Russian, the Russian, army.</span> <span id="s362">We were told that, we saw, we read, I listened to the radio and sometimes also to foreign radios.</span> <span id="s363">And we knew that the Russian occupied Minsk and they were going toward the forest or toward Bialystok.</span> <span id="s364">And the question was, will we be able to survive, because we could not fight the German army when they retreated.</span> <span id="s365">However, they somehow avoided the forest, mostly they were small groups.</span> <span id="s366">The small groups we were fighting.</span> <span id="s367">And in one such case, we took about fifty or sixty German soldiers prisoner.</span> <span id="s368">Initially, with prisoners we... we had to move from place to place.</span> <span id="s369">We couldn't keep prisoners.</span> <span id="s370">But this was already towards the end, and we were taking prisoners toward our camp.</span> <span id="s371">We had to pass a big road.</span> <span id="s372">And I gave them order to lie down, and I told them if they'll, when we had to, when we had to pass the big road, we wented first out to see quiet.</span> <span id="s373">And suddenly we heard the noise of tanks.</span> <span id="s374">We were sure these were German tanks.</span> <span id="s375">And I told the German soldiers if they'll move and yell, they'll be the first to get the bullets.</span> <span id="s376">So they were all quiet.</span> <span id="s377">And when we saw the tanks, were not Germans tanks, they were Russian tanks.</span> <span id="s378">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">GS: I have one question.</span> <span id="s380">My question is, where did you get the ammunition, your weapons, and also where did you get your food?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">SM: Ammunition, initially we had from local people.</span> <span id="s382">When the German-, when the Russian army retreated, they left huge amounts of ammunition in the forests.</span> <span id="s383">And for some reason, the people didn't hide it.</span> <span id="s384">We used to get from the people machine guns, even all kinds of ammunition, from machine guns to even, no, pushki in Russian, cannons.</span> <span id="s385">For some reason they were hiding them.</span> <span id="s386">Whether they were thinking that maybe these will be for Poles, against, because this was in Poland, in a Polish part, or they wanted to have it as some kind of a bargain, we don't know.</span> <span id="s387">But we were getting it from them.</span> <span id="s388">Sometimes we had to force, to take it by force.</span> <span id="s389">When somebody told us that this and this guy has hidden a machine gun, we used to go away and tell him, "Listen, if you'll not give it to us, it means you are for the Germans.</span> <span id="s390">Means we should kill you."</span> <span id="s391">And obviously we did not kill anybody of them, but sometimes...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">GS: You persuaded them.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">SM: Persuaded, so such, [chuckling] this helped to get the ammunition.</span> <span id="s394">Later...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">GS: And your food supply, how did you get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">SM: Food supplies we were taking, getting from the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">GS: They gave willingly?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">SM: Occasionally we told people, "You have to give," so-and-so and so on.</span> <span id="s399">Later toward the war, we had in each village, there was a partisan who was in charge.</span> <span id="s400">And when, and he used to say, "Oh, you two people go to this room to eat, and this, to this family and this family."</span> <span id="s401">And the people, the local people where we lived, often, accepted us and I used to have already a house where always the lady always found something warm for me when I was hungry to eat.</span> <span id="s402">So, and we were going, there were always families of policemen from which we took away everything.</span> <span id="s403">So, if we saw some kind, cows of, which belong to the Germans, we used to take it from them.</span> <span id="s404">And also from time to time we took it from the people we know, if, we left each family, each farmer had at least one cow.</span> <span id="s405">But if somebody had more than one...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">GS: They had to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">SM: They had to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">GS: Did the Germans ever come into the forest where you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">SM: Oh yes, they tried, but they were all scared.</span> <span id="s410">If they came, they came in a large, large number.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">GS: But not large enough to take over and to kill all of you partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">SM: They, they, if they came, they were at two days, three days, four days.</span> <span id="s413">We were retreating.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">GS: It was a large forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">SM: To fight with them we only, we only, we tried to avoid fights, actually, because we did not have the type of ammunition they had.</span> <span id="s416">But where we had to, we did fight.</span> <span id="s417">As a whole, they were, the Germans were scared of the forest.</span> <span id="s418">More difficult was with Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s419">They were not as scared, and with them we had often fights, and most of the partisans killed were actually killed by Ukrainians, more by Ukrainians by, than by Germans.</span> <span id="s420">We had also a lot of Ukrainians also in our side.</span> <span id="s421">As a matter of fact my commander was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s422">But still, they gave us a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s423">And when I said, the, I'll never forget the encounter with these Russian tanks, when they, they stopped when they saw, when we saw Russian tanks, they got out and they stopped.</span> <span id="s424">They thought in beginning, hey, who are this?</span> <span id="s425">And then, they, asked us, "Hey, who are you?"</span> <span id="s426">I said, "We are partisans."</span> <span id="s427">They started to kiss us and they saw the German soldiers, we were, we asked them, where, what to do with them.</span> <span id="s428">So they told us to go to the next city and where the army has a camp for them.</span> <span id="s429">So we took them there and for the first time in two years I saw, I walked on asphalt.</span> <span id="s430">I thought already sometimes in the forest, I thought, will I ever be able to walk on concrete?</span> <span id="s431">On asphalt, and not on mud?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">GS: So at this time now it's '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">SM: This was, yes, '44.</span> <span id="s434">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s435">GS: And you remained with the partisans until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">SM: Until the end.</span> <span id="s437">In '45 I went into Russia to find my mother and I had there two brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">GS: Where were they during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">SM: They were still, still in...</span></p> <p><span id="s440">GS: Back in...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">SM: Back in the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s442">At least...</span></p> <p><span id="s443">GS: Ural.</span> <span id="s444">That was a safe place.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">SM: It was safe from point of view, yes.</span> <span id="s446">They, they suffered hunger and various kind of deprivations, but this was the same thing what the whole Russian population went through.</span> <span id="s447">At least—they worried about us, they were sure that we are not alive, although with the first plane which landed in our, in partisans—I sent a letter to them.</span> <span id="s448">So this was, and I told them that my sister and brother-in-law are also alive, and so they knew after that that we are alive.</span> <span id="s449">But still, it could happen every other day something could happen.</span> <span id="s450">And later my sister and brother-in-law, when they were near Moscow, he was in a hospital there, and from there already they wrote letters so they knew that they survived.</span> <span id="s451">And in '45 I went, picked up, it took some, it took several months to arrange all the papers.</span> <span id="s452">It was '46 that my, the family left, moved back to Poland.</span> <span id="s453">We were sent to Stettin [Szczecin].</span> <span id="s454">No, we didn't, I went to the place where we, Przasnysz, where I was born.</span> <span id="s455">I was there only a half an hour, and I could not, I couldn't stay, because it...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">GS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s457">No life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">SM: No, no Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">GS: You mentioned another place where the family went, in ‘46.</span> <span id="s460">Szczecin?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">SM: Oh, Szczecin.</span> <span id="s462">This is, this is the part of, Szczecin is, was, is a, was once a German city which was, now is, was, Poland occupied it, take it.</span> <span id="s463">Now it is Poland.</span> <span id="s464">And the German population was sent out, and they tried to Polanize it, and they sent also Jews who returned from the Soviet Union they sent there.</span> <span id="s465">In Szczecin I got in contact with Zionists movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">GS: Szczecin, can you spell that name for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">SM: In English I believe it will be, S-T-E-, Stettin, S-T-E-T-T-I-N.</span> <span id="s468">It is a large port.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">GS: You were there from '46...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">SM: From '46 to...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">GS: Or '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">SM: '46 to, ‘til about '47.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">GS: A year.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">SM: Right.</span> <span id="s475">I was approached there by a Zionist group.</span> <span id="s476">They needed to arrange to send children, a train with children, a few hundred children, toward Krakow, so that they can take them out of Poland.</span> <span id="s477">And they couldn't get a train.</span> <span id="s478">They, as a former partisan I knew some people.</span> <span id="s479">Can I, can I arrange it for them?</span> <span id="s480">I arranged it, as long as, I told them if they will give me some people to help, to keep so many kids in,...</span></p> <p><span id="s481">GS: How many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SM: About 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">GS: And how old were they?</span> <span id="s484">Young children?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">SM: Young, from, eight to about, to fourteen, fifteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">GS: These were children who had been orphaned?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">SM: Orphaned and they, there was an orphanage home in, organized in Szczecin and they wanted to send them to Krakow.</span> <span id="s488">From Krakow they had a way to send them through Czechoslovakia, out of Poland.</span> <span id="s489">I organized a train.</span> <span id="s490">They couldn't get a train.</span> <span id="s491">I said, "I'll get you a train!"</span> <span id="s492">And they promised me that, but I told them I want something for it too, and this is, I want my family also to be able to move out from Szczecin to, to Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s493">This was the only place where we could [unclear], because this was close to Germany.</span> <span id="s494">And this was arranged.</span> <span id="s495">I brought the children back, brought the children to Krakow and I returned, and a few months later I was told that there is a possibility to move, and we left.</span> <span id="s496">Actually, not all.</span> <span id="s497">Two of my sisters had to go another way.</span> <span id="s498">They went through Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">GS: How many of your family were able to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">SM: Oh, it was my mother, two brothers, and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">GS: Your father, died earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">SM: My father, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">GS: Did he die of natural causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SM: He, unfortunately he did not know that we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">GS: So then you went to the West.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">SM: To the West, to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">GS: To Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">SM: And in Berlin we stayed for some time, where I started to study in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">GS: You went to the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">SM: To University, yeah.</span> <span id="s511">And my two younger brothers volunteered when the wars in '48 started in Israel, they volunteered.</span> <span id="s512">They went to fight the war.</span> <span id="s513">I had enough wars.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">GS: When did you make the decision to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">SM: It was just before I got my Ph.D.</span> <span id="s516">My mother was that time in Israel, and I went to visit them.</span> <span id="s517">And I talked about, I am a chemist, and I talked about employment possibility, and I saw that it's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">GS: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">SM: No, in Germany I didn't want to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">GS: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">SM: In Germany I wouldn't have, but in Israel there is not easy to get employment as a chemist.</span> <span id="s522">In one place they told me “Yesh lanu chimayim k’mo zefet”, which means we have chemists like tar, like plenty.</span> <span id="s523">In other words, plenty, enough chemists.</span> <span id="s524">Cannot find a job for them.</span> <span id="s525">So that time I decided I'll go to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">GS: But the others in your family did go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">SM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">GS: And remained?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">SM: I still have a brother and sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s530">One brother.</span> <span id="s531">And my older sister, who was with me in ghetto, she already was in United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">GS: Oh.</span> <span id="s533">So you came to the United States then and completed your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">SM: No, I got my Ph.D..</span> <span id="s535">.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">GS: Oh, you got your Ph.D..</span> <span id="s537">.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SM: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">GS: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">SM: And then I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">GS: You mentioned the child of your sister who was placed in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s542">You never got her back?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">SM: No, could not, couldn't find her.</span> <span id="s544">Allegedly we talked to people who, the orphanage didn't exist after the war, and allegedly she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">GS: What year...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">SM: But we're not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">GS: What year was it when you arrived in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">SM: I arrived in '56.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">GS: I'm curious to know a little more about your family, if I may ask you.</span> <span id="s550">There obviously was a Zionist feeling within your family.</span> <span id="s551">Was it a religious Jewish family, or Socialist?</span> <span id="s552">What was the tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">SM: My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s554">My father was, had certain Socialist ideas, but more Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">GS: You mentioned that there was little antisemitism that you experienced when you were with the partisans.</span> <span id="s556">Earlier in your life in Poland, had you experienced antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">SM: Oh yes [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s558">GS: Directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">SM: There is, as a child I was "God-killer" whenever there was a religious holiday— you had to try to avoid the Polish children.</span> <span id="s560">There was, Poland was highly antisemitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">GS: What would happen if you met these children on a holiday?</span> <span id="s562">They would taunt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">SM: Oh we used to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">GS: Beating?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">SM: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s566">Since they were always in majority, was, we had finally to escape, to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">GS: You never thought about wanting to return to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">SM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">GS: You held Soviet citizenship, however.</span> <span id="s570">Had you ever considered staying in the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">SM: No, after I have seen the paradise of the working class, I decided to go to hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">GS: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s573">SM: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s574">GS: The experience had been good in that it saved your family?</span> <span id="s575">But it wasn't a..</span> <span id="s576">.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">SM: Yes, to a certain degree I, one has to say that when, in 1939, when the Jews needed help, the only country which helped was Russia.</span> <span id="s578">America did not let in any Jews.</span> <span id="s579">Was a ship of Jews from Germany who were in Miami that were in New York, and I was in Germany when the Jewish community gave some kind of a prize to the captain of the ship who tried, and had to bring the people back to Germany.</span> <span id="s580">But the Russians opened the borders, "Come in!"</span></p> <p><span id="s581">GS: Was it that they needed labor at that time, to develop?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">SM: It could be.</span> <span id="s583">It was also that Stalin was not, at that time, was not antisemitic yet.</span> <span id="s584">It was later that he changed.</span> <span id="s585">The plot of the doctors and so on.</span> <span id="s586">In 1945 I was in Moscow and saw the Jewish theater in Moscow.</span> <span id="s587">It was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">GS: Yiddish theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">SM: The best Yiddish theater I have ever seen!</span> <span id="s590">And after that, a short time after that they closed it.</span> <span id="s591">And to say, the argument was they closed it that there was because there were not enough interest.</span> <span id="s592">You couldn't get tickets to the, you had to buy tickets in two, three, four, five months in advance!</span></p> <p><span id="s593">GS: This was in '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">SM: Was in '45.</span> <span id="s595">And it was in Yiddish, and very often you saw, I remember once sitting, near me was sitting a young lady, and each time when people were laughing used to say to her mother, "Mommy what did they say?"</span> <span id="s596">She didn't understand the Yiddi-, the language, but still she came to, to...</span></p> <p><span id="s597">GS: The theater was popular.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">SM: To see.</span> <span id="s599">And to say after that, that they closed it because there was not enough interest, this happened later.</span> <span id="s600">But at that time when I was, in forty-, until '45 I did not see antisemitism.</span> <span id="s601">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s602">GS: How much did you know of what was happening, when you were in the area of the Urals, about the persecution and killing of Jews in the west?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">SM: We didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">GS: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">SM: Nothing.</span> <span id="s606">As a matter of fact, when I came to Minsk, I remember talking to a neighbor of my sister's, and he said, “What, at this time does a Jew come from Ural mountains to Minsk?”</span> <span id="s607">And I said, "Why?</span> <span id="s608">What?"</span> <span id="s609">He said, "The Germans are close by."</span> <span id="s610">This was...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">GS: About...</span></p> <p><span id="s612">SM: They heard already...</span></p> <p><span id="s613">GS: '41 or '42...</span></p> <p><span id="s614">SM: That something, yeah, they heard that something funny is going on, while in the Ural mountains you know nothing, you heard nothing.</span> <span id="s615">And you couldn't read it from the papers, because the paper didn't say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">GS: This is what we have heard about most of the Soviet, people in the Soviet Union were uninformed completely about what was happening in the world outside.</span> <span id="s617">Except in the eastern...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SM: No, we did read...</span></p> <p><span id="s619">GS: I mean in the western...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">SM: But was...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">GS: Portions.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">SM: Yeah, we did read what, that France is being occupied, and so on and forth.</span> <span id="s623">But what is happening to the Jews, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">GS: There was no word.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SM: No word.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">GS: When did you first learn of what happened in the camps?</span> <span id="s627">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">SM: Oh, about the various camps, this I heard after the war, in, in, in Minsk, or at all in White Russia there was immediately, the solution was on hand.</span> <span id="s629">In other way we knew that the people are being killed.</span> <span id="s630">We knew that the people, the Jews are being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">GS: You had seen this when you were in the ghetto I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">SM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">GS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">SM: In other words, they didn't kill, they killed in the ghetto too, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s635">GS: They were taken away, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s636">SM: They were taking out, and not far away we heard even when there will be killings, because we knew that they are digging graves.</span> <span id="s637">Still there was no, no, nothing to do.</span> <span id="s638">Was a question, where to run, what to do?</span> <span id="s639">Later, we wondered, why did we sit so long when we saw, hey, that we could have simply gone into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">GS: Well you had to learn that that was a possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">SM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">GS: Was there any, message brought from other places?</span> <span id="s643">Did you hear of what was happening in any other towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">SM: Yes.</span> <span id="s645">This we did, because occasionally some were coming to Minsk from a neighboring town where all Jews were killed, and the remaining were escaping, came to Minsk.</span> <span id="s646">So we knew that, this is why also we did what we were done, because we have seen sooner or later the whole ghetto will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s647">And we have to get away.</span> <span id="s648">Otherwise we'll be, initially we still hoped, hey, maybe the Russian army will push back and so on.</span> <span id="s649">But after, after a year, year-and-a-half, we saw that there is no hope...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">GS: Wasn't happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">SM: Was no hope in it.</span> <span id="s652">And we decided to try it in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">GS: You had no news of what was happening in a place like Kiev, Kiev, the slaughter at Babi Yar, and,...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">SM: No, Babi Yar I heard of after the war.</span> <span id="s655">I knew that they, I can, I could imagine what happened, because we know what the, how the Ukrainians behaved in our place.</span> <span id="s656">But was with Babi Yar was also in Minsk.</span> <span id="s657">There were more people killed in Minsk than in Babi Yar.</span> <span id="s658">In Minsk were killed 120,000 Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s659">GS: So you didn't need to have any other...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SM: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">GS: Examples to know that the partisans was the only way to choose, to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">SM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">GS: Is there anything else that you feel you would want to mention that I haven't asked you about?</span> <span id="s664">Just let me touch on one other thing.</span> <span id="s665">There was never any effort to enlist you or other partisans in the Soviet army, was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">SM: No, the, after the war.</span> <span id="s667">When the, when I, when the Russian army has taken, came to the place which was near Bialystok, was already '44, and then the war was practically, practically won already.</span> <span id="s668">[noise in background; tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s669">GS: Do you have any feeling you would be willing to share as to how, why, you survived, some terribly dangerous, awful experiences?</span> <span id="s670">Do you feel that, did your religious faith answer in any way, or do you have any other feelings about your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">SM: Yes, simply a strong will to live.</span> <span id="s672">We tried to do whatever possible, whatever we could, to survive.</span> <span id="s673">From standing guard in ghetto to building all kinds of places to hide.</span> <span id="s674">Not to be passive and say, "Somebody else will help us."</span> <span id="s675">No, we have to do something else.</span> <span id="s676">There is a certain amount of luck also involved.</span> <span id="s677">But definitely you cannot be passive.</span> <span id="s678">You have to be active, and to do something in order to survive.</span> <span id="s679">And those who did not do, who tried only to rely on faith, did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">GS: Your youth and your general good health put you in a good position to act upon these feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">SM: Definitely this helped.</span> <span id="s682">Definitely helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">GS: And yet there were other young, healthy people who did not act.</span> <span id="s684">Was it out of fear, do you think, that they were unable to participate in the way you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">SM: Very often people did not act because, family ties.</span> <span id="s686">Those who were with mothers, fathers, they could not leave them and run.</span> <span id="s687">It helped, the fact that my mother was away helped me survive.</span> <span id="s688">I doubt if I, if my mother were in with me in ghetto, that I would have had the courage, the strength to leave her and go.</span> <span id="s689">And after all to go out into the forest, and you know that minus forty degrees to be in the, to make, to have to sleep on the snow and so on, is not, is not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">GS: It seems almost unbelievable that you could survive those conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SM: And after years, and after a certain time, we always thought, why did we wait so long, when you know it.</span> <span id="s692">Most people did not know that there is a way.</span> <span id="s693">There was not help from the neighbors, who could have helped much more than they did.</span> <span id="s694">For us particular, it was, particularly this was difficult, because we were in a strange environment.</span> <span id="s695">We didn't know the people in Minsk.</span> <span id="s696">We did not know, especially, the peasants around it.</span> <span id="s697">We did not know that it's simply possible to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">GS: What was your first contact with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">SM: It helped through my brother-in-law, who was a fighter all his life.</span> <span id="s700">And he started to go out into the villages to exchange clothes for food, bring food into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s701">After that I joined him.</span> <span id="s702">This was our first step to see, "Hey.</span> <span id="s703">We can go out.</span> <span id="s704">We can get over, away."</span> <span id="s705">Then was a question to try to find some kind of contacts.</span> <span id="s706">It happened also certain luck that a person who was a prominent Jewish Communist leader who was in the building where we lived.</span> <span id="s707">We discussed certain times, several times, he slept in our room.</span> <span id="s708">And then when he was in hiding because the Germans were looking for him, he came to us for help.</span> <span id="s709">And we offered immediately, without any question, sure we'll hide you.</span> <span id="s710">Through him we started to get certain contacts.</span> <span id="s711">So, it was from one part our action, and from other part the willingness of, to look, not to, not to give up hope.</span> <span id="s712">To look for ways out.</span> <span id="s713">This what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">GS: You have to seek it in order to find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">SM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">GS: Some partisan groups did not accept the Jews.</span> <span id="s717">Some actually turned on them.</span> <span id="s718">But this group in the forest near Minsk had Jewish people working with them and accepted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">SM: There were many groups which accepted.</span> <span id="s720">Obviously, if they wanted, they could have saved many more Jews.</span> <span id="s721">If there were some kind of a action to try to save Jews, Jews could have been saved, because many simply did not know where to go, what to do.</span> <span id="s722">Not many, most of the people.</span> <span id="s723">Had the Russian partisans be more interested in saving Jews, they could have saved much more, many more.</span> <span id="s724">They did not actually do anything to save, but they did not refuse, most of them did not refuse when somebody came to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">GS: Whereas the Polish partisans, by contrast, did turn away.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">SM: Oh, these Polish partisans we were always fighting.</span> <span id="s727">I participated in one case in disarming Polish partisans, because they were interested more in fighting us than in fighting Germans.</span> <span id="s728">I never heard about Polish partisans fighting Germans, but I know they were killing Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">GS: Well, I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s730">And I realize it's Dr. Makower, as you're addressed.</span> <span id="s731">I know it hasn't been easy to draw on these old memories, but what you've told I think will be very valuable to people who come to study seriously what the war years did to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s732">And it will be passed on from one generation to the next.</span> <span id="s733">On behalf of the Gratz Archive I want to thank you.</span></p></body></html>
