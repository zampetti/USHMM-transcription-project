mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s12">EE: ...we arrived in Auschwitz with my parents and my brother...we were separated...the old ones went one way...we went another way...my father and my brother survived the war...then they were taken to a camp in Germany...from there they were marched, towards the end of the war, April of 1945, they were marched to Theresienstadt and that’s where they were liberated.</span> <span id="s13">When we were liberated...we were liberated...we were taken to this labor camp in Lanzig, Austria...</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WH: When you were in Auschwitz, did you do any work?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">EE: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: ...after the liberation...</span></p> <p><span id="s17">EE: ...we were divided into groups according to our homes, which in my case was Czechoslovakia, so we were taken to Prague...</span></p> <p><span id="s18">WH: Tell me, this reminds me when you say Prague, what do you think of everything that is going now?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">EE: It’s just incredible, that’s all I can think.</span> <span id="s20">We were there this summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: It wasn’t like that then.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">EE: No, it wasn’t like that.</span> <span id="s23">It’s just amazing what’s going on.</span> <span id="s24">It’s almost frightening, because it seems completely out of control.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: It’s bizarre.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">EE: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: Do you like it that this is happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">EE: I like it on a human level.</span> <span id="s29">I like it.</span> <span id="s30">On a shall we say, on a bias level, I think the Poles deserve to suffer a bit more, the Hungarians along with them, the Czechs I have mixed feelings about.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: Does it depend on Slovaks or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EE: Oh, yes the Slovaks can suffer as the Poles and the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s33">For ever and ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: What about the Berlin wall coming down?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EE: I think it’s absolutely amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">WH: Does that make you nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">EE: Does that make me nervous?</span> <span id="s38">A united Germany makes me nervous a bit, yes.</span> <span id="s39">Yes.</span> <span id="s40">I think –ahhh, -nervous.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WH: ...people here who are not Jewish don’t understand that nationalism in these countries is often accompanied by anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">EE: Not often.</span> <span id="s43">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">WH: ...your home town –was?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">EE: Muncatch.</span> <span id="s46">Munconchero...I was born in Budapest, in ’26 but I was raised in Muncautch...(after the Liberation)...my father died...and my brother and I met in Budapest...and cousin...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">WH: ...you eventually went to medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">EE: Yes, my brother and my cousin went to Israel and I started medical school in Budapest in the spring of –1946.</span> <span id="s49">Which involved a lot to do, because they didn’t any certificate to the fact that I completed school, which eventually I did find a report card from the final grade of the gymnasium, but I never had any (?</span> <span id="s50">maturer?)</span> <span id="s51">certificate, because we never had it, Hitler came in April, just before it was time to take the exams.</span> <span id="s52">So they admitted me to medical school conditionally that I’m going to get that, that I have to have a (?</span> <span id="s53">maturer?)</span> <span id="s54">exam somewhere, which I did, and the Jewish girls gymnasium in Budapest.</span> <span id="s55">I recall nothing.</span> <span id="s56">I don’t know whether I ever attended their class or whether I just ran in to sit for the exam.</span> <span id="s57">Well, I have the exam somewhere.</span> <span id="s58">So they admitted me officially.</span> <span id="s59">I lived with my cousin at my cousin’s house, whose husband is a physician and I attended school.</span> <span id="s60">In 1948 when the Russians were really approaching...politically they were coming more apparent, it was my cousin, another cousin...it was his idea that it’s time to leave this country before it closes down...so we got to Vienna.</span> <span id="s61">He was a Czech citizen because he was not born in Hungary like I was, and he arranged to get some false passport for me...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: ...so what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">EE: So, I was still hung up on my medical career, so I really didn’t do anything much with it, I kind of let it be...in the meantime my brother died in Israel, and I was kind of depressed and my goal was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s64">I was going to finish medical school and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s65">And since my brother had died, my push decreased considerably... but all my friend they told me, What’s the big deal, why don’t you go to America.</span> <span id="s66">If you don’t like it, you can always leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: You didn’t have any family left.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">EE: No, I didn’t have any immediate family left...I was all alone, and I wasn’t all alone.</span> <span id="s69">This cousin that I’m talking about, it’s my male cousin, who, my biggest surprise is living still in (inaudible European city)...</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: So you were in Vienna now.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EE: So I was in Vienna now, this is 1949 or ’50 and I registered with the American Consulate where they told me that I needed a sponsor.</span> <span id="s72">‘Did I know anybody in America?’</span> <span id="s73">I said, ‘No, I didn’t know anybody in America.’</span> <span id="s74">Which wasn’t exactly true because one of my cousins did come to America in ’45 and I strongly suspected, and I even knew her address, but I’m not 100% sure that I did know.</span> <span id="s75">In any rate, when I said I (?</span> <span id="s76">wasn’t?)</span> <span id="s77">alone, I had this cousin who took me to Vienna, who arranged for the false passport and he was really my moral supporter and to a certain extent even financial, too, a little bit...I did have assorted relatives, cousins, and we were a very close knit family, so it really did not feel so alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: ...you came to America in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">EE: In 1951.</span> <span id="s80">After I told the Consulate that I didn’t know anybody, they got me sponsorship...I’m sure, it was the Joint Distribution Committee (inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: You don’t know the sponsor?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">EE: I know the sponsor.</span> <span id="s83">Was Beth Israel hospital in Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: So you finished medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">EE: Yes, I finished medical school in Vienna of June of ’51...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: Had you done a specialization in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EE: No, I just graduated...Vienna University...straight medical school.</span> <span id="s88">And I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: You came by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">EE: Yes.</span> <span id="s91">S.S. General Stewart...I landed in New York.</span> <span id="s92">I don’t think that I had any intentions of going to Boston.</span> <span id="s93">By the way, I knew nothing from America.</span> <span id="s94">I did know a little bit of English, minimal English from high school, which was mostly reading and writing, not the –oral expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: ...when you came to New York, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">EE: When I came to New York, I knew about this cousin who was in New York.</span> <span id="s97">And I was heading to this cousin.</span> <span id="s98">I also had a boyfriend in Vienna who, due to similar circumstances, he had relatives in America.</span> <span id="s99">He came out here.</span> <span id="s100">Maybe a whole year ahead of me, but there was still some wishy-washy relationship.</span> <span id="s101">Not a very strong one, nevertheless, he was in the picture.</span> <span id="s102">So when I landed, he was around.</span> <span id="s103">He was in touch with my cousin, so I guess that she knew already that I would be coming.</span> <span id="s104">She lived in Brooklyn and I remember going to Brooklyn to her...as it happened, my picture appeared in the Daily News and the Daily Mirror...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Why did it appear?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">EE: Because the boat arrived, which was a routine in those days, and they had an old man, and a baby and they had a doctor.</span> <span id="s107">And my husband calls it, ‘They had a cheesecake doctor.’</span> <span id="s108">Okay?</span> <span id="s109">So, they have to have somebody, they picked somebody from the boat of the new arrivals.</span> <span id="s110">It was my introduction to American journalism, because I didn’t say a word to anybody, yet I was quoted.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WH: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">EE: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: Did you give your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EE: Yes, they gave my name...they spelled it correctly...they said I was going to Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">WH: What did they quote you as saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">EE: Paraphrasing, they quote me as saying that I was going to Boston and I was engaged and going to be married, or some stuff like that...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: You weren’t engaged?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">EE: No...it was just one of those things...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: So you were famous from the moment you came here.</span> <span id="s120">A million people saw your picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EE: A million people saw my picture, and amongst the million was my father’s cousin who came to this country years before I was born, who is a real good guy.</span> <span id="s122">He called up this cousin to find out whether I was who he thought I was indeed who he thought I was...and they literally became my adopted parents.</span> <span id="s123">I lived in their house.</span> <span id="s124">I mean, I really didn’t stay with my cousin for any length of time.</span> <span id="s125">She was a new immigrant, and she had a husband and babies, and very religious and so on.</span> <span id="s126">So this couple who’s name is Leo and Margey Meiseles and they lived on 90th Street and Broadway in a large spacious apartment and they literally adopted me.</span> <span id="s127">And I lived with them until I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EE: In ’53.</span> <span id="s130">That’s two years...so they were trying in any way to help me get an internship which was very, very difficult for foreign graduate.</span> <span id="s131">I started my internship at Morrisania City Hospital in November of 1951.</span> <span id="s132">I arrived in September –6th.</span> <span id="s133">I met my husband in the hospital –he was an intern also.</span> <span id="s134">So we were both interns and the following year he went to different hospital, and I went to Beth Israel Hospital and I continued my specialization, I became a pediatrician, which is what I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s135">So, I was a pediatrician for a number of years.</span> <span id="s136">And I remained in very, very close contact with this couple, and their children, and we still are in very close contact.</span> <span id="s137">At this point, Leo is 88...our daughter is getting married in March, our youngest daughter...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">WH: What was your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">EE: Siegel.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">WH: Today you are a psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">EE: Today I am a psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: Where did it happen, the change?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">EE: The change happened –I did pediatrics for a couple of years, I had my two older children.</span> <span id="s144">And it became difficult to run a pediatric practice which in those days included house calls and being available all the time.</span> <span id="s145">And I just found it very difficult to manage, so that’s Number One.</span> <span id="s146">Number Two, pediatrics was not particularly challenging in those days.</span> <span id="s147">The bread and butter of private pediatrics, I presume still is, sore throats, upper respiratory infections and so on.</span> <span id="s148">In those days, it was also well-baby care was done by the pediatrician.</span> <span id="s149">Today, it’s done by the pediatrician’s nurse.</span> <span id="s150">Which means, that I had to measure head circumference and weigh and length and all that jazz.</span> <span id="s151">Which just, it wasn’t intellectually stimulating at all!</span> <span id="s152">That is the combination of being difficult and not stimulating and the fact that, as my patients, who I basically got this new-borns, were getting a little bit older and then the mothers and the grandmothers, started asking about weaning and toilet training and all the kind of stuff that they didn’t teach you while you were a pediatric resident.</span> <span id="s153">They taught you all the fancy obscure diseases.</span> <span id="s154">But none of that stuff.</span> <span id="s155">So I had to start reading about it, and I said to myself, if I’m going to be spending my time giving advice, I better find out what kind of advice I’m giving and better learn something about it.</span> <span id="s156">So that’s how I got interested in psychiatry.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: After how many years did you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">EE: I started my psychiatry residency in 1960 and I finished...about 4 years later...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WH: Where did you do the psychiatry residency?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">EE: Partially in Manhattan, Veteran’s Administration Hospital, then in Creedmor and then in Long Island Jewish Hillside which at that time was only Hillside...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WH: Were you in private practice after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">EE: ...I was in private practice –about ’67 or ’68...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">WH: How long have you lived in Great Neck?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">EE: Since 1962.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: Your private practice, you started it here?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">EE: Yah.</span> <span id="s167">Yes and no.</span> <span id="s168">I still have my pediatric office in Forest Hills and my husband had an office there also...and then we added this spot to the house.</span> <span id="s169">This was an open porch and once we built this office, I was here...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">WH: Today you practice, is it children or adults or mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">EE: It is mixed.</span> <span id="s172">At this point there are more adults (?</span> <span id="s173">with?)</span> <span id="s174">children...and again, it was very much part of my other assumed responsibility such as mothering and doing all the other things, and I felt that I did not particularly want to work the hours where my children were at home.</span> <span id="s175">Which is you know, when the children could come.</span> <span id="s176">So I gradually switched over to adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WH: You have how many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">EE: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WH: Had you ever treated any Holocaust survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">EE: Only incidentally...not specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: ...granted that people will suffer from depression, but it’s important to be able to find a way (inaudible) in distinguishing between pre-war pre-disposition, perhaps, and the traumatic effects of going through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">EE: That is very true, but the difficulty arises that most of the survivors were basically kids before they –experienced the Holocaust, or teenagers.</span> <span id="s183">So there was very little real developed personality.</span> <span id="s184">I say, most, there are those who were in their 20’s, or 30’s or 40’s, but at least certainly my generation were all teenagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">WH: The average age of the average survivor is between 15-35...I was just wondering what you as a psychiatrist, or as a survivor, what you think of this literature (on the Holocaust).</span> <span id="s186">If you know the general trend it’s taken is that the population (inaudible)...when I did this statistically survey I learned that 19% of the survivors admitted to ever having seen either psychiatrist or a social worker or a psychologist...I could not investigate the circumstances in which they saw such a person.</span> <span id="s187">And I allowed the interviewers to indicate if they said that they saw a Social Worker because when they came here, HIAS said, ‘You must see a Social Worker,’ so that counted as a ‘yes’, but a number of people who had therapy (inaudible) might only be 12-15%.</span> <span id="s188">When I compared them to the American raised Jewish population, the number of people who saw a psychiatrist or psychologist or social worker was 31%.</span> <span id="s189">Thirteen points higher.</span> <span id="s190">Now when I told this to people they said, ‘Of course, the survivors –are resistant to the idea, they think it’s norishkeit, they don’t want to be bothered by it.</span> <span id="s191">But before, if I would ask psychologist what percentage of the population do they think is seeing someone they gave much higher estimates than 18%.</span> <span id="s192">Now, up until the time that I had done this research...(inaudible)...the problem to me is that 100% of the conclusions are being drawn based on 18% of the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">EE: It’s true for every statistics, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">WH: Yes...but most of the people didn’t see anyone, the fact is they might have needed to see someone they just didn’t.</span> <span id="s195">There hasn’t been lately too much emphasis pathologically... ...(inaudible)...and not enough on the normal aspects.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">EE: Well, I happen to feel exactly that way you described it.</span> <span id="s197">I think the tension is strictly through the pathological (inaudible) and if you start out by the fact that if you want to take the real, -what shall I, the statement that the fittest survive, then you are already feeling a more fit sample.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">WH: Which makes it even more wrong to focus on the pathological.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">EE: Well, always in that framework, but basically, yes.</span> <span id="s200">The strongest and the fittest were those who survived.</span> <span id="s201">I’m not saying that there were no strong and fit ones who succumbed.</span> <span id="s202">But, theoretically, at least, with everything that was going on, you had to be strong and fit to make it through.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">WH: What about those who say ‘I just made it through luck’?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">EE: I think all of us made it through luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">WH: Wouldn’t that negate though, the theory of the strongest?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">EE: No, because luck holds out just so long, okay?</span> <span id="s207">-</span></p> <p><span id="s208">WH: ...it’s luck and your strength, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">EE: Well, luck was always part of it, okay?</span> <span id="s210">Because you could never figure out whether Mengele shot the fat ones, or the short ones, or the tall ones, or whatever that particular day.</span> <span id="s211">But when I say ‘the fittest,’ if you had any possibility to manipulate the situation a little bit, then you didn’t just give up and try to do whatever you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">WH: What about if you were (?</span> <span id="s213">inaudible?)</span> <span id="s214">from what you saw, in other words, if people only said, ‘Well, the strongest and the fittest,’ in other words, who could pull a wagon longer, who had more endurance, who didn’t succumb to typhus, all those things are very important.</span> <span id="s215">And then one point a survivor said to me...’those of us who survived,’...’we weren’t necessarily the nicest, we weren’t necessarily the kindest, we weren’t necessarily the (inaudible?</span> <span id="s216">gentlest?)</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">If we were, we would be dead.’</span> <span id="s219">Now, how do you assess a statement like that?</span> <span id="s220">I’m sure that the time you spent in Auschwitz you saw all types of people.</span> <span id="s221">Nice ones, nasty ones.</span> <span id="s222">Terrence Depres, who wrote the book, ‘The Survivor,’ argued that those who shared, survived because those who shared, others reciprocated and...I am trying to be as honest as possible and (inaudible-learn?)</span> <span id="s223">the facts.</span> <span id="s224">But of course, I am only a child of survivors.</span> <span id="s225">I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t really know the truth.</span> <span id="s227">I know the accusations, the implications, the insinuations...(inaudible)...but you are a trained individual and I’m sure that in the backdrop, now that you’re a psychiatrist you could look at this experience in a little bit more different light.</span> <span id="s228">What do you think of all these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EE: Those who shared, (inaudible) a small group, yes.</span> <span id="s230">It is possibly true.</span> <span id="s231">I mean, take the four of us, you know there were four cousins.</span> <span id="s232">All four if us survived –and yes, we shared, and yes, we supported each other.</span> <span id="s233">I mean, in that sense it helped, and it helped all four of us.</span> <span id="s234">Now, I was very sick in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s235">I don’t know what I had...I barely remember it, but what I do remember is that we (inaudible)...had to line up for hours on end to be counted and so on.</span> <span id="s236">And I do remember that one of my cousins got a bucket from somewhere...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s238">EE: ...Up to the moment where they saw a guard or the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">WH: so you could get a rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">EE: Yes...and they literally held me up with their hands for the few moments when it (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s241">hurt), okay?</span> <span id="s242">On the other hand, when my cousin got sick, and it was a question of hospitalization, or anything, we said ‘It was out of the question.’</span> <span id="s243">And when another cousin had scarlet fever...it was considered almost fatal illness not only in concentration camp but in general.</span> <span id="s244">It was a scary disease...and it was a question since we were sleeping right next to each other, and this was suppose to be contagious we didn’t know how, who was going to sleep next to her.</span> <span id="s245">Now, if she was abandoned, without giving the four of us were not together, she probably would have been succumbed because some ‘stranger’ would have said, ‘why don’t you go to the hospital’ instead I slept next to her.</span> <span id="s246">She slept on the edge and I slept next to her and the rest lined up.</span> <span id="s247">So, yes, in that sense it helped.</span> <span id="s248">On the other hand, if you get hold of a slice of bread, and you shared it ten ways, all ten may have died.</span> <span id="s249">And yes, if you got a slice of bread and you didn’t have the four (inaudible) like we did, I don’t think that we really grabbed for ourselves without sharing if there was anything possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">WH: But the sharing could be limited to your little group.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">EE: That’s what I said.</span> <span id="s252">Sharing in a small group, I can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">WH: What did you observe in terms of behavior on the part of other people around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">EE: Everyone was for himself, by and large.</span> <span id="s255">For instance, I had a little cousin, she was 10 at the time, who came to us from Poland.</span> <span id="s256">She was already in bunkers and G-d knows where in Poland and she came illegally to us and we were together in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s257">She was already a trained smuggler, and conniver and you name it, she was it.</span> <span id="s258">And she managed to get into the kitchen, and she managed to get this or that.</span> <span id="s259">She was not a big sharer...but as I said, a –expert because she had already put in like 5 years in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">WH: Did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">EE: No, she did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">WH: How come?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">EE: She was very young.</span> <span id="s264">I don’t know how she even managed to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">WH: ...such a tragic story...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EE: That’s right.</span> <span id="s267">Because like I said, so some of it had nothing to do with what you knew and how smart you were or what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">WH: Circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">EE: Some of it was circumstances.</span> <span id="s270">Some of it was sheer luck.</span> <span id="s271">And I’m not saying that everybody who survived is fittest, but I think that in terms of the general population, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">WH: I’ve come to the conclusion here, that a survivor is a survivor wherever he may be.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">EE: Uh, uh (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s274">WH: ...inaudible...had I started this project twenty years ago, I would have been interviewing people who were still alive then.</span> <span id="s275">What’s left now is really the strongest among the strongest.</span> <span id="s276">They not only survived, but they survived until 1989.</span> <span id="s277">That’s a long time after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">EE: Yes, but you are also interviewing the youngest...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">WH: Did you feel that people here really didn’t understand what you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">EE: To start with nobody talked about it.</span> <span id="s281">For a long, long time, nobody talked about it.</span> <span id="s282">My children always knew, but they were not particularly interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">WH: When did you tell them?</span> <span id="s284">When did they become interested if they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">EE: They did.</span> <span id="s286">They always –I think they learned more stories about the family than about Auschwitz specifically.</span> <span id="s287">One year I may try to figure that out.</span> <span id="s288">I would say maybe 7 years ago, 6 years ago, not a terribly long time ago.</span> <span id="s289">Maybe 8.</span> <span id="s290">My –oldest daughter...she was married...and lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s291">They used to come every summer.</span> <span id="s292">So one summer they arrived and I think that was the first –this was already after Epstein’s book, which I kind of encouraged the children to read, and they weren’t interested.</span> <span id="s293">Or maybe they kind of glanced through it and the general comment was, ‘I can’t identify with anything.’</span> <span id="s294">...they kind of skimmed through it and the general comment was, that ‘we can’t identify with it.’</span> <span id="s295">...my two big ones are today 35 and 33 and the two little ones are 30 and 29...their comments were, ‘It had nothing to do with me.’</span> <span id="s296">...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">WH: Is your husband American?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">EE: My husband is born Russian, he is a survivor of a different kind because they came here in 1939...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">WH: Was there anything in particular that made your children -.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">EE: Well, as I said, one summer they arrived...1982...and Jane said, ‘Tell us your story.’</span></p> <p><span id="s301">WH: and you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">EE: Yes, I did...but basically, that was the first time that I got a ‘tell us your story.’</span> <span id="s303">Never again was it a ‘tell us your story.’</span> <span id="s304">They did want it on a tape, but nobody ever listens to it.</span> <span id="s305">And here and there, things come up, as my kids mature they may have some question, if they read something, I think mostly Susie.</span> <span id="s306">Because, maybe because I speak to her more, or she’s less preoccupied with a million other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">WH: You were saying that...(inaudible)...was a little bit overdone.</span> <span id="s308">That the people who came here were pretty strong, in fact.</span> <span id="s309">That if you go to work in the morning, and you have children, you’re normal in one sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">EE: Uh, uh (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s311">WH: Is there a fascination?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">EE: Well, not only that, but if you really look around –I must quote my husband, who’s famous saying... ‘For an orphan, I married a girl who has the biggest family I ever saw!’</span> <span id="s313">As I said, we have a very close knit family.</span> <span id="s314">So this father’s cousin’s children, you know, is already very close.</span> <span id="s315">And everybody is a cousin.</span> <span id="s316">I mean, my cousin Baras’ niece is my cousin.</span> <span id="s317">Everybody is my cousin –even HIS cousins are my cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">WH: ...(inaudible) –morbid fascination –voyeurism –in psychiatry...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">EE: Okay, look.</span> <span id="s320">Some people, you know, like Judith Kestenberg, or some people who really devote their...life to a certain perspective, yes, there maybe a morbid fascination but then there’s a morbid fascination with any of these (inaudible -?</span> <span id="s321">such product that anybody understands?)</span> <span id="s322">.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">WH: It’s true, but morbid was a negative.</span> <span id="s324">In other words, (inaudible)...and I guess, in trying to make sure that it’s not a function of my own discipline...sociology deals with the normal...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">EE: And doctors deal with the abnormal.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">WH: Right.</span> <span id="s327">Because who else goes to doctors?</span> <span id="s328">...I’m trying to get a picture of the entire community and I see those who have problems as a small minority of the total population.</span> <span id="s329">I also, I guess I feel that this part of the population needs to be considered, needs to be taken into account but it’s –even though –sometimes I’ll interview a survivor and (?</span> <span id="s330">she’ll –or he’ll) say, ‘I never saw a psychiatrist, but maybe I could have used one.’</span> <span id="s331">I feel even though people like my parents, ‘What?</span> <span id="s332">You’re meshugge?’</span> <span id="s333">...(inaudible)...I guess that I still feel that if you are really sick (inaudible)...a terrible problem, you wake up screaming at night.</span> <span id="s334">You’re walking around in a catatonic state of depression.</span> <span id="s335">You will either through yourself or your wife, husband, or your relatives or your children find your way to professional help or you may turn up in the emergency room.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">EE: No question about this!</span> <span id="s337">–But you have to get into that state.</span> <span id="s338">Because those people who suffered from nightmares which they, in forty years they have gotten accustomed to, more or less, so it’s less frightening than it used to be.</span> <span id="s339">And they go about their daily living and they said ‘Gee, I had a terrible nightmare, but it’s time to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">WH: (inaudible)...(survivors having nightmares)...you can’t repress those things, even in your sleep they’ll come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">EE: They may come out, not necessarily in terms of the nightmares because I don’t remember any nightmares either.</span> <span id="s342">I’m not going to tell you that I never dreamed about this or that or the other particular picture or something.</span> <span id="s343">But none of it has the intensity I don’t think, forever waking up with a nightmare.</span> <span id="s344">I don’t recall getting up in the morning and I said, ‘Gee, did I have a horrible nightmare.’</span> <span id="s345">If you ask me, ‘what did I dream about the war?’</span> <span id="s346">I will tell you that I don’t remember but I do know that sometimes, and very, very infrequently, probably no more than maybe once in three, four, five years that I would have a dream that is somehow is related.</span> <span id="s347">And, for instance, when they had the Garden of the Finis Contini, that was a long time ago, a very long time ago, I wanted to go to see it with my husband, my husband was very reluctant.</span> <span id="s348">‘I don’t think it’s going to be good for you,’ and ‘Why are you looking for this kind of stuff,’ and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s349">And I said I wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s350">And we did go to see it.</span> <span id="s351">And all I remember is one scene out of the whole movie, that upset me.</span> <span id="s352">And that was...rounding up cattle into cattle cars.</span> <span id="s353">Cattle, not people...maybe I’m confusing two movies, maybe it was a western that had the cattles.</span> <span id="s354">This ‘Finis Contini’ when we came out, my husband was very upset, and I was much less upset.</span> <span id="s355">And he said, ‘How come?’</span> <span id="s356">I said, ‘Because after you go through the real thing, there is no way they can imitate it.’</span> <span id="s357">...so you can develop a certain, well, I don’t know what to call it in terms of an emotional distance or something like, nothing can touch me.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">WH: ...(inaudible)...repress it.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">EE: Call it repress it, call it disassociated.</span> <span id="s360">It’s almost like that was another somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">WH: ...do you have any idea why he (inaudible but referring to a man in another interview who shoveled bodies)...didn’t dream?</span> <span id="s362">...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s363">EE: It’s possible that he’s repressing it.</span> <span id="s364">It’s possible that he disassociated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">WH: And you can do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">EE: Yah.</span> <span id="s367">I may not consciously.</span> <span id="s368">But sometimes, you know, if you look at it sociologically, then psychosis is an escape from suffering, right?</span> <span id="s369">And if you have no better defense then you go nuts, right?</span> <span id="s370">Literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">WH: ...the question of escaping is a very individual thing.</span> <span id="s372">It depends on what you’re escaping from.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">EE: Exactly.</span> <span id="s374">But you sometimes can escape, I mean we call it a very non-working defense, or a sick defense if you escape into madness.</span> <span id="s375">But madness in that sense is also an escape.</span> <span id="s376">I mean, you have this, you can drive anybody mad sooner or later.</span> <span id="s377">It’s just a question how long are you going to keep at it.</span> <span id="s378">But you can make just about anybody psychotic with assorted, and I’m only talking about mental tortures, and I’m not even talking about anything physical.</span> <span id="s379">So, yes, you can disassociate, you can change your whole perception of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">WH: Would you say, from your perspective as a psychiatrist, what lessons can you take away from this whole experience (inaudible...)...I don’t know if you ever formalized it in your mind, but are there certain things that you feel...(inaudible...).</span></p> <p><span id="s381">EE: I never formalize anything, but, not only formalize but even formulated anything.</span> <span id="s382">I haven’t really delved into the Holocaust in general, even my own experience.</span> <span id="s383">So, like I told you, I repressed a great deal.</span> <span id="s384">I credit that as a good defense that allowed me to function at the level that I am functioning.</span> <span id="s385">I really haven’t given it terribly much thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">WH: Does it ever come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">EE: Does it come up?</span> <span id="s388">In my work, very little.</span> <span id="s389">I am, if you want to call the word, I wouldn’t even say fascinated.</span> <span id="s390">It’s too strong a word.</span> <span id="s391">But definitely interested.</span> <span id="s392">If there’s anything on TV about Holocaust (inaudible) like Kristallnacht, and all that stuff, and we would go through the whole thing again.</span> <span id="s393">See, my husband would just avoid all of it.</span> <span id="s394">He says, ‘I don’t want to suffer.</span> <span id="s395">I don’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s396">Why do you want to watch it?’</span> <span id="s397">And I usually do want to watch it...War and Remembrance.</span> <span id="s398">‘Why do you have to do that?’</span> <span id="s399">And I can’t tell you that I’m suffering through it.</span> <span id="s400">I really am not suffering through it and I probably really, again, kind of disassociating the emotional part and what I usually tell him, you know, I really don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s401">I don’t know the history of what was going on.</span> <span id="s402">I didn’t know the history of Germany, I was a kid in 1933, and German history didn’t affect me in any way...</span></p> <p><span id="s403">WH: If you had an opportunity to see a film that explored or to get information that dealt with psychiatry, individual or individuals, perpetrators, or you could see film or read something about (inaudible)...which one do you think would pull greater interest for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EE: The perpetrator.</span> <span id="s405">I saw enough of the sufferers.</span> <span id="s406">When I say enough, I mean the numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">WH: If you saw a movie that said that it was an in-depth analysis of Hitler’s S.S., the mentalities of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">EE: That would interest me, definitely, more than the one who were in Auschwitz with me.</span> <span id="s409">How do people, how can they bring themselves to do something like that?</span> <span id="s410">How could they?</span> <span id="s411">I really don’t know how they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">WH: But you thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">EE: Well, (laughs) I thought about it to this extent, okay?</span> <span id="s414">I really don’t know how, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">WH: But you know that they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">EE: Yah, I know that they did it.</span> <span id="s417">And the more that I think about it, the less do I understand on an individual human nature how anybody can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">WH: Is it possible that they convinced themselves (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s419">EE: It’s a very hard conviction, particularly when you hit somebody and really whip somebody, with saying ‘You dirty Jew!’</span> <span id="s420">or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s421">And you are addressing a human being.</span> <span id="s422">So, to say that they convinced themselves that these are not human beings, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WH: Do you think that Americans are capable of doing something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">EE: Absolutely!</span> <span id="s425">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s426">WH: No question.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">EE: No question.</span> <span id="s428">No question.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">WH: What makes you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">EE: Americans are human beings like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">WH: Are Jews capable of doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">EE: I think that Jews would be capable of doing it also, with lesser chances than others, because in a sense, Number One, the whole experience of the Holocaust and the suffering kind of conditions one differently.</span> <span id="s433">It’s hard to forget all that.</span> <span id="s434">But then again, I mean, the Israeli soldiers are committing atrocities (inaudible) in the occupied territories.</span> <span id="s435">They call it ‘individual.’</span> <span id="s436">I’m not so sure that it’s so individual.</span> <span id="s437">Can human beings do it?</span> <span id="s438">Yes!</span> <span id="s439">Can they really psychologically, like mass hysteria, grow with it and do it?</span> <span id="s440">Sure!</span> <span id="s441">It can be done.</span> <span id="s442">It’s hard to understand it.</span> <span id="s443">How (inaudible –dare?)</span> <span id="s444">to understand it on an individual basis.</span> <span id="s445">How masses can do it, they simply caught up in mass, -not simply, but they caught up in a mass hysteria, and they just go with the flow.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">WH: Do you think that there’s anything that we can do...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s447">WH: Well, I don’t think that we are standing the likelihood of anything as great as the extermination of the Jews, however, the world wasn’t exactly, terribly sympathetic.</span> <span id="s448">In Angola, (inaudible) and other places in the world, in Ethiopia, in Uganda, and all the places where people were murdered for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s449">Whether it was their color, or whether there was a height, or whatever.</span> <span id="s450">Because they didn’t suit a dictator.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">WH: (...inaudible)...are most of your close friends survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">EE: Yeh.</span> <span id="s453">My closest friends are European and survivors...</span></p> <p><span id="s454">WH: Are they all relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">EE: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">WH: ...do you talk about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">EE: It usually comes up in some form or other.</span> <span id="s458">But not for lengthy conversations or anything of the kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">WH: (inaudible)...are you involved politically?</span> <span id="s460">...do you have strong view...?’</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EE: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">WH: What is most important to you?</span> <span id="s463">What interests you?</span> <span id="s464">...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">EE: ...there is no question my family’s the most important thing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">EE: ...did you take vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">EE: We used to go, for many years from the time my youngest was in kindergarten, almost until she graduated from high school, we used to go skiing every year.</span> <span id="s468">But that’s over with.</span> <span id="s469">Ten years ago, we bought a condo in Florida.</span> <span id="s470">So, we go primarily there...in Boca Raton.</span> <span id="s471">And other than that, we used to go to Israel a lot...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">WH: Are you a strongly identifying Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">EE: Oh, yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">WH: ...religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">EE: Religiously, I am identified religiously, I am not particularly observant, I’m a little -.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">WH: Are you an agnostic?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">EE: I don’t know if I’m exactly an agnostic either, but I’m not, as I said, I’m not particularly observant.</span> <span id="s478">I’m more identified emotionally, or feeling-wise, than with any kind of specific observance.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">WH: Are you ever sorry you didn’t move to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">EE: Am I sorry?</span> <span id="s481">I don’t know if I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s482">I never looked at it as being sorry.</span> <span id="s483">I know that for a long time I was very, very comfortable there.</span> <span id="s484">When I say, ‘for a long time,’ I am talking about visits.</span> <span id="s485">For a long time I always thought that we might retire there.</span> <span id="s486">Except that we didn’t think that we would retire.</span> <span id="s487">So it’s kind of (laughs) -.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">WH: What does your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">EE: He’s a radiologist.</span> <span id="s490">He was physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">WH: ...you thought that you’d retire, but of course, if your children are living here -.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">EE: No it’s not even –I never even looked at it in terms of my children are living here.</span> <span id="s493">I just kind of –as the years went by, I feel a certain distance between myself and my cousins which is a very –I have lots of cousins, maybe a dozen, okay?</span> <span id="s494">But I’m not friendly, I’m not close to all of them.</span> <span id="s495">Okay?</span> <span id="s496">Close to one, two, five, maybe six, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">WH: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">EE: No, in Israel.</span> <span id="s499">When I say I’m close, it’s the kind of closeness that we barely correspond.</span> <span id="s500">A letter is sitting here for months which I am eventually going to answer, but when we are together, the thread is very easily picked up and always going very well.</span> <span id="s501">Nevertheless, I feel a distance which I guess is age and circumstances, you know, like when we used to go everything was revolving around our visits when we were younger, and I guess (inaudible -?</span> <span id="s502">they?)</span> <span id="s503">had more energy and more recently when we used to go, which was occasionally (inaudible)...we went to a wedding, a cousin’s child’s wedding maybe two years ago.</span> <span id="s504">So everybody is busy with their own life, like here.</span> <span id="s505">And it kind of ends up we are spending an evening with the cousins, or two evenings with the cousins, and I lost the –ah, I guess the sense of family.</span> <span id="s506">The intensity of the family that I used to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">WH: How much of your time do you spend in your normal day in your practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EE: ...between 6 and 8 hours in general...it’s a full day.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">WH: Are you affiliated with a hospital too?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">EE: Yeh, I am affiliated with LIJ Hillside...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">WH: The motivations for why people committed the acts they did (inaudible) are psychological questions.</span> <span id="s512">Do you find that in your work, the people (inaudible)...do you find that having lived through what you lived through is helpful in any way in dealing with your patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">EE: It’s very hard to answer because I don’t really know how it could be if I hadn’t lived through it.</span> <span id="s514">And, does it give me more empathy, or can I really relate to depths of despair or anything like that?</span> <span id="s515">Yes, I can.</span> <span id="s516">But who says it has anything to do with having to survive the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s517">See, what happens, I never give any of my patients, and there were very, very few who somehow surmised by my accent, by my being European, by my age and so on, surmised that I had to be involved one way or another.</span> <span id="s518">Somehow.</span> <span id="s519">And, maybe in all these years, I would say, maybe 4,5 if they asked me directly, whether I was a Holocaust survivor, I would say, ‘Yes.’</span> <span id="s520">And first I did it very hesitantly because they have a reaction.</span> <span id="s521">Their reaction was, in general, ‘How can I possibly bore you with my little nonsense here, when you had that kind of suffering.’</span> <span id="s522">So I was very hesitant in admitting it, because I knew that it stops them.</span> <span id="s523">They say -.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">WH: You didn’t want to overwhelm them.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EE: And I didn’t want them to stop telling me about their ‘little suffering’ because it’s nothing compared to what I went through kind of thing.</span> <span id="s526">So it’s a very tricky thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">WH: Well, does it harden a person?</span> <span id="s528">...do you sometimes say to yourself, ‘Why is this person bothering me with this nonsense, if they only knew what I went through –they wouldn’t do that.’</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EE: No, no.</span> <span id="s530">That never -.</span> <span id="s531">I don’t see it as nonsense.</span> <span id="s532">I’m not going to tell you that I haven’t spent umpteen boring sessions where the topic for that particular session was ‘nonsense’ but these are suffering people.</span> <span id="s533">They’re not coming for fun.</span> <span id="s534">And they maybe not suffering today, but who knows tomorrow and certainly suffered plenty before they arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">WH: Well suffering is a relative matter, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">EE: Yes.</span> <span id="s537">Suffering is a relative matter and sometimes they will tell me ‘here I am talking about this nonsense where all these 14 people were just killed,’ or whatever, you know, or an earthquake, or –all that, and I’m busy with my thing that I got upset last night for this, that or the other thing.</span> <span id="s538">Well, if you’re looking at the individual, it’s the individual suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">WH: How about other psychiatrists.</span> <span id="s540">Do they know about your own experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">EE: Some do, some don’t.</span> <span id="s542">I would think that the majority know.</span> <span id="s543">Maybe they surmised again, but never mention it, or it doesn’t come up, but then again, if it does come up in anyway, there’s no question that I tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">WH: Well there are people in Great Neck...who are specialists in this area...(inaudible...)...Hillside -.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">EE: Hillside had, yes, had one of the studies that at the time annoyed me a lot, and I did, spoke up at the time because they were looking all at the pathology.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">WH: Can you tell me about that?</span> <span id="s547">About Dr. Finkelstein, that you spoke up about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">EE: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t recall the details, but basically they were (at Hillside) doing a study on in-patients who turned out to be Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">WH: What annoyed you about it, if we grant that people do have pathology?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">EE: What annoyed me about it that I feel that there’s a tremendous amount of emphasis on the negative on the pathology among the survivors and as I started telling you, besides when my husband said about ‘(inaudible)...you’re married.’</span> <span id="s552">But my point was, that a large amount of our friends and acquaintances are Holocaust survivors, Europeans, all doing very, very well without exception.</span> <span id="s553">Okay?</span> <span id="s554">And I’m not only talking about financially, but I’m talking academically, having achieved high positions and so on.</span> <span id="s555">The Israeli Universities are filled with –they were not my contemporaries, necessarily, but people from the Hebrew gymnasium, and they are all high achievers.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">WH: They are also doing well emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">EE: I presume that they are doing well emotionally to be able to be that productive.</span> <span id="s558">And I’m not going to tell you that some people are not high achievers and doing well intellectually and in their chosen profession are suffering emotionally, and having nightmares.</span> <span id="s559">That I’m not going to tell you.</span> <span id="s560">Or, that they may have had episodes of depression.</span> <span id="s561">I don’t know about all that.</span> <span id="s562">But if you are looking as a group -.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">WH: Did you ever think or consider working with survivors simply because it’s opposed to someone like (inaudible-Jvcovy?)</span> <span id="s564">...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">EE: I never really thought of it, of studying it in that sense, or shall I say surrounding myself with intensity of survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">WH: I’m asking because the opportunities were out there, everyone was talking about it, beginning of the ‘70’s, ‘80’s, everyone was writing about it.</span> <span id="s567">It seems to me, that you could have been chosen (inaudible)...and my subjective views enormous contribution to it, simply because you had both the professional and the inside perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EE: Number One, I am not a researcher, Number Two, I am not a writer.</span> <span id="s569">I’m a clinician.</span> <span id="s570">Okay?</span> <span id="s571">And, so I really didn’t -.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">WH: So you didn’t have that opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">EE: Sure, I could have teamed up with Judith Kestenberg or with Jvcovy, or I could have teamed up with somebody, but the impetus just wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s574">And, I don’t know really, if it had anything to do with old age, or call it advancing age, or the (inaudible -?</span> <span id="s575">fact) that the Holocaust really, in the ‘70’s were just beginning to emerge as a study as an issue it’s really much more up in the ‘80’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">WH: So there was no desire to avoid it.</span> <span id="s577">You didn’t feel it would be painful to delve into it -.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">EE: No.</span> <span id="s579">If anything on a casual conversation, I may have said to both of these people (re LIJ Hillside study) that, ‘look, if there is any place where you think I could fit in, call me,’ kind of thing, but I never went anything further than that.</span> <span id="s580">I think that both of these people do know that I’m a survivor.</span> <span id="s581">And, I –with Judith many years ago, I did have a lengthy interview with Jacoby it was just a very casual conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">WH: (inaudible...) if you had to give a message, a statement, or a set of statements to people, about how people learn to overcome tragedy, and despair, what would you tell them, based upon what you yourself went through, What advice would you give to a person –I don’t mean clinical, because you know (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s583">EE: You know, it’s very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s584">Because I can’t say that I have a specific motivation or a specific something that pulled me through.</span> <span id="s585">If anything, I would have to say it’s really not as the other organizations like they say, ‘day by day,’ but maybe hour by hour, okay?</span> <span id="s586">At time of stress.</span> <span id="s587">Or at times of danger , okay?</span> <span id="s588">Just look at this hour, see what you can do, the best in this hour and face the next one afterwards –roll with the punches.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">WH: You have to will yourself to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">EE: Yes, you have to will yourself.</span> <span id="s591">This is what I have to do now.</span> <span id="s592">And where is it going to lead.</span> <span id="s593">I don’t know, but you have to deal with this situation right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">WH: Well it’s great advice, but you have to be strong enough to follow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">EE: Oh, -no question about it.</span> <span id="s596">I’m not saying that it’s easy.</span> <span id="s597">But you are asking me a hypothetically question.</span> <span id="s598">But in general, I do think I deal more with the reality, with the here and now, than with planning for futures -.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">WH: ...I want to find out what it was as a group that gave the survivors the strength to learn to live again, to hope again, to love again, to trust again, after all the terrible things that they went through.</span> <span id="s600">That was the question that I started this book with.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">EE: Well I think probably, in a very broad sense, right after the war, in 1945, it was really a matter of clinging together.</span> <span id="s602">And I don’t know how many people, I mean they got married one, two, three, because they found another human being to hold hands with, or to go to bed with, or whatever.</span> <span id="s603">I don’t know how many people at that point consciously planned, or didn’t plan children.</span> <span id="s604">It may have been an unconscious need to have children immediately to form a family again.</span> <span id="s605">But I don’t know whether it was conscious thinking, or really an emotional need to share, and to be with somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">WH: And that was a need that had been suppressed because they didn’t have an outlet for so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">EE: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">WH: You couldn’t trust people in the camps as a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EE: Uh, uh, (yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s610">WH: ...the survivors have a higher birth rate than the average Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">EE: I suspected that.</span> <span id="s612">And I’m sure that there is some unconscious, something, -motivation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">WH: ...some people who –supposed experts, told me that they started out with the idea that maybe the survivors didn’t want children because they said that, ‘The world was too terrible a place to bring people into.’</span> <span id="s614">But lo and behold!</span> <span id="s615">It didn’t happen that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">EE: Because they probably wanted to reconstitute –I mean, we were 4 children by design.</span> <span id="s617">And, -not because I had any particular conscious number -.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">End of Tape #1, Side B.</span></p>
