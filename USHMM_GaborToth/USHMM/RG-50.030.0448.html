stated November 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What was the make up of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born into a middle to upper class family.</span> <span id="s18">My father was a political activist, he was a journalist.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was running a Textile distribution business.</span> <span id="s20">I had an older brother, we were a very well to do happy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What are the the names of your family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My fathers name was Benjamin, my mothers name was Sara, my brothers name was Joshua.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Do you have any memories of living in Hindenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I memories of Hindenberg are practically zero.</span> <span id="s25">I don’t remember the city at all.</span> <span id="s26">My father being a political activist was persecuted much earlier than the general Jewish population.</span> <span id="s27">He was constantly in hiding and at certain times they would storm the house and take him away for short periods of time.</span> <span id="s28">So they decided to escape Germany and go to Poland and that was Eastern Poland where my mothers family lived and also my fathers family resided in the same city.</span> <span id="s29">My mother’s family owned a textile mill and they were distributors for textiles as well as had the retail store.</span> <span id="s30">My recollection of that plays a very vivid they were very happy days even for the fact we were displaced from our home.</span> <span id="s31">My grandparents and the siblings of my mothers and father were living in a very large home, within that there were like apartments where my aunts and uncles were living and I had a lot of cousins.</span> <span id="s32">We used to play together.</span> <span id="s33">Early restrictions were started to impose upon us as the Germans were storming Poland, but relatively it was a happy time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Let me just ask you a little bit about the happy or happier times and where exactly where you do you know where this was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: The city was small the name was Shotcouf and we were living on the out skirts of that city and the place was called Yelganetza.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: So before there were to many restrictions were you was your family practicing religious traditions and customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My family was conservative, we adhered to all the holidays.</span> <span id="s38">My parents were going occasionally to the Synagogue on Saturday and they were considered quote unquote a cultural family.</span> <span id="s39">I learned Hebrew, I love the Hebrew songs and music and in general I was raised in the Jewish traditional life and I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Were you mostly around other Jews at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No not not specifically because my family was waiting with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s42">So I used to play a lot with all kinds of children of different faiths and when the restrictions were imposed upon us the mere fact that I couldn’t play with the non-Jewish children made a big impact upon me.</span> <span id="s43">I do remember wanting to play with a certain child that I like very much and prior to the war we were very good friends and as I approached her one day the mother pulled that little girl away she said “Oh no you can’t play with her any more she is no good she is a Jew”, and the little girl said “What is a Jew, she is my friend”, and that thats when I really started feeling different.</span> <span id="s44">It was also the fact that I couldn’t play on the play ground that mainly our activities were restricted to our house, with my coursins being in the same situation it made me already feel that some thing bad is coming upon us.</span> <span id="s45">We used to play down in the celler in the dark places, mainly inside the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Do you have an image of how old you were at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I would, think five, five years, five, six years like at an age preschool age where you know were jump, hop scotching and playing those type of games.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you were able to play for a while before everything was really disrupted and even though the war had already started?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, I real yes, I, we were relatively off, better off than other families because of the fact of a although all the goods were confiscated and a business was removed and given away to non-Jewish citizens my grandparents and parents were able to still hide some of the goods and that way they kept up secret trades with the a farmers in the villages and the obtain food, in order to obtain food so were were not initially totally starving.</span> <span id="s50">I remember we used to disguise ourselves a wearing shawls and peasant cloths and at night to to the villages and carry these good in exchange for food and many times these farmers would take there goods and not give us the farmers food and we would come back empty handed.</span> <span id="s51">But I used to look forward to going on these excursions it was an adventure and for a child it was a mysteries way of sneaking through the dark streets in the evening in a disguise away.</span> <span id="s52">This was going on for a short period of time until a they were posting all kinds of curfews and threatening with being killed if we left certain time.</span> <span id="s53">The wearing the white bands with blue star and it became much more restrictive.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did all of your normal daily life activities then become disrupted?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, that when when gradually gradually newer restrictions were announced and I remember still the sound the drums where at a city employee would come out and run to a square city square and listen to the announcements.</span> <span id="s56">What we can do and what we can not do and all the restrictions and so on so.</span> <span id="s57">It it it became gradually more difficult to live, also big impact on us when they started bringing Jews from different countries like Hungry.</span> <span id="s58">Suddenly they brought hundreds of Jews and into the synagog where they camped out there and these people were poorly malnourished.</span> <span id="s59">They have no food they have no clothing they have to leave suddenly, and thats when we realized that a actually there is a war and that we are going to be involved, by probably being displaced also.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Where you frightened at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I was I, can not describe the feeling of a child the because I just experienced these restrictions as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s62">This is what it is you can’t go to school, you can’t play, you can’t you don’t have much food, you can’t go outside on certain days.</span> <span id="s63">You the windows have to be shut, the doors have to be shut.</span> <span id="s64">We we each member of the family was assigned to sit guard behind the window.</span> <span id="s65">Lets say 12 hours a day there was a exchange each member was taking a turn and there was fear.</span> <span id="s66">There was anxiety and there was an air of uncertainty.</span> <span id="s67">You didn’t know what tomorrow might bring.</span> <span id="s68">It it it was a kind of a day to day life, moment to moment really.</span> <span id="s69">Along with restrictions I know they form a Unionrod which was a collection of elders and my my uncle was part of that.</span> <span id="s70">Unionrod and through him we were learning some of the horrors that were going on in the larger cities not to distant from us.</span> <span id="s71">There was our only connection to the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What did your parents tell you or what did they try to explain to you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: They didn’t, they did not tell me much.</span> <span id="s74">I used to hear, stories of the old good days when the Kaiser was alive.</span> <span id="s75">World war one and the excitement then they the excitement adventures of wars and I kind of thought that was a really neat thing to be able to wonder from country to country and a see soldiers fighting and so on.</span> <span id="s76">And so I imagined that to be the same way.</span> <span id="s77">Little did I know that this war was going to be directed against me.</span> <span id="s78">My image of a war was soldiers against soldiers not soldiers against children.</span> <span id="s79">We really were not, as children we were not prepared for anything realistic the adults probably knew and I used to hear them talk about killings and death and so on but, as children we did not know what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Did you hear anything about Hitler specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Oh, yes that was mentioned a lot and I remember the adults talking why doesn’t Roosevelt do something about it.</span> <span id="s82">And more why doesn’t the world organize against Hitler and why don’t they try to to to help us to get out of this misery here.</span> <span id="s83">But thats as far as I could understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Where you living in a getto in Chorkof, or you were always outside the town of Chorkof?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: We were living outside Chorkof at at only for a brief period of time.</span> <span id="s86">What happened was that soon after they formed the Unionrod we heard of Acktunin an action being a a being performed in all cities around us.</span> <span id="s87">Well one day my uncle came running from that Unionrod screaming at us to disberse something terrible is going to happen.</span> <span id="s88">He didn’t know what but nothing good and to run away, just get out of the house I don’t want to see you.</span> <span id="s89">That was the beginning of the extermination of our town.</span> <span id="s90">I remember my mother grabbed me she said “Lets go lets run”, some of the other members ran down the we had a very big celler and they ran down there and my mother grabbed me and said “Lets go.”</span> <span id="s91">So we went outside of the city falling on our floor until we reached some farm farmers houses we heard shots very soon, very near by we hid in stacks of hay from house to house and the shots were coming closer and closer , we knew we had to move fast, we could only move at night or in the dark.</span> <span id="s92">We crawled to house until we started hearing voices, these were Jewish members of the city carring dead bodies to a near by cemetery.</span> <span id="s93">We kept on moving farther and farther away until the lamenting shots became much more distant and pretty soon quieted down.</span> <span id="s94">We stayed in a hay stack at a farmers house over night.</span> <span id="s95">The space was so small and so tight, that I remember laying there over night doubled over until early morning when the farmers left for the fields.</span> <span id="s96">We crawled out of there and the bright day light really blinded us and we stretched out and was pretty quite and peaceful and then we decided to move back to watch the town.</span> <span id="s97">We came back and a deadly silence greeted us there was blood and dead bodies in the street.</span> <span id="s98">And we came back to our house and the house was totally ransacked the windows were broken, there was nobody there, we sat on the floor.</span> <span id="s99">Pretty soon some members emerged from the celler and they were telling us how the Germans were searching homes and killing people and lucky they didn’t discover them in the celler.</span> <span id="s100">My father who used to be in hiding all the time escaped last minute and hid in a village.</span> <span id="s101">And then when he returned, upon his return he was sure that we were all killed.</span> <span id="s102">My uncle who was in the Unionrod was a witness to all these killings and death.</span> <span id="s103">At that time my brother who a was not a direct member of the Unionrod, but my uncle use to keep around him there because he thought it a much safer place.</span> <span id="s104">Was taken from the Unionrod and he was made to gather all the dead bodies into the villages square and then he was lined up and taken away with the transport.</span> <span id="s105">Later on some of the farmers was telling us they stood and watched and they saw the Jews marching towards the railway station and they saw my brother along side my grandfather march along without a speigel to their death.</span> <span id="s106">My uncle described the scene when they lined them up he was pointing with his sad eyes towards him like making a gester rescue me, get me out of this line, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s107">One of the Jewish elders tried to pull away a little girl out of the line, his own litle daughter, and he was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s108">After that and a few other action occured, they wiped out the total town.</span> <span id="s109">The few left over people and among them we were part of the left over population was transported to a city called Lutrouch.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: I just want to ask you a little bit more about your brother, can you tell me what kind of relationship you had had with him before he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: My brother was older than I quite a few years I don’t know totally how many for sure like five and I always looked up to him, he was like my God.</span> <span id="s112">For a child I used to love to brush his cloths and shine his shoes, looking for his approval and he was joining always organizations like Shamar Zier, and I always love when he took me by his hand, took me to these meetings.</span> <span id="s113">I remember Saturdays when he took me there, there was always singing going on and he was a very good student and in school and he used to tutor other children and I always go along with him and he play the violin and I always hope that some day I would, it was a very close relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: How did you react to hearing that he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I was totally devastated, I kind of refused to believe he’s really dead.</span> <span id="s116">I always have the image that he escaped somewhere from a train.</span> <span id="s117">I went into total isolation, I did not speak to anybody, I wore black cloths.</span> <span id="s118">As a child I associated that already with black cloths, I wouldn’t eat, I just totally went into morning more than any adult.</span> <span id="s119">It was a devastating experience for me and I totally refused to acknowledge that he’s not there.</span> <span id="s120">I remember even some how get a hold of a piece of chocolate, I don’t know how it ever came to my hands, I refuse to eat it I was saving it when he comes back for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you think that hearing about him being killed, made you more afraid at that time.</span> <span id="s122">Did that change any of your feelings about the war and the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I really didn’t hear that he was killed.</span> <span id="s124">I knew that “They were taken away to camps.”</span> <span id="s125">And the adults knew that there was no return from those camps, but I as a child refused to believe that.</span> <span id="s126">My image was always that he escaped and he will come back.</span> <span id="s127">As far as fear I personally, I can not describe the feelings of fear.</span> <span id="s128">It was a life of living from moment to moment and I I I just have never had that feeling of fear.</span> <span id="s129">I felt that I have to meet what comes and any challenge that will come I should surmount it.</span> <span id="s130">It is amazing to me that as a child during those times before this action and this devastating action that took place, my main concern and regret was I couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s131">I couldn’t play, I couldn’t go to nursery school that was my main depravation I experienced during those years.</span> <span id="s132">Not so much food lack of food or lack of cloths it was more lack of freedom, lack of playing of interaction of other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Had you gone to school at all by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I had gone to a little nursery school, which I remember just a play school.</span> <span id="s135">As far as learning to read, I was all taught by osmoses, my father used to read to me because he was in hiding I would go down in the cellar.</span> <span id="s136">He would read to me, he would sing songs to me, tried to teach me Russian.</span> <span id="s137">That was my main education was underground education.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What languages were you speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I was speaking German and Polish not as fluent and then my father taught me Russian, and some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s140">Ya I remember he taught me also Hebrew songs, poetry and Russian poetry, he read me instead of children stories, he read me stories tell stories Thats what I grew up upon, war and crime and that kind of thing, and not Cinderella stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: When you were near this town Shortkof, did you experience any contact with Germans or did you experience any anti Semitism yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Oh yes, yes very much so, even as a child I knew I was different, even at nursery school.</span> <span id="s143">There was a time “Religion” and we as Jews would not, as Jewish children would not go, that hour we had to stay out and that by itself made us feel different and bad.</span> <span id="s144">I personally was treated a little bit better and I don’t understand why maybe because my family was more influential.</span> <span id="s145">In the area I was well known but I used to hear all the time Shid Shid, which in Polish is Jew and I felt a different treatment by the teachers, I definitely saw that I more rejoiced in fact in the Hebrew language and the Hebrew spirit and didn’t dwell much of the other side of the a being maltreated as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did you ever go to your parents and ask them about being called a Jew in that way, in that derogatory way?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I just absorbed it, I didn’t, I didn’t ask questions.</span> <span id="s148">I learned it on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you have friends and were they always Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No and that thats when I started feeling that there was different, I had Jewish and non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s151">I had a lot of friends and I was a leader.</span> <span id="s152">When we were playing I was always the leader and I started feeling this difference by the non-Jewish friends turning against me, and I even remember the farmers or the villagers used to come to take some of the goods from us and some of the children would come along.</span> <span id="s153">Later on those children would turn away and wouldn’t speak to me, gee why you come to take all of our goods and you still dispise us and don’t like us.</span> <span id="s154">One of these little girls said “Because your Jew and no good”, I did feel that badly but I had to make it out on my own and understand it on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: You were starting to that you were then taken to a ghetto in Bochoch?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We were ordered to within four hours to leave the town, take what you can in your hands and out.</span> <span id="s157">I think we were taken into a horse and wagons and driven to we didn’t know where we were going and after some hours we arrived at this town was a very depressing place.</span> <span id="s158">I remember coming in a wagon there were cobble stone streets was no lights, houses were dark the streets were filthy and smelling, gray cobble stone and we were taken to a house, which was like a two story house, there were some inhabitants there already.</span> <span id="s159">There was a dark corridor there were a few rooms assigned to families, there were like eight to 14 people to a room and there was like a communal type of a life.</span> <span id="s160">There was a two story house there was only one bathroom on the lower floor and I remember the lines they used to be lined up for that bathroom.</span> <span id="s161">I was always thought gee what if someone was constipated and got stuck there and all these people still waiting in line.</span> <span id="s162">In a way it wasn’t totally totally a destructive life there because we lived together because there were some children from different families that we interacted right away.</span> <span id="s163">Except now we started to experience food shortage and much more limited freedom of movement.</span> <span id="s164">We were not allowed to leave that house, toward evening one member of a room snuck out and brought back some food.</span> <span id="s165">I remember that there was like a black market and my father did not look Jewish at all and he would be the one to leave the house and venture out, he grew a beard and mustache and looked very much Aryan.</span> <span id="s166">And he would come back and bring food.</span> <span id="s167">Many a time we didn’t know if he was going to come back because he could have been caught.</span> <span id="s168">I still remember specifically in those times members were appointed to sit guard, and I was a little bit older and I was to sit with an adult, looking out through the crack in the window, which was totally covered with a sheets, looking out across the street was the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s169">And I used to children walk and children play and I just couldn’t imagine through a children’s eye what it would be for me to be able to go across there and just walk.</span> <span id="s170">Thats when I really started to experience [end of side one, tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Would you continue to tell me a little bit about your experiences shortly after you were in the ghetto and how it felt for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: By being thrown into that open ghetto, I, and being totally limited to a certain place, while looking out the window and seeing the other side across the street, which was the Aryan side and seeing people walk freely and children playing and I was totally isolated and deprived of the sun and the moon.</span> <span id="s173">I started to understand what it meant to be a Jew under the Nazi regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Were you worried for your life or for your family's lives at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: At that time we, I specifically, became aware that life is very finite and we actually are in danger of losing our lives in the days or weeks to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: How old do you think you were at the time, what, what's your image of yourself at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: My, I cannot specify my age but my image of, was that of a 10 year old, going on 25, very serious about life and death.</span> <span id="s178">I saw my grandmother die and she died a natural death on the bed and we, in our home nobody spoke about death.</span> <span id="s179">I remember that night, the children were placed in one room only, I guess to protect us from the visual image of a person actually dying and taking the last breath.</span> <span id="s180">And the adults and the children, the, my mother's brothers and sisters gathered that night around the bed and we heard the heavy breathing of my grandmother, but we didn't say anything, we just lay there motionless and I cannot speak for what the others heard, but I still remember now, it becomes so vivid in my mind, the way she was really gasping for the last breath and I remember my father, who was her son-in-law, asking for forgiveness and I remember her asking, "Why, you didn't do anything wrong, I have nothing to forgive you."</span> <span id="s181">It's the first time that I really speak of that.</span> <span id="s182">And I remember as a child hearing that.</span> <span id="s183">Nobody spoke anything about it and the following day, naturally it couldn't be funeral, but I remember my uncle, her son and some other men from the house were carrying her body wrapped in a white sheet.</span> <span id="s184">I did not know, we were not told where they were going and what they are going to do with the body and we never knew whether they were going to come back alive because they had to leave the compound.</span> <span id="s185">This was the first time that I spoke about it.</span> <span id="s186">Life went on, very restricted, if you can call it life.</span> <span id="s187">My father came to realize that it's time to do something about survival and his features were not Jewish and he grew a mustache and he looked totally Aryan, so he used to escape out of this restricted compound to venture on the outside and as I mentioned, to bring us food.</span> <span id="s188">One day he took the freedom of leaving for a day and wandered into a village and it was Easter day, Easter morning.</span> <span id="s189">While wandering through this village and trying to get some food, he started to be suspected as a Jew.</span> <span id="s190">At least he was a foreigner there, nobody knew him, said, "What are you doing here, something suspicious about you."</span> <span id="s191">So he started running to different areas, where he found himself on Easter morning in front of a church.</span> <span id="s192">The members of the church were let out after the Easter sunrise ceremony and he was so deep in pain and so much alone, that his heart started crying and he started singing Ailee, ailee(ph), the song from Yom Kippur services, with a loud, strong voice.</span> <span id="s193">He used to love to sing.</span> <span id="s194">The Christians walked out and started asking, "Who are you and why are you singing here, why didn't you go inside?"</span> <span id="s195">And he started saying, "My voice sounds better on the outside and didn't you hear the priest sing that?"</span> <span id="s196">And these people stood around and listening to his singing and then walking away, nodding their heads.</span> <span id="s197">It was ironic that he was a Jew, hiding his identity, singing a, a holy Jewish song in front of a Christian audience.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: When he came back and told you about that incident, was he very worried about going out again?</span> <span id="s199">Were you very worried about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We were worried, but we couldn't sit and philosophically worry.</span> <span id="s201">By being on the outside, he was more in touch with reality.</span> <span id="s202">He picked up messages, he knew that the war is coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s203">And when he returned from the outside, he knew that something has to be done and started to organize the men in the compound to build bunkers, hiding places.</span> <span id="s204">So, immediate action was taken to build bunkers within the big house or compound.</span> <span id="s205">They organized and searched the house and the ground and finally they found what they thought was a great tunnel under the house and constructed a rock that blocked off a certain area.</span> <span id="s206">And that was deep tunnel leading to nowhere, that's what they thought and for days they were digging and constructing that bunker.</span> <span id="s207">At the same place they built some alternate places, hiding places.</span> <span id="s208">One day, very soon, the guard, quote unquote, the guard, was sitting in front of the windows spotted some activity going on on the street with German soldiers popping out on the corners.</span> <span id="s209">The signal was given for us to run to the bunker.</span> <span id="s210">It was amazing that prior to that we used to practice every day, how fast we, it has to take for us to run down the stairs and climb up those rocks and one elder was standing and timing us.</span> <span id="s211">Well, time came to hide and we started hearing shots.</span> <span id="s212">People became panicky and one was climbing up on the other too fast, enter that bunker and moved the rocks.</span> <span id="s213">I remember there were sick people on the second floor and nobody could carry them down, cause everybody was running towards the bunker and they were left in their beds.</span> <span id="s214">The place was very small and the people were crowded together, there was nowhere to move, you couldn't breathe.</span> <span id="s215">But unfortunately it didn't last long, pretty soon we heard, started hearing shots and German voices shouting rousse(ph), rousse(ph), which meant get out, get out.</span> <span id="s216">We couldn't believe that they discovered us so soon, we were so convinced that this was such a safe bunker.</span> <span id="s217">What it turned out to be is that the tunnel was leading across the street underground, below some of the stores on the Aryan side and there was the barber shop and when we were digging that tunnel, they used to hear the voices of the Jewish people building that bunker and as soon as this action started, the barber right away notified the Germans and the Polish militia, that there were Jews hiding right underneath and they came straight, without having to search long.</span> <span id="s218">They found the rock, they opened the rock and urged us to come out, but nobody would move, so they started shooting into the bunker and throwing some gas rockets, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s219">People started to move back, towards the wall, there was screaming of children, people bleeding from these wounds inflicted upon them by the shots.</span> <span id="s220">There were a few sick people laying right near the entrance, they were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s221">And I remember pulling my mom and my dad and said, "Let's go."</span> <span id="s222">And even at that moment, I was thinking of my brother and I said, "Let's go, we'll join now Joshua."</span> <span id="s223">On the way out they were beating everybody with clubs.</span> <span id="s224">People became disoriented.</span> <span id="s225">There was blood running through their faces.</span> <span id="s226">They were lined, these soldiers were lined out along the corridor, lining up the people and beating them at the same time, so they will be, came so helpless and disoriented and did not offer any resistance.</span> <span id="s227">Any resistance would have been met with a bullet anyhow, so there was no point.</span> <span id="s228">I remember spotting my uncle, standing there and his blood was dripping from his head and we could not do anything and we were ready to go.</span> <span id="s229">I stood with my parents and I spotted a door and I tried the door and it cracked opened and I pulled my mother and she says, "Why are you pulling me?"</span> <span id="s230">I said, I pointed with my finger, with my thumb, "Go over there, go over."</span> <span id="s231">And then I pulled my father and then I, I pulled them in and we went up the stairs, we went up the stairs and there were bodies laying up there on the bed, with the blood dripping down and went into a room and each of us hid under the bed in a puddle of blood.</span> <span id="s232">And then we heard the lamenting voices from downstairs and pretty soon it became more quiet.</span> <span id="s233">Suddenly we heard footsteps running up the stairs and a voice saying in Polish, "I saw you running up there, I know you are hiding.</span> <span id="s234">Stay under the bed until it becomes quiet and then go down and hide again."</span> <span id="s235">And he disappeared.</span> <span id="s236">As it became quiet we emerged from under the beds and we went into a different hiding that my father constructed.</span> <span id="s237">It was located on top of a toilet which pretended to be like a ceiling.</span> <span id="s238">Pretty soon the Germans and the Polish militia returned with some other citizens, to remove the dead bodies and to do a last minute search.</span> <span id="s239">They entered the toilet room where we were hiding and instead of looking up, they looked down and there was a child that fell through the toilet seat, it was a constructed toilet, not like we have here and this child was deep in feces and the soldiers were standing there and laughing and one said, "Don't waste a bullet, she'll drown in the feces anyhow, " and walked away.</span> <span id="s240">We remained breathless up on top, until all the bodies were removed and the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s241">Later we emerged from our hiding and there were a few other people that survived in that same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Who had you been living with first of all, in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: My parents, my mother's family and my father's brothers and there were people from other parts of different, other parts of cities and different villages that were brought there, into that compound.</span> <span id="s244">It wasn't a really compound of many houses, it was one huge house.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: How many people were living in the one house with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: There were like, total I think there were 120 and about, I think the majority, I think 90 percent were wiped out, killed off during that one actione(ph).</span> <span id="s247">I remember as it quieted down, these people were marched out, the outside of the city, but not too far away and there was a mass grave being dug by some of the militia people, and all our families, there was, _____, the other people from that compound and other compounds in the ghetto, were shot into that mass grave.</span> <span id="s248">That's where most of our family was killed.</span> <span id="s249">There were only four members, out of about a total of 45 or 50 family members remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Who were the ones surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Surviving was myself and my parents and one of my uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Had you seen dead bodies like that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Never, no.</span> <span id="s254">No, only I heard it from description.</span> <span id="s255">When they had the first actione(ph) in our little city _____, but I've never been in a trapped bunker.</span> <span id="s256">I've never seen people falling right in front of me, shot to death.</span> <span id="s257">I've never seen people laying in bed with the blood dripping down on me.</span> <span id="s258">This was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s259">But even during that experience, I did not lose my strength and will to survive.</span> <span id="s260">Because it was this little girl that really saved her parents, by being alert enough to recognize and realize that this door was an opening to a life or to at least an escape for this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: What did you do immediately after this actione(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, as we were lucky enough to escape the second time in that toilet, hiding, we stayed in that house for a day or two until everything quieted down and pretty soon [pause], we remained in the house, all the four of us, wondering what's going to happen next.</span> <span id="s263">We did not remain for long alone.</span> <span id="s264">Few days after this total destruction, new transports were coming in from nearby cities and villages.</span> <span id="s265">These were new resettlers.</span> <span id="s266">The house was filled again with Jews from all over the area.</span> <span id="s267">Some urban, some rural, people that had only in common by being persecuted by the Nazis because of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s268">They came from all walks of life.</span> <span id="s269">We befriended one family that was a farming, a Jew from a farm that had a little girl my age and we became friends.</span> <span id="s270">My father, being again mobile and circling around the non-Jewish quarters, was aware that the war is coming to an end and this is a time, a final action that they final solution of the Jewish question is in sight.</span> <span id="s271">And his only way of escape would be to do it now, otherwise we are doomed to die.</span> <span id="s272">We were lucky enough that we were able to save gold and silver coins that we carried in our clothing, hidden in seams.</span> <span id="s273">And my father approached this, befriended a family, his name was Abraham and told them that he would offer him money in order for both of the families to escape.</span> <span id="s274">His idea was, because Abraham knew all these farmers and had such great faith in his village, that he would send Abraham to find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s275">The plan was to divide our families so that in case somebody's killed, one member at least, will remain.</span> <span id="s276">Abraham went back to the farm and was to come up with three hiding places.</span> <span id="s277">He left, but we never knew whether he would return or not.</span> <span id="s278">After some time he did return and announce that he found a place and the children would go first.</span> <span id="s279">Thus it was decided that I and his little girl would follow him.</span> <span id="s280">The eve of one day, we were to follow Abraham through fields and paths, through forests, moving forward through the night and hiding in the fields during the day, in order not to be spotted by farming people in the fields.</span> <span id="s281">We crawled on our four, until Abraham decided that he was going to venture out and find a farming house and we stayed in the fields until he returns.</span> <span id="s282">The two little girls remained laying there, waiting for Abraham to return.</span> <span id="s283">It took days til he returned and announced that he found a place, we ought to follow him and just run into a barn, in towards the evening, without telling anybody or speaking to anybody.</span> <span id="s284">That night he let us into a barn, we climbed up on a high stack of hay and Abraham said goodbye to us and left us there.</span> <span id="s285">And if, if we only knew that we are in a barn, but we had no concept where we were, we had no image whether this was a city, a village, a town, a farmer's house.</span> <span id="s286">We had no concept what's on the outside.</span> <span id="s287">We could only tell day from night by the sound of the environment, like the crack of the dawn, the rooster, the rooster would crow, or towards the evening the farmers would return from the fields.</span> <span id="s288">The only other being was the horse in the barn and we knew day from night when the horse would return from work in the field.</span> <span id="s289">And the morning when the farmer would come and feed the horse and get him ready to go to the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What did you bring with you when you left the ghetto to go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: We brought nothing.</span> <span id="s292">We could not carry anything, we had to crawl on our feet and hands and we certainly could not carry anything.</span> <span id="s293">We remained laying on top of that high stack of hay, which was piled up, up to the roof of the barn.</span> <span id="s294">Our food consisted of a morning ration of water and a piece of dry bread.</span> <span id="s295">The farmer would bring the water, a bucket of water to feed the horse and out of that he poured some for us.</span> <span id="s296">He had a hiding place for the ladder and he would quickly assemble the ladder and with a sound, with a signal of a cough, he would approach the haystack and quickly place the, some water and a piece of bread and immediately descend.</span> <span id="s297">This repeated itself at night.</span> <span id="s298">The only change of meal was on a holiday or a Sunday, where instead of water, we would get some milk.</span> <span id="s299">We could hear the children outside playing in the yard and we were never sure whether they were going to run into the barn and play, although the farmer made sure that the ladder is not in sight.</span> <span id="s300">The only companion was the horse.</span> <span id="s301">We laid stretched out on the, on top of that haystack, two little girls, covered under a blanket that blended in with the hay, not speaking to each other in order to conserve energy.</span> <span id="s302">We could not stand up, there was room only to sit or lay and thus was our days going, flowing in from day to day.</span> <span id="s303">We could not tell time, we could not tell season, we just existed up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How long do you think you were in hiding in that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s306">I really can't.</span> <span id="s307">I don't know if it was months, or more than a month, or weeks, no concept.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you think about your parents a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: We were, but we had other things that were happening.</span> <span id="s310">We were both alternating at night to retrieve our food, by crawling forward towards the haystack and one night I, it was my turn to do so and I reached out for the bucket and reached too far and by holding the piece of bread, tumbling over and falling off that big haystack.</span> <span id="s311">The horse, hearing that noise, got up and made a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s312">I laid there and cold, bleeding, the floor was cement.</span> <span id="s313">Lisa, my friend up there could not help me, we could not speak, not make noise.</span> <span id="s314">The farmer came in and saw me laying there and did not say anything, just walked out again, in order not to arouse suspicion.</span> <span id="s315">We, I wondered what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s316">I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s317">The following day the farmer came back and placed a ladder, motioning for me to climb back up.</span> <span id="s318">I was too much in pain that I couldn't move, he'd finally found some kind of harness that placed me in it and pulled my up and thus returned me to the top of the hiding place.</span> <span id="s319">After that he let Abraham know that he wants us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Can I ask you a few questions about being in hiding?</span> <span id="s321">You said that you didn't want to arouse suspicion by talking, but did you ever talk with your friend who you were right next to, all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Not, I don't remember any talking going on between us at all, we were just laying quietly, I guess sharing each other's pain and dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What were you dreaming about?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Someday, I remember dreaming of having, imagining a bowl of soup and a matzo ball floating on it and that's justifying swallowing that dry piece of bread and water.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Were you thinking a lot about food?</span> <span id="s326">What else were you thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: At that time, I think most of the time we were, I was just imagining a hot meal.</span> <span id="s328">I could not think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What about being around the horse, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: The horse became our savior and our guardian angel.</span> <span id="s331">We were always, I was always wondering whether he understood, they knew what was going on, but in certain ways he protected us from being thrown out of the barn.</span> <span id="s332">He formed a shield that night when I fell off and I was sure that the farmer was going to throw me out that night, just throw me into the fields and the horse gathered some hay around me, laid down, embraced me half-circle and I laid down on top of him, feeling the warmth of his body and, and the warm breath and the soft, friendly eyes, as if he were saying, "I'm not going to let you die."</span> <span id="s333">And he refused to eat and drink until the farmer would place me back on the haystack and leave us some food, and only then he drank his portion.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">End of tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick, conducted by Amy Rubin, on November 25th, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s337">This is tape two, side A. Would you continue telling me a little bit about the relationship you had with the horse in this barn including the name.</span> <span id="s338">Did you give the horse a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Answer: No, we did not.</span> <span id="s340">We did not and we didn’t, we never spoke to the horse, was the farmer used to, the time when he placed our ration up on the barn, he used to use his conversation with the horse as a disguise for the noise that he was making placing the ladder back and forth.</span> <span id="s341">But we just exchanged glances at each other and the, the eyes, they were so sympathetic and so soft and so warm towards us.</span> <span id="s342">We knew that we had a friend in that horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: The farmer was not Jewish, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s345">The farmer was not Jewish and oddly enough, in all these days when he was bringing us the food, the exchange was so swift and fast that we never saw the face of the, of, we never saw his face.</span> <span id="s346">We just used to see a hand stretching out, placing that food, that piece of bread and water and just retrieve right away.</span> <span id="s347">There was never an exchange of words between us.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did you feel that he was nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: It was like a mysterious kind of figure that was representing this man that never spoke to us yet must have been sympathetic and warm by doing this, endangering his own life and scheming all these activities, hiding it from his children.</span> <span id="s350">His wife was a, a, a companion and planned it along with him but every time he had to embark upon this bringing the food to us, it had to be planned out.</span> <span id="s351">The moment had to be seized just at the right time when no neighbor would spot him, when no child would, would miss him.</span> <span id="s352">It was a constant awareness of danger and way of protecting us and yet at the same time, not, also protecting his own family.</span> <span id="s353">The danger was that if he, if we would be discovered there, his own well-being would be in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Were you scared a lot of the time being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: I, I cannot describe it as being scared but it was, we were always on guard.</span> <span id="s356">We knew that it’s only, it would take only one moment to be discovered either by a child or by a neighbor, by somebody walking into the barn and suspecting something.</span> <span id="s357">And as a matter of fact, that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s358">Through some mysterious way, the farmer, not beknown to us or to himself became a suspect of hiding, quote unquote, hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s359">One day when he was out in the field working, we suddenly heard some suspicious sounds, loud sounds of militia approaching the barn.</span> <span id="s360">Within a moment or two, we realized that this is danger lurking right behind the barn and what do we do?</span> <span id="s361">With a glance at each other we knew that we have to escape and how do you escape?</span> <span id="s362">There’s no ladder and we are way up high there and those voices are coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s363">We jumped off that big high haystack and by some miracle we got up from that cold stone floor and ran through half-open door and behind another haystack and the yard and then into the wide fields.</span> <span id="s364">Just in that moment as we went through that yard, the militia was approaching the gate and entered the barn.</span> <span id="s365">There was loud noises and singing and voices of joy assuming that they are gonna catch us.</span> <span id="s366">Well we were right behind.</span> <span id="s367">They ran into the farmer’s house, ransacked his house and did not find us.</span> <span id="s368">We in turn laid in the field.</span> <span id="s369">It was broad daylight and the sun was piercing through the high cornfields.</span> <span id="s370">We laid there until the evening approach, approached.</span> <span id="s371">We’re afraid to go too far away from the village, yet by staying too close, we were in danger of being discovered.</span> <span id="s372">Now, and by going too far we’d have, we would have lost our way back to the same house.</span> <span id="s373">That night we moved back and ran back into that barn.</span> <span id="s374">There was no ladder so we couldn’t climb up so we just laid there on the floor.</span> <span id="s375">The farmer suspected that we would return and came in at night into the barn and found us there.</span> <span id="s376">He mumbled something and then place the ladder and we climbed up.</span> <span id="s377">However, he was not too happy because next morning no food was delivered to us.</span> <span id="s378">That following night, Abram heard in his hiding place that, that farmer’s house was ransacked and he was sure that we got caught and killed.</span> <span id="s379">And he came to find bodies in that barn.</span> <span id="s380">He came and sat there at night and didn’t see any blood on the floor so he thought maybe they took us away and killed us in the fields.</span> <span id="s381">He sat in that barn quiet, assuming that the farmer will come in and he did but his only greeting was that to take us away, right away he will not subject his family to danger.</span> <span id="s382">And he wanted us out.</span> <span id="s383">Despite all the pleading, Abram had won his confidence by giving him a day or two to go out and find another hiding place.</span> <span id="s384">He agreed to wait ‘til Abram returns next day.</span> <span id="s385">Next day Abram never did come back.</span> <span id="s386">We did not know what to expect.</span> <span id="s387">We thought maybe he was killed.</span> <span id="s388">However, after a few days, Abram came back and took us.</span> <span id="s389">He took us to, not find, not being to able to find a new hiding place, he divided us up and took us to where my parents were and took his little girl to where he was hiding at.</span> <span id="s390">I was very weak and quite ill and it did me well be staying with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What was it like to see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: It was a shock because I myself did not see myself.</span> <span id="s393">There were no mirror, you couldn’t tell how I looked.</span> <span id="s394">I was shocked by their appearance in rags, unwashed, not well nourished as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s395">And they were shocked by my appearance.</span> <span id="s396">I was totally emaciated, unkept, in rags and I could tell from the expression on their face that I was not a very well sight to look at.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Had you known that they were also in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s399">It was a planned situation that we knew that they were in hiding.</span> <span id="s400">We did not know where and we had no concept of the geographic location of the whole village.</span> <span id="s401">But we did know that they were alive and as the plan was, to divide us up, it was not a surprise that they were close by.</span> <span id="s402">The hiding place they were at was designated by their farmer as only for two people and when the farmer walked in and saw an additional person he said, “No way.</span> <span id="s403">I did not agree to three.”</span> <span id="s404">We tried to bribe him and give him some more gold.</span> <span id="s405">He took it and then next day changed his mind.</span> <span id="s406">He said, “You gotta go.”</span> <span id="s407">And so again, Abram was caught between having to take us out of this hiding place and not finding another.</span> <span id="s408">We were chased out, by now it was turning cold and winter snow was on the ground.</span> <span id="s409">I was very weak, practically unable to walk and Abram was just trying to help by finding another place which was no avail.</span> <span id="s410">I was begging him to leave me there on the cold white snow.</span> <span id="s411">I could not walk anymore.</span> <span id="s412">The wind was fierce in an open field, the snow was blowing, and I, all I wanted is to be left alone.</span> <span id="s413">But Abram said, “As God is my witness, I’m not gonna let you die.”</span> <span id="s414">And he carried me on his shoulders and he was alternating.</span> <span id="s415">My father did a little bit carrying and we wandered days in that bitter cold in the white snow until we spotted a dark object far away.</span> <span id="s416">Abram ventured out by leaving us on the snow and moving forward to examine what it was, came back few feet, telling us that it looked like it’s a house and that we have no choice but try to go towards it.</span> <span id="s417">We chose to wait there in the snow while he himself ventured out.</span> <span id="s418">He dared to walk into that house and came out alive, coming back to us and carrying us, carrying me back into that house.</span> <span id="s419">It turned out to be an isolated little hut in the prairie and the cold snow, a very very poor farmer allowing us, agreeing to take us in.</span> <span id="s420">We entered the barn which was totally empty.</span> <span id="s421">This time there was neither a horse nor a cow nor hay.</span> <span id="s422">We lay down on the cold floor just waiting.</span> <span id="s423">The farmer was very poor.</span> <span id="s424">It was one of these, God’s people really, that had nothing worldly around him.</span> <span id="s425">He had children, they had no shoes, therefore stayed inside the house.</span> <span id="s426">Therefore the danger of them running into the barn was diminished.</span> <span id="s427">He explained to us that he had a cow that died because he could not feed her so he had no milk.</span> <span id="s428">His crop died in that cold weather and he had no bread and the gold that we gave him was no avail to him because he could not go into the market to buy anything because he was known to be the poorest soul in the area.</span> <span id="s429">So on a Sunday we would have some potatoes but he was so poor that he couldn’t afford any salt.</span> <span id="s430">But he was good-hearted and really sympathized with our fate.</span> <span id="s431">For some time we stayed there until one day we heard shots.</span> <span id="s432">These were very distant and we did not pay much attention until the farmer came and said, “Do you know the war’s approaching.</span> <span id="s433">The Russians are coming nearer and nearer and they are beating the Germans and you’re going to be free soon.”</span> <span id="s434">We did not believe that.</span> <span id="s435">We continued to remain in the same position, very pessimistic and doubting whether we would ever get out alive from these places.</span> <span id="s436">One night, we heard very close shots.</span> <span id="s437">Prior to those shots, we heard this lamenting of human beings was was, which was so painful, was like these lamenting cats that sometime cry at night.</span> <span id="s438">It was so close that we thought that it’s approaching us and soon engulf us in it.</span> <span id="s439">I remember thinking is this how you die, by hearing these voices coming out of nowhere?</span> <span id="s440">Pretty soon, we heard some voices knocking, some sound knocking at the door of the farmer’s house and later we learned that Abraham, his little girl and his wife, at the last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the village, were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at.</span> <span id="s441">Abram and his wife and daughter were dragged out into the open field, close to this farmer’s house and shot to death.</span> <span id="s442">Thus was the end of Abraham after all these wanderings.</span> <span id="s443">After all these narrow escapes, the friendly farmer, the farmer that Abraham fed and provided clothing and provided food for his family and his animals, thus was the end of Abraham, shot by his own quote unquote friendly farmer.</span> <span id="s444">The man that was totally a stranger to us, our farmer, explained to us that the knocking at the door was one of the militia men that asked him to go out and bury those bodies.</span> <span id="s445">The farmer described these three bodies laying in blood and the blood was still warm, melting the white snow.</span> <span id="s446">And the ground was so frozen that he couldn’t dig any holes.</span> <span id="s447">After while, he just had to leave them there and cover them up with the snow.</span> <span id="s448">Days after, the farmer came back to the barn saying, “You know, the end is here.</span> <span id="s449">The Russians are coming.”</span> <span id="s450">We did not believe it.</span> <span id="s451">He said, “Look, you can come into my house.”</span> <span id="s452">His house really consisted of one room where five people were living, three children and his wife.</span> <span id="s453">His wife was ill and was in bed.</span> <span id="s454">But we did not dare leave that barn until one knock at the door convinced us that freedom is here.</span> <span id="s455">He came in, the farmer came in, just refused to close that door and dragged that, dragged us into the house.</span> <span id="s456">By then, soldiers came in and he explained us that the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s457">The Russians indeed were there.</span> <span id="s458">They were friendly.</span> <span id="s459">My father, teaching himself the Russian language, started talking to them with tears in his eyes.</span> <span id="s460">My mother, I remember, was kissing their hands and the Russian soldiers were patting her saying, “Devie (ph), devie (ph),” which means no, no, don’t have to do that.</span> <span id="s461">We are here to liberate you.</span> <span id="s462">And then they saw me and they lifted me up and said indeed, that’s a yehvooshkod (ph), that’s a little girl.</span> <span id="s463">They saw that we barely were breathing and embraced us and brought in cases of food and prepared us for departure.</span> <span id="s464">We knew that we couldn’t stay in that house any longer, that we had to move forward because the battlefield was right there.</span> <span id="s465">There were bombs exploding all around us.</span> <span id="s466">The Russians dropped us off at the nearest village and despite the fact that quote unquote we were liberated, the danger was lurking behind each and every house.</span> <span id="s467">The Ukrainian population was not very friendly to survivors.</span> <span id="s468">They were trying to kill us at every moment that we took a step in that village.</span> <span id="s469">At one moment, a, one of the villagers lifted his, an ax, trying to chop off our heads, when a Russian tank rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot.</span> <span id="s470">I remember the villagers standing on the streets and pointing at us and we had to protect ourselves by hiding behind the tanks that were rolling by.</span> <span id="s471">I remember my father going over to one of the villagers saying, pointing to me saying, “You see, she doesn’t have any horns on her head.</span> <span id="s472">She’s just a little girl like yours.”</span> <span id="s473">And then the farmer spit in his face.</span> <span id="s474">The Russian Army was really the key to our survival.</span> <span id="s475">They took us in their tanks despite the limitations and regulations not to pick up civilians.</span> <span id="s476">They brought us from village to village and until the, a certain destination where they could not move on any longer.</span> <span id="s477">They placed me in a farmer’s home and instructed the farmer to light the fire in the oven, made room for me to stay in a warm place, brought in cases of Spam and ordered the farmer to feed us, warning them that they’ll come back in a few days and they wanted to find us alive.</span> <span id="s478">Meanwhile, the battle was going on and we had to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: This farmer that you were with, what nationality was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: The general population there was Ukrainian but he was such a simple man, a man with a pure soul.</span> <span id="s481">He did not know of any nationalities, he did not know of any differences between human beings.</span> <span id="s482">He was just a poor soul, alive and trying to live as pure as he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Were you with your parents with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s485">That’s how we survived, the three of us, in that one stable.</span> <span id="s486">That isolated, totally God-forsaken country, really.</span> <span id="s487">The objective was to move on and try to return to our place of origin which was Shortkoff (ph).</span> <span id="s488">It was not easy to move on.</span> <span id="s489">Everywhere we went there was cartouches (ph) and bombs and artillery.</span> <span id="s490">We also found ourselves in camps with soldiers around us.</span> <span id="s491">What was forbidden for us to stay.</span> <span id="s492">I remember in trying to obtain some food and going and finding a army kitchen in offering my services.</span> <span id="s493">I went to the cook telling him I’m gonna peel potatoes in order for him to give me some food for my parents.</span> <span id="s494">And he pointed a big knife towards me said, “This is not a toy for a little girl like you.”</span> <span id="s495">And then he gave me a whole bucket of hot potatoes and I was proudly carrying it towards my parents, feeling so big and important.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: How old do you think you were now?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Gosh, you’ve got me.</span> <span id="s498">I really am totally at a loss.</span> <span id="s499">I lost track of time and age and I have, I totally cannot recall.</span> <span id="s500">I could see myself as a twelve-year-old maybe, doing all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: I’m imagining that it’s probably around 1944 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And the only record that shows your birth, you mentioned earlier as 1939.</span> <span id="s504">Have you reconsidered or thought that maybe that birthdate is incorrect?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yes I agree and I’ve been trying to ponder upon that because in no way could I have been such a young tender age to do all that.</span> <span id="s506">And I suspect there may be a difference of four or five years between my actual birthdate and the, the date that is given in my records.</span> <span id="s507">This being that, when we were aiming to emigrate to the United States, we needed to have a sponsor.</span> <span id="s508">And being a child, I could not get a sponsor because we had to guarantee that we would not fall to welfare, that we would be able to support ourselves.</span> <span id="s509">The person that sponsored us, my parents, couldn’t, did not find any work for me, so that I had to be younger in order to qualify to enter as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So I don’t wanna break the flow of earlier but thank you and can you continue telling me about your experiences soon after being liberated but not yet being truly free?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: This time was also time of trial and tribulations.</span> <span id="s512">The road to return to our home was not easy.</span> <span id="s513">It was involved with narrow escapes of bombs which were not at least, not directly directed against us.</span> <span id="s514">At least this was a general war, not a war waged against three people.</span> <span id="s515">Three Jewish, against Jews to begin with.</span> <span id="s516">We finally came to our place of birth, not of birth but that’s where we were living and there was no sign of the city.</span> <span id="s517">The total town was wiped out to the ground.</span> <span id="s518">There was, our home was totally nonexistent.</span> <span id="s519">There were some bricks, broken glass and nothing visible of what we had before.</span> <span id="s520">We moved into a house nearby that apparently was occupied by people that escaped in the last minute when the Russians approached because the oven was still warm and there was a fire burning in the fireplace.</span> <span id="s521">We established our living there for a short while.</span> <span id="s522">The bombs were falling nearby destroying the rest of the buildings.</span> <span id="s523">We stayed on trying to make contact with nearby villagers and farmers that we knew before but nobody would let us in.</span> <span id="s524">Nobody would speak to us.</span> <span id="s525">Everybody was hostile and surprised that we survived.</span> <span id="s526">They even went far enough to tell us that they didn’t know who we were, to get out of their property and just to go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did you encounter any other Jews when you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No.</span> <span id="s529">When we came back, we searched for members of the family or other friends and Jewish people that lived in that town before the Nazi came and we, there was no soul around.</span> <span id="s530">Nobody came back.</span> <span id="s531">Soon enough my father got ill and was taken to a hospital which was an army hospital and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Was this, was this in the same town, the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It was in Shortkoff (ph) which was seven miles to where we had established our home temporarily.</span> <span id="s534">After that I got sick and they took me to the same hospital.</span> <span id="s535">My father was delirious, didn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s536">The bomb, the bombs were falling, the hospital was shattering, was shaking, the glass was shattered.</span> <span id="s537">It was quite a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s538">Again, a little girl, this time, at least, my emotions, my fear was with me and I remember laying in that hospital bed being so afraid, closing my eyes and being ready for what will come.</span> <span id="s539">My fighting spirit was gone.</span> <span id="s540">I was resolved to die, whatever will come.</span> <span id="s541">Soon enough, we got better, naturally, the war moved on, __________ the destroyed area but we were alive.</span> <span id="s542">We found a place to live and we went on.</span> <span id="s543">We lived in a house, it was halfway destroyed but one room was intact and if you opened the door, you found yourself looking out into the outside and it was an abrupt end to the wall and there was no heating.</span> <span id="s544">There was food available only through shipments that came from the Joint Jewish Committee distributing to areas of destruction and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Where were you living now?</span> <span id="s546">This new place after the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: It was still in Shortkoff (ph).</span> <span id="s548">It was Shortkoff (ph) but it was occupied by the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s549">So it was still an area where there was little food or heating available but at least we were safe and nobody was waging against Jews.</span> <span id="s550">My father regained his spirit and his will to life and he started establishing some kind of life, he started trading goods on the footsteps of the house by putting out certain sundries (ph).</span> <span id="s551">I remember I don’t know where they came from but he put out like buttons and, and all kinds of little things and soldiers would come and buy it and send it to Russia.</span> <span id="s552">Pencils, all kinds of frames and little pictures and toys.</span> <span id="s553">Pretty soon this little, little store on the footsteps of the house because a roomful of...[end of side one, tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: This is a U.S.H.M.M. interview with Dr. Anne Resnick, tape two, side B. Please continue telling me about Shortkoff (ph) and returning there.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: My father started trading with the Russians and started to think of education for me.</span> <span id="s556">He immediately hired private tutors and there also did not forget the, the violin.</span> <span id="s557">And I remember going to private lessons to, carrying the violin with me, and as well as tutoring me almost ten hours a day.</span> <span id="s558">Pretty soon we found a school, started to attend school and the father became a big benefactor for the school.</span> <span id="s559">He donated monies and goods therefore I became quote unquote a celebrity.</span> <span id="s560">Where every teacher knew me and they gave me special attention.</span> <span id="s561">This was quite flattering from a time where you were considered as total waste of humanity.</span> <span id="s562">I enjoyed school very much.</span> <span id="s563">I loved school, I loved learning.</span> <span id="s564">Things were turning around for us and we were trying to think of our future.</span> <span id="s565">During that time, very pleasant things were happening.</span> <span id="s566">A distant relatives of, relative of ours returned from Russia.</span> <span id="s567">This man was taken by the Russians during occupation of Poland and he was a very well-to-do businessman and considered as an enemy of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s568">He was taken one night to Siberia, stayed in a labor camp, survived Siberia and then released into freedom.</span> <span id="s569">He was in Russia for a while and then returned to the same city.</span> <span id="s570">However, he returned to find nobody of his family, his wife and children were killed in that compound in Boochoj (ph), lined up to the wall and killed and buried in the mass grave.</span> <span id="s571">There were other people coming back from Russia.</span> <span id="s572">Again, everybody was hoping to find at least one member of their family, very few found anybody.</span> <span id="s573">We were hoping to move on with our lives and the aim, the general aim of the Jewish population at that time was to move towards the west.</span> <span id="s574">We had no particular direction but we could not stay in the eastern part.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Were you experiencing anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: There was anti-Semitism in the Polish population, forever.</span> <span id="s577">Before the war, during the war and after the war.</span> <span id="s578">So much so that when we moved to the west, again we came to a beautiful city which was called Vrotsluv (ph) and again my parents started a little business.</span> <span id="s579">Again, selling goods and selling clothing and we had a very beautiful home.</span> <span id="s580">This was a home that belonged to Nazis, former Nazis.</span> <span id="s581">These Nazis escaped and left their home and we were allowed to move in.</span> <span id="s582">As a matter of fact we were assigned by an organization to, to move in there.</span> <span id="s583">When my parents were trading in a, this was like a, a mall and during the day when I was in school then my parents were at the mall, we were robbed.</span> <span id="s584">My parents were taken to the house, tied up and threatened to be killed.</span> <span id="s585">These were Polish, Polish people, young, young gang members organized against Jews and were trying to do harm to the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s586">Not so much by killing them but definitely robbing them of their goods and making their life not very pleasant for the remainder of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s587">Also, I attended school which was a private __________ which is equivalent to a high school, a lower school, middle school and high school and I think I was in the middle school but by being tutored specifically in addition to the school I was a very good student and I was a, again I felt the, the, the distance between me and the Polish students.</span> <span id="s588">I always had the feeling that I was not welcome there, I was not liked.</span> <span id="s589">The Polish students did not socialize with me.</span> <span id="s590">There was one more Jewish student there and so the ratio was like 98 percent, 99 percent non-Jews, and maybe one percent Jew.</span> <span id="s591">Was me and another young man, young child, young boy.</span> <span id="s592">We were excluded from, again when there was religion we had to wait outside.</span> <span id="s593">We could not participate in certain club activities and there was certain remarks, there were remarks made behind our backs.</span> <span id="s594">There was not a very friendly atmosphere in school.</span> <span id="s595">Despite that, I continued to really thrive and love school and be continued to move on with our lives.</span> <span id="s596">After the threats on my parents’ life, lives, we became very active in pursuing the, pursuing the, a way to leave Europe at all and apply for immigration to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Had Germany been defeated already?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s599">This was the time when Germany was in ruins and defeated.</span> <span id="s600">And this was the time where there was movement to get the Jews out of Poland.</span> <span id="s601">Actually, we had to get ourselves out of Poland.</span> <span id="s602">However there were organizations that were helping across the borders from Poland to Germany and this was also an activity, there was not much publicized.</span> <span id="s603">I cannot recall exactly how it came about but we did cross the border at night in trains.</span> <span id="s604">And we, our, our initial destination was Austria.</span> <span id="s605">We briefly parked quote unquote in Austria.</span> <span id="s606">I remember the checkpoints where we were searched and went, had to go through medical exams and make sure that we not carrying any diseases to endanger the lives of the Austrian population.</span> <span id="s607">We stayed briefly in Vienna and it was a beautiful time for me.</span> <span id="s608">I loved Vienna, I loved to visit all the museums and the castles and learn about the history of that country and the music and the opera and learned the language and the customs of that country.</span> <span id="s609">And it was really beautiful.</span> <span id="s610">The, that time again, my father never forgot the education and I had private tutors again and music and violin lessons and was a great time.</span> <span id="s611">We continued to move on and from Vienna we came to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s612">And Salzburg was again a haven for me.</span> <span id="s613">There’s all the music and the culture and the music festival, the __________ and we visited, I remember Bodgoshtine (ph) which was a, a summer home for Hitler.</span> <span id="s614">And it is a very beautiful place, unfortunately, Hitler made it his residence and that brought back bad memories and bad taste in our mouth.</span> <span id="s615">But, besides that, the life was pleasant.</span> <span id="s616">We did not stay at one place for long.</span> <span id="s617">We kept on moving on and moving on.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Did you finally feel free when you came to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I, yes, and I would think we felt free because we were together in a community, not in a community per se, but in a commune with all Jewish people.</span> <span id="s620">They had the aim, to immigrate and to become a useful, productive citizen of a country that we were proud of.</span> <span id="s621">There was, between us, we had no discrimination and we, it did not have much interaction with the Austrian population other than being like a tourist.</span> <span id="s622">So we did feel free although it was not a normal life that we were leading.</span> <span id="s623">It was not that we woke up in the morning, had to go to work and, and have a stable environment.</span> <span id="s624">It was again, a temporary existence but it was a pleasant one without execution and without prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Did you go to the DP camp in Salzburg or where did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: It was not a camp and it was not called the Displaced Persons Camp.</span> <span id="s627">It was an assigned, also like, it wasn’t barracks, but there, it was an assigned area that we had lived like in a commune.</span> <span id="s628">It was together with other people and we shared common bathrooms and bedrooms and shared all the joys of tourism and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Had your family been practicing the religious customs throughout?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: We practiced mainly the holidays, although we had not run across real religious within that commune.</span> <span id="s631">Some of them were not in with the, some of them were converted Jews.</span> <span id="s632">These were Jewish members of families that rescued other members and then got married and she was not Jewish, he was Jewish and at the, at, even in that commune we experienced already the friction between those married couples that almost resented the Jews within that commune so we did not have an Orthodox community within us.</span> <span id="s633">It was a divided Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What sort of preparations were you trying to make in order to emigrate to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Okay from Salzburg, somehow we were assigned to a city called Awnsboh (ph) which is southern Germany.</span> <span id="s636">And there it was like a displaced camp which you have alluded to although we did not see it as a camp.</span> <span id="s637">There were individual houses within certain area, there were no walls to the area except it was outside of the city with an area of woods and flowerbeds and it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s638">There, there was a Jewish self-ruling committee established where all the administrative work was done by a, by an elected quote unquote government body.</span> <span id="s639">And my father happened to become one and we was kind of considered to be the elite group of that commune.</span> <span id="s640">My uncle who returned from the Russian Army, he was the only one that survived due to the fact that he was threaten to the Russian Army, was the physician for that whole area.</span> <span id="s641">And again we were fed well.</span> <span id="s642">We had a ample supply of food.</span> <span id="s643">My, my own concern was to go on with my education and I did not like living in that commune so because of the school being in the downtown area, my parents and I decided that I would move out and live with a family, ironic enough, a German family.</span> <span id="s644">However, I had my own room and I could go to school in the morning then I would have tutors come in the afternoon to their house where I could totally concentrate on my studies and, and I’d have tutors either going to their homes or they coming to my home.</span> <span id="s645">These tutors were former Nazi professors, they were not allowed publicly to teach anymore in the school system so they made their living by tutoring students.</span> <span id="s646">And that’s, I fell into the hands again of former Nazis.</span> <span id="s647">Since my objective was to get as much as I can as far as education was concerned, to catch up for the times that I lost, I decided to forgo the fact that these were Nazis and continued on without dwelling upon political differences.</span> <span id="s648">I also in the afternoon, attended a special course for quote Creeksbeshaydickter (ph) which means, meant that all the people that participated in the war, in the German Army could not attend regular school and these were former Nazi yooogunt (ph) and Nazi soldiers that volunteered early in life to be in the army.</span> <span id="s649">A special course was created for them at a very fast pace to catch up on all the education requirements.</span> <span id="s650">And we found out about it and I applied for that and I got accepted so I was the only female student, Jewish, sitting with all former Nazis, Nazi soldiers, Hitler yoogunt (ph) that during breaks made the same remarks that I used to hear before that how sorry they are that they didn’t kill off all the Jews and that they had to do it over again, they would volunteer over again and they had no hesitation admitting how, how they are looking forward to the Nazis coming back and regaining the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Did they know you were Jewish at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I would, wager that they knew except that it never came up and we never discussed it.</span> <span id="s653">They definitely knew that I was not, by birth, a German.</span> <span id="s654">I don’t think that my sentiments were such that I could join them in the discussions of the past activities and they must have suspected but they were uninhibited and not remorseful at all of what they did and what was right to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did you find it very troubling to be around such students and even the other teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: It was difficult, it was very difficult and sad for me to just totally, first of all, I was isolated.</span> <span id="s657">I could not have much interaction, you imagine in a classroom where, what if you miss certain notes and what if you need to ask something, so it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s658">It was troubling but I had only one choice: either, either give up and not do what I set out to do or just to suffer through it and obtain what my goal was.</span> <span id="s659">Some of the teachers were friendly, they liked me and they were admiring me as a child or young person sticking to my guns despite the fact that it was so difficult.</span> <span id="s660">And they understood the situation and sometimes they even favored me.</span> <span id="s661">Some of the teachers were directly hostile and maybe I perceived it as being hostile but they’re definitely not friendly.</span> <span id="s662">The people I lived with were fairly civilized.</span> <span id="s663">I had kitchen privileges and they made sure there was enough coal because the winter was cold there and it was fairly livable.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: How often would you see your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I would go visit maybe every third day, and go, it was on a hillside and was go up there and visit for an hour or two and then go back, understanding that hey, we’re not separated because of need.</span> <span id="s666">We were separated because of choice and that I had to accomplish this and not totally live in a displaced camp where I could not achieve that education as I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Had your family already started some kind of paperwork to emigrate to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I think they did because by the sheer fact that they were assigned to that area that this came through an organization that assigned us to that area in order, then later to emigrate according to the planned number of people that were gonna leave that area.</span> <span id="s669">There were some inhabitants of that commune that were going to Israel and there was a strong movement for emigration to Israel at that time and strong protests against the people that were choosing to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s670">However, we explained that we had family in the United States and we had not abandoned the Jewish spirit of establishing a homeland for the Jews and that we, we just as good Jews as the ones that emigrated to Israel.</span> <span id="s671">It was however, of maybe abandonment and the Zionist Movement accused Jews of being traitors to the United, traitors to the state of Israel which they were hoping to be proclaimed.</span> <span id="s672">Or was already proclaimed.</span> <span id="s673">___________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: What, what year do you think this was that you were in Awnsboh (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: ’46, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: So it may have still been Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: So I’m also curious, in preparation to go to the United States, since you did have it in your mind that you were trying to emigrate there, did you start learning English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes I did and as a matter of fact I was introduced to the English language through newspapers.</span> <span id="s682">And this had started these, in Vrotsluv (ph) before we came to Austria and Germany.</span> <span id="s683">My father was a self-taught man and he believed very much in starting early so he used to read to me, he taught himself English through certain, certain self, self, like tapes and books and they were called Longonshide (ph) letters and through those books he taught himself to pronounce the English vocabulary and learn the, the language.</span> <span id="s684">So he introduced me to those books and to newspapers and that’s became my, thus I learned the language of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Do you remember some of the first things that you learned in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, I remember some article, some article in the newspaper and it said, England won a new lease of life and I couldn’t kind of translate it into German ‘cause there’s no equivalent kind of expression, a new lease of life.</span> <span id="s687">And I remember saying to my father, I said, “Just like we won a new lease of life now.”</span> <span id="s688">That was a lot of fun to learn all that and explore and.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: What language was your father using to explain English to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Some, mostly German.</span> <span id="s691">But he was, my father was also a Yiddishcist (ph).</span> <span id="s692">He believed in the Yiddish language and the Yiddish culture and he used to speak to me in Yiddish too which sounds like German and so it was easy for me to understand.</span> <span id="s693">He encouraged me so much to use the Yiddish source of literature which was very rich and to read like __________ and Sholomosh (ph) and Byalake (ph), Nokman Byalake (ph) in Hebrew and Yiddish translations.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: How long did you stay or about how long in Awnsboh (ph) and then where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I think we stayed in Awnsboh (ph) approximately seven or eight months.</span> <span id="s696">From there I think I went to a very brief stay at Munich because I qualified for entrance to the University of Munich by completing that special course which was a very advanced course.</span> <span id="s697">I did go to Munich for a brief period of time and from there we qualified to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s698">We did leave Munich to Bramerhoffen (ph) which is the port from where the Jews embarked towards the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: When you were in Munich, did you stay on your own there?</span> <span id="s700">Were your parents with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No, my parents remained in Awnsboh (ph) and I stayed again, I was assigned a room in a large Nazi home and again, they had a large Jewish community in Munich and there was a self-governing body again, a Jewish self-governing body with, they’ve former, a very famous former prominent Jews being at the top.</span> <span id="s702">And they made sure that the Jewish, remaining Jewish population had a place to live by, by placing them in homes where former Nazis lived and restricted der Libenstraum (ph) just like they restricted ours for a long period of time.</span> <span id="s703">It was not very pleasant to live with these people because you were reminded every day that what, that they were sorry that they did not complete the job of total liquidating the Jewish race and that they’d have to do it over again, they would.</span> <span id="s704">So they never left that doubting that they are sorry that it did not come to be, what they planned to do.</span> <span id="s705">Otherwise, life was very beautiful in Munich.</span> <span id="s706">Again, I enjoyed my student years.</span> <span id="s707">I loved the university and the environment there.</span> <span id="s708">I loved the cultural life there, the museums were fabulous.</span> <span id="s709">The musical life, I remember, for the first time when Leonard Bernstein came to conduct a symphony and I went there and he personally, I got to shake hands with him.</span> <span id="s710">it was such a thrill for me.</span> <span id="s711">And again, attending all these theaters and art museums.</span> <span id="s712">The student population at Munich University had a fairly, few Jewish students and we remained very close.</span> <span id="s713">Unfortunately, the, the, the student body at European universities is not a very close-knit, it’s not that you attend a class and you’re part of that class.</span> <span id="s714">You attend certain courses on different levels.</span> <span id="s715">So we did not have one unit, there was one friend at this level, another friend on the other level but we kept very friendly and we had a Jewish student organization.</span> <span id="s716">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What was the trip like to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I remember it was a transport ship.</span> <span id="s719">Everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s720">It was quite packed.</span> <span id="s721">The journey was not very easy, the voyage through the sea was quite stormy but I shall never forget, I don’t remember the year but I know the day when we arrived.</span> <span id="s722">We couldn’t eat much except the day when we arrived, we docked at a port and we stood there for a whole day and suddenly we were served big portions of turkey.</span> <span id="s723">I knew what it was but a lot of people didn’t know and said what’s happening, suddenly, all that big food and turned out to be Thanksgivings Day and that’s why we stayed a whole day docked at the New York Harbor looking at these skyrises and the Statue of Liberty and really giving thanks for arriving at the land of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: What were your first impressions when you finally got off the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: We had no concept what it would be like to, to arrive in a, in a country that we didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s726">Where will, we had no plan, we were just going there without any plans what would be or how it would happen.</span> <span id="s727">We arrived, we docked for a whole day, we were taken off the ship.</span> <span id="s728">They were calling out names and I remember hearing our name, Hertzog (ph), and I couldn’t imagine, say who knows us here, I mean who would be calling our name?</span> <span id="s729">And these were people from an organization, I think it was Hebrew Aid Society, Hiyoss (ph).</span> <span id="s730">And we were taken to a place where registrations and all kinds of paperwork had to be done.</span> <span id="s731">Then we were assigned to stay in a hotel in Manhattan and we were to come to that administrative building which was somewhere around east, on the east side and we were had to walk from Manhattan to come for lunch and dinner to that administrative building.</span> <span id="s732">This was at the transitional period.</span> <span id="s733">From there we had to decide, people had to decide what to do and how to construct their lives.</span> <span id="s734">For lots of people, this was just a waiting period to move on to different states, midwest and Chicago and so on.</span> <span id="s735">Being that people had relatives in those parts of the United States.</span> <span id="s736">We were destined to stay in New York since my father had a cousin.</span> <span id="s737">It was a time of search, a time of instability, a time of insecurity, a time of losing self-respect for oneself, being that we were dependent on this Hebrew Aid Society to provide us with lodging and food.</span> <span id="s738">We had only a limited amount of resources to establish our own identity.</span> <span id="s739">The sponsor that signed for us was a cousin of my father’s who was a millionaire in New York, being the proprietor of a multi-million dollar business consisting of all, of all the things, there was hairnets that he imported from China that were folded and bagged in his plant in New York City.</span> <span id="s740">We naturally visited him and other members of his family and the first thing to do was to invite us for dinner.</span> <span id="s741">Well after the dinner, the first question said, so, what are you gonna do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">End of tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick conducted by Amy Rubin on November 25th, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s745">This is tape three, side A.</span> <span id="s746">You were telling me about meeting with your cousin and what he was starting to ask you about what you were going to be doing in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Ah, my father replied, “I’ll do what I always do.</span> <span id="s748">I’ll find a way to start a business.”</span> <span id="s749">Said, “Well how are you gonna start?</span> <span id="s750">You don’t have any money.</span> <span id="s751">I’m gonna give you a job because I signed for that.”</span> <span id="s752">So he offered a job for my mother and for myself.</span> <span id="s753">Now legally I was not supposed to be working yet.</span> <span id="s754">He placed us in a sweatshop where it was packed with women sitting alongside a large long table folding those nets, hairnets and placing them in envelopes.</span> <span id="s755">The work was so fast and depended on the success of the speed.</span> <span id="s756">There was a foreman there, supervising the working women which have been working there for years and were very well suited for that job.</span> <span id="s757">Except the two of us, strangers and never having be subjected to that kind of work.</span> <span id="s758">And he used to stand there with a real whip and hit the table and we used to withdraw our hands because we were not fast enough.</span> <span id="s759">After few days of that kind of environment, we walked out and feeling very disappointed, I kept on walking the streets of 5th Avenue, seeing a different world for myself.</span> <span id="s760">I, at the same time, I had the great sense of art and I loved to sew and prepare clothes and I started to design children’s clothing and until one person noticed that and gave me a lead where I presented it to a manufacturer.</span> <span id="s761">And after a while, I was designing children’s wear at one of the biggest companies in New York.</span> <span id="s762">I was not happy with my life though.</span> <span id="s763">I used to finish a job and say well, so what else did I do today?</span> <span id="s764">Another piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s765">I, my, I, but I was determined to help my parents get established.</span> <span id="s766">I also won scholarship but that was a chance that I took and, subjecting myself to a certain test that I saw at an international student organization offering a scholarship in Texas, Southwestern University.</span> <span id="s767">So I was awarded their, their, I was awarded that scholarship, went down to Texas, stayed there for a short while at the University but I guess I had a guilt feeling leaving my parents in New York and, not really knowing what, how they gonna survive and what they were gonna do.</span> <span id="s768">So I dropped everything and came back to New York.</span> <span id="s769">But then my father had, still had some resources, financial ones and had bought a grocery store and we all helped.</span> <span id="s770">My mother became the major storekeeper as my father was mainly ordering milk and supplies and that’s how we got our feet back and got back into business.</span> <span id="s771">I then, it was time that I get out of this family business and my parents having lost all their property and home and textile plant in Europe thought that maybe they could get it back.</span> <span id="s772">A movement was on for __________, meant that the German government should restore some of the property to the Jews.</span> <span id="s773">I, there not being very happy in that environment of store and just doing designing, I decided to go back to Europe and to enroll in the university there and at the same time try to see if I could regain some of our, our property.</span> <span id="s774">It was difficult for me to stay in New York and continue my education there although I could have stayed in Texas but I, again, did not feel very suited in that, for that area, being that was a total different culture between, in Texas and myself.</span> <span id="s775">I went back to Munich and enrolled at the university and was determined to pursue medical degree and become a physician.</span> <span id="s776">I did make some contacts with that __________ office but they discouraged me saying that there properties will never be recovered.</span> <span id="s777">By then my father had had some account in a Swiss bank and he suggested that I transfer myself to Bairn (ph), Switzerland and enroll at the university, continue my medical studies there and while trying to recover the monies from the bank.</span> <span id="s778">But that again, was to no avail.</span> <span id="s779">I went to the bank and they said there’s no such account.</span> <span id="s780">But I stayed on at the University of Bairn (ph).</span> <span id="s781">I enjoyed the studies there and I graduated with honors.</span> <span id="s782">Switzerland was nice in the effect that I had all the freedom to study and there was a small Jewish student population there where you could interact and pursue your studies.</span> <span id="s783">That was my aim and that’s was my goal and that’s why I went there.</span> <span id="s784">I used to come home to New York in the summer.</span> <span id="s785">I used to take fellowships at various hospitals and join various international medical students’ groups and learned a lot and there was my life: to learn and to be able to do medicine.</span> <span id="s786">I graduated from the University of Bairn (ph) and then I met my father in Israel after graduation.</span> <span id="s787">And the meantime, a very sad thing happened, while I was in Bairn (ph), my mother was ill, became ill and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.</span> <span id="s788">I came back to New York and faced that reality.</span> <span id="s789">It was very difficult since being in medicine, I knew what the outcome would be.</span> <span id="s790">However, I had to go back and continue my life.</span> <span id="s791">During my last year of school, I was not aware of this grave situation and my mother passed away without me being at her bedside.</span> <span id="s792">My father upon consultation with a rabbi decided not to let me know until it was too late for me to come ‘cause they were afraid that I would stop school and never return to it.</span> <span id="s793">And being in the last year they thought it would be wise for me to finish and that I definitely could not change the situation.</span> <span id="s794">This is still a very heavy guilt that is weighing upon my shoulders, not being able to hold the hand at the end of her life and I’ll just have to live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Did you talk with your parents once you were in the U.S. much about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: I never did speak about it, neither was my mother.</span> <span id="s797">My father being the extrovert kind of a person started to write a drama, drama and he named it, “Oh Hear Me World.”</span> <span id="s798">He never finished it.</span> <span id="s799">It was translated by a friend into English.</span> <span id="s800">He wrote it in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s801">He liked to talk about his experiences but we never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: When did you personally decide to speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: In 1995.</span> <span id="s804">I had joined a certain organization through the Jewish community, Jewish Federation in L.A.</span> <span id="s805">They had some programs, cultural programs and I came upon certain people.</span> <span id="s806">They were child survivors in different countries, in Scandinavian countries and they were telling of their experiences as orphans being taken to a priest, by priests into, Jesuits and churches and lived in orphanages.</span> <span id="s807">And they had the most interesting stories to tell and finally I joined them.</span> <span id="s808">Although I did not speak much on my experience, I had this feeling that I belonged to a certain group, that is child survivors.</span> <span id="s809">In 1995, my son being a student at the University of Pennsylvania, visited Washington and visited the museum, the Holocaust Museum and came back and had asked me to talk about my experiences.</span> <span id="s810">Although I never did speak to my children about it, I did speak to high school students at the Jewish Federation and I became a docent at the Museum of the Holocaust in L.A., in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: What sort of long-term impact do you feel the Holocaust has had on your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: In the past I did not think that it had any impact.</span> <span id="s813">I just was so involved with succeeding in life and, and pursuing what I wanted to do in my life and, and medicine was my only goal in life.</span> <span id="s814">And then I got married and I had two beautiful successful children and I think I instilled upon them the same love of learning and that there was my all, my whole awareness was the presence, the present, not thinking of the past.</span> <span id="s815">Now that I start dwelling on the past and seeing that, I had no childhood, that I had lived this life in hiding and during persecutions and a very unusual childhood, I, I begin to realize that it, I think it made me a stronger person although I cannot imagine how it would have been had I had a normal childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Have you started to write about your experiences as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I have.</span> <span id="s818">I had been encouraged by certain people in the newspaper field to, after they saw my story in a videotape, to write down those experiences and I decided to do that.</span> <span id="s819">And it’s slow because I’m still very much involved in medicine and it just leading a normal, busy professional life.</span> <span id="s820">But one of these days, I’ll retreat and do some more recollections, putting it down on papers so that maybe my children and their children can read about it.</span> <span id="s821">As of today, my daughter still doesn’t know what her mother went through and what a life she has had during her childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Would you mind reading just for a moment or two, a selection from, some of your memoirs?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: This is entitled, “A Day in the Life of a Hidden Child.”</span> <span id="s824">It was a day as it was in those times, a dark stable, a horse, a high stack of hay.</span> <span id="s825">This, this hay occupied a space almost up to the roof.</span> <span id="s826">Two little girls, motionless, lying side by side, communicating only with a whisper, a sigh.</span> <span id="s827">Sharing the same destiny for no reason or fault of their own.</span> <span id="s828">Each different, each from different corners of the world, thrown into a doomed fate of struggle and despair.</span> <span id="s829">Both cuddling an imaginary dream on their worn-out blanket, the color of hay to blend in with.</span> <span id="s830">The space was small, only room to sit but not to stand.</span> <span id="s831">The position assumed was horizontal, laying down only, to reduce friction, to conserve energy, time of the day judged by the sounds of the outside.</span> <span id="s832">Sunrise by the crowing of the rooster, sundown by the return of the villagers from the fields.</span> <span id="s833">Sundays and holidays by the presence of the horse in the stable, by the small ration of milk instead of water.</span> <span id="s834">At the crack of the dawn, the farmer would enter the barn, getting the horse ready for a day’s work.</span> <span id="s835">He would carry a pail of water, some of which we would share with the horse and a piece of dry bread under his shirt.</span> <span id="s836">With a cough, he would signal his approach, produce a ladder and place it at the edge of the hay.</span> <span id="s837">He would place then, the water and the bread at the edge and then quickly disappear removing the ladder as quick as possible.</span> <span id="s838">This exchange was so fast, was so quick that we never had the chance to see his face.</span> <span id="s839">Time was of essence.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: And before we conclude, will you just let me know after you were in school in Switzerland, when did you return to the U.S. and where you lived after that, briefly?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: After I graduated, as I mentioned, I went to Israel as a tourist.</span> <span id="s842">I stayed a tourist for two weeks and then I joined, I volunteered at their hospital in Tella Shamir (ph) and Ramadgan (ph) in Israel.</span> <span id="s843">I was almost persuaded to remain there and work there in the hospital however, I still felt that the United States were my home and I returned 1966.</span> <span id="s844">I returned to New York.</span> <span id="s845">I had to pass certain exams in order to qualify to do post-graduate training and I remained in New York for a brief period of time and then obtained a pediatric internship at the University of Buffalo Children’s Hospital.</span> <span id="s846">I did an internship there for a year and met my husband, my husband-to-be and moved out to Los Angeles and continued my post-graduate training at Cedar-Sanai (ph) Hospital in New York.</span> <span id="s847">I’m sorry, in Los Angeles and remained here for the past 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: I want to thank you very much for being interviewed today.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0448 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
