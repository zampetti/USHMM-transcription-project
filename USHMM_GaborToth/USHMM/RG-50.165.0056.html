in Sweden in 1948.</span> <span id="s15">After the war I was one of the Bricha leaders along with Abba Kovner and Nisn Resnick.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: How come you didn’t go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">IK: My wife wanted to go to the U.S. with her three sisters who already had papers to</span></p> <p><span id="s18">come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">MK: I had a student affidavit to go to Bais Yaakov through Rabbi Jacobson in Sweden.</span> <span id="s20">But then the visa was delayed and I didn’t go that way.</span> <span id="s21">I got married and he discouraged me because he didn’t want me to work, to be a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">IK: 1920 in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s24">My

id="s27">IK: I wanted to go into the printing business here with the Forward.</span> <span id="s28">I couldn’t get into the Jewish union.</span> <span id="s29">(He is reluctant to discuss this.</span> <span id="s30">Perhaps his political views were not left-wing enough.</span> <span id="s31">He says it had, perhaps, something to do with overtime.)</span> <span id="s32">I worked for the Wall Street Journal, where it was very good.</span> <span id="s33">They gave me a break taking into consideration my background.</span> <span id="s34">Then I worked for The Daily News.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">IK: I’m resigning from this interview because what you want to know about is not important to me.</span> <span id="s36">I want to talk about my wartime activities.</span> <span id="s37">I could tell you half a book about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: I’ll write about that too but I want to combine it with after the war.</span> <span id="s39">Do you feel your life ended after the war?</span> <span id="s40">Didn’t you have children and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">IK: Yes, but everybody did this.</span> <span id="s42">I managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: But tell me the part I can’t read about.</span> <span id="s44">Do you think you see life differently because of how you went through the war?</span> <span id="s45">You weren’t humiliated like people in Auschwitz were?</span> <span id="s46">Are your children proud of what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">IK: They know about it but they’re not involved.</span> <span id="s48">We raised three children.</span> <span id="s49">All of them did well, went to school, and have good jobs.</span> <span id="s50">They all married Jews.</span> <span id="s51">We have five grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: How long did it take to put together these three volumes?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">IK: I began collecting this material after the war ended and have been working on this continuously.</span> <span id="s54">I don’t go to shul every day and I don’t play cards.</span> <span id="s55">I do only this in my spare time.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WH: Do you feel people here failed to appreciate what you did during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">MK: They couldn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">IK: I wouldn’t say I suffered.</span> <span id="s59">I had what to eat, where to sleep, but I wasn’t received the way I should have been.</span> <span id="s60">Everybody had problems then.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: Do you think that today you’re receiving the recognition?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">IK: Yes, sure, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s63">(He then shows me his journal.)</span> <span id="s64">But in those days, I expected that the Jewish union would give me a break.</span> <span id="s65">I didn’t expect help from Italians, but these were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">WH: How were you able to resist when so many couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">IK: I got lucky.</span> <span id="s68">Many others tried but failed.</span> <span id="s69">We happened to be a couple of meshugayim (crazy people).</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: Do you belong to any social organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">IK: We belong to a survivor’s group called Masada.</span> <span id="s72">They are made up of survivors, mostly from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s73">They have affairs where they give coffee and a cake and they’re packed.</span> <span id="s74">Shlomo Zynstein is the president.</span> <span id="s75">All types of survivors come.</span> <span id="s76">It’s on Farragut Road.</span> <span id="s77">Sometimes the children of the survivors come if, say, a parent is honored.</span> <span id="s78">When I come to these affairs, they introduce me as an important person because of the books I write.</span> <span id="s79">But it embarrasses me and I told them I wouldn’t come if they don’t stop doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: What achievement are you proudest of?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">IK: That I met my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: I thought you were going to tell me that it was that you fought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">IK: This?</span> <span id="s84">This is natural.</span> <span id="s85">I knew another man he was a printer but he ended up working for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s86">He has a lot of people on his conscience.</span> <span id="s87">So this shows that you can go one way and you can go another way.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: Are you happy that you wound up in America and not Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">IK: I should have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s90">This is the true story.</span> <span id="s91">It just happened that I came here.</span> <span id="s92">The whole business with the hundreds of thousands of people who came through the Bricha started with three people in my apartment, in Vilna.</span> <span id="s93">This part is interesting.</span> <span id="s94">But I don’t want to have printed the story with the unions because I don’t want people should say that the Jewish organizations didn’t do anything to help their own people.</span> <span id="s95">And I’ll tell you, 90% of what the people say they did as partisans is baloney, made up stories.</span> <span id="s96">Some people were partisans for a week, a month, or a day; some were just peeling potatoes for the partisans.</span> <span id="s97">I’ll give you my book and you’ll have a good idea of what the partisans in Vilna did.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Interviewer Notes Isaac Kowalski is a true war hero.</span> <span id="s100">He was a partisan in Lithuania during the war.</span> <span id="s101">As described in his book, A Secret Press in Nazi Europe, (Shengold, 1978, paperback), he built and published from a secret press, leading the Nazis to post a 100,000 Reichsmark reward for his capture.</span> <span id="s102">He showed great courage and leadership abilities during this period and felt that nothing that happened in America could measure up to the excitement of those years in terms of the prestige he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">He has published a monumental three volume anthology that he edited, titled, Anthology on Armed Resistance, 1939-1945 (Jewish Combatants Publisher’s House, Brooklyn, N.Y., 1988 (?)</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">He also publishes a journal dealing with resistance called Jewish Combatants of
