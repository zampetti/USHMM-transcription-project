Cutler.</span> <span id="s3">Nora Levin interviewing, July 27, 1984.</span> <span id="s4">Now, Mrs. Cutler, would you be good enough to tell us a little about your childhood, your place of birth, the composition of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">EC: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1925, and I had what I would call a very harmonious family life.</span> <span id="s6">We were only four of us.</span> <span id="s7">I only had a brother, and my parents and myself.</span> <span id="s8">And, I can only remember my family life with warmth and loving memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">NL: Can you tell us the name of father, the name of mother, and father’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">EC: Yes, my mother’s name was Margaret, Margit, in Hungarian, and my father’s name was Henry, Henrich, and my dad was a builder, he was a contractor, he was a one-man businessman who did his own contacts, and he ran the business all by himself.</span> <span id="s11">He was qualified to do all his own designing and architectural work, all up to the completion of the buildings.</span> <span id="s12">It was required, in that time, that’s the way they taught people to practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">NL: Was he born in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">EC: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s15">My parents were born in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NL: And your brother was younger than you, or older?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">EC: My brother was 3 1/2 years older than myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NL: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">EC: George.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">NL: Did you live in a general neighborhood, or was it a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">EC: We only had one really designated Jewish neighborhood, and it wasn’t designated by the government, it was designated by the people who wished to live in such a fashion.</span> <span id="s22">And they were really the Hassids.</span> <span id="s23">I was living in a neighborhood that was fitting our financial circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">NL: Upper middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EC: Middle class, I would say.</span> <span id="s26">We were not financially affluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">NL: Oh, you were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">EC: No, we were not.</span> <span id="s29">We were culturally affluent but we were not financially affluent.</span> <span id="s30">My father had a tremendous struggle to keep things on an even keel.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">NL: Was this perhaps because of any antisemitism with respect to his work, or was it just that these were rather difficult times?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EC: I believe that he had a very difficult start, and I don’t think it was due to antisemitism at that time.</span> <span id="s33">They had problems preceding that time, because they went through the first World War, and they had a wave of antisemitism in Hungary at that time, following the first World War.</span> <span id="s34">But as time progressed, I believe that it was due to the fact that starting out life and being married and having a family was a difficult task, and under those circumstances, the economy of the country wasn’t anything to compare with the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: It was not fully developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">EC: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s37">But he was a clever man, and he was a very fine and a knowledgeable person, and he progressed, and he got into a very good situation afterwards, just before Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s39">Were your parents involved in Jewish communal life at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">EC: Not my parents, no.</span> <span id="s41">My father’s parents, particularly his mother, was very religious.</span> <span id="s42">I never had a chance to know her.</span> <span id="s43">She died before I was born.</span> <span id="s44">My mother’s family, I didn’t really know either of my grandparents, because they died before I was born.</span> <span id="s45">I knew my grandfather just for a short length of time when I was a very small child.</span> <span id="s46">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: So your parents partook of general...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">EC: Not Jewish oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">NL: Not Jewish oriented.</span> <span id="s50">Do you remember any experiences in synagogue at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">EC: Yes, I do, because in spite of the fact that they weren’t really Jewish oriented, we kept the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s52">My mother always observed the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s53">And unfortunately, you know, due to facts of life, my father was never able to come home in time for the holiday dinner, and that caused a lot of problems, but we kept Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and, interestingly, the school system was devised in such a way that it was compulsory for us to learn about our own religion.</span> <span id="s54">We had designated heads of, religious leaders, that conducted classes in the public school, and it was, we had, I had two, four hours a week, and it was compulsory for me to attend synagogue.</span> <span id="s55">It was part of the curriculum.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">NL: Did you resent that as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EC: Well, I didn’t particularly enjoy going to the synagogue, because it’s not in my nature.</span> <span id="s60">And I was, however, I evolved to be much more Jewish than I believe my parents, particularly my father, wanted to be.</span> <span id="s61">My father really did not want to continue in the faith.</span> <span id="s62">My mother was more loyal to the faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">NL: And your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">EC: My brother was, I recall some conversations with him later on, as we got older, and he was more an atheist.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">NL: So he wasn’t bar mitzvahed, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">EC: No.</span> <span id="s67">To be bar mitzvahed in Europe, I mean in my part of Europe, I can’t refer to all of Europe, and in our particular circumstances, you had to have some means.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">Your religious practices cost you money.</span> <span id="s71">Because it wasn’t supported by the government.</span> <span id="s72">It was an interesting structure.</span> <span id="s73">The Jews were self-supportive.</span> <span id="s74">We had a so-called, it was like a government within a government, where the Jews, they kept a file on our birth records, and so on and so forth, and like the synagogues and the matzah factories, you know, everything concerning the Jewish practices, had been maintained by a taxation from that body.</span> <span id="s75">And, it was an accepted form of existence.</span> <span id="s76">We had been taxed, and if you were Jewish, and you were documented to be Jewish, you were obligated to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NL: This was true in other countries in Europe, too, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">EC: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NL: Yes, certainly in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">EC: And, we took it as a part of life, and we have life, and that was it.</span> <span id="s81">As a matter of fact, my father had been very much involved with that organization, through his...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">NL: A kehillah?</span> <span id="s83">Was it similar?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">EC: I don't know what a kehillah is?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: A Jewish communal body, Gemeinde.</span> <span id="s86">A Gemeinde.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EC: Perhaps.</span> <span id="s88">Well, those words mean nothing to me.</span> <span id="s89">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s90">What we called it was a Hitkesek which would mean, in translation, a faith community.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: Yes, that would be the same, as kehillah.</span> <span id="s92">And so your father was involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">EC: Oh yes, my father was involved, because of his trade.</span> <span id="s94">They sought him out, and he was working for them, on maintaining, for instance, I remember, before the holidays, before Pesach, the matzah factories always had to be painted, and, you know, maintained, and the synagogues needed repair work, or what have you.</span> <span id="s95">And yes, he was working for them.</span> <span id="s96">He was one of the people on their staff.</span> <span id="s97">Religiously, I was rather expressing myself as religiously, my family was not all that involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">NL: But you say that the Bar Mitzvah would have been costly, had your brother gone...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s100">I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s101">It wasn’t such a traditional kind of observation, in my circle, as it would be here.</span> <span id="s102">I mean, it’s expected here.</span> <span id="s103">When a child reaches that age, you know that he’s going to get bar mitzvahed, unless they are completely turned away from the faith.</span> <span id="s104">I don’t remember ever attending a Bar Mitzvah in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">NL: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s106">You may have had a very different tradition there.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EC: I wasn’t involved with the Hassids.</span> <span id="s108">It probably was an existing practice there.</span> <span id="s109">I wasn’t involved with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NL: Now, you said, culturally your family was very affluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">EC: Not very affluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">NL: Culturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EC: Oh, culturally, I am sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: So this meant that they were interested in music and drama?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">EC: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NL: Any specific arts?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">EC: Particularly in music.</span> <span id="s118">My brother was studying to be a concert violinist.</span> <span id="s119">And, unfortunately, that came to a very abrupt end.</span> <span id="s120">He was very fine, he was talented, and it was really both my parents’, and particularly my father’s dream, and so we had every conceivable exposure to music.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">NL: Did you study, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">EC: Yes, but I wasn’t talented.</span> <span id="s123">I still play a little bit, and I passed it on to my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">NL: And so, your school life, I take it, was quite happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">EC: Well, I think it started out to be a normal school life, and ended up to be a disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">NL: You entered at age seven or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">EC: At six.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">NL: That was in 1931, or so.</span> <span id="s129">And were there a number of Jewish children in your class?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">EC: Yes, as a matter of fact, it was very well mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">NL: And no noticeable antisemitism at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">EC: Not as a child, I didn’t observe it.</span> <span id="s133">I don’t know, I heard it here and there from the lips of the adults, you know, when they got together and discussed it, you know, they had comments that they made about this, that, and the other thing, but it really didn’t affect me, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">NL: And, you had non-Jewish friends then, I suppose, as well as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EC: I had some.</span> <span id="s136">We didn’t live in a Jewish neighborhood, and it was inevitable, when you go to school, you pick up friends, with whom you hit it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NL: Do you remember when the coming Nazi influences first began to impact on your family, or on you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">EC: Well, I have one memory standing out in my mind, particularly.</span> <span id="s139">I was in high school, and the class, the home room teacher, I would say, the woman who was in charge of our class, primarily, she seemed to be very much under the influence of Hitler.</span> <span id="s140">I never heard the name mentioned before, and I didn’t know who she was talking about.</span> <span id="s141">She addressed the class at one point, and praising him to be one of the upcoming heads of state who was going to imprint his memory into the history of the world.</span> <span id="s142">And I never realized how true that was.</span> <span id="s143">Her prediction was true to life.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">NL: About how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">EC: Let me think.</span> <span id="s146">I had to be like about 14, somewhere around 14.</span> <span id="s147">I don’t quite remember what grade.</span> <span id="s148">It had to be about when I was 14, because it would have been like--well, anyway, I can’t really...</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NL: But you were already...</span></p> <p><span id="s150">EC: But I was an extremely unaware youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: Well, I think most children are until there’s some devastating event.</span> <span id="s152">And your parents, did they speak to you at all about any distress they may have felt, or anxiety?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">EC: Well, I brought this story home to my mother, because I was one of those kids who always went home and gave full reports of what happened in school, and I told her about this great guy who was coming up in the horizon, and I said, oh, and Ann Margaret said that he was just a fabulous man, he’s going to change the whole world around for the better.</span> <span id="s154">And my mother was horrified, because she also, by that point, she already knew who this man was.</span> <span id="s155">And blasted her, and she was really--and I didn’t understand why she got so upset.</span> <span id="s156">And then after that, I heard, little by little, I heard about what was happening, and what was in the making.</span> <span id="s157">Not exactly, I mean, we really weren’t informed of exactly what developed, but we got the wind of it.</span> <span id="s158">And we also had a friend, a Christian friend, who was Communist.</span> <span id="s159">and he was coming around always talking about, projecting from what he knew, and at one point he made a very upsetting comment that my mother oftentimes brought up afterwards.</span> <span id="s160">Fortunately, they lived through the Holocaust, my parents.</span> <span id="s161">And he said, it won’t be long before we’re going all be maggots, or something to that end, or our bodies are going to be crawling over by maggots, or something like that he was saying.</span> <span id="s162">It was a horrifying thought and comment, but he knew what he was talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">NL: Was father’s business affected?</span> <span id="s164">This would bring us to the late 30’s, early 40’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EC: We were all very much affected.</span> <span id="s166">It was a very slow process in Hungary, particularly in Budapest, because it was the capital city.</span> <span id="s167">We weren’t hit as strong and as quickly.</span> <span id="s168">There is one other incident that I would like to bring out, that would be an answer to your question as to whether I realized there was any antisemitism.</span> <span id="s169">When I really started to learn that I was different from the rest of the people, I had just entered, I think it was when I just started high school, and I had a girlfriend who was at the same time going to a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s170">And after the first couple of weeks, we always gathered in the courtyard playing in our home.</span> <span id="s171">I lived in an apartment building, and we always gathered in the courtyard after school, and we were just playing around like kids would, and she turned around and said, “I’m not going to be your friend anymore.</span> <span id="s172">I can’t play with you anymore.”</span> <span id="s173">And I said, “Whatever for?</span> <span id="s174">I haven’t done anything.”</span> <span id="s175">She said, “You killed my Christ.”</span> <span id="s176">And I said, “I don’t even know who it was.</span> <span id="s177">How could I have killed him?”</span> <span id="s178">So that’s how it all began.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">NL: This was the first time you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s181">I was hit by it, and I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s182">I was bewildered, by her attitude and action.</span> <span id="s183">I was bewildered more than anything else.</span> <span id="s184">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">NL: Did you discuss that with your mother?</span> <span id="s186">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EC: I discussed most everything with my mother at that time.</span> <span id="s188">The only thing is, you know, parents, they didn’t really sit down and give an in-depth introduction to life to their children, you know, in those days.</span> <span id="s189">I don’t know, they didn’t have the time, or they didn’t think that it would really be necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: And they may not have known what to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NL: Did you feel defended against this kind of attack?</span> <span id="s193">Did you feel strong enough in your own Jewishness to feel that strength, or was it crushing?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">EC: Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, that I felt strong enough in my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s195">I was feeling strong enough in my humanness that I didn’t feel that this attack was warranted.</span> <span id="s196">And so, therefore, I didn’t know what to make of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">NL: Did you retain your friendships with other non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">EC: There was one, but little by little, we more or less oriented ourselves towards our own.</span> <span id="s199">And consequently, what happened, it brought out a much more of an awareness of who you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NL: It had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s202">Circumstances had forced you to.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">NL: And your parents, I suppose, were losing their non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">EC: They didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s205">My father had some non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s206">My parents were not very, they didn’t have a big social life.</span> <span id="s207">They had limited friends, It was just the family they were more or less involved with.</span> <span id="s208">But my father, in his association in business, had found some friends, and fortunately he found some excellent Christian friends, because that was their savior, that was the life saver later on.</span> <span id="s209">So, as a result of what was happening, I think that I have created a much tighter alliance with my Jewish contemporaries, and I’d become a member of the synagogue that was nearby.</span> <span id="s210">They had a Jewish group, an organization, a youth organization, that I allied myself with, and that’s where I had my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NL: This was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EC: That’s right, in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">NL: There was a special youth movement there that you liked?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EC: Well, every synagogue had a youth organization, and culturally oriented...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">NL: It wasn’t Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EC: No, it was not Zionist, no.</span> <span id="s217">It was strictly social, recreational.</span> <span id="s218">So now in the synagogue, I was familiar with, because as I said before, I had to go to synagogue whether I liked it or not.</span> <span id="s219">So, I wasn’t alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">NL: And were there other relatives in Hungary that you were in touch with, your parent’s sisters, brothers, or cousins, for example, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">EC: My mother had a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s222">My father had some cousins.</span> <span id="s223">And we were relatively closer to my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s224">But my father also, we had a relationship.</span> <span id="s225">It wasn’t what I would call a very...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">NL: But they were also undergoing these changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">EC: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s228">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NL: And were you aware at all, or did you have any consciousness of any governmental measures that were being taken?</span> <span id="s230">Any specific anti-Jewish measures?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">EC: Well, you had to be aware of it, because it was happening, and it was affecting you.</span> <span id="s232">But they were gradual--they crept up on you.</span> <span id="s233">They were from day to day--you never knew what was going to hit you next.</span> <span id="s234">And there were other pressures.</span> <span id="s235">Although, I must say that, of the government that existed at the time, they didn’t really have to be pressured that much.</span> <span id="s236">Now, during the Horthy Regime, I think Horthy was trying to resist, I think was trying to resist, I think for his own sake, if anything, because his existence as a Premier was threatened, and I don’t think that he held any love for the Jews himself.</span> <span id="s237">I mean, who does, really.</span> <span id="s238">When it comes down to the bare facts, nobody does.</span> <span id="s239">If it’s politically advantageous, then they’re going to do something for the Jews.</span> <span id="s240">If it isn’t, then they are more than willing to have the Jews befall the victim of any kind of circumstance.</span> <span id="s241">You know, so this is the bare fact of life.</span> <span id="s242">So, in my situation, this was the same thing in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">NL: I do understand that there was a very special rapprochement with Hitler, because Hitler promised to restore some of Hungary’s lost territory, in Transylvania, for example, Czechoslovakia, I don’t know whether that impinged on your family at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">EC: It didn’t affect us.</span> <span id="s245">The only way that affected us was, we were getting a lot of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NL: Tell us about that please.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EC: From Poland, and , oh, we got a lot of Polish and Yugoslavian refugees, and they were hiding out, and they were, it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s248">I didn’t quite understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s249">As a matter of fact, one of my aunts, my mother’s sister-in-law, the wife of her brother, had, she divorced a man from Yugoslavia, and she had a son who was a Yugoslav citizen, and he came up and back and forth.</span> <span id="s250">But see, these things weren’t discussed in front of the children.</span> <span id="s251">So what I only knew was that all of a sudden I met this person, and I heard that he was or she was from a particular area that I wasn’t even familiar with, and that we have to do this, that, or the other thing for this person, house them, or clothe them, or aid them in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">NL: Did this young man stay with you for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EC: Not with me, but with his mother, And, also, the same aunt had a niece that came from Poland, somewhere from not quite Poland, but from that region, because she spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s254">From the border of Czechoslovakia, Poland, that area there, people did speak Russian and Polish or what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">NL: Teschen?</span> <span id="s256">[also known as Cesky Tesin in Czech and Cieszyn in Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s257">EC: Yeah, something and Carpathian.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">NL: And so your feeling is that Hungarian Jews, at least within your own circle, were helping the refugees to find hiding places or places of refuge?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">EC: If they were relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">NL: Otherwise, I guess it was very threatening?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">EC: I don’t have a very fond feeling of Jewish behavior during those days, I don’t, very secretive.</span> <span id="s262">Anybody who had access to any kind of a situation saving measure, they certainly didn’t hand it down to you.</span> <span id="s263">They sold it to you.</span> <span id="s264">It wasn’t their brotherly love.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NL: In other words, if they had certain advantageous positions or certain advantageous knowledge, they didn’t share it.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EC: They did not share it.</span> <span id="s267">You had to have the contacts.</span> <span id="s268">You had to be able to be clever enough or inquisitive enough, and oftentimes, if you were inquisitive, it wasn’t welcome.</span> <span id="s269">It was not a nice awakening, no, for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">NL: Can you remember any specific situations where that came to the fore?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">EC: Many, many, because without knowing really what was happening, because we weren’t very sophisticated people, and we weren’t mingling with those who were.</span> <span id="s272">So our knowledge was very limited.</span> <span id="s273">We only knew things when they actually happened.</span> <span id="s274">And, we didn’t have the ins and outs of getting these informations.</span> <span id="s275">And all of a sudden we would notice that somebody is no longer there, so we would hear, oh, this person was able to go to Switzerland, or that person was able to get to the United States, or he had papers, or he had a way.</span> <span id="s276">But how?</span> <span id="s277">Some people went to Israel.</span> <span id="s278">Now, I had two cousins in Israel.</span> <span id="s279">They were Zionists.</span> <span id="s280">And, they wanted to take us there, and my brother and I, after much agonizing discussion, decided that we were going to take that route.</span> <span id="s281">I didn’t want to leave my parents, and my brother would say at the time, “You can’t help if you stay.</span> <span id="s282">Maybe if we go out, we can help.”</span> <span id="s283">So we went up to the Consulate, and found out that there was one more transport that was going to leave, and that was that transport that we didn’t get in, and that’s what saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">NL: Because that was destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">NL: What happened to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">EC: I think that was the transport that Hitler got word of, the last transport that went to Israel.</span> <span id="s288">I’m not quite clear on these...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NL: Would this be now already ‘42, ‘43 or so?</span> <span id="s290">Not the late ‘30s already, but into the ‘40s.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">NL: And the Zionists were organizing these transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">NL: Fortunately you weren’t on that one.</span> <span id="s295">As you said...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">But I know about it, because of what has happened.</span> <span id="s298">My cousins were insisting that we would come, and that’s why we sort of made this decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: And did your parents ever discuss the possibility of leaving themselves?</span> <span id="s300">Did they ever come to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">EC: My mother always wanted to leave Hungary.</span> <span id="s302">And she always wanted to leave, and my father didn’t have the nerve to do it.</span> <span id="s303">I think he didn’t have a good self-image.</span> <span id="s304">And he was afraid to make such a drastic change.</span> <span id="s305">He felt so responsible for the family.</span> <span id="s306">I had an aunt here, my mother’s sister, who came after the First World War.</span> <span id="s307">And they were discussing the possibilities of my father coming here and getting started, and then bringing us over, and father didn’t have the--what it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">NL: Self confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">EC: The self confidence, that he would be able to do that.</span> <span id="s310">He didn’t want to leave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">NL: Well, it was a very big wrench, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">EC: But my aunt and uncle, and my mother, I know she was begging my aunt and uncle to bring us, the children, over, because by that time they knew that something horrible was going to happen.</span> <span id="s313">And we knew of another family who had relatives in the States, and got their son here just before he was drafted into the service.</span> <span id="s314">And my mother was begging my aunt, and my aunt found all kinds of excuses not to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">NL: She just didn’t want the responsibility?</span> <span id="s316">Even though she had wanted your father to come there?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">EC: No.</span> <span id="s318">Actually, she didn’t want my father to come.</span> <span id="s319">They didn’t want my parents to come.</span> <span id="s320">They just would have obliged, I imagine, if we asked them for an affidavit.</span> <span id="s321">But she flatly refused to bring my brother and I over.</span> <span id="s322">And, so, we didn’t have any financial means or contacts or anything to do anything.</span> <span id="s323">We were trapped.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NL: And the Jewish community leaders weren’t informing you about what was happening elsewhere in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">EC: We weren’t really informed.</span> <span id="s326">I think few of us were listening to BBC, and we were glued to the radio.</span> <span id="s327">I mean, we heard of all sorts of things happening, but we didn’t really know what was happening.</span> <span id="s328">But we knew we were surrounded, and we knew that it was inevitable for the Germans to consequently come in and take over completely.</span> <span id="s329">We knew that.</span> <span id="s330">I mean the writing was on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">NL: I’m wondering if the refugees from Poland and Yugoslavia, for example, would have told your parents what their experiences had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">EC: They didn’t have the kind of experiences that evolved later.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">NL: Not the deportation?</span> <span id="s334">To the death camps?</span> <span id="s335">Just persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">EC: No.</span> <span id="s337">Just persecution.</span> <span id="s338">Now, we had persecution that was very gradually put upon us, that was, that you must have heard, the restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">NL: Can you spell them out a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">EC: Of course, I was an apprentice at the time.</span> <span id="s341">I apprenticed dress making...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">NL: You were allowed to finish high school, Eva, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">EC: I was allowed to finish high school, but I couldn’t go any further.</span> <span id="s344">Now, when I’m speaking of high school, it was four years of what would be, you know, the terminology is still different, the educational system was very different, I had a high school education compared to what high schools are teaching here.</span> <span id="s345">But it only took four years over and above four years of elementary studies.</span> <span id="s346">So it was the four years, and after that, you would enter to higher education...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Tape 1, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s348">NL: This is side 2, continuing our interview with Mrs. Eva Cutler.</span> <span id="s349">Yes, you were saying that after this high school equivalent, you were apprenticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">EC: Yes, I apprenticed dressmaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">NL: As a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s352">And what was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">EC: It was an exciting experience.</span> <span id="s354">I was fortunate enough to go on into a very exclusive salon in center city, catering to the high class clientele, ambassadors’ wives.</span> <span id="s355">It was an international trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">NL: There obviously was no restriction as to the young apprentices who were allowed to enroll, or was this a Jewish firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">EC: It just so happened that the owner of that firm was Jewish, but it had nothing to do with anything, because we were not allowed to go into higher education, but the trades were open.</span> <span id="s358">We could pick and choose any of the trades we were so required to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">NL: This must have been because Jews were so important to the economy of Hungary.</span> <span id="s360">Would you imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">EC: I would say that it was because they didn’t know what else to do.</span> <span id="s362">I mean, what could they do with us?</span> <span id="s363">Lock us up, or we would have been totally dependent on the state, which was not the case.</span> <span id="s364">You know, that state did not take care of its dependents so much.</span> <span id="s365">I don’t know, they just closed the doors on higher education, and they gave us this option.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">NL: And your brother was also apprenticed, Eva?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">EC: Well, my brother had a very sad situation, because as I said before, he was studying to be a concert violinist, and he wasn’t given the opportunity to go to the Academy.</span> <span id="s368">And my father was in business, so my father engaged him as an apprentice in the masonry field, and, of course, you know, that that was certainly not what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s369">Not only that, but it spoiled his hands, you know, a musician’s hands have to be very preserved...</span></p> <p><span id="s370">NL: That was the only alternative he seemed to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">EC: He didn’t want to do anything.</span> <span id="s372">And so, as a consequence, my parents were very strong on one thing--you have to do something.</span> <span id="s373">That’s how I became a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s374">I didn’t want to do anything, either, but I had to do it.</span> <span id="s375">In fact, before I became an apprentice, I tried doing some things before I made up my mind finally what I would choose, because my mother wouldn’t tolerate having me sit around the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">NL: So you began to like your work?</span> <span id="s377">You wouldn’t go that far?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">EC: I developed an attitude, and I thank the good Lord that I learned what I did, because without that, I would have been lost here.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">NL: How true.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">EC: And so, I have an excellent skill that I have taken further.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">NL: And how long did you stay in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">EC: Well, the term was two years, and I just finished the two years, and I was scheduled to graduate, when the Germans came into Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NL: That would have been March ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">EC: I don't remember the date.</span> <span id="s385">Dates mean nothing to me anymore.</span> <span id="s386">I know that it was that day that they came in, and I still went through with my graduation.</span> <span id="s387">I was determined to get it finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NL: You got the diploma?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">EC: I got the diploma.</span> <span id="s390">I never had any use for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">NL: Well, it must represent something?</span> <span id="s392">Some sort of achievement.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">EC: That’s why I was determined to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">NL: Didn’t you have to use it here when you came over?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">EC: No, here they never asked.</span> <span id="s396">But I knew I completed something.</span> <span id="s397">And also, under the circumstances, which might be of interest to you, we didn’t have access to all fabrics.</span> <span id="s398">And how that was, the way the requirements were that we bring in a garment that was already cut out.</span> <span id="s399">Now this salon that I was working at was not longer in practice, because the woman who was the proprietor of the salon had been captured and taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NL: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EC: Just before I graduated.</span> <span id="s402">It was days, it was the last week, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">NL: Were other Jews being seized?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EC: Yes, it was happening now.</span> <span id="s405">Unfortunately, the way that happened with her was that she had a lover, who was non-Jewish, and he was in the military.</span> <span id="s406">And he had her captured.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, things were going on there that you, only in your wildest imagination, you could read books--It was horrendous times.</span> <span id="s408">You didn’t know who your friends were, you didn’t know who your enemies were.</span> <span id="s409">Maybe you knew who your enemies were, but sometimes your friends turned out to be your enemies, too.</span> <span id="s410">Actually, these things were already happening and they were like, sort of like on the sneak.</span> <span id="s411">Cause you never really knew when you walked out on the street what was going to happen to you next.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NL: I’m wondering if this might not have been later in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">EC: Couldn’t have been in ‘44, because that’s when I was already away.</span> <span id="s414">When I went on my way was in ‘44, in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">NL: November?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">EC: November ‘44.</span> <span id="s417">This was happening in ‘43.</span> <span id="s418">I think it was ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NL: This was happening in ‘43, because I had never heard of any Budapest...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">EC: It was ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: Cause the Germans, I know, didn’t come into Hungary until March of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EC: OK, March ‘44 then it must have been in the spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">NL: And just before the German occupation, Eva were there any intimations, any hints or threats this was coming?</span> <span id="s424">You knew this was inevitable?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">EC: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s426">And there were some terrible things happening, because there was an organization in Budapest that took over from Horthy, that were very strong followers of Hitler, Hitler’s henchmen, it was like the Hungarian SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">NL: The Arrow Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s429">Salash.</span> <span id="s430">Now the Arrow Cross...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">NL: S-A-L-A-Z-I?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">EC: Szálasi.</span> <span id="s433">Yes.</span> <span id="s434">The Arrow Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">NL: He was, I think, the ambassador to Germany from Hungary, and then eventually became the Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">EC: And he had done all the atrocities that he didn’t even have to be ordered to do.</span> <span id="s437">So, of course, we were very much affected by that.</span> <span id="s438">You couldn’t go out down the street without the threat of being captured and never come back again.</span> <span id="s439">I mean people had disappeared without any warning.</span> <span id="s440">You were not allowed to make a telephone call from a public booth, but they wouldn’t tell you until they captured quite a number of people, and then, the following day, the order would come out.</span> <span id="s441">These were the kind of things, underhanded methods, in which they dealt with many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">NL: Did you know what Auschwitz meant in this early period?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">EC: Not really.</span> <span id="s444">We didn’t know what was happening, or how.</span> <span id="s445">We knew something horrible was happening, but we didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s446">Now, my brother was drafted because of his age.</span> <span id="s447">He was drafted into the Hungarian Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">NL: Into the Hungarian Army?</span> <span id="s449">Interesting?</span> <span id="s450">They were taking Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">EC: Yes, but they separated the Jews into the work brigades.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NL: Into labor battalions?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">EC: They were not labor battalion.</span> <span id="s454">They were not given arms, they were not given the benefits, they were not given clothing.</span> <span id="s455">They had to wear their yellow arm band and they had a cap, an army cap.</span> <span id="s456">That was all their uniform.</span> <span id="s457">And the families had to maintain these boys, but they were given food while they were away, but not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">NL: Did you hear from Henrich, I mean George, did you hear from him during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">EC: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s460">He was coming home regularly, because he was a likable fellow, and he got back to his violin.</span> <span id="s461">And he used to come home because he was very much liked.</span> <span id="s462">And they put him in the KP, acquiring food, and they always came back to Budapest to get the food, and he was stationed not far from Budapest, in Varzt, [phonetic] and he was stationed there, for the longest time.</span> <span id="s463">In the beginning he was away and my parents went to visit him, but just before the whole catastrophe happened, he was close to us in Vartz, he was stationed there and kept coming home now and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">NL: What were some of the other Jewish men doing in these work brigades?</span> <span id="s465">Did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">EC: They were working.</span> <span id="s467">I know they were working.</span> <span id="s468">It was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">NL: Treated harshly?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">EC: It all depends on where you were.</span> <span id="s471">If you were lucky and you were still in the motherland, it was slightly different.</span> <span id="s472">Really, I only knew from here and there, knowing some other fellows that came home, and after the war, that I have heard some horrendous things were happening with them, like, they took them out into the battlefields and used them to pick up the unexploded shells and things, and they were working in the mines, and died in the minefields, and they died as a result of explosions and the like.</span> <span id="s473">Then there were some horrible things that were happening.</span> <span id="s474">They didn’t know really too many details about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: But George’s own situation was not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">EC: But George’s own situation was not bad up until the time, until while I was at home, and he used to come home, and would stay home for a day at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NL: And what was happening to Mother and Father at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">EC: My father, oh, when the Germans finally came in, they seized Budapest, oh, there are so many things.</span> <span id="s479">I don’t think you have enough tapes for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">NL: Well, as much as you wish to share.</span> <span id="s481">Please, just keep talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">EC: My father, for instance, was one that didn’t believe it could happen.</span> <span id="s483">It won’t happen.</span> <span id="s484">And it won’t happen to him.</span> <span id="s485">And as a consequence to that, he was very brazen.</span> <span id="s486">When he realized that there were police around the eastern railroad station we went by on this particular day, and he saw that there were crowds of people, and he didn’t know what was happening, he really didn’t want to know what was happening, but he went up to this policeman, and he said, “Well, what is going on here?”</span> <span id="s487">And he said, “Well, they were asking for identification for Jews”, and my father didn’t look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s488">And he said, “By the way, where is yours?”</span> <span id="s489">And so he was kept, he was detained.</span> <span id="s490">And we didn’t see him for two days.</span> <span id="s491">My mother was tearing her hair out.</span> <span id="s492">When we realized, we called up the police department, and what I’m saying, we were fortunate because we had some very good Christian friends.</span> <span id="s493">One of his friends was a police officer who happened to be in that particular precinct where my father was brought in.</span> <span id="s494">And they were so overcrowded, number one, that they didn’t know, they were detaining the people there, and after they were overcrowded, they transferred them out to some other destination.</span> <span id="s495">But he took my father out of the crowd.</span> <span id="s496">And he sent him home, and he said, “Look, why don’t you learn your lesson and keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s497">Stay away from trouble!”</span> <span id="s498">He warned my father on several occasions, so he was really a true friend.</span> <span id="s499">So my father came home.</span> <span id="s500">But he had such a--it gave him--it put such an imprint on him.</span> <span id="s501">He said that his experience was undescribable.</span> <span id="s502">It was devastating.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">NL: Was he allowed to continue his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s505">Not only that, but what happened was, when the Germans came in, seized the city, they took over this Jewish body of the community, and this is how they put their fingers on all the Jews in the city.</span> <span id="s506">So, they engaged my father to continue working for them.</span> <span id="s507">But it was strictly working on construction work.</span> <span id="s508">And again, it was a miracle, I mean, I don’t know how this tape is going to come off, because you’re interviewing me as a Jew, when I’m very Jewish in my feelings, and I had many occasions, in fact, my father very much wanted us to change at the time, because he thought that it would save our lives, and I was reluctant to do that, basically because my philosophy is that you are what you are.</span> <span id="s509">And you can’t really change it, you can’t really change it.</span> <span id="s510">You don’t change yourself.</span> <span id="s511">Just because I would have a different religion, I would still be who I am.</span> <span id="s512">It really made very little difference.</span> <span id="s513">But, I came away from this with an experience of an entirely different nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">NL: That’s what makes it so valuable, Eva, so please, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">EC: Than most people.</span> <span id="s516">I find that human beings are so much alike.</span> <span id="s517">Human beings basically are all the same.</span> <span id="s518">There are certain differences in the way that we believe and we act, and our philosophies and our regards to humanity.</span> <span id="s519">And we had some very interesting experiences on this score, and one was this Hauptscharführer [warrant officer], whatever, my father was under in Hungary, working under him, who was an extremely decent.</span> <span id="s520">Now, he wasn’t an SS, he was a Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s521">But he was such an unusually good person, an honorable person, and he was helping the Jews as much as he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">NL: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s523">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">EC: For instance, with my father, I mean, he had a comradeship with my father because he respected my father for his knowledge and for the person he was.</span> <span id="s525">And he helped him with food, and it wasn’t only my father, whoever he was in contact with.</span> <span id="s526">And on the end, when I wasn’t any more there, I understand he saved a lot of Jewish lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">NL: It is very important to know that.</span> <span id="s528">Important to preserve that knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EC: I feel that it is very important, because I can’t condemn the whole nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">NL: No, one shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s531">One shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s532">And we have much evidence in our archives that deals with the righteous Gentiles.</span> <span id="s533">So, I’m glad to have this testimony.</span> <span id="s534">And were there any other experiences that you recall that you’d like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">EC: You know, this particular Hauptscharführer had called on the people around him, and told them that he, that all these men that were working under him, should bring in their families, and they should, and he had a plan, and my brother and I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s536">We didn’t trust him.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NL: What did he want to do?</span> <span id="s538">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">EC: What he ended up doing was he somehow found a way to help these people escape.</span> <span id="s540">Or he shielded them, put them, housed them somewhere, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">NL: Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">EC: No, but my parents, in the end, you know, because I was reunited with my parents after the war, they told me that he actively, he had saved the lives of many.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">NL: Maybe he had given them some special status, and the Germans respected paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">EC: No, he did it against German regulations.</span> <span id="s545">He stuck his neck out.</span> <span id="s546">He stuck his neck out.</span> <span id="s547">Because he had the power in Hungary, but I don’t believe he got any kind of approval for it, for what he did.</span> <span id="s548">And had my brother and I, if my brother had trusted him, or trusted this whole situation, he would have had some trust in somebody, he would be alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">NL: But he was decent and honorable to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">NL: And your father continued his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s553">And father continued in his work.</span> <span id="s554">Now, what happened was, I was, at that time, I was 18 years old, and I continued going into the synagogue.</span> <span id="s555">We had our group, we went on excursions, in spite of the air raids.</span> <span id="s556">We were stuck in the middle of the bridge during air raids.</span> <span id="s557">I mean, you can’t keep a young spirit down.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">NL: These were Allied air raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">EC: Allied or not, I guess Russian, yes, Russian and Allied.</span> <span id="s560">Russians came by night, no, the Russians came by day, and the Allied, the English and American troops came at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">NL: Came to bombard you?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">EC: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s563">We were, I don’t even want to go into that, because it really doesn’t make any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">NL: But you were able to maintain your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">EC: Well, we moved from one place to another, because they designated houses, where mixed houses where Jews could dwell.</span> <span id="s566">We didn’t have what they later on have established as ghettos.</span> <span id="s567">But we had marked houses with the Mogen Dovid, and we had to wear arm bands, and it had to be on the outer clothes, and I was harassed several times because as a youngster, I was rebelling in a way.</span> <span id="s568">I didn’t understand how dangerous it might have been, and I put my sweater over it, and I was harassed in the street by, several times, by, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s569">NL: Hungarian police?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">EC: Hungarians, not police, civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">NL: Civilians.</span> <span id="s572">These were in the Arrow Cross Movement possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">EC: Everybody was.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">NL: Or just sympathizers?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">EC: It seemed that way.</span> <span id="s576">But, in spite of it, like I said, young spirit is a wonderful thing, and we were at it still, we had our cultural events, and we had our, you know, exposure to other things that we were determined not to cut away from, but little by little the boys were drafted in.</span> <span id="s577">And then, little by little we were left pretty much alone.</span> <span id="s578">And a friend of mine, my very dearest girlfriend, who also didn’t look Jewish, she looked like a German, with blue eyes and blond hair, and her mother was a widow, bought her papers to escape, and she had a destination to go somewhere to the Transylvanian part of the country, and she was captured on the train, and we read the notice in the paper that she was taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">NL: That was in the paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">EC: That was in the paper.</span> <span id="s581">That’s how we knew that she never got to her destination.</span> <span id="s582">And her mother and I and she has a brother, we were all broken up about it.</span> <span id="s583">That was the first time it really hit close.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">NL: You knew by then what Auschwitz was?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">EC: We knew that there was an Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s586">We didn’t know what was happening in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">NL: You still did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">EC: No, we didn’t know what was happening in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s589">We did not know about the gas chambers, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NL: Was this notice put in one of the Jewish papers or Hungarian papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">EC: Hungarian papers.</span> <span id="s592">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">NL: Were there many Germans on the street, or would you say they were somewhat concealed, and you had to face mostly Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">EC: Hungarians.</span> <span id="s595">I don’t think the Germans had to worry about the Hungarians carrying out any orders.</span> <span id="s596">The Hungarians were overzealous.</span> <span id="s597">They were so happy to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">NL: So that they could get Jewish property?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">EC: Well, I can’t explain this.</span> <span id="s600">This is something that doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s601">It wasn’t just the property, it was just this human fallacy, it is something you hate.</span> <span id="s602">The hate you feel superior.</span> <span id="s603">You know, they were given the opportunity to feel superior.</span> <span id="s604">And somebody they thought were superior to them, it gave them the opportunity to turn around and say hey, you know, you’re no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">NL: To have victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">EC: Victims yes.</span> <span id="s607">I can’t explain hate in any other way, because somebody who doesn’t do anything to harm you, why would you hate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">NL: So, your impression was then that there weren’t many Hungarians who helped Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EC: No, there were very few of them, few individuals.</span> <span id="s610">Generally speaking, I think that the Hungarian people are antisemitic to begin with.</span> <span id="s611">They had a whole history of how it evolved, and whatever.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t consider the Hungarians humanitarians.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t.</span> <span id="s614">And that’s why they have such a very sad history.</span> <span id="s615">I think they bring it on themselves.</span> <span id="s616">They are so-called, they were always very patriotic, and their patriotism was, I don’t know what it was based on.</span> <span id="s617">You know, I don’t understand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">NL: Probably dreams of the old Hungarian empire, the glory of the old empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">EC: You know poetry is magnificent.</span> <span id="s620">You know, Hungarian culture is beautiful, rich, literature, very, very wonderful.</span> <span id="s621">Hungary has even today, it has its outstanding talents and I’m very proud of my Hungarian heritage, I really am.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">NL: So you’re a patriot in a way, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">EC: I’m dedicated to the culture of it.</span> <span id="s624">I’m dedicated to the beauty of it, the beauty of the terrain.</span> <span id="s625">You know, I mean, that has nothing to do with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">NL: Interesting.</span> <span id="s627">Now, do you have any memory of the Germans capturing Horthy, making him a prisoner, threatening to kidnap his son?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">EC: There were some who were there, and then they said that Horthy was Jewish.</span> <span id="s629">Oh, everybody had to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s630">They had to justify to the public why they had done this, that, and the other thing against people.</span> <span id="s631">So they dug it up that Horthy had a Jewish grandmother, or Horthy’s wife was Jewish, or I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s632">I remember these things vaguely.</span> <span id="s633">All I know is that it was like, you know, we were sitting on top of a volcano, ready to erupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">NL: Did you hear specifically that there were deportations to Auschwitz from outside of Hungary, from the provinces?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">EC: We heard of deportations.</span> <span id="s636">We had a place called Kistarcsa, in Hungary, and beyond that, we didn’t know where people were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">NL: Beyond that you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">EC: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s639">We heard of Auschwitz, but that’s about it.</span> <span id="s640">We didn’t know of any other place.</span> <span id="s641">At least, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">NL: There was a massacre at Kamenetz-Podolsky, Did you ever hear of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">EC: I didn’t, which doesn’t mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">NL: No, I was just wondering.</span> <span id="s645">So actually, within your own ken, there’s no comprehension of what was going on, or what was happening to Jews elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">EC: We knew what happened in Poland, that they were deported.</span> <span id="s647">We knew what happened in the small towns and the rural areas in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s648">We knew about it, but we didn’t know the extent of it.</span> <span id="s649">We were horrified.</span> <span id="s650">We really didn’t know what was happening, it was kind of a shadowy mystery.</span> <span id="s651">What they were trying to make us believe is that what they were doing with the Jews was gathering them and taking them to work camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">NL: Resettlements.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s654">We really didn’t know anything more that that.</span> <span id="s655">Then they used the method that they applied to us.</span> <span id="s656">Like, for instance, my father, first they gathered the men under the age of, I would say, what 55, or whatever, or how old my father was at the time.</span> <span id="s657">It’s immaterial.</span> <span id="s658">Anyway, they had a certain age limitation, and they gathered the men of workable age, of workable condition, and they recruited them.</span> <span id="s659">They just came from house to house, picked them up, and took them.</span> <span id="s660">But we were told that they have to be ready.</span> <span id="s661">Of course, by that time we weren’t allowed to go in the street at certain times, we weren’t allowed in certain stores, we weren’t allowed, you know, they had restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">NL: This would have been what, the middle of ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">EC: ‘44, somewhere around there.</span> <span id="s664">But I think it was before that, because it was lasting for quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NL: So then your father didn’t work under this German for a long time, but just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EC: You know, this is why I say that my account of this is a little bit hazy, because time elements somehow at this point means nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">NL: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">EC: I am giving you an outline of what has happened, but how and what sequence and when, and how much time elapses between one and the other, I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s669">My father was taken, I think he was still working for the Germans, but it really didn’t matter, he wasn’t exempt.</span> <span id="s670">They took him, and then shortly after that, they recruited the women between the ages of 16 and 38.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">NL: Where did your father go?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">EC: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s673">So that left my mother out, and it took me.</span> <span id="s674">And that’s when I left home.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">EC: We had gathered, that was a horrendous experience.</span> <span id="s677">This was a horrendous experience, that I have not really been prepared for, and, fortunately, I must really emphasize, I was physically and emotionally very stable.</span> <span id="s678">And I also must emphasize that because I was as naive as I was, and because I was so unaffected by so many things up until that time, it gave me extra strength to endure.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">NL: That’s an important point.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">EC: Yes, I was young, I was 18, and now compared to today’s 18, I was a child, but sturdy.</span> <span id="s681">I had, physically, I was very well preserved.</span> <span id="s682">I was very strong, in physical condition, and healthy.</span> <span id="s683">So we got our knapsacks.</span> <span id="s684">I went together with a young woman from the house who was newly married, and her husband was also in the service, and the two of us stuck together all the way to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s685">And we went through the hell of life that I could not describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">NL: Where did they take you first?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">EC: The first route was walking all the way over to the other side of Pest, which is Buda.</span> <span id="s688">They took us into a place that used to be a swimming resort place, and they said it was down there, no, pardon me, no, the first was, we had to go, it was a huge football field.</span> <span id="s689">And that was in Üjpest, which is the outskirt of Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">NL: Can you spell that please?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">EC: Ü-J-P-E-S-T.</span> <span id="s692">And the “U” has an umlaut on it.</span> <span id="s693">And it was a football field, a huge very popular football field.</span> <span id="s694">And we went up on the tribunes...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NL: Tape 2, side 1.</span> <span id="s697">Interview with Mrs. Eva Cutler.</span> <span id="s698">So you were saying that they put you up on the grandstand of the football field...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">EC: Well, what happened wasn’t just the grandstand.</span> <span id="s700">You occupied any space you found, and we were a great number of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">NL: A thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">EC: Thousands of women, yes.</span> <span id="s703">We were absolutely exhausted, because we didn’t know what was happening, and we were walked all the way over there on foot, and without belongings.</span> <span id="s704">And it was raining.</span> <span id="s705">It was a horrendous experience simply because we were so unprepared...</span></p> <p><span id="s706">NL: Where had they told you they were taking you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">EC: They just told us to go, and we gathered in the field, and they didn’t tell us anything much.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">NL: You were being led by Hungarian police or guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">EC: Guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">NL: And what time of the year was it, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EC: It was in the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">NL: This was the fall of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">EC: I was, I thought I was on the last transport, but I was on the one before the last.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">NL: Had there been earlier transports of women who had been drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">EC: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s716">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s717">This was the last effort, and I learned later that it was a result of Eichmann’s doing.</span> <span id="s718">Eichmann was in Budapest, and I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s719">We never heard his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">NL: I was going to ask you.</span> <span id="s721">You never heard his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">EC: We never heard his name mentioned, never.</span> <span id="s723">We knew that the SS had, up in Svábhegy, one of the mountains in Buda, they had their headquarters set up there, but we didn’t know who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NL: Curious that you never heard his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EC: We never heard his name, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NL: So what happened to you after you were walked to this football stadium?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">EC: Well, my mother, in her last effort, whatever we had in the house, she prepared food for me and put it in my knapsack, and put in part of my things she had gathered for my dowry, linen stuff and things, to take with me, because we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s728">And when I finally got out there, I lost half of my food, it got soggy, and it fell out of my sack, and I was distraught and was tired, and the uncertainty of things, you know, we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s729">We had no control over the situation.</span> <span id="s730">And, unfortunately, you know, there were a lot of women who, friends that had ways to get out, that they managed to get back home somehow.</span> <span id="s731">I had a friend who proved not to be a friend.</span> <span id="s732">I mean, it was like they turned people against people all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">NL: Every man for himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">NL: But some were able to escape and go back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">EC: Some of them had ways of getting back to a community, or whatever.</span> <span id="s737">But later on they were gathered up again.</span> <span id="s738">It was chaos, total chaos.</span> <span id="s739">So, as a matter of fact, I had a friend of mine, who was married at the time, and she, they separated the married and the unmarried in lines, and she had to go into another line.</span> <span id="s740">And after the war she was telling me, she had such pangs of conscience that she had abandoned me, and she wanted to always know what was happening to me, to tell me how she felt, and to tell me that she had no control over the situation.</span> <span id="s741">Fortunately, I managed to see her after the war, I mean, just recently.</span> <span id="s742">But at any rate, chaos.</span> <span id="s743">And from there they took us to Buda, it was used sort of a summer resort, a swimming pool resort, like a swim club.</span> <span id="s744">We were there for overnight.</span> <span id="s745">And the kinds of things that they pulled on us, like for instance, they would cook meals, they would cook a meal, and we were hungry by that time, we were very tired and hungry, and distraught, and frightened.</span> <span id="s746">And so, just before the food would get done, they would get us together and leave.</span> <span id="s747">And consequently, what happened, some people almost fell into the pit where they were cooking the meal, because we were hungry, and wanted to get something, and they would give you maybe a slice of bread or something.</span> <span id="s748">So this was consequently a pattern that they were trying to apply, to break our morale.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">NL: These were all Hungarian guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">EC: Oh, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s751">And then, we went through town after town after town.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NL: Just marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">EC: Marching on foot.</span> <span id="s754">And we were attempting a few times, we attempted escape.</span> <span id="s755">We ran into the properties of landowners, in stables, we were trying to hide in the stables, in the haystacks, and we had experience there that were really horrendous.</span> <span id="s756">The kids of the property owner discovered us, and he was luring us out by the food.</span> <span id="s757">He said, “Ladies, here is the soup.”</span> <span id="s758">We got out, and the guards were there waiting for us.</span> <span id="s759">You know, that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s760">We were walking on the Viennese highway alongside of the ditches, you know, the side ditch, and we were sleeping in there, huddled in there, sleeping, with our blankets on the ground, huddled together, and of course, winter came upon us, and a lot of people had frozen to death.</span> <span id="s761">A lot of people had gotten injured, and they would do away with them on the way.</span> <span id="s762">They wouldn’t want to take anybody who couldn’t walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">NL: You were in the so-called death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s765">Sort of, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">NL: Did you have any contact with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">EC: Yes, at the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">NL: All right, I don’t want to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s769">.</span> <span id="s770">This obviously was the so-called death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s772">I faced, what do you call it, I was almost shot, because at one point, we were in Hidek [phonetic], I think that was the last part.</span> <span id="s773">And we went to sort of a farm land, where we were stationed in a huge stable, where there were some men also from Rumania.</span> <span id="s774">I had met some people from Rumania.</span> <span id="s775">We went through horrible things.</span> <span id="s776">Men in the wagon, and we were stopping to get water.</span> <span id="s777">Nobody got water, and I recognized my uncle’s brother, who looked like death warmed over, and he called out, he recognized me, to give him some water, and we went and picked up ice or snow and tried to--It was, you know, these were the kind of things that one sees in a movie, and I don’t relate to it.</span> <span id="s778">I got it out of my system in a way, because I couldn’t live with it.</span> <span id="s779">I just couldn’t live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">NL: This went on for weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">EC: It lasted for weeks, for months.</span> <span id="s782">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s783">NL: You never stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">EC: We never stopped.</span> <span id="s785">We stopped at this one particular place for some time, and I was with this friend still, and she went out to work.</span> <span id="s786">They wanted us to go out and work.</span> <span id="s787">And it was at the point where I just decided that I wasn’t going to do anything.</span> <span id="s788">I had my, my feet were frostbitten, and my shoes didn’t fit my foot.</span> <span id="s789">My feet were swollen.</span> <span id="s790">And I couldn’t put my shoes on.</span> <span id="s791">And besides which I was lethargic.</span> <span id="s792">I just decided that it was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s793">I just wasn’t going to do anything about it, and I just stayed behind.</span> <span id="s794">I figured whatever will happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s795">And they lined us up one morning, and they said if you’re not going to work, this is it.</span> <span id="s796">I said the hell with it.</span> <span id="s797">This is it.</span> <span id="s798">They were going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s799">But they didn’t shoot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">NL: They didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">EC: No, because I’m here.</span> <span id="s802">And at one point we started walking again, and in the meantime, I went out a couple of times to dig ditches, that was some other things that happened.</span> <span id="s803">Not at this time, this was the last stop.</span> <span id="s804">But before that, and it’s kind of hazy in my mind, because we went out, and we were sent out in the mornings to do the ditch digging, and the men were separate from the women.</span> <span id="s805">And something happened in the men’s camp where a man, somebody kicked an SS’s gun, and it went off, and the SS got hurt, and they didn’t want to say who it was.</span> <span id="s806">So they took all the men, because they didn’t want to squeal on each other, they took them all and they shot them all down.</span> <span id="s807">But before they did that, we had to circle around, we had to watch it, they had to dig their own grave, and stand by their grave, and they shot them down.</span> <span id="s808">And there was a young woman who tried to escape, and they caught her, and they did the same thing with her, had her dig her own grave, and shot her into it.</span> <span id="s809">So there were some horrendous things not to remember.</span> <span id="s810">Not to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">NL: And when did you contact, when did Wallenberg reach you?</span> <span id="s812">Had you heard about him earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">EC: No, I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s814">I had no idea who he was.</span> <span id="s815">What happened was--and here I would like to mention something that I think is of utmost importance also.</span> <span id="s816">This was the last mile that I had to walk, where they really didn’t have any kind of mercy.</span> <span id="s817">If somebody couldn’t walk, they just shot them.</span> <span id="s818">They didn’t want to carry them on.</span> <span id="s819">And, I couldn’t walk because of what I told you about my feet.</span> <span id="s820">And, my girlfriend was begging me, because I was ready to sit down, to give in, and there was an officer, a German officer, who came and helped me.</span> <span id="s821">He told me to put my arm around him and he walked with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">NL: Where did he come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">EC: He was one of the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">NL: He just came out of the blue?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s826">They were with us.</span> <span id="s827">We never knew who was going to be with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">NL: You kept meeting different detachments?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">NL: I see!</span> <span id="s831">And by this time, of course, your group must have dwindled to a very few, or did you keep meeting new groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">EC: No, our group was still going on together, but I remember a lot of us, but we were going to a destination, we knew at that time, but we didn’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s833">They took us to Hidegkut, which was the last station.</span> <span id="s834">Have you heard of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">EC: And Hidgekut, I wasn’t familiar with it.</span> <span id="s837">It was near Schuttrun I think.</span> <span id="s838">And they had then, before they took us to Hidegkut, or was it after or before, that’s when they turned us over to the Germans officially, at the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">NL: And this is when you met...</span></p> <p><span id="s840">EC: That’s when I met Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">NL: Oh, but the German officer you had met earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">EC: That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">NL: And he helped you and walked with you and kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s845">He put his arm around me, and said put your arm on my shoulder and he helped me walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NL: That’s an important episode to record.</span> <span id="s847">And so, at Hidegkut, then you encountered Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s848">Now what was he doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">EC: He was standing at the border.</span> <span id="s850">He was a very tall, good looking man.</span> <span id="s851">I didn’t know who he was, and he called out to the group, and he said, in Hungarian--he must have known Hungarian, he said, "Anybody who has in her possession or not in her possession a..</span> <span id="s852">."</span> <span id="s853">what do they call it in Hungarian, a, what do they call it in Hungarian, oh well, a..</span> <span id="s854">.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">NL: A Schutzpass?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">EC: Yes, Schutzpass, yes, protective pass, from the Swiss or the Swedish Governments, should stand out of line.</span> <span id="s857">And I was dumb, and by that time I was also fatigued.</span> <span id="s858">And, I figured I don’t have it, never had it.</span> <span id="s859">I knew of it, that was another thing that the Jews didn’t share.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">NL: You did know of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">EC: I knew of it.</span> <span id="s862">It wasn’t available for us.</span> <span id="s863">We couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s864">And in Budapest, the Jews did not share this kind of information.</span> <span id="s865">There was also a Swiss house which the Swiss Government had declared to be neutral ground, and they took many children in there, as many as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">NL: I never heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">EC: Children and youngsters under age.</span> <span id="s868">And I understand that that was later invaded by the SS anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">NL: Oh, so those children didn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">EC: Yes, they suffered atrocities.</span> <span id="s871">It was horrendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">NL: Must have been the Arrow Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">But anyway, I didn’t know who he was, I knew what he was talking about, but I said, well, I just don’t have it, it doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s875">And I just ignored it.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">NL: Did many people step out?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">EC: Quite a few people stepped out, and I understand from one account that he took them back to Budapest, and then they were recruited all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">NL: But you went on into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">EC: I went on to Germany, I went on to Hidegkut, and that Hidegkut experience was worse than my fears.</span> <span id="s880">It was the coldest time of the winter, we were unprotected; we were sitting there; we were not allowed to sit, but many of us were sitting down.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">NL: Was this in the open?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">EC: In the open, there was absolutely no shelter.</span> <span id="s883">By that time our clothing was ragged, our conditions were fragile.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">NL: You were not eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">EC: And the food was not, I mean, it was just--and a lot of people who stayed there were frozen, they just died.</span> <span id="s886">And that’s where they came in with the cattle cars, and that’s where we were herded into cattle cars and taken.</span> <span id="s887">But, preceding that, I want to point out something that I have very deeply imprinted in me.</span> <span id="s888">The attitude of the people as we were marching through the towns, it varied from town to town.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">NL: Now you were going through, of course, Hungary and Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">EC: No, just Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">NL: And then into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">EC: Well, through the Austrian border, where we were put into these cattle carts, and then we didn’t come in contact with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">NL: Tell us about the attitude of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">EC: The Hungarian people were a very curious bunch, because there were townspeople that were waiting for us with warm soup, hot soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">NL: Is that so!</span></p> <p><span id="s896">EC: And with consoling words and with compassion, and with sympathy, and there were towns, in which it was just extremely the opposite.</span> <span id="s897">They took the stuff from our bags, hurled all kinds of nasty, unkind remarks at us, were telling us that they wouldn’t barter with us, we were bartering for food, or whatever we had.</span> <span id="s898">They wouldn’t barter with us, because what are we going to do with our belongings anyhow--where we go we don’t need it.</span> <span id="s899">And it went from town to town.</span> <span id="s900">.</span> <span id="s901">It was an experience, and if I was a writer, oftentimes I think I really would like to write a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NL: I never heard this either, that there was such variation, and that you did have some compassion and help.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">NL: That’s important.</span> <span id="s905">So you were able to sustain yourself with this intermittent help.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s907">So, as far as I’m concerned, my person, my personal experiences have really been valuable, because it did give me a great deal of strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">NL: And insight.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s910">Insight.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">NL: Do you have any theories as to why there should be such variation?</span> <span id="s912">Or is it just that some people are nice, and others are not?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">EC: What’s very curious about it is, it varied not by individuals sometimes, but by environment, areas.</span> <span id="s914">and I don’t know what the influence might be.</span> <span id="s915">Whether it’s the terrain, whether it’s the circumstances by which they lived.</span> <span id="s916">What kind of influence triggers off this kind of behavior?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">NL: Certainly intriguing.</span> <span id="s918">Did these people know that you were Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s920">They knew that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s921">They knew that we were going to be taken some place, and that they didn’t have to deal with us anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">NL: Interesting.</span> <span id="s923">Without this help you probably would have perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">EC: Well, yes, I’m pretty sure, I couldn’t go that far to really analyze it.</span> <span id="s925">I don’t know what kept me alive.</span> <span id="s926">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s927">I guess it wasn’t my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">NL: Well, there must have been something pulling you, pushing you, perhaps the thought that you would see your family again?</span> <span id="s929">Or is it your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">EC: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s931">It was just the kind of thing that in a situation like that...</span></p> <p><span id="s932">NL: You didn’t intellectualize so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">EC: You can’t.</span> <span id="s934">No.</span> <span id="s935">You don’t know what’s hit you.</span> <span id="s936">You don’t know why they’re doing this to you.</span> <span id="s937">You don’t know why the rest of the world is just not even taking notice.</span> <span id="s938">We were waiting for the American troops to come and liberate us, and we were waiting for the paratroopers to fall out of the sky, and, here we are, you know, out in the open fields being bombarded while we are walking through the land.</span> <span id="s939">As a matter of fact, I was so resigned that I fell asleep during the air raid, and I didn’t even want to take notice if a bomb fell on me.</span> <span id="s940">People went home to tell my mother, and my mother said, “That’s my daughter!”</span> <span id="s941">I mean, I have a certain attitude, a nature, that I think helped me through many crises, even after the concentration camps, that helps me sustain and stay above.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">NL: Obviously some spirit.</span> <span id="s943">Spark.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">EC: That trip in the cattle car was one that I could not, even if I wanted to give you an even close description of it, it was something so inhuman, it was something so, I think the animals are treated better when they are being carted away.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">NL: And now you were in German hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">EC: We were in German hands, I believe, yes.</span> <span id="s947">They didn’t know what to do with us, because the roads were cut off.</span> <span id="s948">They were determined to get us out to the camps.</span> <span id="s949">We were rerouted, no food, no drink, and people were mad, there was a woman who went berserk, and lice...</span></p> <p><span id="s950">NL: No toilet facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">EC: No toilet facility and like I said, you know, it’s useless to elaborate.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">NL: Such brutality!</span></p> <p><span id="s953">EC: Because you can’t, I mean if you have never seen things like that, from my description, you can’t visualize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">NL: Did this happen for days?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">EC: For weeks.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t remember how long it took us, because we finally got there...</span></p> <p><span id="s957">NL: You were in sealed cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s959">Well, it wasn’t really, I don’t know what you called sealed, it was sealed in a sense that only they could open it up from outside, and they would leave us out for drinks, sometimes.</span> <span id="s960">But we were without water and food, and I don’t remember the details, OK?</span> <span id="s961">This is something only the very strong impressions that remain with me.</span> <span id="s962">But the details are totally washed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">NL: And you eventually went to Bergen-Belsen on these trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">EC: Yes, and there that was another--Now that made a difference in my later life as to how I relate to my Jewish brethren, and it’s not complimentary, not at all complimentary.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">NL: There was a lot of selfishness...</span></p> <p><span id="s966">EC: It was worse than that.</span> <span id="s967">It was just, just as--I was human as everybody else and I didn’t expect that.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">NL: These were all Jews at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">NL: And, of course, not only Hungarians, but others?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">EC: Polish Jews, whom I have suffered a great deal from.</span> <span id="s972">Polish Jews I suffered from, the Jews from Czechoslovakia suffered from, anybody who didn’t come from Budapest I suffered from.</span> <span id="s973">Because I happened to be a Jew from Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">NL: There was this hostility, this hatred on the part of other Jews toward Hungarian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">EC: Yes, particularly if you happened to be from the capital.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">NL: Did you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">EC: I never did, and never will until my dying days, and never will accept it.</span> <span id="s978">Never.</span> <span id="s979">Because I can’t relate to it.</span> <span id="s980">Under any circumstances, I can’t relate to it.</span> <span id="s981">People are giving me all kinds of opinions, that I voiced my opinions to, and they say I’m antisemitic.</span> <span id="s982">I’m not antisemitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">NL: You are not antisemitic!</span> <span id="s984">Of course-</span></p> <p><span id="s985">EC: How could I be antisemitic when I’m a Jew?</span> <span id="s986">I’m anti anything or anybody who was in disagreement with my concept of brotherhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">NL: Can you tell us just briefly, I know it’s very painful, how this hostility toward you manifested itself?</span> <span id="s988">How did they know you were Jews from Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">EC: Well, when we first came in, they knew where we were from, and they treated us, I didn’t know who they were, I didn’t know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s990">I didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s991">They stole our food.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">NL: You were given food?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">EC: We were in the hands of those who were there before, who were in the higher positions, and they stole our food.</span> <span id="s994">They gave it to their own.</span> <span id="s995">They were helping their own.</span> <span id="s996">They were helping their own.</span> <span id="s997">I mean, we were victimized by them, not only the Germans.</span> <span id="s998">You know, it’s a chaotic situation, and some people tried to justify it.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">NL: They were there first, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">EC: They were there first, so they were entitled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">NL: It’s a hierarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">EC: It’s a cockeyed thing.</span> <span id="s1003">Of course, they were so dehumanized, that maybe I shouldn’t be so harsh on it.</span> <span id="s1004">But, it happened to me after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1005">After we were liberated I was hit even harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">NL: How long did you stay at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">EC: Well I got there in January, from what I recall, and I was liberated in April.</span> <span id="s1008">And by the time the liberation troops came in, I was on the verge of death.</span> <span id="s1009">I had typhus; I wasn’t able to move.</span> <span id="s1010">I was in the barracks without food for two weeks, food, or water, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">NL: No medical care, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">EC: Out of the question.</span> <span id="s1013">I was transferred to those barracks because I got sick, and I was just laid up there.</span> <span id="s1014">I won’t go into the barracks, because you know already about them, without my saying it about the conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">NL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1016">Were you part of a work detail at Bergen-Belsen, or did they just intern you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">EC: Interned me, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">NL: It was not a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">EC: There were certain things there, but I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1020">And later on I heard they might have been performing abortions.</span> <span id="s1021">But we were missing it, and I didn’t know what it was, because I didn’t see it, I heard it.</span> <span id="s1022">And it was just horrendous.</span> <span id="s1023">There were certain things going on there that, you know, it’s useless to repeat.</span> <span id="s1024">I must say that what I really didn’t understand, I’m very happy and I’m very thankful that I was given this kind of deeply seated decency, because this is something you can’t acquire.</span> <span id="s1025">You are or you’re not.</span> <span id="s1026">That I was unable, and I’m telling you the truth, I was unable to steal any food from anybody.</span> <span id="s1027">I tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">NL: It’s remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">EC: I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1030">I was already there, and I was able to get hold of it, and I walked away from it.</span> <span id="s1031">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1032">And I am still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">NL: Remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">EC: So, I am not saying I can take credit for it is because it’s something from my...</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">NL: From your parent’s values, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">EC: I don’t know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">NL: Your home and love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">EC: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1039">I understand my brother was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">NL: And your son has it obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">EC: Yes, all my children do.</span> <span id="s1042">It’s some heritage that I imprinted into them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">NL: It’s priceless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">EC: And my brother had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">NL: So, you were at Bergen-Belsen until liberation, at death’s door.</span> <span id="s1046">What saved you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">EC: The Red Cross came in, and nothing, I don’t know what saved me.</span> <span id="s1048">I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1049">I guess my time wasn’t up.</span> <span id="s1050">And I was taken to Sweden, and I was in Sweden for a year before I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">NL: A whole year.</span> <span id="s1052">Did you hear at all about what had happened to the rest of your family during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">EC: I tried to contact them, and I sent mail, and as you know, the connections were very--there was no real postal service at the time, and I finally sent a letter through the Red Cross to this friend, this Gentile friend of my father’s, who was my father’s chess partner, and the Communist that I told about, he was really a very deep-seated Communist, ideologically speaking, because I believe that when the regime really started, he was harassed by the Communist regime as well.</span> <span id="s1054">It’s a very curious statement of happenings, you know.</span> <span id="s1055">So I sent him a letter because he was trusted with all our valuables, we gave him, and we had a pact between us that anyone who remains, who survives, will try to make contact through him.</span> <span id="s1056">And, so I sent him a letter, and he contacted my parents.</span> <span id="s1057">He got my letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">NL: And what had happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">EC: Well, my parents went through a lot.</span> <span id="s1060">They had the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span

upon himself, to get dysentery, and they took him to Budapest to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1064">And so he snuck out of the hospital, you have to know my father to believe it, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean, he was a small man, I’ll show you a picture of him.</span> <span id="s1066">He was a small man, he was a quiet man.</span> <span id="s1067">He was, I didn’t know my father too well.</span> <span id="s1068">Yet he had determination, and he had a spirit, and he was, he knew his values.</span> <span id="s1069">He had his values pretty straight.</span> <span id="s1070">And he knew that my mother was probably there by herself, and he took out from the hospital and ran home and got my mother, and I think that’s when they herded them into the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1071">In the meantime, my brother had also escaped from his post, because they were taking his transport to Germany, and they came through Budapest, and he came to my parents in panic, and my parents hid him out.</span> <span id="s1072">They took him into a bomb shelter, no, a bomb fell on a school, a bombed-out school, and they were hiding him there, and took him food for like a week undercover, and I heard this afterwards, and at one point, my brother couldn’t tolerate it, and he gave himself up, because he saw what happened to the young men who were discovered.</span> <span id="s1073">They flogged them and they tortured them.</span> <span id="s1074">And he said he couldn’t take it, couldn’t go through that, and he was taken to a concentration camp, and he sent a note to my parents and explained that he gave himself up.</span> <span id="s1075">And at that point my parents went to the ghetto, and from the ghetto they were herded.</span> <span id="s1076">I understand my father was even there while they were in the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">NL: This is tape two, side two.</span> <span

id="s1086">And how long were they ghettoized, for months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">EC: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1088">All I know it was in the Hassidic area, where the Jews were congregated to begin with.</span> <span id="s1089">It has a big, beautiful synagogue in that area, behind the--temple, that is a beautiful architectural--you’ve probably heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">NL: I think I’ve seen pictures of it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">EC: Now it’s no longer a synagogue, from what I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">NL: The building is still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">EC: They couldn’t keep it up as a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1094">Anyway, that’s where I was confirmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">NL: That’s the synagogue you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">EC: No, that’s not that one I went to, that’s where I was confirmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s1098">So they survived the ghettoization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">EC: But what happened was, how they survived, was that they were herded out of the ghetto, and from what I understand, that was the incident that I also heard of , and you might have, that they took them down to the Danube.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">NL: Oh, and put them on the boats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">EC: No, they just shot them down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">NL: Some of them were put on barges?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">EC: And what did they do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">NL They just let the barge float, and they drowned.</span> <span id="s1105">But in this case, they were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">EC: So, my father first didn’t know, they did not know what was to become of them, and my dad said to my mother, they had their sacks, and my mother didn’t look Jewish either.</span> <span id="s1107">Probably that’s what saved them, partly, or whatever saves you.</span> <span id="s1108">You know what saves you.</span> <span id="s1109">They were going, with these guards around them, you know, with the bayonets and guns and such, and at one point my father said to my mother, “Look, I’m going to give you a signal.</span> <span id="s1110">When I tell you now, you take the Mogen Dovid off and we are going.”</span></p> <p><span

did what she was told, and she went with him.</span> <span id="s1114">And with all their stuff, they got on the trolley car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">NL: Oh no!</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">EC: Would you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">NL: Oh my!</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">EC: And he went to Gentile friends who put them up for a while.</span> <span id="s1119">They were already almost liberated.</span> <span id="s1120">The liberating troops the Russian troops, were all around there, and that’s how they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">NL: Do you know if other Jews attempted to do the same thing?</span> <span id="s1122">What a story!</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">EC: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1124">So this is what saved them.</span> <span id="s1125">But what came after that they told me about, I would not have been able to survive it.</span> <span id="s1126">I mean, the Russian liberation was a horrendous experience that you must have heard accounts of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">NL: Excuse me, could I interrupt for just a moment, because I want to get back to Sweden, and then we’ll come back to this story, if you’re not too tired, Eva.</span> <span id="s1128">In Sweden were you under the care of the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">EC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">NL: Under the care of the Red Cross were you in a special institution?</span> <span id="s1131">I guess a hospital first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">EC: I happened to have had an injury, a consequence of malnutrition, so they took me to a special hospital, even a quarantine, when they first cleaned us up and separated us according to our conditions, and I have a disability that resulted from that.</span> <span id="s1133">I was in a special unit.</span> <span id="s1134">And they took a documentation on this effect in my mouth, in my palate of my mouth.</span> <span id="s1135">And you know, there were some people with facial, who got, not infections, there, but actually deterioriations, rotting of the tissues or lips; they had to have cosmetic surgery done, and that’s how I was in a special unit.</span> <span id="s1136">And then they took me to Malmö, to a hospital where I was recovering, and then from Malmö, I was taken into an area that was Swedish owned property.</span> <span id="s1137">I understand it was royal property, the King’s property.</span> <span id="s1138">It was something similar to what a resort would be like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">NL: Convalescent home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">EC: Well, it was, I guess you could call it that, but we were already healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">NL: You were able to take care of yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">EC: It was primitive surroundings.</span> <span id="s1143">They were like log, wooden houses, buildings, barrack-type buildings, with individual cottages, and no central heating.</span> <span id="s1144">We were given the wood to heat our units and to maintain our own...</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">NL: They gave you food, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">EC: Yes, we had a common dining room, we had, a director of the camp, and health facilities set up.</span> <span id="s1147">It was a very healthy environment.</span> <span id="s1148">It was phenomenal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">NL: Were there all Jewish residents there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">EC: Yeah, we were all Jewish residents.</span> <span id="s1151">We were all survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">NL: Were there several hundred people, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">EC: Oh, absolutely, and they had several of these camps set up, and we were separated by nationalities and by sex, by gender.</span> <span id="s1154">And it was a phenomenal experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">NL: Good care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">EC: Super, and humane care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">NL: And humane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s1159">Super.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">NL: And your experience of the Swedes must have been very positive and humane?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">EC: Oh yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1162">And we had created a communal environment there.</span> <span id="s1163">I learned how to ski there; I made some contact with the Swedes that were interested.</span> <span id="s1164">I was in a hospital there also later on for surgery, because as a result of the condition that I suffered, when I recovered, when I was recuperating, my tissues had grown together, and I couldn’t open my mouth.</span> <span id="s1165">So, I was in the hospital, and I made the acquaintance of a Swedish family.</span> <span id="s1166">We had formed a Hungarian entertaining troop, a dancing troop.</span> <span id="s1167">We had a former ballet dancer from the Hungarian Opera Company, the Budapest Opera Company, and she choreographed the numbers, and I love to dance.</span> <span id="s1168">And we made up our own costumes, and the curator of our group, of our camp, a woman, her name was Norquist, no that was the family, Norquist.</span> <span id="s1169">I forgot her name.</span> <span id="s1170">She had a very Swedish name.</span> <span id="s1171">She was chaperoning us, and the others were different performances throughout good will tours, and we were really greeted like ambassadors.</span> <span id="s1172">That--had banquets; we were performing; I mean it was the highlight of my whole, I mean, it was a fantastic experience there, and then the family that I made the acquaintance of there, I stayed with them, and they were manufacturing sporting attire, and they gave me an outfit for skiing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">NL: So you learned to ski.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">EC: And I learned how to ski.</span> <span id="s1175">Of course, I never became an expert, but some of them have been excellent skiers, because we were in an area up in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">NL: What a juxtaposition to your other experiences!</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">EC: Yes, and the children were going to school on skis.</span> <span id="s1178">And so, it was that kind of an area.</span> <span id="s1179">It was between two lakes, Lokabrunn is where I was.</span> <span id="s1180">And we went to Karlskoga, and we went to, what was the other town, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1181">But it was really a very interesting...</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">NL: And wholesome life after such agony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">EC: And they gave us an allowance, a monetary allowance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">NL: This was from the government, do you think, or from the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">EC: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1186">Maybe the Jewish community and the Red Cross, and international agency, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1187">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">NL: See, I had never heard of this special recovery and rehabilitation program in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1189">So you see, that’s also a very, very important segment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">EC: You know, in that respect I’d say that if I can just disconnect myself from having been a victim, which I don’t consider myself, because there are victims, from one circumstance or another.</span> <span id="s1191">I just consider it to be having been born in an era that you couldn’t escape from.</span> <span id="s1192">And if you turn these experiences into a valuable learning experience, I think you can build on it and will really become stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">NL: Some survivors are able; of course, many are not.</span> <span id="s1194">They are too crippled, too traumatized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">EC: Emotionally, I understand a lot...</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">NL: And physically, too.</span> <span id="s1197">So you were in Sweden then for about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">EC: Yes, I was in Sweden for a year.</span> <span id="s1199">And I contacted my relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s1200">I remembered their address.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">NL: Oh my!</span> <span id="s1202">The same family that refused you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">EC: I was like, I’m somewhat changed now, but I was close with my mother because my mother was angry at her sister, and she said, “If we survive, I don’t want to have any part of her.</span> <span id="s1204">I don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s1205">She wrote letters to the extent of her saying that she held her responsible if anything happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">NL: Just judgement, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">EC: And I said to my mother, “She’s your sister.”</span> <span id="s1208">So, I had to learn...</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">NL: But you had remembered her address.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">EC: I remembered her, I contacted them, and they didn’t want to bring me over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">NL: Even after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">EC: They didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s1213">They were stalling.</span> <span id="s1214">I found out when I came here that she was worried, because she heard so much about the girls who were liberated, that they had become whores, and she didn’t want to take something like that on her responsibility.</span> <span id="s1215">That was my aunt, who just died recently, without me really being in touch with her, because consequently I severed relationships with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">NL: How did you get here then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">EC: They brought me over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">NL: They did bring you over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">EC: Yes, I was persistent.</span> <span id="s1220">I told you, if I make up my mind to do something, I would do it somehow.</span> <span id="s1221">I convinced her that I wanted her to bring me over.</span> <span id="s1222">What happened was, that I contacted her just at a time when I was scheduled to board the vessel, and I got a letter from my parents that they were alive, and that they got my letter, and so I was able to communicate with them, and that I was on my way over to the States, but if they wished, I’d go home.</span> <span id="s1223">And so they decided that I should come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">NL: I was going to ask if you had thought about going back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">EC: They decided I should come here because they wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">NL: They couldn’t get out by that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">EC: They went through a lot before they got out, because with this new government, and I wasn’t a citizen yet, and my aunt’s efforts really weren’t all that helpful, and they couldn’t get their visas and when they got their visas, they couldn’t get their passports, and so consequently what they ended up doing was they sold all their belongings, and they hired a guide, and they decided to go in on their own, and they left the country in the night, during the night, and they got to the border under horrendous circumstances, and they passed on to Austria.</span> <span id="s1228">And they were in Austria at the displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s1229">Oh, my parents went through a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">NL: Oh, my!</span> <span id="s1231">what courage they showed, Eva, what courage!</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">EC: Well, they didn’t want to leave for a while, because they were still hoping for my brother to come home.</span> <span id="s1233">Because one of my brother’s comrades came back, and they had a rendezvous.</span> <span id="s1234">He gave this comrade the address of my parents, and he came to visit my parents, so my brother never returned.</span> <span id="s1235">So my brother must have either had fallen victim to the Russians who captured the Jews on the way home, and took them out to Siberia, or he might have been killed on the way home in a battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">NL: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">EC: But he lived up until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">NL: You do know that.</span> <span id="s1239">Is there any possibility that he’s still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">EC: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">NL: You know he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">EC: He must have.</span> <span id="s1243">If he’s not in Russia, I mean, where else could he be?</span> <span id="s1244">We had people, as it turned out, my friends are still in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1245">I went back 37 years later and I found them.</span> <span id="s1246">So we would have known, because there was one particular friend who was very close to my brother, and he would have known if he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">NL: But you never received any documentation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">EC: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">NL: And your parents stayed in Hungary until...</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">EC: Until they figured that he wasn’t coming back.</span> <span id="s1251">And then they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">NL: They left in what, the early ‘50s or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">EC: I came over here in ‘46, so they must have left about ‘48, ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">NL: And they had a very rough time under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">EC: They had a difficult time because they didn’t want to join the Party, because they really wanted to come here, and they didn’t want to jeopardize their opportunity to come here.</span> <span id="s1256">And they did have difficult times.</span> <span id="s1257">I must say though, when I was taking piano lessons, when I was like 14, I had a Bösendorfer grand piano, and after the war, and my brother had a very fine violin, and after the war, the first thing my father did was get a beautiful piano for me, and two magnificent violins for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">NL: Hoping he would come back.</span> <span id="s1259">So they came, and joined you, were you in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">EC: No, I came to Philadelphia; my relatives were in Philadelphia, and my parents were in Austria, my father was working for the United States Government there, in a development where they were building the housing for the troops, for the occupational troops there.</span> <span id="s1261">And he was working in his field.</span> <span id="s1262">He was a supervisor.</span> <span id="s1263">And he had a good deal over there.</span> <span id="s1264">They didn’t tell anybody they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1265">My father never wanted anybody to know that he was Jewish after the war.</span> <span id="s1266">And it was a little conflict between him and my mother, but my mother gave in.</span> <span id="s1267">But they couldn’t get into the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">NL: Couldn’t get into the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">EC: No.</span> <span id="s1270">So they had an opportunity to go to Canada, and they went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1271">And they were in Toronto for two years before they came here.</span> <span id="s1272">And my father became a citizen when they came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">NL: Only then were they able to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">EC: Yes.</span> <span id="s1275">This was after I got married, because I got married the year after I became a citizen, and then, my son Gary was born a year later, and my parents came when Gary was about six months old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">NL: What a saga!</span>

spoken to her, I was very upset, and she understood how upset I was, and it wasn’t easy for her to make this decision.</span> <span id="s1285">But she had made this conscious decision because she felt that she couldn’t accomplish anything by remaining a Jew.</span> <span id="s1286">And she really doesn’t believe that we should have this kind of division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">NL: She

id="s1293">EC: Even more so.</span> <span id="s1294">Her grandchildren don’t even know that she is Jewish, and some very upsetting things came out of this.</span> <span id="s1295">I pointed out to her

to do is build the country without, freeing the country from this strong sense of prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">NL: So you agree with her then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">EC: I think in her particular circumstance, I think she did what she consciously projected would be an out-growth of her efforts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">NL: Suppose one of her grandchildren finds out that his or her grandmother was Jewish, which is bound to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">EC: It’s not supposed to make any difference, but this is what upsets me.</span> <span id="s1345">That her husband was telling me, and I was very offended by it.</span> <span id="s1346">But as a humorous little incident, that her grandchild heard somebody was saying something, you know, making a slur about Jews, like kids do, like a verse type of thing.</span> <span id="s1347">And she was repeating it.</span> <span id="s1348">She came home with it.</span> <span id="s1349">And then my girlfriend told her she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">NL: Oh, she did!</span> <span id="s1351">And did the child have a lot of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">EC: No, she was surprised, I mean, children repeat things.</span> <span id="s1353">They don’t know what they’re saying or why they’re saying it.</span> <span id="s1354">She told her, and I said, “You see, that’s what I’m talking about.”</span> <span id="s1355">I said, “You ought to have a little more awareness instilled, because even if you spill out your life, you are responsible for what is going to happen later.”</span> <span id="s1356">So she agreed with me.</span> <span id="s1357">I made a very strong impression on her then.</span> <span id="s1358">I said, “You’re responsible, because you can’t erase it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">NL: Would you have any other words to American Jewish youth, or American youth, in light of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">EC: The only thing I can elaborate on is that I don’t think we are a superior race.</span> <span id="s1361">I think our circumstances have made us more aware that we have to perform, and we have to be good enough, and better in some circumstances, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1362">We have to prove ourselves because the world is against us, but we’re no better than the others.</span> <span id="s1363">I don’t like that attitude.</span> <span id="s1364">I think that attitude also creates hostility.</span> <span id="s1365">I think we are inviting hostility a lot of time.</span> <span id="s1366">I think we have to learn that all people on this earth are really brothers, and if they’re not going to accept that, they’re doomed.</span> <span id="s1367">That’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">NL: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">EC: You’re welcome.</span></p></body></html>
