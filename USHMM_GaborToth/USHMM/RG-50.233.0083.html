that it should never be forgotten, what happened to us and could happen to anybody else who is surrounded by fear, anger, discrimination and so on.</span> <span id="s3">People did not want to listen for a long, long time because it wasn’t nice.</span> <span id="s4">My story wasn’t pleasant.</span> <span id="s5">People had some guilt.</span> <span id="s6">Some people were totally disinterested so I talked as much as I could, to my family to whoever listened to me.</span> <span id="s7">I want to leave it as a memento not for me, and not for pity for me; but just to let it stay alive.</span> <span id="s8">That it should never happen again and it should never be forgotten again.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">I was a young girl when it happened.</span> <span id="s10">I was sixteen and a half.</span> <span id="s11">I was 100 years old when I came out.</span> <span id="s12">Like every survivor I have my own story and like every survivor I have my own version of it, my own interpretation, my own questions.</span> <span id="s13">I give it to you to remember, to be better by it; to think before you say something or make fun of anybody; or belittle anybody, to know that it gives a deep wound.</span> <span id="s14">I want to give you the courage, the happiness of being alive and be able to see, smell, touch, whatever you want, and just enjoy life in general.</span> <span id="s15">Well, let’s start with the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">I come from an unreligious town, from an unreligious family although both grandparents were religious.</span> <span id="s17">My parents did not kept any more than Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur and we were first Hungarians and then Jewish.</span> <span id="s18">We were Hungarians who happened to be Jewish --- very proud to be assimilated and very well liked, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s19">I come from a little town, most people knew each other.</span> <span id="s20">My uncle was a fairly rich man.</span> <span id="s21">My father was middle class, well liked.</span> <span id="s22">My mother was a beautiful, intelligent woman, looked up to.</span> <span id="s23">I used to recite poetry since I was three years old and relatively pretty child.</span> <span id="s24">I was basking in love of my parents and my uncle and people around us, so I thought.</span> <span id="s25">Then slowly, very slowly, everything started to change.</span> <span id="s26">The different edicts from the authority came and our neighbor did not question why a Jew are not allowed to do.</span> <span id="s27">We went along, my father and everybody believed the Jewish hierarchy who said nothing will happen if you keep the law.</span> <span id="s28">We are Hungarians and nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s29">Nothing happened, we stayed home.</span> <span id="s30">You couldn’t be a white-collar worker any more in an office so you became, like my father, a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s31">When the army did not take Jewish men in, they became working force without uniform, their own clothes.</span> <span id="s32">They went into and they learned songs and they made up new songs that it does not matter that we have a … how you say it --- you work in the fields for Hungary.</span> <span id="s33">They’re still good Hungarians.</span> <span id="s34">I went to school, fell in love.</span> <span id="s35">I laughed, joked, I bicycled, I recited poetry.</span> <span id="s36">I went to the Jewish organizations and slowly I learned that I was a Jew, very slowly.</span> <span id="s37">By the Hungarian Nazi Party emblem on my desk in school or kids spit on us and called us name and of course we gave it back.</span> <span id="s38">We fought and yelled and went home.</span> <span id="s39">They said they are idiots, ha, ha, ha and don’t be hurt.</span> <span id="s40">Just go for --- like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s41">We did.</span> <span id="s42">The edict came, more and more.</span> <span id="s43">I remember when Hitler came on the radio or in the movie theater.</span> <span id="s44">We saw the news, and the pomp and the marching and the --- all the beauty of a Wagnerian night and I felt like a little mouse.</span> <span id="s45">All the goose steps were coming for me.</span> <span id="s46">But you joked, shook off.</span> <span id="s47">The next day was another day.</span> <span id="s48">School time came 1942, or ’41 when I finished junior high and I couldn’t go to high school because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s49">I couldn’t stay home either, just sit home, do nothing; so I started to work as a beautician where a richer Jewish kid could get into a different school, pay here and there.</span> <span id="s50">Slowly they went to school and who couldn’t, learned a trade like your father, like me.</span> <span id="s51">I was supposed to go into a Jewish ….</span> <span id="s52">Hungary had one Jewish schoolteacher’s school which didn’t take new pupils.</span> <span id="s53">They were not allowed and nobody else took me.</span> <span id="s54">So I learned and again life gone on.</span> <span id="s55">I had tutor who taught me when ‘everything will be peaceful again”, I could make my high school easier.</span> <span id="s56">I remember when Hitler walked into Poland.</span> <span id="s57">I remember some rumors.</span> <span id="s58">I knew my own family, friends; all of a sudden, we didn’t hear from them.</span> <span id="s59">So you grabbed a little tighter around you and loved a little more.</span> <span id="s60">And we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">1944, March 19, the Germans occupied Hungary.</span> <span id="s62">I was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s63">That was my big chance to recite in a big Jewish auditorium.</span> <span id="s64">I couldn’t and I sneaked back to my hometown Hatvan, which was not far from Budapest.</span> <span id="s65">Then the men were taken to working camp, all the men up to sixty.</span> <span id="s66">The women went home and came the edicts again.</span> <span id="s67">You had to put on the yellow star, you had to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s68">From the ghetto, you were taken out to a factory, a sugar factory.</span> <span id="s69">From there we were taken to unknown destination.</span> <span id="s70">Whoever was afraid was calmed down that you don’t have to be afraid, we will be taken to a camp --- not a camp, a town where all the Jews will be together.</span> <span id="s71">We’ll learn and we believed.</span> <span id="s72">That’s how it was . . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s73">I remember so well like yesterday when they took us out the first time to work in the fields.</span> <span id="s74">They took out 50 people from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s75">Meanwhile in the ghetto, they collected money, the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis, for us.</span> <span id="s76">My mother pulled me with her.</span> <span id="s77">That’s way, after a full day’s work, we were coming back and the people of this lovely little town stood there while we had to march in the middle of the gutter, singing and kissing the ground where the horses were going before.</span> <span id="s78">The people, they stood by and laughed and cheered and clapped.</span> <span id="s79">I remember the faces around me.</span> <span id="s80">I remember the fear of dying.</span> <span id="s81">Got me like a knife.</span> <span id="s82">I remember the hatred what came into me when I saw my so-called friends in the crowd laughing and pointing at me.</span> <span id="s83">I remember other times when my friend next door wouldn’t say hello to me when I had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s84">There were some nice people --- went out their way to say a kind word; probably very ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s85">But nobody raised a question, nobody asked why.</span> <span id="s86">All of a sudden, good law abiding citizens became lower than dirt.</span> <span id="s87">The property was taken, the freedom was taken away.</span> <span id="s88">Fear was planted.</span> <span id="s89">I saw people being beaten in the street and nobody came to rescue.</span> <span id="s90">I remember the Hungarian so-called police who beat us unmercifully, unmercifully.</span> <span id="s91">You learned to be quiet; you learned to be a Jew and talked about Palestine and you were no more Hungarians.</span> <span id="s92">I remember when we had to give in the jewelry, the radios, the bicycles, the record players, all the treasure, the jewelry, my mother’s wedding band.</span> <span id="s93">I remember when we were allowed only 50 pounds, excuse me, 100 pounds, 50 kilos out of the home to go to the inner ghetto.</span> <span id="s94">My mother saved, since I was a baby, my hope chest and tearing all up.</span> <span id="s95">The photo albums, tear out the pictures and leave my house.</span> <span id="s96">Everything on our back.</span> <span id="s97">My mother and I were the last to be taken out from our home because my father was so well liked, big deal, I loved him.</span> <span id="s98">I remember my mother’s tears and her cries when I took the beautiful and never used Czechoslovakian dishes, glass dishes, and cracking them together saying, if I can’t use it, nobody else should.</span> <span id="s99">She had a pearl necklace, Richleau pearl they call it here.</span> <span id="s100">It was not round shape, it’s more like different size, more like pear shape.</span> <span id="s101">I threw it into the bathroom, the toilet.</span> <span id="s102">If I couldn’t have it, nobody else will.</span> <span id="s103">But I remember my mother cleaning up the house before we left, it should be neat.</span> <span id="s104">I’m fighting with her, leave them and burn this and let not have --- they enjoy it and my mother smiled and said, oh, we’ll come back here.</span> <span id="s105">I also remember two peasants coming who loved my father and wanted to hide us like --- as we live in Yonkers, one in New Rochelle would hide me and the other would hide my mother in Hastings.</span> <span id="s106">Being we were so uninformed to know what’s coming and what’s going on in the world, my mother refused saying, I can’t go away from my child.</span> <span id="s107">Whatever happens, will happen with us two because I can’t be separated.</span> <span id="s108">Well, Mengele separated us, Dr. Mengele in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s109">My mother wanted to kill herself as we were going on this train to Auschwitz and I didn’t let her.</span> <span id="s110">I should have, maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s111">Anyhow, you learn to be a Jew very, very hardly with many, many, many pain and many disappointment.</span> <span id="s112">I would envy those who had faith, who was brought up as a religious Jewish kid because at least, they had some background information.</span> <span id="s113">I only was a Hungarian first.</span> <span id="s114">Oh, how I loved the gypsy music which was always playing and how much I loved the Hungarian poets.</span> <span id="s115">How heartily I recited.</span> <span id="s116">I learned about Jewish poets and I learned about Palestine.</span> <span id="s117">Our Jewish hierarchies, even our rabbi in that time didn’t approve of it.</span> <span id="s118">They only told us to follow the rules and follow the laws and nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s119">We are Hungarian and nothing could happen to us.</span> <span id="s120">Hungary will not let us go.</span> <span id="s121">Then you learn in the Eichmann time, that Hungary paid the German to take us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">June 12, 1944, we were taken from Hatvan into a freight train and we started our journey.</span> <span id="s123">June 15, we arrived to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s124">This was the first time I ever heard of the word, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s125">It was a big, immense place with horrible smell.</span> <span id="s126">People were running with sticks in pajamas, pajama-looking things, no hair.</span> <span id="s127">I asked my mother are we in an insane asylum?</span> <span id="s128">We were taken out from the train and all our valise, our papers, our identification are staying in the train.</span> <span id="s129">We have to go in front of the SS ---- we were selected, one to right, one to left.</span> <span id="s130">I was taken from my mother.</span> <span id="s131">I was sent to right.</span> <span id="s132">She was sent to left.</span> <span id="s133">My girlfriend who was in the next line heard Mengele and the foreman talking to my mother who was crying.</span> <span id="s134">Why are you crying?</span> <span id="s135">Your daughter is going ahead of you, waiting for you with coffee and bed.</span> <span id="s136">Just go with the rest.</span> <span id="s137">You’re so young and beautiful, shouldn’t have a big girl like yours, just go with the rest and you will see your daughter shortly.</span> <span id="s138">My mother went and I went.</span> <span id="s139">She was 38 years old.</span> <span id="s140">I was taken to a bathhouse.</span> <span id="s141">I had a belt, a wide leather belt which my mother sewed in money and a switch knife.</span> <span id="s142">If ever anybody tried to attack me, I should use it.</span> <span id="s143">Whoever heard that; you will be in rags, hairless, nameless, sometimes walking naked because there was no clothes for me.</span> <span id="s144">We were taken into a big barrack.</span> <span id="s145">You didn’t know who was there and there were about 1,000 people in one barrack.</span> <span id="s146">We were sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s147">Was no food, there was no toilet, there was no dignity.</span> <span id="s148">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s149">You get up at three in the morning, they counted you and then they herd you back again to the same room.</span> <span id="s150">You couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s151">You put your hand --- one put the hand on the hairless head just to see if it’s nightmare or if it’s real.</span> <span id="s152">Then I cried and I asked one of the kapo, a Slovakian girl, where’s my mother?</span> <span id="s153">She pointed to a chimney.</span> <span id="s154">She said she’s burning over there.</span> <span id="s155">Of course you couldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s156">You saw your friend, you didn’t see yourself and you started to laugh because you couldn’t recognize it in that condition.</span> <span id="s157">Then slowly it dawned on you that this is it, it’s real, it’s there and you lived.</span> <span id="s158">You try to adjust and form a new family, you had to belong.</span> <span id="s159">Somebody you have to love and love yourself and it was very hard there to love, even yourself or your neighbor.</span> <span id="s160">You fought for everything, a piece of apple on the floor, so nobody should step on you.</span> <span id="s161">And the bread, you had to hide it.</span> <span id="s162">I never hide my bread, I always ate it.</span> <span id="s163">I always was hungry, immensely hungry and hunger hurt.</span> <span id="s164">Believe me, hunger is pain.</span> <span id="s165">There were three things what hold me up high --- hold myself up high.</span> <span id="s166">I never stole from my fellow-inmates; I never fought for food; and I never sat on the “kuble”.</span> <span id="s167">The kuble was a barrel which I took out and brought in but I never sat on it.</span> <span id="s168">It was the lowest point --- lowest thing in my eyes, it was filled with diarrhea and everybody’s shit and everybody’s urine and it’s all over.</span> <span id="s169">I couldn’t sit on it; in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s170">But I got up in the morning and I took it out to the latrine before anybody.</span> <span id="s171">I was in the latrine committee rather than sit on it.</span> <span id="s172">It’s ridiculous, it’s stupid but it held me back.</span> <span id="s173">It’s called dignity.</span> <span id="s174">Human dignity for a sixteen year old.</span> <span id="s175">The food what we get was garbage.</span> <span id="s176">It was deliberately over salted if we get anything and then they didn’t give us water; or they give us black coffee without sugar or some kind of tea.</span> <span id="s177">It was too early yet in the stage to be able to eat it.</span> <span id="s178">We were in this place for about three weeks.</span> <span id="s179">At July, about two weeks when I was taken to Krakow Plaszow --- to me Krakow Plaszow was the worst place.</span> <span id="s180">It was a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s181">There we took out the marble grave markers were taken into Krakow to redone the gutters.</span> <span id="s182">Many times you hit into the earth and you came up with skeleton or piece of bone and heads and the work was horrible.</span> <span id="s183">It wasn’t productive work, it was sheer torture.</span> <span id="s184">We took how you call it --- gravestones, big stones.</span> <span id="s185">Six, seven, eight girls were taken as horses and had to pull wagons.</span> <span id="s186">There were beating, constant beating, big German shepherds were --- trained dogs to go back in after the woman’s breast and men’s testicles and pull them apart if one went out of the line.</span> <span id="s187">I saw the Gestapo beating and asking people, you know, for some stupid secrets.</span> <span id="s188">I saw them being tortured --- this is where I saw young children taken out and halfway alive still, burning on the fire and screaming.</span> <span id="s189">There was no God, God didn’t listen and I said there was no God.</span> <span id="s190">But still we tried.</span> <span id="s191">You had a human dignity and you choked down the garbage that was called food.</span> <span id="s192">When hunger was very hurting, you cried.</span> <span id="s193">Nobody else saw and the six, seven girls were band together, you had nobody else.</span> <span id="s194">They delegated one as a mother and took care.</span> <span id="s195">One went for water and one went for food and one tried to save the other.</span> <span id="s196">Keep up the spirits and we joked.</span> <span id="s197">Every time you felt like crying, then we laughed.</span> <span id="s198">One was an opera singer who sang and I recited poetry at night.</span> <span id="s199">Another teacher taught us something.</span> <span id="s200">We talked about resistance --- that was our resistance.</span> <span id="s201">They could not push us that low or that down.</span> <span id="s202">You hang on to humanity and they were gone.</span> <span id="s203">I became sick, I was taken to the hospital there in Krakow.</span> <span id="s204">I had typhoid fever and I lived it through.</span> <span id="s205">I sang.</span> <span id="s206">The Polish Jews, they were still in their ghettos and they had some --- some had food.</span> <span id="s207">So they told me to sing, they would give me food.</span> <span id="s208">I had fever and I sang and I sang.</span> <span id="s209">Sometimes I get food.</span> <span id="s210">Then there were rumors that we will be taken again.</span> <span id="s211">My friend came and sneaked me out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s212">Hid me in the so-called bed and we were taken out again back to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Krakow was the worst place for me and the worst was the captain on a white horse.</span> <span id="s214">I don’t know his name.</span> <span id="s215">I know he was hanged after.</span> <span id="s216">Krakow, I got so many beatings and I thought many times about killing myself.</span> <span id="s217">Can’t live like this --- going to the electric wire.</span> <span id="s218">I had a friend, her name was Kathy.</span> <span id="s219">Was a beautiful, intelligent, sweet girl, full of fire.</span> <span id="s220">She gave me a big speech.</span> <span id="s221">She told me that look at me, I eat all the shit what they giving here and I’ll go home and I’ll give it back.</span> <span id="s222">Everything I get and I live it through and look at me.</span> <span id="s223">She slipped and as she slipped, she was falling toward the wire.</span> <span id="s224">She grabbed the live wire and she was dead in a second, that was Kathy.</span> <span id="s225">There were other girls, a girl friend, Susie.</span> <span id="s226">Her eye was --- one of the kapo started to hit her and hit her in the eyes.</span> <span id="s227">Her eyes were coming out.</span> <span id="s228">She was blinded in one eye.</span> <span id="s229">There were constant beating and fighting and killing.</span> <span id="s230">If not the German, then the Jewish kapos.</span> <span id="s231">For a gold tooth, they killed people and pulled out their teeth.</span> <span id="s232">Food was everything.</span> <span id="s233">It was something what constantly was on everybody’s thought and we became skinnier and sicker and filled with boils and ragged.</span> <span id="s234">They only gave us rags and lice with them.</span> <span id="s235">We had horrible, horrible time.</span> <span id="s236">The fear from one another, from one Jew to the other and the German laughter and they came in clean beautiful clothes and touched us with a white glove only.</span> <span id="s237">You felt lower and lower.</span> <span id="s238">Then you said no, I’m not lower, I’m just as good, I’m better than them.</span> <span id="s239">There was a young German man, a German SS, who saw me once.</span> <span id="s240">It was in August, we were working in the field and it was a peculiar weather.</span> <span id="s241">It was extremely cold in the morning and the night but it was very hot in the daytime.</span> <span id="s242">He was drinking from his canteen.</span> <span id="s243">As he was drinking, I was swallowing.</span> <span id="s244">He turned around and he offered me his drink from his own canteen.</span> <span id="s245">To me, I was in rags and filth and I looked at him and I said, you’re offering me?</span> <span id="s246">He said, yes, why not?</span> <span id="s247">I don’t hate you.</span> <span id="s248">I looked at him and I said then how could you look around and see this?</span> <span id="s249">He said, I don’t care, I’m only following orders.</span> <span id="s250">Tomorrow I’ll shoot you without a doubt if they tell me to do so.</span> <span id="s251">I looked at him and I said, oh, just tell me one thing, how could you sleep after this?</span> <span id="s252">How could you put your head down and go to church or tend to your friend, go home and kiss a girl.</span> <span id="s253">Could you ever live like normal people again.</span> <span id="s254">He said, oh yes, I’m only following orders.</span> <span id="s255">This was already July, 1944 when the Americans were already in France.</span> <span id="s256">I didn’t know about my father.</span> <span id="s257">I didn’t believe that my mother was dead.</span> <span id="s258">We left again and we hoped again.</span> <span id="s259">The rumors were flying that tomorrow we’re going home.</span> <span id="s260">Or we will be away from here or they’re taking us here or there.</span> <span id="s261">You hang on to hopes.</span> <span id="s262">I remember when we were in that assassination against Hitler, they tried --- an attempt to assassinate him.</span> <span id="s263">Every tenth of the prisoner was killed.</span> <span id="s264">We didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s265">I remember when they were taken from us.</span> <span id="s266">It was extremely quiet in our barracks.</span> <span id="s267">Somebody started to pray.</span> <span id="s268">That passed too.</span> <span id="s269">I remember rape was done to us.</span> <span id="s270">Not by Germans, by kapos.</span> <span id="s271">Although it didn’t have to be rapes because there was a price.</span> <span id="s272">A girl’s price was a piece of buttered bread, a women’s price on the market was a piece of bread and an onion because was less work.</span> <span id="s273">I never was tempted to go there.</span> <span id="s274">Was too low.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe it would be a little more, I might have been.</span> <span id="s276">Hunger is very painful.</span> <span id="s277">I was constantly, constantly hungry and thirsty.</span> <span id="s278">I find my friend, my all-time best friend since childhood, selling me water for bread.</span> <span id="s279">In August, we were taken, evacuated from the Krakow Plaszow ghetto, we were taken back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s280">That was a three days’ trip.</span> <span id="s281">This is the first time they gave us herring in August, and didn’t give us water for three days.</span> <span id="s282">They put us in a train.</span> <span id="s283">First 80 people in a freight train.</span> <span id="s284">Then they put more and more and more into it.</span> <span id="s285">People went absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s286">Hunger hurt but thirst is much worse.</span> <span id="s287">There were people who drank their own urine and drank their blood and died.</span> <span id="s288">Everybody was fighting for just to put down their feet to be able to stand.</span> <span id="s289">We throwed the dead ones in one end of the train.</span> <span id="s290">Then we arrive in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s291">Oh yeah, in between time, they once opened the train --- we were yelling for water, begging for water.</span> <span id="s292">One soldier came with water and threw at us, wouldn’t let us drink.</span> <span id="s293">We arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s294">There was again a selection and I was again survived.</span> <span id="s295">I was sleeping another barrack the whole night.</span> <span id="s296">I was with my aunt from night to morning and I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s297">She only find me in the morning when we spending the night to be taken to another part of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s298">She was working near the crematorium.</span> <span id="s299">She was working with the Canadians, the white kerchiefs, “girls”.</span> <span id="s300">They had a “good position”.</span> <span id="s301">They could get the food, they were separating the clothing and food from the deported luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">(End of Tape 1, Side A) I asked her where my mother was and she told me about the crematorium.</span> <span id="s303">I was beaten and I saw her being beaten.</span> <span id="s304">She spit out her tooth and I spit out two tooth.</span> <span id="s305">But I had somebody, I know that somebody in my family was alive in that time.</span> <span id="s306">I learned the fact that my grandmother died, my mother died, my cousins died and I believed that first kapo who told me that they are burning people here.</span> <span id="s307">That was the first time I believed it.</span> <span id="s308">I didn’t want to live nor did I want to die any more.</span> <span id="s309">I didn’t fought to be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">I was just lucky or unlucky.</span> <span id="s311">Anybody, any survivor who says to you or to anybody, I was lucky because I did this so I survived.</span> <span id="s312">Or I did that and I was smart or I did this and that’s why I survived.</span> <span id="s313">They are all lying.</span> <span id="s314">Or making it --- they just believe in that because it was sheer luck who came back and who didn’t.</span> <span id="s315">Just sheer luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">So we were in Auschwitz again.</span> <span id="s317">And this time, we had pritches, bunk beds, we had bad.</span> <span id="s318">We got gray uniforms, not the stripe, just plain gray uniform.</span> <span id="s319">We were deloused and we still weren’t working.</span> <span id="s320">We were beaten every time somebody was hanging out of line and any little amount of “undisciplined behavior” was good thing for beating.</span> <span id="s321">The dead was still counted.</span> <span id="s322">Then in September we were taken into Augsburg factory where we working in an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s323">That saved my life. . . . .</span> <span id="s324">We were tattooed in Auschwitz in our hand.</span> <span id="s325">We got again the gray uniform.</span> <span id="s326">We went through again a selection.</span> <span id="s327">Again the usual freight train ride.</span> <span id="s328">Five hundred of us were taken to Augsburg into a factory where the first time I was working outside in Augsburg for the bomb.</span> <span id="s329">Cleaning up after the bombing.</span> <span id="s330">Many times I found food put down where we were expected to go.</span> <span id="s331">October came and we heard about Horthy, our Hungarian governor going away to Germany.</span> <span id="s332">No more is operating from the German army and then the afternoon we heard that the Hungarian SS party took over the governments.</span> <span id="s333">Again we grouped together.</span> <span id="s334">We had a mother, Marta and I had a friend, Veronica and another friend who was actually from Hatvan, my hometown.</span> <span id="s335">Her name was Elizabeth, she was very good to me.</span> <span id="s336">Very good it mean always food.</span> <span id="s337">She gave me food.</span> <span id="s338">She gave me her portion.</span> <span id="s339">She was a decent girl otherwise.</span> <span id="s340">Marta was our mother and we cling together.</span> <span id="s341">We talked, talked about getting out, when will be, if it will be over.</span> <span id="s342">We’ll be together.</span> <span id="s343">We gave up the hope that we will meet anybody or find our family more or less.</span> <span id="s344">Sometimes we believed that we will reach Palestine --- sometimes we didn’t that we ever will wake up even the next day.</span> <span id="s345">We were very happy when the Americans bombed the city or even our factory.</span> <span id="s346">We cared nothing of being alive.</span> <span id="s347">It was unimportant any more.</span> <span id="s348">The importance were that it should be heard about it.</span> <span id="s349">The world Jewry should know about it.</span> <span id="s350">That Hitler should be defeated.</span> <span id="s351">Rumors were constantly flying.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">When I was working finally in the factory itself, after two or three months of outside duty, I got into, in November, into the factory --- which again I was lucky because it saved me.</span> <span id="s353">I was working next to a German woman one side and next to a German man on the other side so there was no way to sabotaging work.</span> <span id="s354">Whatever we done, it went through another German hand.</span> <span id="s355">One German man, a beautiful human being, even though they didn’t have much to eat, he gave us two heflling, the two prisoners, the two jailbirds, food every morning.</span> <span id="s356">I find food in my place and my friend find food next to her.</span> <span id="s357">There was washing facility here and more or less better food.</span> <span id="s358">The winter we survived.</span> <span id="s359">I learned to walk in wooden shoes or without shoes.</span> <span id="s360">I learned to sleep while I was working or standing.</span> <span id="s361">I had blood poisoning Christmas time.</span> <span id="s362">I was operated on my arms and we had a Jewish doctor with us.</span> <span id="s363">Told me that they will cut off my arm.</span> <span id="s364">I had about 104, 105 fever and I survived that without an aspirin.</span> <span id="s365">I woke up after the operation and I tried to touch my arm and it was there.</span> <span id="s366">.</span> <span id="s367">I went further and my hand was there but I was afraid to touch my finger, my finger was there.</span> <span id="s368">So I was very lucky all over.</span> <span id="s369">I had pleurisy in that place.</span> <span id="s370">Also I survived that without aspirin even.</span> <span id="s371">I was taken out to take out the bomb, to put it out.</span> <span id="s372">The German thought we are very brave but it was no fear in us.</span> <span id="s373">It did not matter if we dead or alive or whatever; but it mattered if a bomb fell on them.</span> <span id="s374">We were always very happy when the American fighters came, the airplane came and the bombing was beautiful to our eyes.</span> <span id="s375">That’s how we were, wished to die.</span> <span id="s376">Whenever we were taken, they went to the shelter --- we were just taken down into a place where we couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s377">It was delightful.</span> <span id="s378">We sang, we ate our food --- whoever saved it.</span> <span id="s379">I never saved my food, I was very happy to eat it.</span> <span id="s380">Almost all of us survived in that place until March when we were taken out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">We were taken to Muehldorf-Waldlager.</span> <span id="s382">In that place, my introduction to the place were one of the young schriber saw me ---- schriber is a writer who wrote the people’s name and numbers in --- he looked up and he said to me, oh my sister.</span> <span id="s383">I said you are mistaken, I am not your sister.</span> <span id="s384">He took my name, my number, excuse me, he was kissing me.</span> <span id="s385">He jumped up and kissed me, oh, my sister, my dear sister.</span> <span id="s386">I said no I’m not your sister and I told him where I come from and my name and serial number.</span> <span id="s387">After that, he very quietly gave me the place where to go which was --- in there we were sleeping on the good earth.</span> <span id="s388">There was a trench between the beds.</span> <span id="s389">There was a trench where we were walking and there was a tent over us.</span> <span id="s390">Again I saw a man, a skeleton man around us.</span> <span id="s391">The place was surrounded by electric wire but between one camp to the other, between one section to the other, there was just normal wires.</span> <span id="s392">I went back to my barrack or whatever you --- tent, and I get a message from one of the longer-time inmate that I was called to the wire where the man meets woman.</span> <span id="s393">These were the hierarchies, the kapos, the doctors, etc., they had more energy, more food in them to even be able to think, not necessarily sex, but be more than human who needed companion rather than all thinking of food and immediate danger, I think.</span> <span id="s394">Anyhow, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s395">The second day I was put to work.</span> <span id="s396">I was working near the kitchen and at night again I got a call to go out to the wire to meet this schriber.</span> <span id="s397">I was, I don’t know, proud or stupid or what have you --- so I send back a message that I am not a cow to be looked over and leave me alone.</span> <span id="s398">Well, next day, I was out to work in an underground airport.</span> <span id="s399">This was in 1945, March.</span> <span id="s400">They put cement on my shoulder which I supposed to climb with two flights up.</span> <span id="s401">The cement was about 25 kilo, about 50 pounds and to take it up two flights.</span> <span id="s402">I just --- they put it on my shoulder and I just fell down with it.</span> <span id="s403">They put it on again my shoulder and I fell with it.</span> <span id="s404">So I was beaten back, beaten from the work back to the camp which was about a good kilometer.</span> <span id="s405">At the door, he was receiving this boy.</span> <span id="s406">His name was Eddy Binbaum from Kejnark who was waiting there and took my number, took my name, my number.</span> <span id="s407">It wasn’t the name only, the number.</span> <span id="s408">He started --- as I left he whispered to me and he said, now you coming to the wire and I said, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s409">I went there and we talked.</span> <span id="s410">He explained that he thought I was his long lost sister and he was in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s411">He gavc me food through the gates and I was put to a very easy job.</span> <span id="s412">I went into the forest collecting acorn.</span> <span id="s413">I got even a toothbrush which I didn’t see for a year, almost a year.</span> <span id="s414">I saw him through the gates and we talked.</span> <span id="s415">I never liked him.</span> <span id="s416">I always had a fear in me for him, because of him, because of his behavior.</span> <span id="s417">I learned a great deal from this experience.</span> <span id="s418">That you --- in the circumstances where you are, you never know what you will do just to survive.</span> <span id="s419">Because if that boy would have asked me in that particular time, after the beating, that if I have to go back there or lay down for him, I would have laid down for him.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t think I would ever be ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t know, it never come to that point.</span> <span id="s422">But I could understand a little more.</span> <span id="s423">Anyhow I come back to this part for understanding.</span> <span id="s424">Then we were there until April.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">On April 24, no April 23, there was an airplane, a bombing and many prisoners escaped.</span> <span id="s426">They put a --- what you call it, a laousserstrauser --- it meant a punishment stripe into my starting-to-grow hair.</span> <span id="s427">It’s about three inches with cut into the middle of your head completely, like an Indian or like the Hara Krishna people except it was reversed.</span> <span id="s428">Anyhow I was taken to the train with the rest of the 500 girls and the rest of the camp.</span> <span id="s429">All of a sudden, this schriber came with two SS men and called my name and number.</span> <span id="s430">He told the head SS that I’m not able to travel, I had typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s431">I should go back with him to the camp.</span> <span id="s432">As I told you, I had some fear in me.</span> <span id="s433">I was climbing down when people who were with me from my town; they told me, don’t go.</span> <span id="s434">You will be a whore.</span> <span id="s435">You will be his lover and that’s why he’s doing it.</span> <span id="s436">So I didn’t.</span> <span id="s437">I went down and said I’m much better.</span> <span id="s438">I’m all right now and I shouldn’t be taken back.</span> <span id="s439">This boy quietly told me that it cost him a lot of money to take me out of the --- a lot of gold, not money --- to take me out of the transport because they are going into Innsbruck and they will kill us all with a benzine injection.</span> <span id="s440">Benzine injection that we could burn faster.</span> <span id="s441">Meanwhile every time we left the camp, like Augsburg or Mueldorf or Waldlager, we saw the Germans trying to erase all track of the camp.</span> <span id="s442">The papers and everything was burning and they were in a mad rush to clean up after them.</span> <span id="s443">That’s the time when my group swore that if any of us will be alive, we will talk so it shouldn’t be forgotten no matter how much the Germans, the SS were trying to cover up.</span> <span id="s444">Whoever will survive will talk.</span> <span id="s445">So with this knowledge of benzine injections, I climbed back to the train and sat there.</span> <span id="s446">I didn’t tell nobody our future.</span> <span id="s447">I figured whatever happens to the rest, should happen to me.</span> <span id="s448">Sit there.</span> <span id="s449">April 27, they opened the train, the Germans, and they said we are free.</span> <span id="s450">It was a beautiful, sunny, gorgeous afternoon.</span> <span id="s451">The town name is Poing, it was spring.</span> <span id="s452">Everybody started to run away from the train.</span> <span id="s453">I climbed down and I became hysterical.</span> <span id="s454">I cried and I stood by the train and I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s455">I kissed the earth.</span> <span id="s456">I just got paralyzed, I just couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s457">My friends were trying to pull me away from the train.</span> <span id="s458">I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s459">I was skinny and the knowledge of impending death and the benzine injections in my head and keeping it secret was just too much.</span> <span id="s460">All of a sudden, the guards, they say we were free.</span> <span id="s461">It was about a good five minutes and then we heard the machine guns.</span> <span id="s462">We were completely surrounded by other SS and like a sickle, I don’t know how you say, when you see that with the thing in his hand, death and sickle, just went with the machine gun, went in a complete circle.</span> <span id="s463">I saw the girls who were together, some of them from the beginning, falling.</span> <span id="s464">Then I could get up --- oh I jumped, I jumped back to the train, back to the freight train and we started to pull back our comrades, the girls who will be able to pick up.</span> <span id="s465">The train started again and April 28, the American bomb came and started to machine gun our train because the Germans at Poing put an anti-aircraft wagon to our train.</span> <span id="s466">They started to shoot the American airplane.</span> <span id="s467">The Americans came down and, in return, they started to machine-gun us.</span> <span id="s468">That train ride was my lowest_________, the lowest point.</span> <span id="s469">I know that I will become a musleman after that.</span> <span id="s470">It meant not only will you be dead --- I gave up.</span> <span id="s471">I know the minute when I give up.</span> <span id="s472">In that point, when I gave up, I remember as yesterday.</span> <span id="s473">I even remember better than yesterday.</span> <span id="s474">I was in the train and somebody left a piece of bread, a crumb.</span> <span id="s475">I had a very big struggle in me.</span> <span id="s476">To steal it or not to steal it.</span> <span id="s477">When I turned around, somebody else stole it and there was a big fight between the girls.</span> <span id="s478">We get low and we were dirty.</span> <span id="s479">We were covered with filth and was thinking, look at myself and I said, there is no use.</span> <span id="s480">Maybe the Germans are right; that we shouldn’t be alive.</span> <span id="s481">When the machine guns started, I was standing in a corner where there was a little hole looking out the passing wheels.</span> <span id="s482">Everybody who had somebody who was standing with me there, two of my girlfriends, Kathy S and Lili, they have somebody pull them down.</span> <span id="s483">Made room for them to lay down so that machine guns shouldn’t hit them.</span> <span id="s484">I was standing there and nobody picked me or pulled me down no matter how much they liked me.</span> <span id="s485">There was no way to throw myself.</span> <span id="s486">The rest of the skeletons were dead people and hurt people.</span> <span id="s487">Somebody, some man had a striped uniform.</span> <span id="s488">They pushed it out to show the American raiders.</span> <span id="s489">Their machine gun stopped.</span> <span id="s490">They went and gone around and meanwhile I said my goodbyes in my little life, in my little head to everybody.</span> <span id="s491">I counted whom I will see again in other world.</span> <span id="s492">I was very sure that that’s it, that it’s finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">May 1st in the morning, our camp boys opened the train and they said, the Americans are here.</span> <span id="s494">I borned, I reborn May 1st.</span> <span id="s495">I was 22 kilos which is about forty pounds.</span> <span id="s496">I remember an American soldier picked me up and I was begging him not to give me back to the German again and then I don’t know nothing for a week.</span> <span id="s497">I was very lucky again.</span> <span id="s498">A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Gatheish Gabol found me and he took me to Partenkirchen to a hospital for a week.</span> <span id="s499">He didn’t give me food which was very good because anybody who got food in the belly in the first couple of days, they died.</span> <span id="s500">Well, that’s my story.</span> <span id="s501">I was liberated at Seeshaupt, taken to Munich, then to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Then I was in an UNRA camp till September.</span> <span id="s503">I had many experience there.</span> <span id="s504">I went home to find my father.</span> <span id="s505">Tried to pick up life.</span> <span id="s506">Met my husband, lost my first child, waited to go to either Israel or America.</span> <span id="s507">Israel, I mean Palestine, in that time there was still the camps in Cyprus which I couldn’t bear to go.</span> <span id="s508">We came to America.</span> <span id="s509">I picked up my life.</span> <span id="s510">I’m happy to be alive.</span> <span id="s511">Mostly I enjoy every minute.</span> <span id="s512">I gain many thing by this experience.</span> <span id="s513">I know I do.</span> <span id="s514">I am a different person.</span> <span id="s515">I was a different person when I came out of camp.</span> <span id="s516">Now that the question is up and people are asking and there is interest in our stories, it’s easier for me to --- finally after 33 years --- to heal my wounds.</span> <span id="s517">I was an atheist when I came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s518">Then I became an agnostic and my children born and raised in.</span> <span id="s519">When Eichmann was caught, it didn’t matter to me that they will hang him or not.</span> <span id="s520">It made me happy that there is a trial, there was a trial.</span> <span id="s521">When the first American turncoats were showed, I became more understanding about a Jewish turncoat or kapos or collaborators.</span> <span id="s522">When you seventeen, everything black and white; when you fifty-one, you can see gray.</span> <span id="s523">I don’t know if I would be --- how I would react if it would have been presented with the same situation that they were, those kapos.</span> <span id="s524">.</span> <span id="s525">I know now that the Germans deliberately picked mostly the low people of our people to --- the opportunities to --- who were able to take these.</span> <span id="s526">They did it deliberately so that we could be more angry with what was immediate object to us, another hefling________ another prisoner, rather than the immaculate god-like clean Germans.</span> <span id="s527">Nevertheless, when an American Jew says I’m proud to be a Jew, I think of the kapos.</span> <span id="s528">I’m not proud to be anything.</span> <span id="s529">I’m proud to be me.</span> <span id="s530">I’m proud to be a human being.</span> <span id="s531">Maybe, just maybe there is a little saying what I read somewhere -- if anybody else, not the Jewish people, would have been put in the same situation, they wouldn’t only fight with mouth, they probably would kill each other -- which didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">I learned human nature.</span> <span id="s533">Nobody’s perfect including myself.</span> <span id="s534">I learned tolerance on many, many things but I can’t tolerate self-pity.</span> <span id="s535">I very seldom indulge pity in me, for me.</span> <span id="s536">I’m like the steel; I love my family probably more than it’s normal but they are the most important thing to me after my freedom --- before my freedom.</span> <span id="s537">They first and then freedom.</span> <span id="s538">It’s nice to have nice things but I could be very well without it.</span> <span id="s539">Whenever I felt low, I have to think very far, how lower I was before so everything after that is just high up.</span> <span id="s540">It’s hard for me to see the flower picked because I know it will die but everything is already easy after that experience.</span> <span id="s541">You can’t be afraid of dying.</span> <span id="s542">I’m neither afraid of aging.</span> <span id="s543">When you were sixteen and never thought you will be 17, you’re just not afraid of it, of dying, or aging.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Israel, when I went to Israel, I made peace with God.</span> <span id="s545">I got my answer, my own answer.</span> <span id="s546">I know the world would never allow Israel to come in existence if not six million martyrs on their part.</span> <span id="s547">Oh, yeah, I have guilt too.</span> <span id="s548">It was a very, very deep guilt that I’m alive while the others didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s550">Somehow I always knew.</span> <span id="s551">I know in my head, I didn’t do nothing to be here and I was just lucky.</span> <span id="s552">But this guilt was persisting and the only way to press this was to talk the way I promised them.</span> <span id="s553">And I think I did.</span> <span id="s554">Although people said we are opportunists and liked to be pitied and so on.</span> <span id="s555">It wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s556">I t was just sheer_________ frustration that they didn’t want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">I had beautiful comrades, had beautiful experiences with them.</span> <span id="s558">I had friends who find their own potato and gave me half of it, when there was no food.</span> <span id="s559">The same token, I steal for them and I was beaten.</span> <span id="s560">Borach but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s561">We cried at night when nobody else saw us.</span> <span id="s562">You could be sure the other person turned around and said don’t cry and started to tell you something with a funny and you laughed.</span> <span id="s563">We tried to give each other a spirit to go on.</span> <span id="s564">When there was no hope, we created.</span> <span id="s565">You know you lie with the optimism, nevertheless you try.</span> <span id="s566">I had horrors, I saw unbelievable horrors.</span> <span id="s567">I saw babies being killed in fire when they weren’t completely dead yet.</span> <span id="s568">I saw dogs tearing woman’s breasts.</span> <span id="s569">I saw fighting like cats and dogs for a piece of breadcrumb.</span> <span id="s570">I liced (?)</span> <span id="s571">, oh boy do I lice.</span> <span id="s572">When I was filled with boils and our feet hurted and still you could laugh.</span> <span id="s573">Still you recited poetry.</span> <span id="s574">Still there was a woman who talked about Shakespeare there and the other one who went to the Bible, without the book, only in her head.</span> <span id="s575">There were girls who for eleven months didn’t eat a piece of crappy meat what they gave, wouldn’t eat it and kept the religion as it should be kept with the laws.</span> <span id="s576">I learned that it’s easy to be nasty --- by the same token light up; the world lights up with a good word.</span> <span id="s577">I learn that it’s easy to say bad things to the other in anger.</span> <span id="s578">I learned to say the good things which make the world a nicer place.</span> <span id="s579">(End of Side B, Tape 1) But in your heart when you talk all the atrocities, all the horror, all the pain, the hunger, the thirst, the humiliation, the hurt, the worry about your relatives, the pain what is unbearable when you see your friend die next to you, the lice bites, the fever without aspirin, without water, itching, filth.</span> <span id="s580">I saw in Krakow Plaszow I a hospital when a baby is born and one of the SS came in and tear it apart.</span> <span id="s581">I saw a girl, after her mother was beaten, ran to the German and held his uniform and yelled, don’t you have a mother?</span> <span id="s582">Both of them were killed just for holding on to his uniform.</span> <span id="s583">They talking about resistance.</span> <span id="s584">How could you resist when absolute indifference surround you?</span> <span id="s585">Not to talk about those people really hated you; but the rest, the good --- the nice people who just didn’t care.</span> <span id="s586">It didn’t hit them, didn’t happen to them.</span> <span id="s587">There were many people with us but it wasn’t the same.</span> <span id="s588">When you are alone, completely alone in the world, and you are surrounded by hate, you become timid.</span> <span id="s589">The resistance just --- there was resistance --- just to stay alive was a form of resistance.</span> <span id="s590">When you recited poetry, that was a form of resistance.</span> <span id="s591">But still --- with all these odds, you are still human, that was a form of resistance.</span> <span id="s592">When you walked in the snow barefooted because the wooden shoes, the Holland type of wooden shoes which everybody got the same size, didn’t fit on your feet and you had to run and rush or else you would be punished.</span> <span id="s593">You walked barefoot and still you could laugh and look at their eyes and keep your head up and say, I might be lower than you but I’m just as human being and maybe much better than you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">There were many, as I started to say, many people who were not Jewish also in camps.</span> <span id="s595">American prisoners and Russian prisoners and Polish prisoners-of-war; they had it a little easier, a little better.</span> <span id="s596">It wasn’t that absolute aloneness, the nothingness behind it.</span> <span id="s597">It wasn’t necessarily their family worried, where is their mother, where is their father, were they killed and why?</span> <span id="s598">It wasn’t a hate surrounding -- the neighbors spit on you and so on.</span> <span id="s599">There were Christian wives or husbands who went into the camp deliberately and I definitely take off my hat to them.</span> <span id="s600">They were just in the same boat as we were.</span> <span id="s601">They were our comrades even if they weren’t Jews, they were my sisters, my blood brothers and I give them credit.</span> <span id="s602">I don’t have any notes, I’m doing this just on the spur of the moment and if I’m jumping here and there you’ll have to excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">I want to talk about after liberation a little bit to finish my story.</span> <span id="s604">After I was out of the hospital, I went to the United Nations Restitution Action, I think that means UNRA camp.</span> <span id="s605">We were there from May to September, I got home, back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s606">During that time, I personally again could only talk about my experience.</span> <span id="s607">Where I found friends,___________ who took me out from Muenicle to Dachau where he was working in the American kitchen and saved my life by giving me food and shelter.</span> <span id="s608">In there, there was a time of my life when I didn’t belong to anybody.</span> <span id="s609">I didn’t had to be account for anything, perfect absolute freedom.</span> <span id="s610">I done what I pleased, I went wherever I went.</span> <span id="s611">I know that we either go to Palestine there when the Haganah people came up for us.</span> <span id="s612">Our group decided to go first to Hungary to see if maybe somebody alive.</span> <span id="s613">From that time, I would have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s614">Probably would never be in here, meet my husband, so who knows what was right, who knows what was wrong.</span> <span id="s615">Anyhow I didn’t, I went back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s616">Meanwhile let’s go back to the UN camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">We got food, we got shelter, we got clothes.</span> <span id="s618">There was no worry where the food was coming from.</span> <span id="s619">The most important thing still was food to your stomach and that was done.</span> <span id="s620">There was a relative freedom in it.</span> <span id="s621">Being in jail, everything was beautiful.</span> <span id="s622">Being in jail and out of jail, it was everything beautiful.</span> <span id="s623">The young friends and all these.</span> <span id="s624">I again recited poetry.</span> <span id="s625">I lived with my so-called new family.</span> <span id="s626">We were responsible only for teach other, to each other.</span> <span id="s627">I was well liked.</span> <span id="s628">I went to camp to camp to recite poetry.</span> <span id="s629">I was in the American entertainment committee which meant that they took us to all these UNRA camps.</span> <span id="s630">I met many people, of course, whenever we meet, we always ask, you was with Hatvan?</span> <span id="s631">The people from Hatvan?</span> <span id="s632">Or did you meet people from Satoralia, Whely, Erdoebene?</span> <span id="s633">Where I -- my grandparents came and so on.</span> <span id="s634">You recuperated slowly.</span> <span id="s635">You had no outside contact with anybody beside your friends and beside your fellow liberated inmates.</span> <span id="s636">Then in September, we were taken back to Hungary; also again of course, in freight train but in much better condition, with food, with shelter, with everything.</span> <span id="s637">One of my friend who was two days before me, came home, came back to Hungary; waited the Hungarian border and told me that my father is waiting for me at the station.</span> <span id="s638">Well, when I saw him, I thought he will die.</span> <span id="s639">He was skinny, he was ragged.</span> <span id="s640">He was liberated January and after January every single train he waited till he heard that I’m alive.</span> <span id="s641">He waited after that every single train again until I came home and it left a toll on him.</span> <span id="s642">Then I became sick, I had again a pleurisy and I was taken to the mountain, my grandparent’s house.</span> <span id="s643">I met Ernie, fell in love, we got married and we had a plan to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s644">We went into a Hachshara, a aliyah camp and I became pregnant.</span> <span id="s645">There was no transports going to Palestine because most of the transports were caught in and was taken to Cyprus so we decided to get in touch with my uncle in France.</span> <span id="s646">He gave us working papers so we will be able to leave legally Hungary.</span> <span id="s647">I had no bad time after the war in Hungary but I never went home to Hatvan.</span> <span id="s648">I just couldn’t bear the thought to go to Hatvan.</span> <span id="s649">I felt if I go near my house and I see something of my mother laying somewhere, I will run amok.</span> <span id="s650">So Hatvan was no more in my eyes.</span> <span id="s651">I had a baby, a preemie baby.</span> <span id="s652">We tried to keep her alive for two months and then she died.</span> <span id="s653">Then we left to France.</span> <span id="s654">We lived in Lyon for two years.</span> <span id="s655">Put in legal paper for either America or Palestine, to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s656">My father, meanwhile, was already in America and family meant an awful lot to me.</span> <span id="s657">I knew that I have a lot of family here.</span> <span id="s658">So the paper came through and we did came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">We started anew and started from way bottom.</span> <span id="s660">Nobody helped us, thank God.</span> <span id="s661">Whatever we made, it was my husband’s two hands.</span> <span id="s662">He started right away a little shop in the neighborhood and went to work.</span> <span id="s663">Then I became pregnant with my Kathy which was my happiest moment in my life because after the first baby I had to wait for four years till I was allowed to become pregnant.</span> <span id="s664">I had doubts that I could be pregnant anymore.</span> <span id="s665">We struggled and made a life and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s666">I am happy.</span> <span id="s667">I have three beautiful daughters.</span> <span id="s668">Ernie --- Ernest ---and I raised them the best of our knowledge, the best to our ability.</span> <span id="s669">There are times when I couldn’t console them as maybe other mothers could because their problem or their cry was so ridiculous to me after I went through, that I couldn’t feel sorry for something childish like not getting the good dress or what she wanted.</span> <span id="s670">I can’t tolerate self- pity as I said before, on me, or on anybody.</span> <span id="s671">I tried my best with my children.</span> <span id="s672">I made many mistakes, of course.</span> <span id="s673">But all the mistakes was honest mistakes, not being -- that’s one thing to hurt them.</span> <span id="s674">I love them more maybe than anybody else loved their child because to me it means a little more to have a family than somebody who gets it easy, got it easy.</span> <span id="s675">I love very deeply.</span> <span id="s676">I try to be tolerant to other people.</span> <span id="s677">Well, this is my story.</span> <span id="s678">I hope that little bit we learn from each --- from somebody else’s experience and it shouldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s679">Not to me, not to the Jews, not to colored man, a black man, or a yellow man, or a Christian, or a Vietnamese, or anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">I love this country.</span> <span id="s681">It gave me shelter.</span> <span id="s682">I’m full and equal citizen.</span> <span id="s683">I have a vote.</span> <span id="s684">I came with nothing to this country and I built up a nice life.</span> <span id="s685">I like the American people who might be a little more naïve than the European but they are beautiful, they are helpful.</span> <span id="s686">I love the youth of America who cares for Vietnam and the black people.</span> <span id="s687">I love Israel.</span> <span id="s688">I think it’s only existing because six million died for it and people working for it.</span> <span id="s689">I’m no Hungarian any more.</span> <span id="s690">I am American and I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s691">It is beautiful to me to look out the window when it’s raining and I know that I have a shelter over my head and I have clothes to keep me warm.</span> <span id="s692">The smile of my children.</span> <span id="s693">I grew up a lot in eleven months and it always will be with me.</span> <span id="s694">I’m far from my friends.</span> <span id="s695">We were thrown all over the world.</span> <span id="s696">They got married and I got married.</span> <span id="s697">I don’t know their married name and they don’t know mine, or so few who does.</span> <span id="s698">I met fellow camp people.</span> <span id="s699">We ever meet, it’s like big family.</span> <span id="s700">Whenever I meet anybody with the same tattoo on their had as mine, they are close to me even if I wouldn’t know their name, closer to me than anybody else could be.</span> <span id="s701">We came to this country with nothing.</span> <span id="s702">We brought out my father-in-law and mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s703">Then we helped out my sister-in-law and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s704">We took out my Hungarian --- my sister-in-law is still in Hungary for twice to visit and my niece.</span> <span id="s705">Once we went back to Hungary and the first time I went back to Hatvan, my little town.</span> <span id="s706">I found nobody, but nobody there.</span> <span id="s707">There was not one Jew left in Hatvan.</span> <span id="s708">I’m not looking forward to go again to Hungary although I probably will, maybe this summer to see my niece getting married.</span> <span id="s709">I don’t blame the people who completely assimilated over there, became Hungarianized.</span> <span id="s710">That much that they changed their name and became non-Jews or nothing, no religion or no nothing.</span> <span id="s711">They want just to be left alone, not to be reminded, not to be anything.</span> <span id="s712">They couldn’t left Hungary so they have to live their life the way they can.</span> <span id="s713">.</span> <span id="s714">I try to live my life the way I see it fit.</span> <span id="s715">I don’t think I could try to understand those people who are here and don’t want to remember being Jews.</span> <span id="s716">They just want to be completely assimilated.</span> <span id="s717">I hope the world will let them forget everything but I doubt.</span> <span id="s718">As long as there is anti-Jewish joke or anti-Semitism open or quiet, I fight against it.</span> <span id="s719">I belong to B’nai Brith --- I started to belong when I came here and heard the first time about it when I didn’t know the language yet.</span> <span id="s720">The Anti-Defamation League because I know what it could happen.</span> <span id="s721">But as long as I’m here and not in Israel, I am very thankful for this country what they done for me personally.</span> <span id="s722">I have deep wounds but now it starts to heal.</span> <span id="s723">Now that people are asking questions and it won’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s724">The libraries are full with each and everyone individual stories and it will become more and more I’m sure.</span> <span id="s725">You could go there and pick it out.</span> <span id="s726">The books are not burned anymore.</span> <span id="s727">Even in Skokie, even the neo-Nazis could yell again.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe somebody will know that they are not just idiots but they are threats and if we are standing together and fighting back now, then there won’t be another Auschwitz, which I know definitely.</span> <span id="s729">We have a country now and our head high up.</span> <span id="s730">I think it’s another story now but the awareness, we are aware what could happen, will help that it shouldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s731">The Hungarian Jews had one year, the Polish Jews had four, the German Jews had six or eight year of terror.</span> <span id="s732">I know that as long as I live, the American Jews, they’re not going to there because we are citizens.</span> <span id="s733">If worst comes to worst, I’ll just pack up and go to Israel because there is a country where the Jews live in their own field, in their own country and they fight and they are surrounded with Arab, enemies but they have a gun in their hand and it can’t happen anymore.</span> <span id="s734">If I would have a gun in my hand, it wouldn’t happen anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Today’s my mother’s birthday.</span> <span id="s736">This is 1978.</span> <span id="s737">She was 38 years old and I bought all the lilac in the ghetto because I couldn’t go out to buy her a card.</span> <span id="s738">A card, a little present so I stole all the lilacs and I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s739">Today I’m giving in her memory, this day.</span> <span id="s740">I wish my father would be alive to hear it and to know how much I loved him, how much I appreciated the way he raised me.</span> <span id="s741">What an honor and a pleasure and what a happiness God gave me that he was alive and I know him for thirty more years, 34 more years.</span> <span id="s742">He died --’44 -- no thirty years, exactly thirty more years with him.</span> <span id="s743">At least he saw my children.</span> <span id="s744">He loved them and they loved him.</span> <span id="s745">This is my story.</span> <span id="s746">Had to be told and I’m glad I said it and God bless you all.</span> <span id="s747">I am very, very happy.</span> <span id="s748">I could tell you when I’m around that it was worth it --- to be alive.</span></p></body></html>
