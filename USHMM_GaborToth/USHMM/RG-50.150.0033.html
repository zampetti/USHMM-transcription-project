<html><body><p><span id="s1">Kurt Schloss, November 11, 1977</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: Could you tell me when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: I was born on Jan. 23, 1911 in Cologne.</span> <span id="s4">My family was in the furniture business, a firm that was established in the lat 90’s from first a wholesale business to a manufacturing business and then a retail business.</span> <span id="s5">This business was founded by my uncle and my father and I entered this business in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s6">I went to school in Cologne and from there I went to Berlin and from there came back to Cologne in 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Why did you go to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I had a job offer in Berlin and I didn’t want to stay home all the time and I stayed there for about two years and then my uncle died and my father was already of age then and he wanted me to take over some of the load which this business naturally entailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Can you tell me something about your educational background?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I went to a Real Gymnasium and then I went to a commercial school and prepared myself for my future.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: What did you think or hope that your future would entail.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Well, originally I wanted to study law but I was the only son and it was customary at that time and particularly in Jewish circles that the son was expected to take over the father’s business and I was influenced then by my father who told me well, I’m getting on in years.</span> <span id="s13">Who’s going to take over this business.</span> <span id="s14">For whom did we build.</span> <span id="s15">And so first reluctantly, I was his point and I acceded to his wishes.</span> <span id="s16">I also took courses in interior-decorating- this was the major portion of this business.</span> <span id="s17">We had two stores – one for very fine furniture – interior decorating was part of it and then we had another store where we had more commercial furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: About how many people did your business employ?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: We employed, I can only estimate it now, on the average between 60 and 80 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Were these mostly Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: The minority was Jewish – as a matter of fact – until 1933 our customers were predominantly Gentile.</span> <span id="s22">I would say 96% of the customers who we had were gentile.</span> <span id="s23">And we had very prominent people – we had the Adenauer family as our customers.</span> <span id="s24">We had near Cologne, there was Baer-Leverkusen which is now – it was called at that time I.G. Farben – there was a merger going on and a goodly number of Baer employees were customers of my firm so from a business point of view the Jewish trade didn’t mean very much to us because we had hardly any.</span> <span id="s25">This picture changed radically in 1933 although not so abruptly because for the following two or three years, we still had in spite of all the vicious propaganda that went on, we still had a goodly amount of Gentile trade.</span> <span id="s26">There could not be, in the beginning at least, so easily persuaded to boycott the Jewish stores in general and ours in particular.</span> <span id="s27">There were very strong ties, you know, things were a little different then they are in this country, basically, the way I recall it, people do not shop around so much when they buy especially big items like furniture.</span> <span id="s28">It’s more a question of confidence and they – children usually buy where their parents tell them to buy – that is where their parents bought their things.</span> <span id="s29">And so automatically they found their way to our stores.</span> <span id="s30">The only thing that we had to do was that we had to eliminate the name from the delivery trucks so – remember this happened after the boycott day in 1933, that people said the only request that we make and this is the way it started out, that do no deliver the furniture in a truck bearing the firm’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What was the firm’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Blum and Schloss, the same name that we had here.</span> <span id="s33">So, then gradually it changed.</span> <span id="s34">A good number of Jewish people who bought furniture for the immigration came to us and so we had more and more Jewish customers.</span> <span id="s35">Naturally, over the years, the percentage of the Gentile customers dropped considerably.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: When you say the customers did not want you to deliver in a truck marked Blum and Schloss, how did you resolve this.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: We just took the name off – there was no name on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: How did you feel about such requests and the continuing Nazi propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, we engaged and I must plead guilty too, to this fallacy that this will blow over.</span> <span id="s40">Alright, we heard this so often, especially the older generation, they said it cannot last.</span> <span id="s41">Economically, we are in such a mess.</span> <span id="s42">If he stays for another six months, this is the extent of it.</span> <span id="s43">This will be the limit.</span> <span id="s44">Then, of course you have to realize that we were misguided by the directives which came from Schacht who was the Minister of Finance in Germany at that time – I’m talking about 1933 where time and again he proclaimed no interference – no economic interference in trade, no restrictions in trade.</span> <span id="s45">And we grabbed this – we were so, I wouldn’t say desperate, at this time we were certainly not desperate, but this was a confirmation as far as we were concerned to our belief that the whole ear was of relatively short duration – that he just could not continue and that economics would play a much larger part than it did.</span> <span id="s46">Of course, he did as we well know.</span> <span id="s47">Of course, he solved all the financial difficulties that Germany found herself in but we couldn’t foresee this.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: You mentioned the boycott of 1933, was your business affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Of course it was, I member vividly the day of the boycott.</span> <span id="s50">I had a visitor, a distant second cousin.</span> <span id="s51">I didn’t know where he came from – from a small town – and it happened that he was visiting with us just on that day.</span> <span id="s52">Our stores were of course among the prominent Jewish stores in the city were immediately – in the first place, they put signs on the store windows “Jewish store” and then there were S.A. troopers posted in front of these stores and they were shouting don’t buy from Jews and all this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s53">But coming back to this young man – he was curious what the picture in the street was – how people reacted.</span> <span id="s54">And unfortunately, he was carrying a camera with him and he wanted to take pictures of – some of the larger department stores were Jewish owned – particularly the large department stores and I walked with him and we had walked not more than 100 feet and we were arrested by S.A. troopers.</span> <span id="s55">I should have know better but at that time I didn’t.</span> <span id="s56">and fortunately for us we were taken to police headquarters and not tone of the S.S. or S.A. headquarters.</span> <span id="s57">And I could immediately identify myself and the charge was espionage because the fallow carried a camera.</span> <span id="s58">So they established the relationship between this fellow and myself and I explained that I met him for the first time.</span> <span id="s59">However, he is a relative of mine.</span> <span id="s60">And since we had a good many customers among higher police officials, I asked for several and fortunately a police – he was a commander of a precinct, happened to be there and I asked that he could identify me and that he could immediately tell them that the charges are ridiculous.</span> <span id="s61">And to make a long story shot, the man came and he said yes, I know this man.</span> <span id="s62">You release him.</span> <span id="s63">There is nothing to this.</span> <span id="s64">The man had been well know to me for years – associated with a firm that had been in the city for many years.</span> <span id="s65">This young man was released a day or two later.</span> <span id="s66">But I went home, no as a matter of fact, I went back to one of the stores, and something very amusing happened to me.</span> <span id="s67">I went through a side entrance and there was an S.A. man standing and this was already late in the afternoon and he looked at me and he said “Good afternoon”.</span> <span id="s68">I looked at him and he said “Don’t you remember me?”</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">I said, “No, I don’t”.</span> <span id="s71">“Well, I was in your store a couple of weeks ago”.</span> <span id="s72">I said, “you were?”</span> <span id="s73">he said “yes, my parents bought a bedroom set for me.”</span> <span id="s74">I said, “it’s nice to see you especially in your uniform”.</span> <span id="s75">“Well” he said, “you know I had to do it”.</span> <span id="s76">I said I’m not making any comment about it or something of this nature.</span> <span id="s77">So that it was on one hand, it was a warning.</span> <span id="s78">On the other hand, in retrospect, we took this much too lightly.</span> <span id="s79">We should have know better.</span> <span id="s80">But in this kind of situation, business continued business continued in the first years, I’m talking about 1933 to 1935, as if nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s81">I mean people came in, the pressure was not as intensive as it became later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Between 1933 and 1935, did your business get better along with the general economic condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I wouldn’t say it was getting better but it certainly didn’t get worse.</span> <span id="s84">The fact that so many Jews found there way to our stores compensated for the loss of trade to the – it did more than compensate.</span> <span id="s85">We probably did much better than we had done in the early 1930’s so when we contemplated – and of course, I was 25 then – and I became quite apprehensive over the years and when I talked to my father and the older generation, they just couldn’t grasp it.</span> <span id="s86">He said, Where did you want to go.</span> <span id="s87">We still have this business and business is still going very well so what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s88">So, he couldn’t grasp the implications and it was really only brought home to us with a finality when the Kristallnacht came.</span> <span id="s89">Then, of course, everybody woke up and it was a rude awakening for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Up until Kristallnacht, did the Gentile customers consistently fall away?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Gradually, very gradually.</span> <span id="s92">Don’t forget also, that I came from an area which was predominantly Catholic and I think, I can make the statement in general terms, they were not under the thumb of the Nazi, of the Party bosses as in other areas in Germany which were Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Who were the local Nazis?</span> <span id="s94">Did you know any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: The Gaulaiter, a prominent, notorious I should say, Nazi lived across the street from us.</span> <span id="s96">We had a house in a suburb, a very beautiful area.</span> <span id="s97">He lived almost opposite.</span> <span id="s98">His name was Grohe.</span> <span id="s99">Knowingly, I never say him.</span> <span id="s100">We say his black Mercedes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: But in your business dealings, did you know anyone who was a member of became prominent in the Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: We made this discovery shortly before the events of November, 1938 that some of our employees in the office and the sales staff came in one day with the swastika on their lapel.</span> <span id="s103">We didn’t comment and neither did they but no comment was needed.</span> <span id="s104">I showed to us that people who had been with us for a number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What was your reaction to having them in your employ and seeing them with the swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Well, I remember this happened during the events of November 10th when the stores were smashed that either my cousin or I said to one of our people who had been with us for at least 20 or 25 years and we said, “Now, is this justice” and he looked at us and said “Well, that’s the way it goes, the innocent have to suffer with the guilty” So, he knew us personally very well.</span> <span id="s107">He was a salesman with my firm for all those years.</span> <span id="s108">He knew that we hadn’t done anything to provoke this.</span> <span id="s109">But on the other and, naturally under this tremendous pressure and he was subjected like all Germans to this vicious propaganda, he assumed that we were somewhat different, somewhat different, I say, from the multitude of Jewish businessmen and professionals.</span> <span id="s110">Hence, this remark.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did these employees do anything to undermine your business up to this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, they established an “arbeiterrat”, a council of workers, representing the employees and frequently they had meetings and I remember that I was asked and this happened in the factory where we had factory workers, and I was asked to address the meeting which I did.</span> <span id="s113">But there was no outright disturbance, no interference in the management up to the events of 1938.</span> <span id="s114">They consulted us frequently or if they had grievances they came forward and voiced the grievances and we did our best to alleviate whatever grievance they had but I don’t think this was basically any different from any employee-employer relationship.</span> <span id="s115">There may have been incidents but if there were, they must have been minor.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: A thought just occurred to me.</span> <span id="s117">These employees were not motivated to become Party members promotions because they were in private enterprise employ, what motivated them then.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I really have no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s119">But I still remember the remark that he made because I thought it quite astounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: How did the events of 1938 affect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: We had sold the business, I think in September of 1938.</span> <span id="s122">There were several people who were interested and we ended up with one who wanted to take over and there were lengthy negotiations.</span> <span id="s123">We had a hard time coming to terms with him because he simply refused to recognize any value and put arbitrary figures on the inventory and when we did not immediately agree, it was made clear to us that the Party would inject themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: How was that made clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: It was very – it wasn’t implied.</span> <span id="s126">It came out after we said we might as well give it to you, the figure was so ridiculous.</span> <span id="s127">So he said if you are not so inclined to accept my very generous offer, I will report your attitude to the Nazi authorities.</span> <span id="s128">So what choice did we have.</span> <span id="s129">We knew there was no choice and we tried to make the best deal possible.</span> <span id="s130">Unfortunately, today it doesn’t matter anymore but this was in his interest also that we wanted to reduce the stock by running a sale and dispose of a good deal of furniture prior to his take over because he paid so little so whatever we took in from private sources would be at least a little compensation of what we had to give away.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How was this in his interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: It was in his interest because he had no cash.</span> <span id="s133">He had very little money.</span> <span id="s134">His means were limited and he was supposed to pay a certain percentage of the cost price of the goods and since, he didn’t have much, he wanted to take over as little as possible.</span> <span id="s135">We were just in the middle of this sale when the events of Nov. 9-10th occurred.</span> <span id="s136">The stores still bore our names.</span> <span id="s137">I remember during the night, we were awakened by a tremendous noise from the house where I lived.</span> <span id="s138">We had moved from our house into an apartment and above us lived – he was a lawyer and he was associated with the Aentralverein “Deutsche Staatsburger Judisohen Glaubens”.</span> <span id="s139">At first I didn’t realize what was happening but then it became quite clear that in the first place, this man was apprehended, his furniture was completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s140">Fortunately nothing happened to us – we were left alone.</span> <span id="s141">Then we got a call between 7 and 8 o’clock in the morning that there were tremendous crowds in front of our store – the main store – and that people smashed the windows and that riots were going on and today I must say innocent as we were, we went down and I remember, I got down there and I saw this yelling, shouting mass of people congregating in front of the store.</span> <span id="s142">Most of the damage had already been done.</span> <span id="s143">We had furniture of artistic value.</span> <span id="s144">I remember we had a number of petit point chairs.</span> <span id="s145">They were slashed with huge knives – upholstered furniture with down pillows again were slashed – they were partially on the street, broken to pieces, crystal chandeliers were among the things.</span> <span id="s146">There was a huge pile of destroyed furniture in front of the store.</span> <span id="s147">Naturally, the plate glass windows were all smashed.</span> <span id="s148">My cousin went to the police and they were standing silently by – watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: This was the regular police?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: This was the regular – the cop on the street – and we were right near a police station.</span> <span id="s151">There was nothing they could do and nothing they would do.</span> <span id="s152">We dot some of our people in the early morning hours who helped to such an extent that we had a factory and we got lumber and sealed up the windows and this is the last thing that I remember that we sealed – boarded – the windows.</span> <span id="s153">To look around in the store, we gave up because everything was a heap of rubble.</span> <span id="s154">Then, we learned by telephone that so many people were taken prisoners by the S.S. and I thought it wise to – now I have to interject something of a personal nature.</span> <span id="s155">I met my late wife in Geneva in 1938 and we got engaged.</span> <span id="s156">She had her American visa under her maiden name and we planned to get married in the United States.</span> <span id="s157">Then somebody advised us, erroneously as it turned out later, that if we were to get married in Germany she could get me on a preference quota – that the waiting time for a visa would be considerably shortened.</span> <span id="s158">It was erroneous information – it only worked the other way – a husband could get his wife on a preference quota.</span> <span id="s159">Be that as it may, she came back from Switzerland we planned to get married on November 12th.</span> <span id="s160">You know in Germany, church and state are not separated as in this country so you had to go to city hall first and actually the marriage ceremony is preformed by an official of the German government.</span> <span id="s161">What you do afterwards, the religious ceremony is your private affair.</span> <span id="s162">It was not prerequisite for the official ceremony.</span> <span id="s163">So while the sale was going on, I took time out and we were married officially in city hall in Cologne and this was on Nov. 8th.</span> <span id="s164">The official who preformed the legal ceremony wore a swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Was he allowed to perform this ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, among two Jews, he was allowed.</span> <span id="s167">Then the preparations were made to have a short ceremony in the B’nai B’rith Lodge in Dusseldorf where my wife came from on Nov. 12th with Rabbi Eschelbacher officiating.</span> <span id="s168">Then, the events of Kristallnacht interfered.</span> <span id="s169">It didn’t come to any religious ceremony anymore.</span> <span id="s170">On Nov. 12th, the Rabbi was in prison and the synagogue in Dussseldorf like all the other synagogues was burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s171">Now, I’ll come back to Nov. 10th.</span> <span id="s172">My late wife happened to be in Cologne on that day and we thought it was wise to leave Cologne and we went to Dusseldorf and we arrived in Dusseldorf by car and the same thing was going on there.</span> <span id="s173">We say, by observing, we could see pianos lying on the street.</span> <span id="s174">By what choice nobody know, but the thing was well organized.</span> <span id="s175">They had selected a number of apartments which they completely destroyed and by the same token which was much worse, they had a list of people who they arrested, and who were then taken to prison and then to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s176">We stayed the night with a gentile housekeeper who my parents-in-law knew very well not only that night but one or two nights until things would hopefully calm down.</span> <span id="s177">And I was in constant contact with my parents.</span> <span id="s178">Thank god nothing happened to them as a matter of fact and it is almost a humorous aspect of it, my father, not understanding – he couldn’t grasp what was going on- in the afternoon, when I pleaded with him to go home and he did – what I didn’t know was that he went to the police precinct in the area where we lived and asked “Now can you explain to me, he asked the sergeant in charge, what is going on”.</span> <span id="s179">And the sergeant who knew my father very well said “Mr. Schloss, nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s180">Go home.</span> <span id="s181">I cannot answer any questions”.</span> <span id="s182">So my father did that and I was in constant touch with them and if I had been on the list to be arrested, they would have questioned my parents, but nobody showed up.</span> <span id="s183">I came home a few days later – I have to go back a little.</span> <span id="s184">The synagogue – the main synagogue was in the Rohnstrasse to which we belonged, which had a capacity of almost 3000 was like the others, was burned down but the outer walls were still standing.</span> <span id="s185">This was a liberal synagogue.</span> <span id="s186">The orthodox synagogue was in the Glockengasse which was a beautiful building in the Moorish style donated by the Oppenheim banking family was completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s187">There were smaller synagogues in the suburbs which were also completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s188">I remember also it was either on that say or I think it was on that day – on my way to the store, I notice a sanitation truck with a number of Jewish lawyers whom they had taken prisoner on this sanitation truck – some of them personally knew so I immediately realized what we were in for.</span> <span id="s189">It was quite obvious from the beginning that this was well organized and not spontaneous.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: You mentioned that you had grown apprehensive even before Kristallnacht and that you had made plans with Ilse to emigrate to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes, this was very obvious by 1938 so the thing that I did was that I applied for a waiting list – there was a waiting list at the American consulate in Stuttgart – of which we learned very late because it was well know in the southern part of Germany that there was such a list but when the news traveled to us it was too late to get a low waiting number.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Had you applied for a visa then already?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: In 1937, I wanted to go to the United States – I didn’t know much what business would be like, what conditions would be like, whether I would find employment.</span> <span id="s194">So I went to the American consul in Cologne and applied for a visitor’s visa and this I remember also because I find it extremely significant.</span> <span id="s195">He said, “well, what do you want to do there?”</span> <span id="s196">I replied that I want to take a trip.</span> <span id="s197">That’s not all you want to do there, he said.</span> <span id="s198">We have a business here.</span> <span id="s199">You’re Jewish?</span> <span id="s200">He asked.</span> <span id="s201">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s202">Well, he said, I give you a visa but you have to certify that you will never apply for an immigration visa because I was duped too often.</span> <span id="s203">At first, I didn’t realize the implication I said what do you mean, duped.</span> <span id="s204">Well, that people ask for a visitor’s visa and then they leave the country and then by hook or crook they are trying to establish themselves in the United States – leaving the country, evading the formalities.</span> <span id="s205">And from now on this is my policy.</span> <span id="s206">And it seemed to me that the man wasn’t – I don’t know if this was a policy established by the Dept. of State of if this was his personal interpretation.</span> <span id="s207">Be that as it may, I said to him that “under the conditions under which I’m living, I certainly can’t give you this statement, so I have to do without the trip.”</span> <span id="s208">And what I saw as a catastrophe in those days, and this contradicts what I said that I was not apprehensive – yes, I was apprehensive, too- after the boycott day in 1933, we knew that things would be difficult.</span> <span id="s209">How difficult they turned out to be, we could not foresee.</span> <span id="s210">In any event, a competitor of our had established in the early 1930’s, maybe even in the late 1920’s, a branch store in Holland, in Amsterdam and being so close to Holland, we had a good many Dutch customers who liked German furniture and the way I recollect it, if they bought it in Germany and even if they paid duty on them, it was still lower than if they bought the same furniture in Holland.</span> <span id="s211">My cousin and I went to Amsterdam to explore, this was 1933, to explore the possibility of establishing a branch store in Amsterdam or Rotterdam or wherever but we chose Amsterdam and we looked around for stores and we found a store to our liking but the prerequisite was of course that we were allowed to take out furniture, this was mind you 1933 in the very beginning and we went then personally to the authorities before we left for Holland in Cologne and advised them of our intention to open up a store in Holland and they listened to us and asked us how much money is required and if my recollection is correct, we said 100,000 marks.</span> <span id="s212">I could be wrong, I don’t remember the figure exactly.</span> <span id="s213">And they immediately agreed and they said all right you will get permission, there’s no problem, of exporting X amount of German goods provided that the proceeds will flow back into Germany.</span> <span id="s214">We said it is not our intention to leave our business in Germany and shift, of course it was, but we didn’t tell him that, from Cologne to Amsterdam which we would have done had things worked out the way we planned at that time.</span> <span id="s215">Now we looked at stores with this thing in our pockets, they had given it to us in writing immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Who was the official?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: He had to do with the Reichsbank, the Federal Reserve Bank here.</span> <span id="s218">The foreign currency control was under their jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s219">We went to one, we looked at the store and while we were there and I don’t recall whether this was shortly before or shortly after, it would have been shortly after, the April 1, 1933 boycott.</span> <span id="s220">I remember we didn’t know Dutch, we were in the hotel but there was a headline that attracted our attention.</span> <span id="s221">And we had some Dutch friends whom we called – the headline that there were new rules and regulations and that German trade would be curtailed as a result of the happenings on that day.</span> <span id="s222">And we called immediately a friend who told us that the upshot of this was that they had changed the – they curtailed the import of German goods and based it on a quota system – in other words they said what you imported from Germany in the previous years is the basis for 40% quota of what you can import this year and it will be 30% next year and so on gradually reducing German imports.</span> <span id="s223">We took a lawyer and went to the Dutch minister – commercial whatever – to Dutch authorities – put our cards on our table and he said to us or rather to the lawyer as we couldn’t speak Dutch.</span> <span id="s224">I wish I could help you but there is nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s225">This is the law and there are no exceptions.</span> <span id="s226">Well, we thought this was the greatest catastrophe because we were very anxious and it would have worked because we had connections there.</span> <span id="s227">But later on we realized that this was a blessing in disguise because as sure as I am sitting here, we- in all likelihood the business would have flourished and we would have stayed in Amsterdam until the Nazis would have overrun it.</span> <span id="s228">Now, coming back to my personal life, as I said before, my late wife received her American immigration visa in Bern, Switzerland under her maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were both of you in Switzerland in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I was only there for two days.</span> <span id="s231">I didn’t have a passport anymore in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: It was taken away from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes, it was taken away – I think at the border coming back from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s234">I had no passport – she did.</span> <span id="s235">We were legally married.</span> <span id="s236">She was supposed to leave on November 15th on the Manhattan – United States Lines from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s237">I wanted to see her off and she was apprehensive.</span> <span id="s238">She was barely twenty – her birthday was November 14th.</span> <span id="s239">I wanted to see her off and she wouldn’t hear of it.</span> <span id="s240">In the paper on November 13th, there was a statement I think by Goebbels that all actions against the Jews had been stopped.</span> <span id="s241">So I said now you can’t keep me back as long as all actions has been stopped – taking his word.</span> <span id="s242">I will go with you.</span> <span id="s243">We left Cologne – she was to leave on Nov. 15th in the evening – so we left on Nov. 14th in the evening sitting up on a train to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s244">We arrived in Hamburg in the morning and we hardly got off the train when two men approached us “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s245">We answered in the affirmative and they said we had to come with them.</span> <span id="s246">They were Gestapo.</span> <span id="s247">We were taken to a police precinct where they asked us what we were doing and I explained that my wife is leaving for the United States.</span> <span id="s248">So the Gestapo said show me your passport and she showed it to him with the American Visa.</span> <span id="s249">He said we are only keeping your husband.</span> <span id="s250">Hive me all your things, put them on the table, whatever you have, keys, wallet, everything.</span> <span id="s251">They gave it to my wife and said your husband doesn’t need it anymore.</span> <span id="s252">Now for a girl who is just twenty years old, she behaved remarkably.</span> <span id="s253">Then, I was taken to a jail and the door opened and I saw there were several other people there – all Jews as it turned out.</span> <span id="s254">Where did they get you?</span> <span id="s255">What happened?</span> <span id="s256">All the same thing.</span> <span id="s257">They were picked up off the street.</span> <span id="s258">Also people arriving in the morning – similar cases to mine- salesmen.</span> <span id="s259">There must have been at least 30 to 40 people in this cell – it was a huge cell.</span> <span id="s260">Then, in the early afternoon, the door opened and I heard my name.</span> <span id="s261">I answered immediately, the door slammed again.</span> <span id="s262">Then all these people came to me and said “You’re being released”.</span> <span id="s263">I said don’t talk foolish – why should I be released and not you – I don’t believe in miracles.</span> <span id="s264">But they all insisted and asked that I notify my wife, my mother, nobody knows where I am.</span> <span id="s265">I said I will do anything but I don’t believe that I will be released – why should I be released?</span> <span id="s266">I have no visa, I have no passport – I can’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s267">Well, we learned that we were to be taken to the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen the same day.</span> <span id="s268">Then, I would say later in the afternoon, about 4 o’clock, the door opened and again my name was called and I went forward and he said come on and I was taken to a Gestapo official and he said you sign this here.</span> <span id="s269">And I would have signed anything.</span> <span id="s270">And I read the following that I, the undersigned name living there and there obligate myself to leave Germany within three months.</span> <span id="s271">I signed it and they said my wife was outside.</span> <span id="s272">I went out and she was waiting there.</span> <span id="s273">What she had done after they had given her all my things, she went through my briefcase and there was a letter from a travel agent in Stuttgart and this letter helped her a great deal and it stated erroneously that your waiting number will be called soon and I suggest you book passage as early as possible.</span> <span id="s274">The man was a businessman.</span> <span id="s275">He had a list somewhere of these people who had applied for an emigration visa and he wanted to sell passages – he was a travel agent – he was Jewish but that’s how he made a living.</span> <span id="s276">I don’t know why but the letter was in my file.</span> <span id="s277">She found it and came to the Gestapo and she found a man who was, for lack of a better word, let’s say sympathetic and he said – well, she told him that we just got married and my husband is in jail, they graded him this morning and so on.</span> <span id="s278">Well, he said if your husband can leave Germany within a reasonable period of time, there is a chance of releasing him.</span> <span id="s279">But you have to bring me a passage – a ticket from a line.</span> <span id="s280">If you bring this before they leave for Sachsenhausen later this afternoon.</span> <span id="s281">So, she went to the Holland-American line and the man told her that he was not allowed to issue open tickets.</span> <span id="s282">She said but my husband will be leaving Germany soon.</span> <span id="s283">He said how do you know and she showed him the letter.</span> <span id="s284">Well, he said he would interpret the letter as indicating early departure.</span> <span id="s285">I’m going to give it to you but you have to pay.</span> <span id="s286">She had no money so she called my father to wire her the money.</span> <span id="s287">She waited and waited and finally she got the telegraphic advice that the money had been wired.</span> <span id="s288">And then she took the ticket back to the Gestapo and they tried to reach me and find out what jail I was in and then they called me and as I related above I met her.</span> <span id="s289">So then instead of my taking her to the ship she took me to the railroad station and I said I have nothing in writing, the same thing that happened to me this morning can happen again back in Cologne when I get there and I was well known so I was thinking and I called my firm.</span> <span id="s290">We had transferred the office to one of our buildings and I spoke to someone there and told him to do exactly as I instructed.</span> <span id="s291">We had a chauffeur, a truck driver whom I trusted implicitly, I know that he was decent.</span> <span id="s292">I said have this man come to either Duisborg or Essen station and he should go up to the platform where the train from Hamburg arrives and he should meet me upstairs and not downstairs.</span> <span id="s293">Coming back to this man, it’s just incidental, this man had been with us for a number of years and when we hired him, a few weeks later, we got an anonymous letter that the man was a jailbird and he committed some crime when he was young and we confronted him with this letter and he said yes, he had done this, he did foolish things in his youth.</span> <span id="s294">He said wherever he took on a job it didn’t last because this was a jilted girl who spied on him and wherever the man found employment, she notified anonymously the employer and the end result was that he was fired.</span> <span id="s295">And we said to him, this would not influence us to fire you and if you do your job, what’s past is past and if you have adjusted your life, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s296">And he said I will, I will.</span> <span id="s297">And he never, not even in the darkest days of what happened in November, he never forgot.</span> <span id="s298">So he did for us whatever was humanly possible and he repaid us for our faith in him.</span> <span id="s299">So, I arrived and this man was about 6 ft. tall and he always wore these storm trooper kind of long boots, even though he was far removed from them so we met and I told him that we are going down and we are going to talk the local patois and tell me a few jokes.</span> <span id="s300">So we went down laughing and joking and he looked like the prototype of an Aryan and so nobody questioned us.</span> <span id="s301">Then I stayed with relatives of mine for a few days and then I went back to Cologne.</span> <span id="s302">One day I got a letter from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s303">I pushed my emigration but I had nothing tangible yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: When you say you pushed your emigration, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, at that time I applied for an interim visa to England which I finally got.</span> <span id="s306">But now yet at this time when I got the summons from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s307">Well, I don’t have to tell you the felling I had when I got this summons.</span> <span id="s308">I had been at the Gestapo several times but this was the last time and I went there and they asked if I had signed this document in Hamburg on Nov. 15th.</span> <span id="s309">I immediately anticipated that they would want to know why I was still here.</span> <span id="s310">So he said to me and I was floored.</span> <span id="s311">Well, have you any definite plans yet.</span> <span id="s312">And I told him that I was doing my best to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s313">He said you don’t have to be in any hurry.</span> <span id="s314">We will not hold you to the three months.</span> <span id="s315">We will not insist on this deadline.</span> <span id="s316">But I want to, I said.</span> <span id="s317">That’s fine, he said, but I want you to know that as far as we are concerned, nothing will happen to you if you stay longer.</span> <span id="s318">I never say this in writing but he told me that.</span> <span id="s319">So, since we had so many Jewish customers who had fled, these Nazis, they were in our store almost every day.</span> <span id="s320">They secured the furniture that these people had bought and they seized it often when people were leaving illegally.</span> <span id="s321">I was these people everyday.</span> <span id="s322">They would come in and say we had a customer by the name of Goldsmith and where’s the furniture.</span> <span id="s323">We had to surrender it, what else could we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">So, this is why I had contact with Gestapo men, with customs men, everyday.</span> <span id="s325">It was nothing that we did because this happened because we had so many customers all over the area – I mean this was not limited to one small area – they came from all over to buy new furniture to take along and then maybe they left suddenly and the Gestapo got wind of them and then they seized the furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Let me just backtrack for a moment.</span> <span id="s327">The negotiations between you and the men who were to buy the store in September 1938 fell through.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well, the men practically paid nothing because there was nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did he take it over at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, he took over the store.</span> <span id="s331">Before I continue, in the first place, we had to pay for the damages, there was a penalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: A billion reichsmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Right.</span> <span id="s334">So we had to pay for the restoring of the store – in other words put the windows in, clean-up and so on.</span> <span id="s335">Whatever there was left in furniture was in a warehouse and he took some of it very little but some of it and by the way, we never got any restitution for the business since this store which was the main store was completely destroyed during the war and the man was penniless.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: But he only took over after Nov. 10th?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Well, whatever there was left, we took out.</span> <span id="s338">Whatever was sold and undamaged, we delivered although in most cases we didn’t collect.</span> <span id="s339">This was another thing.</span> <span id="s340">After this happened, there was a number of pieces sold which we wanted to deliver and people accepted them and then they didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s341">So are we going to sure them?</span> <span id="s342">I remember I had a discussion with a very educated man by the way and he claimed Well, I owe you about 2000 marks, whatever, and he said let me see the piece.</span> <span id="s343">Everything that had been salvaged was in the warehouse that we owned.</span> <span id="s344">And of course we had the other store which was not damaged so a number of these bedroom sets and pieces of furniture escaped any physical damage so he said let me see the pieces.</span> <span id="s345">I showed them to him and asked if there was anything wrong with them.</span> <span id="s346">He said no but I give you only half.</span> <span id="s347">I asked why half – we were still very naïve I guess.</span> <span id="s348">He said they went thought – they have an ideologically reduced value in German it would be ideologicher minder werd.</span> <span id="s349">I asked if there was anything wrong with the furniture.</span> <span id="s350">No, he said but they went thought the action of November, these pieces and for me, therefore, the value is reduced.</span> <span id="s351">They don’t have the value anymore.</span> <span id="s352">So this showed the attitude of the people- just to enrich themselves, to chisel.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: It’s called taking advantage of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s355">And we didn’t pursue it because what was the use.</span> <span id="s356">He could have given nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you realize at that point that you could only leave with 10 RM?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Then all your assets.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: All the assets were seized.</span> <span id="s361">You had to pay the penalty and the damage of course was huge.</span> <span id="s362">To revert the store back into its original condition took vast sums of money and then, this also comes to mind.</span> <span id="s363">We owned two buildings where we had the other store and these two buildings, we had mortgages on these two buildings which were given by the savings back in Cologne but the savings back was a community bank owned by the community, by the city (different from here).</span> <span id="s364">This was also the end of 1938.</span> <span id="s365">they advised us that the mortgages were cancelled immediately and you had to pay forthwith, immediately and you had to repay.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Repay the outstanding balance in cash?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes, repay in cash which we didn’t have naturally.</span> <span id="s368">Then we had to look around and find somebody who buys the buildings but from one day to another and we found somebody who took the building over exactly at the – he took over the mortgages.</span> <span id="s369">We didn’t get a penny for the buildings.</span> <span id="s370">For these buildings, we did get restitution.</span> <span id="s371">And the man was also furious.</span> <span id="s372">After the war, we got a letter from these people too over the building – it was an industrial concern, very big.</span> <span id="s373">And they wrote a letter asking just for formalities sake that we write a letter stating that we have no claims against them.</span> <span id="s374">We didn’t know at that time about restitution but we weren’t that naïve to give them that letter.</span> <span id="s375">They had to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: They took over the building for the balance of the mortgage.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They took it over for the balance – it was ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: How did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I got an interim permit to enter England.</span> <span id="s380">This happened in March, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Was this through someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes, it was through my parents-in-law.</span> <span id="s383">They had left four weeks ahead of me to England and they had connections there – they knew somebody who knew me too and was influential in brining this about.</span> <span id="s384">From my waiting number, they knew that it would be approximately late that year that I would be getting the American visa so I got a permit to enter England.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you need proof that you could support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes, that I would be a public charge.</span> <span id="s387">A friend of mine gave that for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Meantime Ilse was in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, she was here.</span> <span id="s390">She remembered very little about the crossing because it was the first ship that arrived after the events of November 9-10 and there were reporters there and they wanted to interview her because most of the people there were eye-witnesses and if I’m not mistaken the American Ambassador, William Bullitt was on the same boat – he had been recalled.</span> <span id="s391">I left Germany in it was on the first day of Pesach in 1939 in the morning and I attended a Seder – we still have a Seder – with friends of mine and they were orthodox people.</span> <span id="s392">I remember all the people that were sitting there – there is not one alive.</span> <span id="s393">The whole family was wiped out.</span> <span id="s394">I left the next morning and I went to the Dutch border on the train and there was S.S. who interrogated me and looked for valuables which I didn’t have and</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Did they make it difficult of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, they made if very difficult.</span> <span id="s397">I missed the train – they kept me for a few hours but they didn’t harm me.</span> <span id="s398">They finally let me go and I had to take the next train – I went to Holland and form Holland to England.</span> <span id="s399">I stayed in England until the end of this year and then as you know on Sept. 1, war broke out and here my parents were still in Germany and I talked to them every night and my father did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s400">In the meantime my father knew that he couldn’t stay in Germany but they had had a letter from the American consulate in Stuttgart that they should come to Stuttgart somewhere in Sept. of 1939 so my father said I have the change to get the American visa and I said Father, there will be war and he said No, there will not be war.</span> <span id="s401">To make a long story short, I pressured them and I said I will not talk to you again – never mind the visa – I am positive there will be war.</span> <span id="s402">So finally they gave in and they came with the last plane – for the first time in their lives, the flew which was an even in itself.</span> <span id="s403">They flew from Cologne to London – it was the last plane.</span> <span id="s404">I remember I went tout to meet them and my father said I’ll never forgive you – here we could have gotten the visa and I said Father, let’s wait and see.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: When you say they could have gotten the American visa, they had applied earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Well, they could have gotten it but then how could they get out?</span> <span id="s407">They probably could have at that time but who would take that chance.</span> <span id="s408">I remember in Sept. when they came we had to register in England.</span> <span id="s409">I was already registered but had to register and we went to the Woburn House – the Central Agency for Refugees and we changed buses on Oxford Circus and there we saw the newspapers, “Warsaw bombed” and I said Father, this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: On the day that you left Germany, that must have been a very difficult day for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes, it was a very difficult day.</span> <span id="s412">But I was relatively sure that my parents would follow me because what others did for me, I did for them as soon as I arrived and I had certain connections and of course I used them.</span> <span id="s413">And I had relatives here who also sent a statement that in case of need they would financially help which they never had to but they gave the statement and I got them the permit to stay.</span> <span id="s414">Well, I applied, not knowing that I could leave England during the war, I enlisted for the Pioneer Corps in England but in the meantime, they issued a certain amount of immigration visas and I went to the Consul to the American Consul and I got mine and I asked what about my parents.</span> <span id="s415">So he said they could follow shortly but it didn’t turn out that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What did you do for money in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well, we had a little money.</span> <span id="s418">We were extremely frugal to say the least – I never walked that much in my life, because the two pence that it cost – we just didn’t have so we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: When you say you had a little money, didn’t you have to leave with just the 10 RM?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes, but I had a little money that I had in Holland before.</span> <span id="s421">It was not a huge amount but in the beginning it helped at least to sustain us until we got here.</span> <span id="s422">You remember when we went to Holland in the 1930’s, whatever money was left over from this trip, I left there.</span> <span id="s423">I didn’t change it back to German money.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: You were able to transfer it from Holland to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, we were able to transfer it and also, we had sold a great deal to Dutch customers and when they paid we told them to give it to us in Dutch guilders and we gave them a break on the price.</span> <span id="s426">It was a risky business but it was the only thing to do.</span> <span id="s427">So it was a little money but my father and mother were older and he couldn’t work any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: They were older people and it must have been difficult for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: It was difficult but of course in 1939 after we had gone though, I mean the decision to leave Germany was not a difficult one anymore.</span> <span id="s430">At that time, somebody must have been extremely stupid not to have seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: When you first came here, how did you earn a living in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: When I first came, my wife was working.</span> <span id="s433">She did all kinds of jobs – odd jobs.</span> <span id="s434">She had saved a little money.</span> <span id="s435">She came back from Chicago, she had been living in Chicago.</span> <span id="s436">She came back to New York to meet me and she continued to work in households, doing laundry, whatever she could find, she did it.</span> <span id="s437">She had make her exam as a social secretary in Geneva and again it was a fallacy.</span> <span id="s438">It would have entitled her to get into the social field here but it wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s439">But finally she got a position, the first position in an office, with this huge organization, the National Refugee Service.</span> <span id="s440">She applied, she brought her credentials, she was a professional social worker in Europe.</span> <span id="s441">She made her exam in Geneva.</span> <span id="s442">They took an interest in her.</span> <span id="s443">She knew shorthand and she was very well versed in the language and she knew typing and they told her they could use her in the office.</span> <span id="s444">And this of course ended the odd jobs and the jobs that she took when there was nothing else to be gotten.</span> <span id="s445">I established myself – we had in the main furniture store in Cologne, we had a gift department which was just incidental but it leant a certain atmosphere to the store and one day a salesman came in, a so-called artist and he had developed this line and he showed it us and it was tiles which made in a studio in Cologne and they were very attractive and we gave him an order.</span> <span id="s446">When we saw the handwriting on the wall which was all too late, we thought of this man and we knew that we didn’t have the money to go back into the furniture business and we thought of this man and we went to him and told him that we were leaving Germany soon.</span> <span id="s447">We are not going into competition with you – would you like to show us how you make them.</span> <span id="s448">First he said no and then he thought it over and he saw a way to make an easy buck and he asked for money.</span> <span id="s449">But he said you cannot come during the day because I have people here, you have to come at 9 o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s450">We have him the money and we came to him.</span> <span id="s451">It was very interesting – he used what is called here “decals”.</span> <span id="s452">He put a motif, let’s say a ship on a six by six time and he filled the rest – the water he did with a few strokes of oil paint and the sky with a few blue clouds and then he lacquered the whole thing and so for the causal observer it looked as the real thing – like an oil.</span> <span id="s453">Actually it was not because the main motif was a decal.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Like decoupage.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Exactly, like decoupage.</span> <span id="s456">This is how we got started.</span> <span id="s457">We got some samples and went from store to store.</span> <span id="s458">Of course, unframed we couldn’t sell.</span> <span id="s459">We were not familiar with it.</span> <span id="s460">What did we know, we knew nothing.</span> <span id="s461">Then, I looked up jobbers and I came to a man who was very bug then and he sort of took a liking to the idea and then he said All right, came back and then and he would give us an order but we had to understand one thing – it’s got to be exclusive – this was the beginning of 1940 – exclusive for the whole country.</span> <span id="s462">I said how big was the order and he said he would make it worth our while – I think the order was about 800 or 900 dollars.</span> <span id="s463">Now, we thought we had it made.</span> <span id="s464">We accepted naturally.</span> <span id="s465">It took us maybe 4 or six weeks to make up this quantity of tiles that he had framed himself and then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How did you get the money to buy the materials?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We had a little money.</span> <span id="s468">We paid rent three dollars a month.</span> <span id="s469">It was in the basement in one of those houses in Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s470">We had an arrangement with the super whereby the super closed his eyes to our being there for a consideration of $3.00 per month.</span> <span id="s471">The tiles we paid – he said we could make part shipment and he would pay us which he did –so it was only the first two cases that we and to pay for and then when he paid us we took the money and took on new tiles.</span> <span id="s472">So it took us six to eight weeks and we were finished.</span> <span id="s473">By the summer, we said what do we do.</span> <span id="s474">After the 8 or 900 tiles and after we paid for all the material, there wasn’t so much left.</span> <span id="s475">Then I went back to this man and said, “Look, we have to make a living, how do they sell?”</span> <span id="s476">Well, he said he doesn’t know yet.</span> <span id="s477">Maybe soon reorders will come in.</span> <span id="s478">but I told him in the meantime we had to make a living.</span> <span id="s479">Okay, he says “boys, you can have New York City” Okay, New York City was big enough for us.</span> <span id="s480">And then we also learned by this time that we had to frame them.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: When you say boys, who are you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Me and my partner.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Was this the same partner you had in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes, we were the sons o the original owners.</span> <span id="s485">And then we found somebody who was very helpful and he made samples of frames and we slowly discovered and of course slowly you learn things – the size is wrong, the subjects are wrong and we did other things.</span> <span id="s486">We made them smaller and we came to miniatures and I was the outside man – the so called outside man and I tried to sell.</span> <span id="s487">First, I took all my courage and I went to Gimbels and at that time in Gimbels they had an elderly man and he said “what do you have?”</span> <span id="s488">and I had already frames, items of various sizes, what they have today in groupings and it came up – they group certain things together and we were beginning to know what subjects for instance you cannot sell parrots here- people are superstitious, it means back luck or items with bugs on it – oh no, people wouldn’t touch this.</span> <span id="s489">Butterflies, is yes.</span> <span id="s490">It was a question of choosing the right subject.</span> <span id="s491">Okay, we had this line together and I went to this man who said “okay, I’m going to try it” and he gave me an order for $30.00 and we shipped it and I went back to the wholesaler who said the results were no good, it wasn’t selling.</span> <span id="s492">Starting after the season which was October, November, you can sell wherever you want to.</span> <span id="s493">So I knew already it’s a failure.</span> <span id="s494">But slowly we added other things and in late fall, they have a trade show (1940) and I went there jut to take a look around.</span> <span id="s495">We had no telephone, nothing and I wanted to look what was on the market.</span> <span id="s496">And I saw this Gimbel’s buyer there and he saw me too and I wanted to duck.</span> <span id="s497">I thought oh my god, he’s going to give me – he said come here.</span> <span id="s498">I said to myself, now, I’m going to get all the stuff back.</span> <span id="s499">We had no confidence at all.</span> <span id="s500">He said, “Weren’t you the fellow who sold me those tiles.”</span> <span id="s501">I said yes and thought now its coming.</span> <span id="s502">He said what’s the matter with you guys?</span> <span id="s503">I asked what do you mean what’s the matter.</span> <span id="s504">He said don’t you have a telephone?</span> <span id="s505">I said we had applied for one – what should I say.</span> <span id="s506">He said don’t give me that or something.</span> <span id="s507">Are you refugees?</span> <span id="s508">I said yes.</span> <span id="s509">He said why don’t you come out and say it.</span> <span id="s510">My English wasn’t that good and I don’t know exactly what he said but he told me to come and see him tomorrow morning in my office.</span> <span id="s511">I still couldn’t figure it out.</span> <span id="s512">I thought maybe he wants me to carry the stuff back.</span> <span id="s513">I came there and he asked “do you now how to fill out an order?”</span> <span id="s514">I said yes and he said here’s my order book.</span> <span id="s515">I said than you and he told me to write.</span> <span id="s516">What are the style numbers?</span> <span id="s517">I said 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600.</span> <span id="s518">He said okay, write a dozen of 200, a dozen of 300 ect.</span> <span id="s519">and when can you ship.</span> <span id="s520">I said I could send it in two weeks and this is the way it got started.</span> <span id="s521">Now, of course, this is what we sold for a while and then we added other things until we manufactured a complete line of wall accessories, framed pictures, mirrors, small things, decorative accessories but it took a while.</span> <span id="s522">We couldn’t take any money out of the business the first two or three years, not a cent.</span> <span id="s523">We lived on what our wives made.</span> <span id="s524">Because we started with no capital.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Where was Ilse working during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: She continued with the National Refugee Service and then she quit and got a position as a secretary and then later on, she helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Do you feel that your business background in Germany helped you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, it did.</span> <span id="s529">After all, there was this connection.</span> <span id="s530">Interior decorating was something that we were completely familiar with and it entered the decorative field.</span> <span id="s531">But to adapt our taste to what the market requires here is something else again.</span> <span id="s532">Not what you personally like is saleable.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: What about the German way of doing business as compared to the American way.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Well, I found out soon enough.</span> <span id="s535">I mean when somebody tells you see me after Labor Day, I took it literally in the first year until I found out it doesn’t mean a blessed thing.</span> <span id="s536">It’s just how are you, glad to see you.</span> <span id="s537">Or we know that there is no – well, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s538">It’s the polite way of saying no.</span> <span id="s539">This is something that you have to get used to.</span> <span id="s540">The way I carried on business in Germany and if salesmen come, I would say, No, thank you, I don’t need anything.</span> <span id="s541">But here people don’t do that.</span> <span id="s542">In the beginning I believed it but it didn’t take me long to find out.</span> <span id="s543">Another thing was See me then and then or I will call you or don’t all me, I will call you.</span> <span id="s544">If you take these things literally, of course, you’ll be disappointed if it doesn’t happen but you learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Where there any other difficult adjustments in the ways of doing business between Germany and here?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, the firm in Europe had a reputation and this was a tremendous asset for our business it was well known.</span> <span id="s547">People were very conservative and they weren’t as price conscious as people are here where they go from one store to another and compare prices.</span> <span id="s548">First of all, in this field, it’s difficult to compare because there are mostly different items, different manufactures, different styles.</span> <span id="s549">In the second place, this loyalty they had to the store in Germany – they knew they would be satisfied and this was worth something to them.</span> <span id="s550">They knew they would be pleased and if there was the slightest complaint, they knew the next day someone would be there to correct it.</span> <span id="s551">This is an element that’s completely missing here.</span> <span id="s552">You do not have this intense loyalty.</span> <span id="s553">Here, often, if somebody is half a penny cheaper, he got the order.</span> <span id="s554">They pay one against the other.</span> <span id="s555">I don’t want to misjudge this either- they are entitled to buy at the lowest price possible but it’s a difference in attitude and approach.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: What did you do for recreation in those early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Oh my, movies – 15 cents, a quarter on weekends.</span> <span id="s558">And radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Were most of your customers here Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Most of them were Americans, yes.</span> <span id="s561">And then of course, when I went out selling, they knew from my accent that I was European born even if they didn’t know exactly that it was German born and then they would talk to me in Yiddish and that was another difficulty.</span> <span id="s562">Today, fortunately, I understand Yiddish but at that time, I didn’t and I didn’t speak it either.</span> <span id="s563">And then if I didn’t answer back, they resent the fact – they think you want to hide your identity which was the farthest thought to my mind.</span> <span id="s564">Before I could convey the thought to them that where I came from, Yiddish was an unknown language, we didn’t know Yiddish and sometimes you don’t have the time for any lengthy explanation, but it was a difficulty.</span> <span id="s565">Later on, I picked up some Yiddish expressions and then I used them.</span> <span id="s566">In later years, it didn’t occur to them to ask but in the beginning, I know it was an obstacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What was the greatest difficulty for you in adjusting to American life?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I don’t think I had any major difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Today, do you feel yourself more a part of the American mainstream or more part of the German Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: That’s an easy question.</span> <span id="s571">Look, I’ve lived here longer than I lived in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Do you have mostly American friends or mostly German Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Mostly German Jewish.</span> <span id="s574">Well, of course the affinity still exists.</span> <span id="s575">This is something I couldn’t deny.</span> <span id="s576">But I would never consider leaving the country, never consider going back to Europe.</span> <span id="s577">I have never set foot on German soil and I never will and I told you about the experience I had with German people in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Why wouldn’t you ever go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: For me, this chapter is a closed chapter.</span> <span id="s580">I don’t want to be reminded neither will I forget.</span> <span id="s581">My late wife and I were of the same opinion – we lost so many of our close relatives.</span> <span id="s582">Fortunately, my immediate family was saved.</span> <span id="s583">I cannot forget and I will never, never go back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: How do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Well, I recognize that some people owe them a debt of gratitude for the German government to put them in a position though restitution to have a financial peace of mind.</span> <span id="s586">I don’t see any need for gratitude.</span> <span id="s587">Personally, I don’t receive a pension.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: By choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No, not by choice.</span> <span id="s590">If they would give it to me, I would take it but that’s besides the point.</span> <span id="s591">I also deplore the present trend of the attempt to see history rewritten and there are too many instances of this – the movie that they are showing in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: The idea that this was a career – an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The movie that they show is a great success, playing all over Germany so one wonders did it really change all that much.</span> <span id="s594">Of course, the situation today is different than the one under Hitler but the germ is still there even though there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s595">The presence of the Jews – what’s 25,000 – doesn’t alter anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: How do you feel about Jewish successions in politics like Kissinger or Koch?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Very positive.</span> <span id="s598">This is a lesson that I have learned.</span> <span id="s599">I remember we were super-cautious.</span> <span id="s600">When this thing came up in the thirties we were trying to justify – to took for a logical answer to what was happening and this was an opinion that was shared by many – we said for instance, we blamed the department stores for some of the happenings, for the growth of anti-Semitism especially in the business world and we said with a twisted logic, they have one store, they have two stores, do they need 100?</span> <span id="s601">Do they have to take the livelihood of the small store owner away?</span> <span id="s602">Why this greed?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: The department stores were in Jewish hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: They were predominantly Jewish owned all over Germany – to a good extent.</span> <span id="s605">And when we say this wave of anti-Semitism and this is one of the instances I remember, the department stores, why?</span> <span id="s606">We said what can a man eat.</span> <span id="s607">We brought it back to simple terms – one steak a day, he can’t eat more than one steak a day.</span> <span id="s608">What do they need it for?</span> <span id="s609">And these were the thoughts that went through our minds – foolishly.</span> <span id="s610">It had nothing to do with it – whether there was one Jewish department store or 10 or 100 – nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s611">Now as far as your question, people say for instance in the city, you have another Jewish mayor, Koch.</span> <span id="s612">They would rather he wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s613">And it’s still this ghetto spirit of atmosphere that is guiding our thinking – will it be good or bad for the Jews.</span> <span id="s614">It has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s615">If there is anti-Semitism, it is not based on the fact that Koch is Jewish or Beame was Jewish.</span> <span id="s616">That he was a poor mayor had nothing to do with the fact that he was Jewish or Gentile – nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I asked the question as an indicator of our security.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I feel very positively about the fact that we are very well represented in Congress – we have 5 Senators which is 5% and we are well represented in the House.</span> <span id="s619">We are entitled to have our point of view represented.</span> <span id="s620">But as far as anti-Semitism is concerned, this doesn’t have the slightest bearing.</span> <span id="s621">And people say well, you have anti-Semitism here.</span> <span id="s622">Of course, you have anti-Semitism all over the world but the way I see it – the cardinal difference is that you have a social anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s623">The cardinal difference is this – coming from Germany and seeing what I have seen is this – the anti-Semitism in Europe (including Poland, Austria ect) was in most cases government supported.</span> <span id="s624">This is different from anti-Semitism as you encounter it when you apply to a club here.</span> <span id="s625">You use the same term but it is something entirely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: But the problem is when they come together?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: They came together in Europe but they will never come together here one should never say never but I came here and I opened up the newspaper in 1940 and you had the German Bund very active and Senator Bilbo who was raving against the Jews and kikes and you had the Lindbergh affair and I said my god what kind of country have I come to.</span> <span id="s628">Do I have to continue living in this kind of an atmosphere?</span> <span id="s629">And it was sort of a let down.</span> <span id="s630">And in 1940, Wendell Wilkie ran against Franklin Roosevelt and I read in the paper that Wilkie is of German descent.</span> <span id="s631">And I thought my god, the world is coming to an end and we were very naïve in the beginning and then when Wilkie turned out to be a remarkable man and as liberal as anybody could be.</span> <span id="s632">But we’ve gone through so many political changes.</span> <span id="s633">I cannot agree with somebody who says let’s not get into the limelight and I cannot agree with anybody who says there are too many Jewish lawyers or Jewish doctors or Jewish politicians.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t buy that at all.</span> <span id="s635">If they have a talent, they are entitled like every other human being to further themselves and it has nothing to do with being careful.</span></p></body></html>
