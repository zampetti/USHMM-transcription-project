id="s31">A: I really grew up in Po...yes, in Poland and I went to school, to elementary school and my father was a working man for kind of like business.</span> <span id="s32">Had something to do with lumber, you know.</span> <span id="s33">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s34">We had a nice apartment and we had a grandmother and and and my mother's sisters and the whole family who lived within walking distance of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Where was...did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I went to elementary school and finished seventh grade in .</span> <span id="s37">Q: What was the town like?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: It was...it was, you know, it was a a medium-sized town and it was like a like a county seat or something like that.</span> <span id="s39">There were lots of Jews, very poor Jews.</span> <span id="s40">A few who had businesses and lived a little better, but the majority of the people were...lived in one room apartments.</span> <span id="s41">A religious community, not very assimilated.</span> <span id="s42">It was the part of Poland that was kind of Polish-Russian, not Austrian-Hungarian or German so they were not assimilated as much.</span> <span id="s43">There were in the town maybe ten families that were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s44">There was a rabbi and another rabbi and it was very very orthodox and oriented in very kind of orthodox religious way.</span> <span id="s45">I was too young to really take any active part in in in the life of the town, you know.</span> <span id="s46">I went to school in the morning and came home and, you know, did my homework and had a couple of little girl friends and, you know, boys didn't come yet into the picture, so you know...can't tell you very much about it.</span> <span id="s47">I can tell you that each holiday we got together with my grandmothers, you know...tradition was a big thing, you know.</span> <span id="s48">My grandmother had a business.</span> <span id="s49">She was supplying dairy to the army.</span> <span id="s50">So she was well-off, you know.</span> <span id="s51">So we kind of always gathered in my grandmother's place.</span> <span id="s52">Other daughters and kids, you know, and us, you know.</span> <span id="s53">Father did not do too well, financially I think, you know.</span> <span id="s54">What I can remember, you know, we had a nice apartment like two rooms but I don't think there was wealth, you know.</span> <span id="s55">I think he had...he struggled a lot, you know.</span> <span id="s56">First, you know, he was he lived in one place and then, you know, he kind of couldn't establish himself when he was sent back to Poland.</span> <span id="s57">So Grandmother helped and whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s58">The families kind of lived together.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: When did things begin to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: For me personally, you know, some time after the holidays, our Passover holidays in 1939, my aunt came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s61">And my father sent me to live with her for a while, you know.</span> <span id="s62">I finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s63">There was no question about going to college because there was no money, so I lived...I went sometimes in May to Warsaw in 1939.</span> <span id="s64">In September the war started.</span> <span id="s65">Then, you know, lasted the whole month until, you know, until the Germans really came in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s66">The family four months.</span> <span id="s67">In that apart...in that apartment, you know, uh we all lived in the basement and every morning you had to, you know, go up and every evening go down into the basement until the bombardment was over, and I stayed with them until in the '40's.</span> <span id="s68">In the fall in the '40's.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">And there was a janitor in that house who offered, you know, that I should move in with their family and live with them.</span> <span id="s70">In the meantime, you know, they started...other people started moving in.</span> <span id="s71">It's up in the in the district where later on the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s72">The street was called .</span> <span id="s73">And when they started really giving a very hard time to all the Jews and beating and and resettling, the people started moving in.</span> <span id="s74">My aunt bought me a ticket on the train and said go home.</span> <span id="s75">So I was on the train traveling from Warsaw to .</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Sometime...half-way they stopped the train.</span> <span id="s77">They said all the Jews off.</span> <span id="s78">And they gathered us all in the station...it was a railway station.</span> <span id="s79">A tall guy, a Polish railway worker, came over to me, took my hand to walk me out, and and maybe about half-mile from the station there was three big buildings like apartment buildings where railway workers probably lived, you know.</span> <span id="s80">And he took me to the apartment.</span> <span id="s81">In the apartment there were maybe twenty other Jews, so he kept us over there like some of them he kept like a week, two, two days, five days and slowly he and his wife took them through the fields and tried to help them go on, get out of there.</span> <span id="s82">He kept me six weeks I was over there, and one day he said it's time to move on, and he took me through the fields and I walked like miles and miles...I don't even know what direction, you know.</span> <span id="s83">Some people gave me a ride, you know, and I told them where I want to go and finally I came to the city where I wanted to go home to .</span> <span id="s84">I came over there.</span> <span id="s85">There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s86">I knew I had an aunt, my mother's sister, in .</span> <span id="s87">So I walked to .</span> <span id="s88">You know, on on the way I asked where to go and since I was little blonde girl and uh nobody really suspected that I'm Jewish you know.</span> <span id="s89">Because nobody in all these people who gave me a ride, you know, asked me where you want to go, and I said I want to go there, to .</span> <span id="s90">They took me.</span> <span id="s91">They they...nobody suspected I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s92">I came to .</span> <span id="s93">Was nobody there anymore.</span> <span id="s94">My aunt was, you know, was a wealthy woman.</span> <span id="s95">She had businesses.</span> <span id="s96">It's a small town.</span> <span id="s97">She had a big...and for that time a brick house was a big thing, you know.</span> <span id="s98">She had a big house.</span> <span id="s99">The house was empty, you know.</span> <span id="s100">Some Poles lived over there and they were not there anymore.</span> <span id="s101">So I went back to , and I remembered that while my grandmother, you know, had the dairy, she used to also to deliver some stuff for a hospital, you know.</span> <span id="s102">I remembered that man who was in charge in the hospital is a doctor, so I said I'll go over there, you know, and I'll tell him who I am and maybe he can tell me something where they are, because I didn't know where anybody is, was, you know.</span> <span id="s103">So I went to the hospital and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s104">He put me in a bed, you know.</span> <span id="s105">He said pretend that you are a patient and that you are sick.</span> <span id="s106">We will try to see your your family is in Rawa Russkaya (ph).</span> <span id="s107">This is...next to was Belzec (ph), and next to Belzec, maybe twenty miles, was a city, the Rawa Russkaya.</span> <span id="s108">He let somebody know...I don't know how...by peasants or who sent somebody, that I am in the hospital, in his hospital.</span> <span id="s109">Then my mother and my two sisters are now in Rawa Russkaya.</span> <span id="s110">You could not get through Belzec anymore, so she came...she got some peasants to help her and she came for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">She came to the hospital, and she smuggled me through fields into Rawa Russkaya.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: How did she do that?</span> <span id="s113">Tell us about...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: She she had, you know...Rawa Russkaya was a little village.</span> <span id="s115">It was in the fields...miles and miles of fields.</span> <span id="s116">And she paid some peasants who lived over there, and they brought her in, you know, into the city.</span> <span id="s117">She came to the hospital and picked me up and through fields and and forests and , you know, we went back.</span> <span id="s118">We hadn't seen a soul over there.</span> <span id="s119">There was not a German or or Poles.</span> <span id="s120">Just the peasant and my mother.</span> <span id="s121">And she walked me back to Rawa Russkaya.</span> <span id="s122">Next day, you know...they lived in a, you know...they they really came from to Rawa Russkaya and they didn't have apartment or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s123">They didn't have money, so the Jewish community over there gave an apartment in somebody's basement.</span> <span id="s124">Next day there was a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s125">The Russians were there.</span> <span id="s126">And they took the whole family in about whoever was, you know, about five hundred families from or maybe more...on a on a train and shipped us off to Siberia.</span> <span id="s127">We were in Siberia on the Mongolian border in the Tigress (ph) in the forest as prisoners.</span> <span id="s128">We were over there until 1943, '44, when General who was in in England in the made...you know, they had made a deal with the Russians and they kind of liberated us from the Tigress and sent us into the little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s130">Before you were liberated, uh but you are being shipped to Siberia...can you tell us about the trip to Siberia and then we'll ask you what it was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: The trip took us five weeks in cattle cars without food, without water.</span> <span id="s132">Once in a while they stopped the train...didn't let us off...just brought in some herring, some water, some bread...maybe in the whole five weeks maybe six times.</span> <span id="s133">People were hungry, dirty.</span> <span id="s134">The trip was absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s135">Absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s136">And then they took us, you know, to...it was a little town and they put us in trucks and drove us into the woods, into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">There was nothing there but these tremendous trees.</span> <span id="s138">It was...the Russian Tiger (ph) is is unbelievable because the only thing you have over there is trees and was not a house.</span> <span id="s139">We had to build our own barracks, and they had... couple of day commandant and some others who overseed us.</span> <span id="s140">We could not leave the place.</span> <span id="s141">It was not fenced in or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">But where would you go?</span> <span id="s143">There was a village about five or ten miles away, but you couldn't leave without having a permission to leave and at the...what we had to do over there is get up every morning and cut down trees, cut the trees down into one meter blocks and pile it up in the forest.</span> <span id="s144">And for this you got the ration bread, just bread.</span> <span id="s145">Was hunger.</span> <span id="s146">The families built like a barrack and each barrack was divided into tiny little places.</span> <span id="s147">You lived on the floor.</span> <span id="s148">It was cold.</span> <span id="s149">The winters were horri...winter was...we were one winter there...absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s150">The snows went up six, seven feet and uh was was bad.</span> <span id="s151">It was bad, you know.</span> <span id="s152">And we thought that when we came...if we're ever liberated of these these miserable forests, we'll have stories to tell, and fortunately when we came back after, you know, the war ended...they let us go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s153">On the way back, you know, once we crossed Ger...the Polish border, the Russian-Polish border, the Poles started, you know, wanted to dynamite the train.</span> <span id="s154">And, you know, everybody had to get off the train.</span> <span id="s155">The train was escorted by Russian military.</span> <span id="s156">We had to get off the train.</span> <span id="s157">It took them hours and hours until they cleared what they were and we came into Poland and nobody wanted to go, you know.</span> <span id="s158">They took us to a town with the name of .</span> <span id="s159">It used to be a German town and when belonged to Poland.</span> <span id="s160">We didn't know what to do with ourselves, so I joined the kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: This is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: That's right after...around '45.</span> <span id="s163">I joined a kibbutz, the .</span> <span id="s164">This is...and I was in the kibbutz for a while.</span> <span id="s165">I was working and get...you know...wanted to leave to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s166">That was the purpose of joining the kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: What was the kibbutz like?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: It...the kibbutz was really a transient place where people came, stayed a while, worked, and from there tried to leave to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s169">It was not a kibbutz like you have in Israel which you work and you establish a life and you're...it was really a place where people, Jewish people could come, be safe.</span> <span id="s170">The place where they gathered.</span> <span id="s171">There was a Jewish community center, but it did not have the the facilities to accommodate people who came into town, Jewish people, because where would they go.</span> <span id="s172">So I I was in that kibbutz for a while, and then somebody came to me by the name of Andre (ph), and said, you know, you better come and join us.</span> <span id="s173">And I joined the Brichah (ph).</span> <span id="s174">And they sent me to Lodz and to Warsaw to be trained, you know...tell me what to...what I'm going to have to do and things like that, and my main job was to try to find children and bring them to , to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s175">And from there, we put them on trucks into and tried to smuggle them in through the Russian border into Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Tell us about uh some of the children and some of the things that you did in the Brichah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Most of the children that we gathered were orphans.</span> <span id="s178">They were children who Jewish families left either with neighbors or some other Poles or people who wanted to make some extra money from the Jewish families, kept the child through the whole thing.</span> <span id="s179">You know, once the war is over and they can dispose of the child or send it back or and get lots of money paid for it, if they can track, you know...lots of Polish people came to us with these children and demanded a lot of money.</span> <span id="s180">Others wouldn't give up with the children.</span> <span id="s181">Some adopted them.</span> <span id="s182">The others had free labor and most of the children didn't really know that they're Jewish.</span> <span id="s183">We had to find out.</span> <span id="s184">There were different ways to find out.</span> <span id="s185">We used to come to a town and, you know, pretend that they are Poles, and go to the inns and sit and drink and eat with the Poles and joke around about the Jews and here and there you could hear a rumor from...somebody say...hey, you know these five kids of these and this and this family were all blond but there is a black one over there too.</span> <span id="s186">I bet you she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s187">Or I'd bet you he's Jewish, so we kind of found out this way how the kids are, where they are, what they're doing, and tried to gather them in order to send them to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: How did you get them...how did you go about getting them?</span> <span id="s189">A: Getting them to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Physically get them out of the families first?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, most of the times we came and negotiated.</span> <span id="s192">We paid money.</span> <span id="s193">We gave jewelry.</span> <span id="s194">Sometimes even you had to just grab them, just kidnap them.</span> <span id="s195">I hate to use that word, because it's really not kidnapping, you know.</span> <span id="s196">It's getting back what was yours.</span> <span id="s197">Now let's pause.</span> <span id="s198">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: It's OK.</span> <span id="s200">(Pause) It's OK.</span> <span id="s201">Take your time.</span> <span id="s202">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Anyway, we gathered them to the big building to the court in the center in the building was like a square.</span> <span id="s204">The front part had a big gate, and we had guards over there because it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s205">The Poles didn't let us be.</span> <span id="s206">One night we had seventy-five kids, and we kept them in the back of the building, because it was like a square and Polish hooligans or whoever, you know, attacked the building with guns and was shooting and stones and the police was right there on the corner.</span> <span id="s207">Nobody came out to say a thing.</span> <span id="s208">It went on for hours, and everybody was scared and the children were scared, you know.</span> <span id="s209">There was screaming and crying and really, you know, we didn't know how to keep these kids quiet.</span> <span id="s210">They was really scared of this all the shooting.</span> <span id="s211">That's what happ...it happened not only once...many times, so next day we used to take some on trucks and drive them down to the border.</span> <span id="s212">Normally there were Russians on one side and Germans on the other side.</span> <span id="s213">Means to either pay off uh with money, bribe the borders, guards, you know, to let you through.</span> <span id="s214">On the other side there were Brichah from Germany who took them over and they took over...they continued on the other side and we went back.</span> <span id="s215">And uh this lasted and maybe about two years and one day they came, the Polish police came and said they're looking for a little blonde with a blue cape and you see, the Brichah the Brichah had it's quarters on top on the fourth floor and the guards sent up somebody and said, you know, that they're looking for me.</span> <span id="s216">So they got me out and they put me in truck and I went into Germany and I went to Germany and I reported to Munich.</span> <span id="s217">It was the Brichah and of course I worked over there and my job was different.</span> <span id="s218">My job was to find new ways to get...this was illegal...to get people through the borders, through the mountains into Austria and Italy, and from there some oth...some other people came.</span> <span id="s219">Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Tell us about those trips, or one of those trips.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Us...usually, you know, uh we waited for the night.</span> <span id="s222">You know, we...I'll give you one example...we were in and we had to find a way to get people through the mountains, the Alps.</span> <span id="s223">So at night there was me, two other guys, one Israeli, one German Jew young man and another girl, and we were pretending that we are hiking and got lost in the mountains.</span> <span id="s224">To find a better way, a route, so if, you know, that will, you know, we could smuggle through people.</span> <span id="s225">And after a couple of weeks we established the route.</span> <span id="s226">We marked it and and it was a place from where me could smuggle through the people into Italy and into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Can you...as it were, take us on one of those journeys?</span> <span id="s228">What, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Well, we.</span> <span id="s230">.</span> <span id="s231">whenever, you know, the trip was scheduled to go through the mountains.</span> <span id="s232">We had a building over there where we stayed.</span> <span id="s233">A truck used to come with seventy people, eighty people, husbands, wives, children, luggage, packages and we used to take them climbing up the mountains and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s234">People couldn't...it's hard for older people.</span> <span id="s235">It's hard for little kids.</span> <span id="s236">Not equi...not really too many children that to climb mountains, you know, you really have to equipped for.</span> <span id="s237">You have to have the proper clothing.</span> <span id="s238">You can't carry anything.</span> <span id="s239">On the way they left their...they used to carry suitcases with these pots and pans, with everything, you know, hoping that they'll come someplace and have something, you know.</span> <span id="s240">They have to leave everything.</span> <span id="s241">They used to climb up and go through the route that we have established before, that we cannot be caught by the by the police, by the guards, by the border guards, and on the other side the others took them over and we went back.</span> <span id="s242">This we did three times a week, four times a week, whenever it's nec...was necessary.</span> <span id="s243">I became a good mountain climber.</span> <span id="s244">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: What was it like for you, doing all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I think it was the most gratifying time in my life.</span> <span id="s247">I find still now...I came to New York to some affair a couple of years ago, and a young woman by the name of ...I forgot her last name...came over to me and says, I know you.</span> <span id="s248">You know, when my mother and father and my brothers cross the border, you took their jewelry to have it saved, and smug...smuggled it through into Italy.</span> <span id="s249">We'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s250">I mean it was the most gratifying time in my life and now it's different, you know.</span> <span id="s251">Now...but at that time there was nothing.</span> <span id="s252">No future.</span> <span id="s253">It was worthwhile.</span> <span id="s254">Then we came, you know...I was in Germany and then liberation...after liberation we still had some work to do and I was, you know, in the Brichah.</span> <span id="s255">It was attached to the Jewish agency in Munich, so I was still...they kept me a little bit busy still and then I came to Frankfurt and final got to Israel, but while I was in Frankfurt I have a chance to apply for to come to the United States, and everybody said why not.</span> <span id="s256">Try it.</span> <span id="s257">What can you lose?</span> <span id="s258">So I applied, you know, for immigration to the United States, and I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s259">One day I had a telephone call...if you want to go to see the United States, now is the time to go.</span> <span id="s260">And I had a boyfriend in Israel, but he said go, you know, so you'll come back in a couple of months.</span> <span id="s261">I mean such chances not everybody
