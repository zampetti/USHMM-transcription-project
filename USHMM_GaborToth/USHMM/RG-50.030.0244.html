WARD</span></p> <p><span id="s11">November 16, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Would you please like to give us your name, age, and where you are from please?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Yes Sir.</span> <span id="s14">My name is Thomas L. Ward.</span> <span id="s15">I am originally from St. Louis, Missouri.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in St. Louis, August 10, 1921.</span> <span id="s17">I was reared in St. Louis up until the time that I went into Service.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What type of a family life did you have?</span> <span id="s19">What type of family?</span> <span id="s20">Large family?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I had...we had a large family.</span> <span id="s22">All my family were plumbers.</span> <span id="s23">They were in the plumbing business and we lived in the...at that time, we lived in Northwest St. Louis.</span> <span id="s24">My father had a shop in the basement.</span> <span id="s25">Years ago, all plumbers had their own shop in the basement, and I was cutting pipe, which they don't do today, when I was 9 years old, learn how to cut pipe.</span> <span id="s26">And I worked at the plumbing shop every Saturday with my father and my brothers did too.</span> <span id="s27">And we were raised in a Catholic Parish in St. Louis called Corpus Christie which is in Jennings, Missouri.</span> <span id="s28">I went to school there.</span> <span id="s29">I went to grade school there.</span> <span id="s30">I proceeded from that school, and then I went to Bomount High School in St. Louis, which is on Natural Bridge Avenue and after that, I..</span> <span id="s31">.</span> <span id="s32">uh...I worked at a place called Famous and Byer, which is a department store downtown and which is still there, and I worked there until ,uh, well for a couple of years, and then I was...I went into the Army when I was quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: How old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: 21.</span> <span id="s36">In what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: That was...20...that was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: 1941.</span> <span id="s39">Maybe, you could tell us a little bit about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: No.</span> <span id="s41">I want to cut that.</span> <span id="s42">No.</span> <span id="s43">I was 20...20 years old, because I went to Fort Ralley, Kansas, the Second Calvary, which was a horse drawn outfit at that time, and we stayed there until, uh, uh, they broke the horses up and they made it all mechanized.</span> <span id="s44">And when I say mechanized, everybody went in different directions.</span> <span id="s45">And, uh, then I wound up on the West Coast...uh, with the 107th Calvary, and they eventually broke that up and moved us to Camp Hood.</span> <span id="s46">It's Port Hood now.</span> <span id="s47">The mechanized outfit.</span> <span id="s48">And from there, why, we became replacements.</span> <span id="s49">I hope I am not getting too fast.</span> <span id="s50">We became replacements while the war was on.</span> <span id="s51">This was after D-Day.</span> <span id="s52">I should summarize this a little bit.</span> <span id="s53">For the 3rd Calvary, which we...uh...we were replacements for the 3rd Calvary for the line duty men we called it see, when the boys passed and got hurt and killed, why we replaced that.</span> <span id="s54">And I..</span> <span id="s55">.</span> <span id="s56">if I am going too fast or...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: No, that's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: And then I would...we went to...uh...I hope I haven't left anything out.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: No.</span> <span id="s60">That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Then we went...and I was assigned to Troop F, which is the only...the rest of the squadron was accompanied, but this troop was Troop F.</span> <span id="s62">They called it Troop F in the cavalry.</span> <span id="s63">I'd like to emphasize the 3rd Calvary was Patton's old 3rd Calvary...a harsh Navy exec officer, General Patton, and he was quite...he was quite...he was quite interested in us at all times because this is his old outfit.</span> <span id="s64">We reconned for the 4th and 6th Army Divisions.</span> <span id="s65">We went through the southern route of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What do you mean by the Reconn Group.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Reconnaissance squadrons are squadrons that would go and find the enemy.</span> <span id="s68">Like the Panzer Division of some sort....an illustration of the Panzer.</span> <span id="s69">We could not fight it because we were light tanks and we would have to back off and back away and let the 4th and the heavy tanks at the port in the 6th Harbor come in and fight for us see.</span> <span id="s70">And we would...Reconnaissance Squadrons...that's what they called us....a reconnaissance squadron to find out where everybody was and how we would fight them, and then the Colonel...we were attached to the 20th Corps...uh...I wanted to get that in.</span> <span id="s71">And...uh...which we fought all the way in the south, fighting...fought our way through the south, literally fought our way through the south at all times, all day...many battles I was in.</span> <span id="s72">I mean, not only me, but the, this troop.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I might ask what was the year that you went over to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Uh...Europe was ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s77">March.</span> <span id="s78">Yal.</span> <span id="s79">or February.</span> <span id="s80">We were a replacement, if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What part of Europe did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, we went by France, Germany, all the southern Germany, Cassell Uh, we just went all out.</span> <span id="s83">Well, once you...once you became a replacement, you went to replacement pool.</span> <span id="s84">And once you became a replacement, you were forwarded to that...to that outfit, and you were another man.</span> <span id="s85">You would take his place as a replacement in the troop.</span> <span id="s86">And we fought all through southern Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Who was your officer in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Captain Brennan.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And how many men consisted of your little reconnaissance group?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Oh, there was...was quite a..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">quite a..</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">it wasn't a small one.</span> <span id="s95">You mean of this one company?</span> <span id="s96">250 people.</span> <span id="s97">That's only one....</span> <span id="s98">Now a reconnaissance squadron is a group of companies, but our troop was one troop.</span> <span id="s99">We were the tank troop.</span> <span id="s100">They had armored cars, armored vehicles.</span> <span id="s101">They had half tracks, uh, light tanks, and we were the light tank for this here one...this here one group.</span> <span id="s102">We were only tank in this here one squadron, in 3rd Cavalry reconnaissance squadron.</span> <span id="s103">We were the only tanks, but we had...there were two or three other squadrons attached to 20th Corps that went a different route.</span> <span id="s104">We had this here...we wound up in Austria, and our commanding officer was Colonel Walleck.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So the Germans were beginning to be pushed back?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s107">They were fading back, and they...we had...we knew how to fight the Panzer see.</span> <span id="s108">Eventually you could not fight a Panzer tank because the bullets, shells and everything would hit the front.</span> <span id="s109">Uh...you...you...the just...you know, they would glance off, but then they would put concrete in front of the tanks so we would have to hit them on the side to knock them out.</span> <span id="s110">You would have to go around to the side and shoot them and knock the tracks, the half tracks off of them, and that's how you destroyed them, and then they started fading, and people started...the Vermax started to give up...you know what I mean...and everybody...the horse drawn, there was a lot of horses, and they were...dead people...I hate to get into this...were all over the place.</span> <span id="s111">I mean, you know, soldiers, horses and dead horses and just everything until... And we knew that we were...we knew that we were forwarding...we knew we had a hope then you know what I mean...and we could fight and fight much better and we didn't...we didn't come to that much resistance like we had for awhile there.</span> <span id="s112">We had an awful lot of resistance.</span> <span id="s113">And a German was a very good fighter.</span> <span id="s114">And the Panzer Division is an excellent fighter.</span> <span id="s115">You had to know what you were doing, because he could maneuver the tank, and there is an art of maneuvering tank.</span> <span id="s116">And anyhow we went in, and we passed, and we went through Austria, and we went into the...I hope I am not getting too fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: No.</span> <span id="s118">This is fine.</span> <span id="s119">What part of Austria did you enter?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Southern end.</span> <span id="s121">And...uh, this is where Ebensee and uh...Kamer...and we did not get to Wien...Vienna...they call it Wien in Austria.</span> <span id="s122">We did not get there.</span> <span id="s123">We stopped there at the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s124">Matter of fact, we were supposed to get a relief for awhile off the line, and that was the time that we did get our relief and, uh, when we ran into this forest... It was late at night, about 2:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s125">We were driving.</span> <span id="s126">We never, generally never drove at night, and I never seen a battle at night.</span> <span id="s127">I never seen a battle at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I never seen a battle at night and I better explain that why.</span> <span id="s130">Because to drive the tank you got to have some kind of uh, some light or something...I mean you can't just go down without something on and if you showed...there's a little strips of light, and if you would show a strip of light, you would be shot at.</span> <span id="s131">So that always bewildered me about people said they fought.</span> <span id="s132">Now I was out on patrol at night.</span> <span id="s133">I stayed out.</span> <span id="s134">And we stayed in farmhouses and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: By the way, talking about the farmhouses and the little towns that you came to, what was the reaction of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: They were...the farm houses over there...it was...some of the tanks...there was 2 or 3 times that our tank that we had we'd be going down the hill and we make a turn, and we slide into the farm house, and just knock a hole.</span> <span id="s137">You see the farm house...the people lived on top of the farmhouse, and the, uh, uh, cows and everything was in the bottom of the farm house.</span> <span id="s138">And they were good people there.</span> <span id="s139">They were good people and they...the Vermark, I don't believe wanted war.</span> <span id="s140">I don't believe they wanted war.</span> <span id="s141">I mean 2 or 3 of them surrendered to me, just walked up and surrendered to me.</span> <span id="s142">And, uh, uh, I don't believe...now of course the SS they were very staunch and they wanted to do everything what they wanted to do, and they are very cold hearted people I guess you might put it in that they cared about nothing, but only the father land and they believed that that...uh...we would have our hardest battles with the Panzer Division which was right close to the SS and uh, uh, they were hard.</span> <span id="s143">They were good fighters.</span> <span id="s144">I mean they are not...you could never take that away from them, they were very good fighters, and they fight to the bitter end, ‘til they died, you see.</span> <span id="s145">And, uh, I lost a lot of friends in battle.</span> <span id="s146">I seen battle.</span> <span id="s147">I was in battle, and one of my dear friends who was one...was a tank driver...his name was Buckles...Captain Brennan told him a thousand times that when you go into battle, you buckle up.</span> <span id="s148">Down with the Buckles couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s149">He had to have his head up, and they blew his head off.</span> <span id="s150">And I have had a lot of friends of mine that died in... We would stay...I hope this gets to some of the old timers.</span> <span id="s151">If we would get into a farm house and it was vacant, and we got to sleep at night we would try to get in where...close up to where they shoot...if they were going to shoot that morning, they would shoot through the windows, and we would be under there avoiding them, you see.</span> <span id="s152">Avoiding the bullets, avoiding the bullets because they would shoot in, and they would go to the door on the other end, but we were close over by the war.</span> <span id="s153">Let me specify that.</span> <span id="s154">And it's a great feeling to get up in the morning, and you don't know if you are going to die or not, that you lived and that you...that you...it's just a great feeling when it was all over with that you can say you lived and we moved out many times early morning to go fight, but not fight at night.</span> <span id="s155">Not until that daybreak because you had to see what's going on, and you would...you could...uh...the...we would fight and then if it's too heavy, the big tanks would come in and they would make a diamond.</span> <span id="s156">And I seen a lot of American boys...I knew I was in that tank...and I knew there were American infantry men all around me, and they were...the only protection they had was that tank or a tank, and they were outside and I was in.</span> <span id="s157">However, if the tank was hit, one of our Lieutenants, Lieutenant Benslak, his tank was hit.</span> <span id="s158">He burned up in it.</span> <span id="s159">Everybody burns if it is hit properly enough.</span> <span id="s160">And see, these memories I have for 40 years.</span> <span id="s161">(sobbing)</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: No problem.</span> <span id="s163">There's some Kleenex.</span> <span id="s164">You are bringing back some memories and we understand that.</span> <span id="s165">As time went on, as you are getting closer and closer to the Heartland so to speak, did you begin to hear some of the stories about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s167">But we didn't...we didn't...we knew there were...we were starting to get the stories from other people, but we never witnessed this until we got into this camp itself and...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: What were some of the stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Well, we sort of figured that the Jews were kept in concentration camp, you know, like Dachau, uh, uh, Auschwitz, and, uh, but these were all hearsay third party, fourth party things, and, uh, uh, we would hear that just like if our...our...uh...when we get mail, and they would.</span> <span id="s170">We would get...our mail would come up to us, you know what I mean, and "Did you hear about this?</span> <span id="s171">You know there's a concentration camp, you know, maybe up this way or 200 miles or 500 miles or something like that see."</span> <span id="s172">But it never phased me.</span> <span id="s173">I never...I never bothered about it.</span> <span id="s174">I never...I didn't...I was too concerned looking out for my own life, and everybody else was.</span> <span id="s175">When you are in war, you don't have to tell a man to clean his gun.</span> <span id="s176">He will take care of that.</span> <span id="s177">He don't want to be killed.</span> <span id="s178">And these are the things of life.</span> <span id="s179">And so but anyhow, we.</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">getting back to my story, we proceeded into Austria in the lower end where all the lakes were and the forests were and we were mostly on a..</span> <span id="s182">.</span> <span id="s183">we were sort of like on a patrol unit, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s184">Cause you can't fight too well in the forests, in the woods and everything.</span> <span id="s185">It's hard to go by, and these are facts.</span> <span id="s186">I know.</span> <span id="s187">I don't know what any other body said, but I know.</span> <span id="s188">So we went into this area, and we got there about 2 o'clock in the morning, and we started hearing moans, but the tanks always moved.</span> <span id="s189">You know what I mean, a little bit every bit, but we got into this area about 2 o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What is the area you are speaking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Near the concentration camp I am speaking of.</span> <span id="s192">Am I too fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Ebensee.</span> <span id="s195">Yal.</span> <span id="s196">Ebensee, Austria.</span> <span id="s197">We were near there.</span> <span id="s198">We were on the outskirts of it.</span> <span id="s199">We didn't know it was Ebensee.</span> <span id="s200">I didn't know it at the time.</span> <span id="s201">So, uh, there were 3 of us, and the...and we started hearing these moans, and I said, "What is the world is that?"</span> <span id="s202">You know what I mean, and we heard human smells of like dead bodies.</span> <span id="s203">It's an odor that you won't forget.</span> <span id="s204">I don't care...there is no way that you will forget it.</span> <span id="s205">And I asked the one fellow, a Polish boy, I said,"Benny, what do you think we ought to do?"</span> <span id="s206">He said, "We can't see a thing.</span> <span id="s207">It's black out there."</span> <span id="s208">You know, the forests...you know, no lights or nothing.</span> <span id="s209">We'll just have to wait til sun-up to see what's going on out there.</span> <span id="s210">And I talked to another man, Ed Maser.</span> <span id="s211">I don't know where Ed is today.</span> <span id="s212">Uh...We did talk about it in Chicago in the in the 50s the last time I seen him.</span> <span id="s213">He was in Chicago.</span> <span id="s214">He was a New York man.</span> <span id="s215">I don't know where he is today.</span> <span id="s216">I hope he is still living.</span> <span id="s217">Anyhow we went to...when sunup, we went and we seen this huge, huge...it looked like a fort...like the old time forts with all the logs up on them...they looked like telephone poles, that's how big they were now.</span> <span id="s218">I am not exaggerating that.</span> <span id="s219">But they were just lumber.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, they were just a tree cut down and put there.</span> <span id="s221">And I seen all of these...all of these watch towers...these towers around see...and I thought it was a prison at first.</span> <span id="s222">I would assume it was a prison, which it was, but not the one I thought.</span> <span id="s223">Then I told him...I says...I told Benny, I said, "There's no guards that are up in these towers," and that would be unusual.</span> <span id="s224">Everything looked like it was just...everybody skiddadled and ran or somewhere.</span> <span id="s225">So I said, "Let's take the tank."</span> <span id="s226">and we both decided we would take the tank and hit the gates.</span> <span id="s227">And the gates were loose, you know.</span> <span id="s228">They were really unlocked.</span> <span id="s229">These people were so out of it, you know, they didn't...they just didn't...they just didn't...I am talking about the inmates...they were just terrible.</span> <span id="s230">Well, when we opened it up, then we seen all of these people there, and they said and they would tell that they were happy to see us and everything and that, uh, we...it was hard.</span> <span id="s231">They asked for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s232">You don't...I can't...you can't visualize...you can't understand what these people went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Human...Let me see.</span> <span id="s235">I wanted to explain that.</span> <span id="s236">I am glad you asked that question.</span> <span id="s237">Their eyes were sunk in.</span> <span id="s238">Did you ever seen anybody with a cancer that was wasted to nothing?</span> <span id="s239">They were wasted to nothing.</span> <span id="s240">Absolutely nothing!</span> <span id="s241">They would bring these men into these salt mines.</span> <span id="s242">This was a salt mine.</span> <span id="s243">And they were...I would assume they were big men, and they would whittle them down to nothing, and they're.</span> <span id="s244">.</span> <span id="s245">They would not feed them.</span> <span id="s246">They would give them potato peelings, and, uh, that's what the inmates told us, and that, uh, they would have so much cubic, piece of bread, and the guards, who were ex-convicts of German...they were German ex-convicts ran these camps...I mean would...ran the barracks.</span> <span id="s247">They would come and ask how many people was there that the inmates would tell it, and we want half of that in the morning when roll call would come.</span> <span id="s248">And they...I went and I seen...from there, we proceeded...we tried to feed them, and we had to feed them under a guard, under an armed guard, a soup line, so they wouldn't get out and they wouldn't feed up their stomach.</span> <span id="s249">They didn't have...they were just bones.</span> <span id="s250">There was nothing to these people.</span> <span id="s251">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s252">And their stomach...they could only digest the soup.</span> <span id="s253">They couldn't...they didn't have nothing to digest.</span> <span id="s254">They didn't have no body, really.</span> <span id="s255">Anyhow, we got that...and if you would throw a cigarette down, 4 or 5 inmates would jump on that cigarette, a butt of a cigarette, to smoke that cigarette, see.</span> <span id="s256">And then we went into the barracks, and they were high and there were 2 men to each bunk.</span> <span id="s257">And then we proceeded and then they told us to go to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s258">4 high and 2 to each bunk.</span> <span id="s259">The inmates asked us to come to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s260">We didn't know what we were going into.</span> <span id="s261">We were...they asked us, "Please come."</span> <span id="s262">I remember going into there...going to there, and then I seen one room.</span> <span id="s263">I would say there was 500 bodies stacked there.</span> <span id="s264">At least 500.</span> <span id="s265">I am not exaggerating.</span> <span id="s266">I took pictures of them in my album and if anybody sees this in St. Louis, I would like to refer to my album that I gave to the St. Louis Jewish Council on Ala Street in 1946 of January, when I was discharged out of the Army.</span> <span id="s267">But getting back to that, their tattoos was not on their arm.</span> <span id="s268">There were some on their arm.</span> <span id="s269">Displaced person!</span> <span id="s270">But these people in this...in this room...these bodies, I should say, the tattoos were on their chest.</span> <span id="s271">And then we proceeded from that room to go to the crematorium, and they would put 2 people on a slab in this crematorium.</span> <span id="s272">They would have...they had operating tables there.</span> <span id="s273">They would take the gold out of their teeth...gold out of their teeth, and make rings out of them.</span> <span id="s274">And on the sign of the crematorium, it says, "My body would rather be burned than go into the ground, and they would push them into the crematorium to burn them, which they would be gone in 15 minutes or whatever it took them.</span> <span id="s275">Very quick!</span> <span id="s276">But on this thing, I know, I was trying to find a word for it last night and I found this word.</span> <span id="s277">Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews and this is terrible, and God would not let that happen.</span> <span id="s278">I heard other stories.</span> <span id="s279">Not in this particular camp, in other camps down the years, that they would have the Jewish people go into a room and tell them that they were taking a shower...you probably heard this story...where they would gas them.</span> <span id="s280">And that's the God's honest truth.</span> <span id="s281">I know they did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: How long were you in Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: A month.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: A whole month?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Almost a month.</span> <span id="s286">A little less.</span> <span id="s287">In other words, I was attached to Major Kone, who was Judge Advocate Department when he came in for the pictures and everything and I was attached to his...I was relieved....I was taking pictures...which my pictures went to the Allied Supreme Headquarters, and went to the Nuremberg trial over that, and, uh, what I wanted to do...I wanted to leave a little legacy of this to remind the youngest Jewish children that it did happen because I witnessed it, and I was there.</span> <span id="s288">And their heritage is at stake and they should never forget, never forget, because 44 years ago as of this day I can look at it vividly that those persons...dead persons in that room...stacked... You don't forget those things.</span> <span id="s289">You cannot.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Tell me, did the people...did you see the mass graves?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s292">We dug them.</span> <span id="s293">We didn't dig them.</span> <span id="s294">The...the, uh, people in Ebensee dug the graves, but I had...we got some...they had horse drawn carts open...wagons... There were no sides to it, and they put a lot of the buried bodies...put them on there to take them to there.</span> <span id="s295">And there was a hospital in Ebensee that came... However, they knew that there was a concentration camp there.</span> <span id="s296">They knew there was some kind of an inmate camp there because they knew it.</span> <span id="s297">They couldn't avoid it.</span> <span id="s298">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s299">And however, they did come down to help.</span> <span id="s300">And there was a nun there that came to help and that period everything kind of got moved around a little bit there.</span> <span id="s301">You know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did they volunteer to come in or did the commander?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: We went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s304">And of course, they volunteered.</span> <span id="s305">That was technical...I am glad you asked that question.</span> <span id="s306">But we told them to come.</span> <span id="s307">We went to the hospital and told them to come down there.</span> <span id="s308">But they came.</span> <span id="s309">They didn't object to it.</span> <span id="s310">It was sort of a volunteer I guess you would say, but at our request.</span> <span id="s311">And then the, the inmates caught one of the officers who was at that camp about a week later I guess, and they turned him over to the military authority and one guard they caught and they spread eagled him and stoned him to death, on the ground, so he must have been a..</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">must have been a very bad man of some sort.</span> <span id="s314">And the nuns came there.</span> <span id="s315">Then they told us that there was another camp.</span> <span id="s316">Am I getting to far?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: No.</span> <span id="s318">Maybe before we get to the other camp... The towns people...did they deny what was going on there?</span> <span id="s319">Although they knew it was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: That was a good question.</span> <span id="s321">I am glad you asked that.</span> <span id="s322">They knew it was camp.</span> <span id="s323">They did...let's put it they didn't want to be bothered.</span> <span id="s324">uh, They knew that that was a concentration...they knew that the Jews were in that camp.</span> <span id="s325">You couldn't help from knowing it.</span> <span id="s326">You take a place that large and working in the salt mines and seeing some of them people, they would have to go out.</span> <span id="s327">They would have to go to them salt mines under guard or something.</span> <span id="s328">You couldn't help from knowing it.</span> <span id="s329">But it seems they just didn't...they took it for granted that that was it.</span> <span id="s330">And I tell you another little thing that I would as of this day, I..</span> <span id="s331">.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know for sure...I honestly can't say this for sure, but I could have swore to this day that I seen one of the biggest officials near that camp.</span> <span id="s333">He was a young officer.</span> <span id="s334">And I don't want to get into that, because I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s335">But faces don't change.</span> <span id="s336">You might get old, but faces don't change in years, and they...they said he knew a lot of things were going on in Austria, and to this day, I believe he did know it because I am sure he was...he was it was just there.</span> <span id="s337">I just know it, but I don't want to get into...towns brought into see the burial?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: The towns people were brought in to made help bury the people, to dig, help dig the graves, uh, and bury them where they're were mass, which they did.</span> <span id="s339">But the most important thing, that hospital was a very.</span> <span id="s340">It's very grateful that that hospital was there, because they could help do the things that were supposed to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What was the reaction of the towns-people when they saw upfront the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Amazed.</span> <span id="s343">And...uh... They knew the camp was there.</span> <span id="s344">I don't know if they knew the crematoriums were there.</span> <span id="s345">I don't know.</span> <span id="s346">I would doubt that because that was in a secluded...this was a big camp.</span> <span id="s347">This was not a small camp.</span> <span id="s348">And...but some people would have to know.</span> <span id="s349">Some people worked there...in the town...you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s350">They would have to know.</span> <span id="s351">You can't get away from reality.</span> <span id="s352">There's no way in the world you can get away from reality.</span> <span id="s353">And whatever it is, they knew there were Jews in the camp.</span> <span id="s354">They knew that they were Jews because of the uniforms...of the costumes they had, and they had no use for a Jew.</span> <span id="s355">I don't...Hitler never had no use for a Jew.</span> <span id="s356">I don't...I hate to say it that way, but he wanted them...as I got back to the one word, he wanted to exterminate them all, and God won't let him do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Were there other people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes, there were.</span> <span id="s359">Gypsies.</span> <span id="s360">Inmates of the camp.</span> <span id="s361">Uh,</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Maybe you can tell us a little bit about the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Well, they were kind of...there were...there were some there, uh, uh, and they worked and they were treated just like the Jews.</span> <span id="s364">I mean the same things, uh... I never got acquainted with them.</span> <span id="s365">Uh, I have one man...his name...I would like to put...inject this into this conversation.</span> <span id="s366">He was one of the finest photographers that I have ever seen, and he did that in real life over there.</span> <span id="s367">He helped me process some of the negatives and that, and his name was William Greenberg, and he spoke English fluently, but he was at the camp, and he said that he had relatives in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s368">I never found out if he ever reached his relatives.</span> <span id="s369">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: So he was an actual inmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Yes, he was an inmate in there.</span> <span id="s372">I got him some clothes.</span> <span id="s373">(laugh) Took them clothes off of him (laugh) and got some clothes and let him look like a man again.</span> <span id="s374">And, but I wonder of these many years, many times, his face and his name crossed my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Where was he from before he was put in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s376">His home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: He was from Austria.</span> <span id="s378">He was from... Where was he from?</span> <span id="s379">I think it was Cassell.</span> <span id="s380">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s381">I missed that.</span> <span id="s382">But he was sent to Austria.</span> <span id="s383">So if he ever witness...if anybody wants to talk about Ebensee, maybe somebody will know that man somewhere along the...I hope he made it to the United States.</span> <span id="s384">He would be much older than I. I would assume he was maybe 30 years old at that time or maybe a shade over, and he made, uh, he made me...he helped me with this photography.</span> <span id="s385">And he spoke very good English, and that was a hundred plus there, you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Tell me, did the Army begin to give them new clothing to wear aside from the uniforms they had on?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Not at...We...they were getting clothes, but not…not for a long time.</span> <span id="s388">I didn't see any with too much clothing.</span> <span id="s389">I got Bill clothing cause I just went out and got it (laughter) and got him some clothes and got him a bath and got, I hate to say it, deloused him.</span> <span id="s390">You know, they all had to be deloused and everything.</span> <span id="s391">But I did that for him.</span> <span id="s392">He was a nice gentleman and he was kind of close to me you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s393">Basically, he helped me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: So you were how long in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: About a month.</span> <span id="s396">A little less than a month.</span> <span id="s397">Then we were pulled back and they pulled the whole outfit back, the 20th Corps.</span> <span id="s398">Well, before that I want to get into this other little camp down the road.</span> <span id="s399">Uh, we stayed there about a month I guess, a little less than a month.</span> <span id="s400">Cause you have to remember one thing, we were a fighting unit.</span> <span id="s401">And there...then they brought a hospital unit in.</span> <span id="s402">This is interesting.</span> <span id="s403">Uh, one of the surgeons...uh...it was similar...a hospital unit...a field hospital, and this one surgeon was Major Douglas Stone, and he was a very good surgeon and I don't know if he is living today or not, but his father was a very good surgeon and I seen him in the 50s.</span> <span id="s404">I went to his...to see him in the 50s and we went out.</span> <span id="s405">He took me to lunch, and I never seen him since.</span> <span id="s406">And I want to look him up and see if he is still living.</span> <span id="s407">He would be...as I say, he had to be in the 70s today, but he had a practice.</span> <span id="s408">I went to his practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So this unit came in to start taking care of the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s411">He was the...he was a Major.</span> <span id="s412">And he was a very good surgeon.</span> <span id="s413">They took care of the...started taking what they had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So then you pulled out of there and went down the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: We were told...No...it was not that far down the road, but we were told there was a woman's camp down there and we went down there and looked at it.</span> <span id="s416">But they weren't...they weren't as bad as this Ebensee.</span> <span id="s417">It was a little more humane in that camp.</span> <span id="s418">I mean, the women were a little more humane.</span> <span id="s419">You know what I mean it wasn't as bad.</span> <span id="s420">Now it was bad.</span> <span id="s421">Don't misunderstand me.</span> <span id="s422">But, uh, it seemed to me if I recall, they did eat a little better than that in this here women's camp and, uh, but there was quite a few people, women, in that camp.</span> <span id="s423">And I don't... Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What was the camp like?</span> <span id="s425">Was it surrounded by a wall, barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: This Ebensee as I was referring to again... did you ever see when you cut timber on a great big, when a man cut a big tree down, maybe 2 stories high (I have to put it that way.</span> <span id="s427">I can't say by the feet) I say 2 stories and there are timber like that in these areas.</span> <span id="s428">Well, that's how this here camp was.</span> <span id="s429">It was all wood.</span> <span id="s430">It was all these logs, made up all the way around this camp.</span> <span id="s431">It was just one tree after another put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: But that was in Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: That was in Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What about the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No.</span> <span id="s436">The other...the ladies was not like that.</span> <span id="s437">It was more openly, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s438">There was a barbed wire around that little situation, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: What type of housing did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: They had barracks.</span> <span id="s441">They all had barracks.</span> <span id="s442">Oh, I say barracks.</span> <span id="s443">Yes, that was barracks.</span> <span id="s444">Yes, that's it.</span> <span id="s445">But not as bad as the one in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s446">You see, these barracks were 4 high, 2 men into the bunks, I would say, 4 high.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you go inside the barracks for the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Oh, Yal.</span> <span id="s449">Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: And what were the conditions there?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Well, now I..</span> <span id="s452">.</span> <span id="s453">now I can say this.</span> <span id="s454">In the women's I never had too much association with that, only going down there twice and to see the... It wasn't as bad as the one in Ebensee and then I was pulled out to take the pictures and that was the last time... I was only there twice in camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were there bodies as thin as?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes, their bodies were thin, but some of them were... They ate a little better.</span> <span id="s457">Let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s458">They weren't as thin... These people in Ebensee, they were walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s459">That's all they were.</span> <span id="s460">They were just...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s461">I mean the men, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s462">They would work them half to death.</span> <span id="s463">I mean, and then when this one person got out, then they would put another guy in there, strong, work in the mines and everything and just let him die and then they take him over to the... Some of these people that went to the crematorium, I heard that were still alive.</span> <span id="s464">I mean they were just unconscious, but you know, they were still living, you know what I mean, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s465">These people didn't care at all.</span> <span id="s466">You see these are the people that lived in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s467">They would had to know who could do these such horrible things to people, yet live in Ebensee you know.</span> <span id="s468">And the hospital would.</span> <span id="s469">Yal, I am sure the hospital would.</span> <span id="s470">They were experimental in a lot of things.</span> <span id="s471">So Ebensee was well assured that that camp was there, and what they were really doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Did you find out what the purpose was of that camp for the women?</span> <span id="s473">Being so close?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I really didn't get in to much of the women camp.</span> <span id="s475">All we did, we took it and that was it.</span> <span id="s476">We just took it and we just backed off.</span> <span id="s477">Because we had Ebensee already, you know.</span> <span id="s478">We had that and there was nobody was going to object to taking the women camp now that the Americans were all there.</span> <span id="s479">They were...they were too dumfounded because they knew we would...we just took the camp.</span> <span id="s480">We just took it over you see.</span> <span id="s481">Just walked into the man, the Director of the Salt Mines, and arrested him, and told immediately he said...I'm a..</span> <span id="s482">.</span> <span id="s483">I remember, you know, we don't care who you are.</span> <span id="s484">You are going to jail.</span> <span id="s485">Now you're going to be arrested and then they took the Director of that salt mine and they sent him...Major Cone did.</span> <span id="s486">They just took him and locked him...sent him back to the line...back to the...they were the MPs and that's all they did.</span> <span id="s487">And that was it.</span> <span id="s488">And they knew we meant business.</span> <span id="s489">And we went up to the hospital, and the nurses and everybody else came down.</span> <span id="s490">They were told...we told them to come.</span> <span id="s491">But, however, I know they know knew it.</span> <span id="s492">They had to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: What was the month and the year now when you went to Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: May?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Of 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: 44?</span> <span id="s499">And I got out in 45.</span> <span id="s500">I got out 2 days before December 1945 and the war was winding down.</span> <span id="s501">But our outfit was scheduled to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s502">I mean over there.</span> <span id="s503">It's before the bomb that the President... But it was just...it was...right after that, Germany fell.</span> <span id="s504">Basically Germany fell, and it was all over with, the whole thing basically was.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: What was the reaction of the other men that you were with when they saw the same sights that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Same as...Same as I. It's horrible.</span> <span id="s507">And especially if you were Jewish in the American Army, like Ed Maser.</span> <span id="s508">He was no man to fool with you know what I mean, but he still kept his control and everybody else did.</span> <span id="s509">There was a lot of Jewish...there was a lot of Jewish fellows.</span> <span id="s510">A couple of Jewish officers from Detroit, but everybody kept their composure and even though they were Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So then from there, what did your outfit do?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: We were pulled back, and, uh, we had...we deserved to be pulled back to recoup and then all of a sudden they pulled all the way back to Lahare, which were the camp's Lucky Strike, or old gold they made these camps at, where they bring us back to the States and we wound back up to the States to.</span> <span id="s513">.</span> <span id="s514">in.</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">in Fort Jackson, South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Now the pictures that you took.</span> <span id="s518">You mentioned that they were sent someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: The pictures that I were sent to the Supreme Allied Command.</span> <span id="s520">That is where Major Cone, and then went to the Nuremberg Trial for prosecution and lock him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you receive those pictures afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I had the album.</span> <span id="s523">I had the album.</span> <span id="s524">I made myself an album, and I gave that album to the St. Louis Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s525">That is the album that was in and...and.</span> <span id="s526">.</span> <span id="s527">I think there is...I believe Captain Brennan had an album.</span> <span id="s528">We had them...I made it...a group...for the album.</span> <span id="s529">I made this one album especially for myself.</span> <span id="s530">But as a youngster, I thought I was doing a good turn giving it to where it should be going to...to the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s531">That's what they call it...St. Louis Jewish Council at that time.</span> <span id="s532">Now I don't think they call that anymore the St. Louis Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s533">It might be called...I don't know if that would have been... I didn't know too much about it at that time.</span> <span id="s534">But I do know that the St. Louis Jewish Council was in St. Louis on 8th and L on the 2nd floor, and I took those albums and I have never seen them since.</span> <span id="s535">And I really didn't...really didn't pursue it.</span> <span id="s536">Let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s537">I just...then I start raising a family and...and...you know, working as a salesman and everything went by the wayside.</span> <span id="s538">But I am pursuing it vigorously now, and I will go back to St. Louis again.</span> <span id="s539">I went twice, and I will go again.</span> <span id="s540">I believe though that album is there.</span> <span id="s541">Somebody has it that don't mean to have it.</span> <span id="s542">I don't mean...It might be just stacked away someplace.</span> <span id="s543">Some of the old timers, you know, might have who was on that Committee, but I feel that I will find it.</span> <span id="s544">And I want to donate it.</span> <span id="s545">If I find it, I want...I want it in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Just briefly again to go back to Ebensee, were any of the guards there at all when you?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Two were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Two were there.</span> <span id="s550">The rest of them ran off.</span> <span id="s551">Everything ran...Everybody ran.</span> <span id="s552">The doctors and every.</span> <span id="s553">It was sort of an experimental thing in this here...this laboratory, you might call or whatever.</span> <span id="s554">You know, cause they had these...these, uh, uh, uh....they were concrete like slabs where they put the bodies on it and everything where they take their teeth...they take the gold out of their teeth and everything right near the crematorium and visually I am trying to put that in my mind again how that was.</span> <span id="s555">But the two were caught.</span> <span id="s556">The two were caught!</span> <span id="s557">The one was sent back by the MPs.</span> <span id="s558">The other one was killed on the ground by spreading them.</span> <span id="s559">The only 2 that I know of, that I seen.</span> <span id="s560">Cause...so, they told us all of them left 4 or 5 days ago...you know, 3, 4, 5 days ago cause they knew the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s561">Just a matter of time then, and, uh, they were, uh, seems like intelligence was coming pretty close there too, so they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Did you get to know any of the other prisoners as closely as you did...</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No.</span> <span id="s564">Uh, No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s565">I didn't.</span> <span id="s566">There was so many, and, uh, uh, they always wanted to talk to you, you know.</span> <span id="s567">But it's hard to say that these people were sickly, very sickly people.</span> <span id="s568">And I'll be honest with you.</span> <span id="s569">We never got too close to them.</span> <span id="s570">I mean we don't bodily, bodily wise too close.</span> <span id="s571">That's a horrible thing to say about a human being, but they had to be deloused.</span> <span id="s572">They had...you don't realize how bad it was.</span> <span id="s573">I am sure many of them were...had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s574">Many things...there had to be something wrong with them, see, so we were...we kept...we kept a profile, but at a distance you know.</span> <span id="s575">We tried to be sympathetic, and we were sympathetic see.</span> <span id="s576">But anytime you have to take a group of people to feed them and they must be under guard to feed them, that's how...from when we first started so we could feed them and so they could get a little nourishment in them.</span> <span id="s577">And they were, you know, a hungry person will...well, they had to fight to survive at night time year.</span> <span id="s578">I mean, they would fight or be killed or something.</span> <span id="s579">These are the things that I know.</span> <span id="s580">I know that this happened.</span> <span id="s581">I am positive this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: How did the German prisoners stir up the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: They just...they stirred them up at night time, they said.</span> <span id="s584">They would stir them up and get them aggravated at one another, to fight one another.</span> <span id="s585">The German inmates are ex-convicts.</span> <span id="s586">They were inmates, but they were sent to that camp as ex-convicts to work the people, and to do everything to downgrade them, just do everything, fight, argumental.</span> <span id="s587">You got to remember.</span> <span id="s588">These ex-convicts were eating 3 times a day, and they were big, bushy men, you know what I mean, and they would be in charge of the barracks and then...and then they would, uh, uh.</span> <span id="s589">Their thing, as I say before, was to destroy, destroy, and exterminate.</span> <span id="s590">That's the word I am using now, and that's the most appropriate word that I can think of.</span> <span id="s591">I don't know if it's appropriate or not, but it's to destroy the human being, and that's what this camp was all about.</span> <span id="s592">And they worked in the salt mines.</span> <span id="s593">When they were no good anymore, they would send them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s594">Anybody that who is listening to my voice at this time who was in Ebensee knows what I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: How many men were with your troop that went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Oh, the whole troop.</span> <span id="s597">Well, I mean the...uh...we surrounded...once we came in...when we came in and hit the thing, you know like when you Bibwack, we were bibwacking right close to it, then we came back and told Captain Brennan, and he brought the whole troop...I mean the troop now.</span> <span id="s598">That's what company meant, you see...to help because we needed...you couldn't...you had to have men in there.</span> <span id="s599">You couldn't...you are talking about thousands of people in there, and you know what I mean, going...when they are free...it's going...it's chaos.</span> <span id="s600">And you have to have some kind of control.</span> <span id="s601">And this is how we controlled it.</span> <span id="s602">We had to...we had to control it this way.</span> <span id="s603">And soon they realized what was going on, they...they cooperated, you know what I mean, because they wanted... They knew we were Americans, and they knew we were there to free them.</span> <span id="s604">So we reported back to Captain Brennan, he brought the whole troop in.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: The whole troop consisted of how many men?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Uh, this here...was 250 men and, uh, or maybe more or less, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s607">We weren't full size at that time, but there could be a few more, but that is a company of men.</span> <span id="s608">And whatever it was, the whole troop went in there, and then the whole squadron came down, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s609">They just...they just went around...surrounded the place.</span> <span id="s610">We had other companies in to help, because you needed it.</span> <span id="s611">You needed everybody.</span> <span id="s612">Everybody you could get a hold of.</span> <span id="s613">You needed somebody to do something.</span> <span id="s614">Everybody was working there to try to get...disinfect the place and filling and digging graves, and you can't realize what it was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Now under the direction of your troop, did the inmates themselves begin to help organize things?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Oh, yal.</span> <span id="s617">They helped.</span> <span id="s618">Once they found out...after maybe 48 hours, found out what we were trying to do, they tried to help themselves, you know what I mean, a little bit, trying to get organized and...and getting the dead bodies, and we did make the people in Ebensee come in there and help too.</span> <span id="s619">There were no...they worked, and they...we got that hospital to get in there, and as soon as the hospital got in there...but then...the hospital was there, but then the our field hospital came in, and you know, it kind of quieted down a little bit and everybody backed off, and everybody knew what's going on then.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So the inmates were very obliging and tried to work with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: At that time, yal.</span> <span id="s622">They tried...they knew we were here.</span> <span id="s623">We were...they knew we weren't trying to hurt them or anything, but we were trying to help them.</span> <span id="s624">But the first...that first 24 hours was chaos.</span> <span id="s625">You know, they didn't...they wanted...they were hungry, and they wanted...but you had to make that soup, and then you had to go back to delousing them, and many things, and it took some time, but we worked it out.</span> <span id="s626">The United States worked it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So these are things that you will never...?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: You can never forget it.</span> <span id="s629">See.</span> <span id="s630">It's still in my mind.</span> <span id="s631">I can talk it about it today, tomorrow, and the next day.</span> <span id="s632">And this happened 44 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Yet some people today say it never took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Well, you're looking at a living history right now cause I was there.</span> <span id="s635">I know.</span> <span id="s636">I know.</span> <span id="s637">I don't know about Dachau.</span> <span id="s638">I don't know about Auschwitz, but I know about Ebensee.</span> <span id="s639">I know about Ebensee because I was there.</span> <span id="s640">I have seen it all.</span> <span id="s641">Every bit of it!</span> <span id="s642">Every bit of it!</span> <span id="s643">And maybe some displaced person might know me that I didn't, you know, when I was in my younger days.</span> <span id="s644">But I was...I know Ebensee.</span> <span id="s645">I know what it was all about because I was there.</span> <span id="s646">And I could never forget it!</span> <span id="s647">And just like the inmates in there, they will never forget the brutality they suffered was I, I could have been the same.</span> <span id="s648">If I had lived in Europe at that time, I could have...I am not Jewish, but it could have happened to me.</span> <span id="s649">It could happen to you.</span> <span id="s650">It could happen to anybody.</span> <span id="s651">But Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews.</span> <span id="s652">That was...that was his main...more than anything else, he just...but you can't exterminate.</span> <span id="s653">God won't let you do something like that.</span> <span id="s654">It's not feasible and, uh, I believe God it was the man that said enough is enough, and today, I believe Hitler is in Hell.</span> <span id="s655">I say that I am sure he is.</span> <span id="s656">But I feel good that I made this.</span> <span id="s657">I feel I wanted to do it a long time ago, but I made up my mind in April of this year what I was going to do, and I want every Jewish person to know that it happened.</span> <span id="s658">As God is my judge!</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: We want to thank you very much for taking your time to come.</span> <span id="s660">We know it's a long way from home, and we appreciate it very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: It's my pleasure to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Thank you very kindly.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Is that it?</span> <span id="s664">I hope I got it right.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: You did a wonderful job?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Really?</span> <span id="s667">I hope I did.</span></p> <p><span
