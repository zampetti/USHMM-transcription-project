JAKUBOWICZ AND SALOMON JAKUBOWICZ</span></p> <p><span id="s12">April 16, 1988</span></p> <p><span id="s13">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">FJ: Tarnopol, Galicia.</span> <span id="s15">My husband is from Czechstochowa, and we came here May 15,1950 by boat.</span> <span id="s16">HIAS brought us over and we arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s17">They put us in a hotel not far from HIAS, The Americana and we went to HIAS for the meals which we ate in a nice big dining room.</span> <span id="s18">My husband had all kind of jobs with leather but we couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s19">You see, we had no family here.</span> <span id="s20">Then we lived in Brooklyn, in Brownsville.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: How did you decide to come to the farm here in Parksville, N.Y.?</span> <span id="s22">(When I interviewed them, they were renting a small house in Liberty, N.Y.)</span></p> <p><span id="s23">FJ: We had saved up a few thousand dollars from the black market activities of my husband in Germany.</span> <span id="s24">Eggs was 88$ a dozen and we heard you could make a dollar with a farm.</span> <span id="s25">So we bought here farm.</span> <span id="s26">The house was beautiful but there was only two chicken coops.</span> <span id="s27">And these coops were filled so high with manure.</span> <span id="s28">It was there for years.</span> <span id="s29">We stood and slaved in the heat, cleaning the coops.</span> <span id="s30">It took a few weeks.</span> <span id="s31">A man from the Jewish Agricultural Society helped us by showing us what to do because we didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">WH: Weren't you afraid to do something away from the center in New York, that you had absolutely no experience with before?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">FJ: He was a cattle dealer (her husband) and had lived on a farm in Poland.</span> <span id="s34">But life was very hard.</span> <span id="s35">My children, two daughters, were three years old and a few months old.</span> <span id="s36">I had no money to buy regular milk so we bought Carnation milk.</span> <span id="s37">We bought old bread.</span> <span id="s38">We had a very difficult life and no one helped us.</span> <span id="s39">People from town, they didn't even know us.</span> <span id="s40">We bought a 1937 Studebaker and my husband tried to learn how to drive.</span> <span id="s41">We borrowed some money and bought about 2,000 chickens.</span> <span id="s42">They were not very good chickens but we had no choice since we didn't have hardly any money.</span> <span id="s43">Then we sold eggs.</span> <span id="s44">We had to clean every egg with a brush.</span> <span id="s45">We couldn't get along with the partners.</span> <span id="s46">We was living all in one house.</span> <span id="s47">They were also survivors.</span> <span id="s48">But they had family.</span> <span id="s49">They weren't so struggling like me.</span> <span id="s50">They couldn't take this farm life.</span> <span id="s51">So they wanted out.</span> <span id="s52">We didn't have any money so we got another partner, an American Jew, who bought them out.</span> <span id="s53">But this American wanted we should be the slaves and he would be the boss.</span> <span id="s54">Anyway, we had fights with them.</span> <span id="s55">So we had enough with partners.</span> <span id="s56">Anyway, the top floor of the coop caved in on the floor below.</span> <span id="s57">We had 3,000 chickens and was working all by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: What time did you get up every morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">FJ: Don't ask.</span> <span id="s60">We didn't have days and we didn't have nights.</span> <span id="s61">It cost $700.00 to fix the coop .</span> <span id="s62">And then the water dried up.</span> <span id="s63">It was a dry season.</span> <span id="s64">My husband had to go with cans and get water from a spring on the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">FJ: Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s67">I was 100 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: When were you born?</span> <span id="s69">I just wanted to get an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">FJ: 1923.</span> <span id="s71">My husband is born in 1913.</span> <span id="s72">Then we tried to drill wells.</span> <span id="s73">Then, you know, you can't stay in one place.</span> <span id="s74">Our children growing up, helping on the farm.</span> <span id="s75">They used to answer the phone.</span> <span id="s76">They were the bookkeepers.</span> <span id="s77">From the time they were five years old, they helped.</span> <span id="s78">They knew better English than I did.</span> <span id="s79">They took the orders and the messages but they didn't even know how to write it down.</span> <span id="s80">Then, eventually, we hired a man or two to help.</span> <span id="s81">You have to keep on growing.</span> <span id="s82">Then we borrowed money.</span> <span id="s83">We established credit.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: How did you go against the competition, the other farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">FJ: I'll tell you, we had luck.</span> <span id="s86">Whoever bought our chickens, our eggs, they wouldn't eat any other eggs.</span> <span id="s87">They were the best eggs in Sullivan County.</span> <span id="s88">People raved about the eggs.</span> <span id="s89">Then later on, we couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s90">The eggs was very cheap, the feed was higher.</span> <span id="s91">So my husband bought a truck and he used to take the eggs to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">FJ: In the 1960s.</span> <span id="s94">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s95">All the time I had to tear my hair out.</span> <span id="s96">So from this I don't have any hair (She gives a short, bitter laugh.)</span> <span id="s97">We drilled four more wells and still wasn't enough water for the chickens.</span> <span id="s98">We was working day and night.</span> <span id="s99">Then we had to buy automatic machinery because we had more eggs.</span> <span id="s100">And the machinery used to break down.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">SJ: On Sunday I would go to the city and I slept in the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">FJ: One time he was driving himself in New York and all of a sudden he blacked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Did you ever think then, of getting out?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">FJ: You cannot.</span> <span id="s105">You swimming in the sea and you cannot stop in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">There's no such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">WH: You worked from morning till night.</span> <span id="s108">Did you have a television?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">FJ: In the beginning wasn't.</span> <span id="s110">They didn't have television.</span> <span id="s111">In 1960 we got a little TV.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: Did you have to work seven days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SJ: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">FJ: And you had to work at night too.</span> <span id="s115">We didn't have time for friends either.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Some people came from N.Y. to the farm.</span> <span id="s117">They just took away my time.</span> <span id="s118">I couldn't handle that.</span> <span id="s119">The children, they suffered with us.</span> <span id="s120">They didn't grow up in the town and they did suffer.</span> <span id="s121">We tried the best.</span> <span id="s122">They went to the Livingston Manor school.</span> <span id="s123">So we wanted they should go to a school with more Jewish children.</span> <span id="s124">So for a few years we rented an apartment here in Liberty.</span> <span id="s125">They went to Hebrew day school.</span> <span id="s126">It wasn't easy for us but I said we have to do something.</span> <span id="s127">Then I had here a brother.</span> <span id="s128">He wasn't too good to me so I didn't want to talk about him, he should rest in peace.</span> <span id="s129">He came a year before and had a farm.</span> <span id="s130">And that's the reason we bought a farm.</span> <span id="s131">So I didn't have a good word for him, that he did this.</span> <span id="s132">Anyway, he used to build a lot of coops.</span> <span id="s133">He was a big talker.</span> <span id="s134">And he made himself out he was a millionaire.</span> <span id="s135">He offered to lend people money.</span> <span id="s136">He didn't have a penny!</span> <span id="s137">But people listened to him because he talked good.</span> <span id="s138">They thought he was rich!</span> <span id="s139">That's the way American people are!</span> <span id="s140">You don't know the experience of being a refugee in America then.</span> <span id="s141">Today, at least, the Russian people come, they give them everything.</span> <span id="s142">We came from the camps, from nothing, we didn't get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WH: What about HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">FJ: HIAS could help so much.</span> <span id="s145">How much they could, only when we were in New York.</span> <span id="s146">Once we needed money and we asked the JAS to give us a loan.</span> <span id="s147">They asked us how much money you have in the bank?</span> <span id="s148">My husband said: 'When I have money in the bank I don't have to come to you.'</span> <span id="s149">They didn't give us a loan.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: What was the attitude of the American Jews towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">FJ: Very mean.</span> <span id="s152">Very mean.</span> <span id="s153">I mean they didn't want to know us.</span> <span id="s154">When I couldn't speak English and they didn't know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s155">Later when I spoke English, they FJ: spoke Yiddish!</span> <span id="s156">They didn't want to speak Yiddish at first because they were afraid, maybe I will ask for something.</span> <span id="s157">No one wanted to touch a finger to help a refugee.</span> <span id="s158">It was like they felt we took away something from them.</span> <span id="s159">We had one fellow, that he signed for us.</span> <span id="s160">Otherwise, nobody.</span> <span id="s161">Freddy Gasthalter's father from the Paramount Hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">WH: What about other refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">FJ: What could one refugee help another?</span> <span id="s164">They all from the same place.</span> <span id="s165">Just like I couldn't help them, they couldn't help me.</span> <span id="s166">(This is directly opposite the story of and attitude of the Atlanta survivors.)</span> <span id="s167">Some people had family here, they took them in.</span> <span id="s168">But if you don't have anyone, no one could help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WH: I read that in the Vineland, N.J. farming community, they had a helping fund.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">SJ: But they were more established there.</span> <span id="s171">But we were proud.</span> <span id="s172">God will help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">WH: Do you believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">SJ: Sure.</span> <span id="s175">(He walks to a nearby synagogue every day for services.)</span></p> <p><span id="s176">FJ: You have to have a belief.</span> <span id="s177">If God is there or not, we don't know.</span> <span id="s178">But whatever, I'm alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">FJ: So we built a more modern coop.</span> <span id="s180">And it was less work, the place wasn't smelling.</span> <span id="s181">Then everyone was building cages.</span> <span id="s182">And from this we made a beautiful place and people used to come from all over to look at our place.</span> <span id="s183">By then we had a 100,000 chickens.</span> <span id="s184">But then the manure stinked up the place and we didn't have enough land to deal with it.</span> <span id="s185">And it was a big, big problem.</span> <span id="s186">And those cages, they chased us out from the farm.</span> <span id="s187">On the floor they could, the farmers, take the manure away, but in the cages it was loose, but we didn't think of it much.</span> <span id="s188">We didn't want to be left behind.</span> <span id="s189">We wanted to go with the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: What about the other people who had cages?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">FJ: Listen, I can't tell what's doing in their backyard.</span> <span id="s192">Some people had where to spread their manure.</span> <span id="s193">So we had big expenses with electricity, not enough water, and the problem with the cages.</span> <span id="s194">By the end we had almost 300,000 chickens.</span> <span id="s195">Then my husband, he got sick.</span> <span id="s196">I had been sick too a few times over the years.</span> <span id="s197">When I got sick, my husband couldn't even come to the hospital to see me.</span> <span id="s198">He didn't have time.</span> <span id="s199">My 16 year old daughter had to come pick me up from the hospital.</span> <span id="s200">Then, in 1969,my husband broke down.</span> <span id="s201">And everything broke down, the elevators broke down.</span> <span id="s202">My husband was half dead.</span> <span id="s203">We sold everything out.</span> <span id="s204">The cages, they did the trick.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">WH: But it was an accomplishment to build it up from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">FJ: Yes, we built it with our hands, 300,000 chickens.</span> <span id="s207">But, we had to give it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">WH: But you got a price for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">FJ: We got....we went bankrupt.</span> <span id="s210">That was the price.</span> <span id="s211">That was the price.</span> <span id="s212">Say goodbye and that's it.</span> <span id="s213">It was a 48 acre farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">WH: I get the feeling it was a matter of fate.</span> <span id="s215">How could you know what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">FJ: In the beginning we couldn’t give them no work.</span> <span id="s217">Later on we couldn't get no decent workers.</span> <span id="s218">They was drunks, bums; who else would work on the farm?</span> <span id="s219">We left the farm in 1970.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">WH: What did you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">FJ: We rented a room here in Liberty.</span> <span id="s222">My husband got restitution money from Germany.</span> <span id="s223">He got $7,000.00.</span> <span id="s224">I had before $10,000.00 but it went to the farm.</span> <span id="s225">After a few years my husband got a job working as a mashgiachat Falls Chickens in Livingston Manor.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">WH: Tell me about your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">FJ: The children went to college in New York and to high school in Livingston Manor and in Liberty.</span> <span id="s228">They went to Hebrew day school.</span> <span id="s229">I came from a religious home, but not hasidic.</span> <span id="s230">I don't believe in the payes.</span> <span id="s231">Because not everyone is good what is wearing the payes.</span> <span id="s232">We believed in Yiddishkeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">SJ: Now I go every day to shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">FJ: It is good for his morale.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">WH: What about school for the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">FJ: The younger one went to college.</span> <span id="s237">The older one couldn't concentrate so good in school, so she didn't go.</span> <span id="s238">She started but couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s239">Not everyone is college material.</span> <span id="s240">My younger one was cum laude at Queens College.</span> <span id="s241">The two girls took an apartment in Flushing.</span> <span id="s242">The older one was a Girl Friday.</span> <span id="s243">Now she's an assistant bookkeeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">WH: Is she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">FJ: She's married.</span> <span id="s246">But she wants to divorce her husband.</span> <span id="s247">He's good for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">He works by a race track, OTB.</span> <span id="s249">And my younger one is not married yet (She is probably about 38) But, thank God, she wouldn't date or marry someone not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">WH: Do you have any long range effects from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">FJ: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">When I see someone in uniform it scares me.</span> <span id="s253">My heart beats like a......</span></p> <p><span id="s254">I can't help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">FJ: But you know, I’ll tell you, you must tell the world about what happened.</span> <span id="s256">If not, how will they know?</span> <span id="s257">I saw when we came here, some people thought how come you alive and the others dead?</span> <span id="s258">Must be you killed them.</span> <span id="s259">Not Hitler, but you.</span> <span id="s260">How come you are alive?</span> <span id="s261">And really, no one wanted to know.</span> <span id="s262">When you tell them, they say: 'Oh, we know already.</span> <span id="s263">We read the paper.’</span> <span id="s264">You see, people are selfish.</span> <span id="s265">When they living in a good home, they think: What you have to think about the refugees?</span> <span id="s266">You don't wanna hear this.</span> <span id="s267">And the Americans didn't help us then.</span> <span id="s268">The Puerto Ricans, the Haitians had a home, but not the Jews.</span> <span id="s269">They sent five ships back.</span> <span id="s270">And the American Jews complained: 'Oh we couldn't have steak; we had to have chicken.’</span></p> <p><span id="s271">WH: How did you find the strength to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">FJ: God gave me the strength to live thru the war when I lost everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">And when I came in this country God helped me.</span> <span id="s274">I had twenty years slavery here, but, thank God, I came out alive.</span> <span id="s275">And I'll tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s276">I was always dressed decent.</span> <span id="s277">No one could say I'm a farmer.</span> <span id="s278">My home was beautiful.</span> <span id="s279">I made them welcome, whatever I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">WH: People have all sorts of problems.</span> <span id="s281">What advice would you give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">FJ: God helps you.</span> <span id="s283">You should have faith.</span> <span id="s284">Because if you think——that's my life and it's never gonna be better, then you commit yourself suicide.</span> <span id="s285">You keep yourself nice, in shape.</span> <span id="s286">I always took a shower, I dressed myself and I'm a lady again.</span> <span id="s287">Otherwise, I wouldn't survive.</span> <span id="s288">First of all, you must have self-respect.</span> <span id="s289">That's my philosophy.</span> <span id="s290">Even you come now to my house you will never find me in a nightgown.</span> <span id="s291">I get up, I wash up, I wash my hair.</span> <span id="s292">My children are brought up the same way.</span> <span id="s293">They get up, have to make their beds So wherever I go out everybody respects me because I'm not a shnorrer.</span> <span id="s294">You not a prostitute.</span> <span id="s295">That's what it is.</span> <span id="s296">That's how I survived the camps too.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">WH: What do you think of blacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">FJ: They are a wild nation and you cannot expect that much from them.</span> <span id="s299">They not educated; they suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">WH: Okay.</span> <span id="s301">I thank you very much for your time and patience.</span></p> <p><span
