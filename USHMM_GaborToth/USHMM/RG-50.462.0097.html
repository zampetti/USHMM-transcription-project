we lived in a non-Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s27">I was the only Jewish child in the class.</span> <span id="s28">I always had to fight against antisemitism all the time.</span> <span id="s29">But I had non-Jewish friends which sometime protected me or helped me fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">ER: So, you did experience antisemitism before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">IR: Yes, certainly, Austria is a Catholic country and antisemitism is sucked in with the mother-milk.</span> <span id="s32">The only Jews were living in Vienna or in other big cities.</span> <span id="s33">In the country or in small towns, they didn't even know what a Jew was.</span> <span id="s34">So antisemitism was very high even before Hitler took over.</span> <span id="s35">He had an easy field when he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">ER: He sure did.</span> <span id="s37">Could you please tell me some of the antisemitic experiences that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">IR: One is still vivid in my memory because I still am reminded that times didn't change that much.</span> <span id="s39">In Europe religion is taught during school hours, and when the Father or the preacher came I left the room 2 hours in the week, and when I returned they were all really completely hostile because of the teaching of their religion that I'm a Christ-killer and things like that.</span> <span id="s40">But the one experience which sticks out still in my memory because I still repeat it sometimes.</span> <span id="s41">During, I don't know what subject it was, but my girlfriend was sitting behind me and she made some kind of noise, I wasn't able to listen exactly to what the teacher was talking, so I turned around and said, "Shh, be quiet."</span> <span id="s42">So she, in turn, my friend, said, "From you a dirty Jew I don't have to take any orders."</span> <span id="s43">So I turned around and slapped her in the face and naturally she started to cry and the teacher asked what happened.</span> <span id="s44">She told and I told my side of the story and we had to both go the principal.</span> <span id="s45">So we went to the principal and while we were waiting for him my teacher took her aside and I heard when she said, "It wasn't right what you did, but in a way, I can understand.</span> <span id="s46">We cannot let the Jews go over our heads."</span> <span id="s47">And this why I remember because so many times it still happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">ER: Yes.</span> <span id="s49">Did you or your family belong to any Jewish organizations or to a synagogue before Nazism changed your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">IR: Well, in Europe you automatically belonged to a synagogue; either you belonged to a church or a synagogue, that is the law.</span> <span id="s51">So we did belong and you pay dues, that is the law.</span> <span id="s52">And I, when I became a young teenager, I belonged to a Zionist organization, "Revisionist Youth" at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">ER: So your family was not totally assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">IR: No, we were not assimilated at all.</span> <span id="s55">Absolutely not; there was no non-Jewish girl or boy our family married to.</span> <span id="s56">It was still intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">ER: Did any of the men in your family serve in any national army?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">IR: Yes, in World War I. My father and his brothers and my mother's brothers, and as a matter of fact my father was a victim of World War I.</span> <span id="s59">He became seriously ill during the war and he died shortly after.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">ER: Do you remember how you and members of your family reacted to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany in January 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">IR: Well, at that time we lived in a different country; so we lived in Austria not Germany.</span> <span id="s62">But we had relations in Germany so we knew what was going on more in detail than which was in the news.</span> <span id="s63">But in the beginning of 1933 and I guess two or three years after this, Hitler wasn't that aggressive like he was after when he annexed Austria, because Jews were still able to earn a living and they were still able to live where they had lived before, which afterwards changed completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">ER: So, in other words, when he was elected Chancellor, you didn't feel that there was a threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">IR: It was a threat, but your life wasn't threatened.</span> <span id="s66">My husband was born in Germany and he was able to have his business and they didn't take it away at that time.</span> <span id="s67">You were restricted to certain things.</span> <span id="s68">I mean, you couldn't become certain professions.</span> <span id="s69">You weren't able to go to the universities and things like that, but your life wasn't threatened and your livelihood and your home wasn't taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">ER: How would you describe your life from 1933 when Hitler became Chancellor to the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">IR: Well, until Austria was annexed and was taken over I had a normal life.</span> <span id="s72">We did not feel anything what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s73">As a matter of fact, we went on vacation to Switzerland, and one of my relatives is buried on the border of Switzerland to Germany on the German side, and we went there to go to her grave and that was my first introduction to the swastika because right on the border there it was.</span> <span id="s74">So my life was changed when Austria became Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">ER: Not till 1938 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">IR: '38, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">ER: So, you didn't experience any rise in antisemitism then?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">IR: No, that was there anyway.</span> <span id="s79">That wasn’t the point, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">ER: Did any non-Jews try to help you in your experiences with antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">IR: Yes.</span> <span id="s82">We had neighbors who when war broke out in 1939, food was rationed, you had a card.</span> <span id="s83">Now, Jews didn't get a card.</span> <span id="s84">You only got certain necessities bread, meat, to a small amount and only when everybody else got theirs, Jews were able to get it.</span> <span id="s85">Now, we had neighbors who shared their food with us; anything they didn't use we were able to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">ER: You had to buy it from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">IR: Well, of course, but you were able to buy it, before you weren't able to buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">ER: In what other ways did your life change after the Anschluss aside from the fact that the food was rationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">IR: Well, everything changed.</span> <span id="s90">First of all, every law in the country didn't apply to you anymore.</span> <span id="s91">You had no law protected you.</span> <span id="s92">Anybody that helped you was shot.</span> <span id="s93">You weren't able to have a job, you weren't able to have a business, you weren't able to have a bank account, you weren't able to have your home.</span> <span id="s94">Everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s95">The money was confiscated, your home was taken and you had to share it with somebody else.</span> <span id="s96">As time went on, there was 10 or 15 families in one apartment and then they all were transported.</span> <span id="s97">There was already separation for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ER: In any other way?</span> <span id="s99">I didn't mean to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">IR: In the school, you weren't able to finish your education.</span> <span id="s101">You had curfew after 8:00 or so, I don't remember the time anymore, you were not allowed to be on the street.</span> <span id="s102">You were not allowed to sit on the bench.</span> <span id="s103">You were not allowed to go to a movie, or any entertainment, to a park, to anything which is public congregation, like a library or anything.</span> <span id="s104">Jews were exempt from all of that, and I think everybody was wearing a swastika except Jews, it was very easy to detect who was and who wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">ER: Was the Jewish council in your city or town able to guide you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">IR: No, I had one experience shortly after the Germans took over Austria.</span> <span id="s107">I was walking on the street in center city with my cousin and two SS approached us and they said "You're Jews."</span> <span id="s108">I was, I don’t know, 14 years or something, yes, so they took us along to a barracks.</span> <span id="s109">They were military used to be, but now the SS took over.</span> <span id="s110">And they forced us to clean the toilets and things like that just for the fun of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">ER: How were you and your family able to support yourselves after the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">IR: Well, my mother had the foresight not to put all of the things we had, all the money we had into the bank so we had some money at home, and you were allowed to take out a small amount for what you needed.</span> <span id="s113">Many people couldn't; many people were, really destitute.</span> <span id="s114">These were the lucky ones because they were the ones who immediately sought to get out of the country, to get papers and affidavits and things to get someplace else because they were really destitute.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">ER: At that time you were still permitted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">IR: You were permitted to leave when you had someplace to go, but you couldn't take anything along.</span> <span id="s117">You were able to leave anytime.</span> <span id="s118">I was leaving in 1941 with the permission of the Germans, but I had no place to go and you were not able to take anything along.</span> <span id="s119">Absolutely nothing, just what you were wearing, but you had no place to go.</span> <span id="s120">This is why I mentioned before, if each family in the United States would have helped a child or somebody, nobody would have been, because he let them go out.</span> <span id="s121">Hitler only started the extermination camps when he saw that nobody was interested.</span> <span id="s122">He said many times, "Take your Jews; I don't need them, you can have them."</span> <span id="s123">But nobody took us; “took us” under quotation.</span> <span id="s124">So, then he had the final solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">ER: What do you remember of Crystal Nacht [Kristallnacht] in November, 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">IR: Yes, I can remember it very clearly because we went to my sister's apartment, because her husband had a position in a company and they had the baby just 2 or 3 days before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s127">And they were busy with the baby and we were living with them to help them because it was already difficult to get help.</span> <span id="s128">She had a girl helping her, a maid.</span> <span id="s129">So when he went the next day to his office, he was stopped from the SS and he was lucky they didn't arrest him right then and there.</span> <span id="s130">But the company, was taken over the same night so he was without his position, and so he was one of the first ones to apply to get out of the country, and I don't think he was still there on November the 10th.</span> <span id="s131">He had left already.</span> <span id="s132">This was why we, my mother and I, were living with my sister temporarily to help her with the baby because she had to let the maid go, so she had nobody anyway.</span> <span id="s133">What was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">ER: What do you remember…</span></p> <p><span id="s135">IR: Yah, November the 10th Well, we knew what was going on because we heard it constantly on the radio that Jews are our unfortune, Jews have to be killed, Jews is the fault of every misery in the world and so on and so on, and so we were afraid of big riot that would seek out--they went to the families, to the homes, and just pulled them out and took everything away with them.</span> <span id="s136">So we took the jewelry we had and we put it in a place in a bundle and hid it in the attic, and that's about it.</span> <span id="s137">But the people--since my brother-in-law was not living there anymore, he left already, and there was no other man in the house, they didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s138">But below us was living a family, the owner of the house, it was a house only for apartments, and whose name was a Jewish name but he wasn't Jewish, and they came at 4:00 o'clock in the morning they pulled him out and they put him in jail and he swore high and low that he's not Jewish, he's not Jewish, and they didn't believe him.</span> <span id="s139">They put him in jail anyway.</span> <span id="s140">So they were busy with that and didn't bother us in other ways; bodily harm anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">ER: Did they burn any of the synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">IR: They burnt the synagogue, of course, and later we found out that they went to our apartment where we lived, from the neighbors told us, and they were looking for us, and since we weren't there, they left.</span> <span id="s143">But you were completely like a bird, free to do anything which anybody wanted to do with you.</span> <span id="s144">You could hear in the night people yelling for help and nobody helped, no police, or anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">ER: You left Austria, when did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">IR: I left Austria in 1941, on January the 2nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">ER: Okay.</span> <span id="s148">Under what circumstances were you able to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">IR: At that time every border was closed because war was already, the 1939 war was started and there was no way you go anywhere, the borders were closed.</span> <span id="s150">You couldn’t go anywhere, you were sitting ducks.</span> <span id="s151">So, my brother-in-law had an uncle and an aunt who were editors from a paper and they were elderly people, but their life was in danger because they had a paper.</span> <span id="s152">It was a commercial paper, but still and all--and they had a son who was married to a girl from Yugoslavia and her parents, still lived in Yugoslavia, and they left-- the children of these people were in Australia already--so the in-laws from her son--is that clear?</span> <span id="s153">--who lived in Yugoslavia, naturally, they were in contact, and they sent them a smuggler who was smuggling merchandise but then he changed to human beings to smuggle over the border for a fee.</span> <span id="s154">And we didn't know about that at all but we were in touch with this part of the family.</span> <span id="s155">And one day, we get a call and she said I have a terrible cold and I cannot go and she explained where she wanted to go and she already had that guy coming to pick her up, and we would go instead of them, two people, and naturally my mother said, "Of course, immediately, today, tomorrow, any time."</span></p> <p><span id="s156">ER: So, who went, your mother and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">IR: Yes, we went instead of them.</span> <span id="s158">And we are alive and they are dead, because that was the last time anybody was able to get in.</span> <span id="s159">He was caught, the next transport he organized he was caught, from the Yugoslav government; the Germans let you out, but they didn't let you in.</span> <span id="s160">And he was in jail and everybody who was with him was deported and that was it.</span> <span id="s161">So, that was like fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">ER: Were you in touch with anyone outside of Austria between 1938 and 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">IR: Yes, we had relations in Switzerland that were unable to help us, and we had relations in the United States which at that time we did not have contact; we just knew we had.</span> <span id="s164">Abraham and Strauss [a former department store in New York] is my relation.</span> <span id="s165">And after the war when we found out, we didn't know who they were but they did send us these papers to come to the United States, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">ER: Did you have any knowledge of what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe at that time, between '38 and '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">IR: When I was in the concentration camps the news really wasn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">ER: No, I'm talking about before you left Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">IR: Before I left Austria, of course, we saw.</span> <span id="s170">We knew there was Buchenwald and Dachau; there wasn't Auschwitz but the other camps were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">ER: So you were aware that this was happening not only in Germany and Austria but it was happening elsewhere in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">IR: At that time it didn't happen anywhere else.</span> <span id="s173">I was only in Germany and Austria; the other things happened when Hitler went into Czechoslovakia and Poland and then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s174">Actually, before the war, it was only Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">ER: Right, but up until 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">IR: In '41, there was already war, in '39 started the war, and at that time wherever the Germans were Jews were persecuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">ER: Okay, did the German invasion of Poland in September, 1939 cause changes in your situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">IR: No, it had nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s179">We had already lost everything.</span> <span id="s180">Our business was taken over.</span> <span id="s181">My uncle was put in jail and he came out because the janitor of the building he was living in became an SS man, and there’s a difference.</span> <span id="s182">There were people which were antisemites just for the love of it, right, and there were people which were Nazis and they were antisemites, but they had Jewish friends and knew it wasn't right, but it was an opportunity to go ahead, and this was their way of being part of the movement.</span> <span id="s183">And he was one of that; he was a janitor, but he saw an opportunity to become something more than that and so he became an SS Man.</span> <span id="s184">And when he found out that my uncle was in jail, he immediately put everything in motion to get him out.</span> <span id="s185">He took over their apartment that everything was in, they left everything for him.</span> <span id="s186">And he was in for just a few weeks; he wasn't sent to a concentration camp and they let him go because he was taking care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">ER: Okay, in 1941 you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">IR: In 1941, because there was no place else, I mean you absolutely could not live.</span> <span id="s189">There were already transportations, deportations to unknown--we didn't know where they went but we knew that people disappeared.</span> <span id="s190">There were transportations, deportations, which you know Jews were congregated in certain places and where they disappeared.</span> <span id="s191">So we knew sooner or later we have the same fate.</span> <span id="s192">We had to take in our apartment two other families, and this was already the beginning of the displaces; together we would have gone someplace.</span> <span id="s193">And I was called--there were so many episodes which I can't go into because it takes too much time, but--what was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">ER: The question was when you went to Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">IR: We went because we couldn't go anywhere and that was just a lucky thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">ER: Where was your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">IR: My sister joined her husband, he went to South America, my brother-in-law, in September.</span> <span id="s198">Hitler moved in in March, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">ER: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">IR: He left the country in September already and so she joined him just before the war broke out in '39.</span> <span id="s201">He was able to get the papers for the baby and her, and so it was just my mother and I. My uncle left with his family to South America, so we were the only two left.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">ER: Can you describe your life in Yugoslavia once you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">IR: Well, first I want to tell you how we got over.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">ER: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">IR: Anyway, that guy came and we paid him and we made the date, the arrangements, and he told us where to meet and everything.</span> <span id="s206">The Germans had knowledge about this, as I mentioned before, and they even had the place set up on the border, on the Austrian border, bordering Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s207">It was a place where you had to sign in.</span> <span id="s208">The city was a town called Graz, G-R-A-Z, and there was no Jews living there anymore, there wasn't many before, but now it was completely Judenrein, you know the expression.</span> <span id="s209">So there they took over; I don't know what kind of a building it was.</span> <span id="s210">And everybody who went illegal, that was illegal entry into another country, had to come to that place first and they checked if you didn't take anything along, and you could stay there for one day or so until the guy was able to take you over the border.</span> <span id="s211">There were no facilities, you were sleeping on the floor, everybody next to each other.</span> <span id="s212">So it was with the German's knowledge and permission that we went out.</span> <span id="s213">But on the train going from Vienna to that city on the border, I had an experience which I want to record because it is very interesting.</span> <span id="s214">I was young and I was pretty and I cried because I had to leave my girlfriends and everything behind.</span> <span id="s215">You went to unknown, you didn't know the language, what you are going to do there, you had no place to stay, you had no money to take, you were not allowed to take any money, nothing.</span> <span id="s216">You went into unknown- territory with nothing, and so I was crying.</span> <span id="s217">And there was a man, an officer, a German officer, high officer, standing next to me at the window where I was crying, and he says, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s218">So I told him, "I am Jewish and I have to leave the country."</span> <span id="s219">And he said, "I hate to disappoint you, but you are not going to be safe in Yugoslavia either because I am sent there already as a high officer to organize the Fifth Column because we are going to occupy very shortly, but I will do anything I can to help you."</span> <span id="s220">He was a German, from the aristocracy, and he gave me his card and it was an aristocratic name.</span> <span id="s221">He was a very handsome tall guy and he said, "I help you as much as I can because I am a German nationalist, but I don't approve what they are doing to the Jews."</span> <span id="s222">Anyway, he sort of flirted with me, and then when we arrived in that border town we were supposed to be picked up from one of the people who brought us over the border, because we were not allowed to walk the streets as a Jew.</span> <span id="s223">And so when we arrived nobody was there; they didn't show up.</span> <span id="s224">So that officer said, "Don't worry I will take care of you."</span> <span id="s225">Imagine!</span> <span id="s226">Miracles after miracles!</span></p> <p><span id="s227">ER: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">IR: I tore up the card because--I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s229">Anyway he said, "Let's go have breakfast," and he took us to a restaurant and it was early in the morning and everybody looked because we didn't have the swastika, but he was in the uniform so nobody questioned.</span> <span id="s230">So then he took a taxi and he brought us to the address where we were supposed to congregate and he delivered us and he gave me his card, and said he was going to pick me up in the evening because after all, I had been through such a traumatic experience he wants that I should have a good time.</span> <span id="s231">Anyway, I saw on his card that he was an aristocrat.</span> <span id="s232">So, sure enough, he came to that place and--is that too long?</span> <span id="s233">I want to make sure--because I'm alive--how fate plays a role in your survival.</span> <span id="s234">These are things which you cannot in advance prepare.</span> <span id="s235">This just happens.</span> <span id="s236">And it's like a net: you are caught in a net and you found a hole to get out of it.</span> <span id="s237">And this is how it happened.</span> <span id="s238">So he came in the evening to pick me up.</span> <span id="s239">Anyway, I said, "I cannot go with you.</span> <span id="s240">I am not wanted anywhere and you will get into trouble if they find out you go out with a Jewish girl; you can't."</span> <span id="s241">In fact, I was afraid to go anyway.</span> <span id="s242">I didn't have any interest to show this connection.</span> <span id="s243">So he took off his uniform, he was in civilian, he had his emblem, and he said, "You're perfectly safe."</span> <span id="s244">I said, "I am not worried about my safety, I just don't want to go."</span> <span id="s245">I am not going anywhere where I am not wanted.</span> <span id="s246">So he left, then he sent flowers and called the next day, and it went on.</span> <span id="s247">The next day we left already, the next night, so I called him.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Tape one, Side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s249">IR: Okay, so I told him on the phone how grateful I am and everything else, that it was wonderful that he helped me, but that we have two different lives to live, and I had to promise that when I am safe I should let him know.</span> <span id="s250">Now I was afraid even to keep his calling card because if anybody found it, he would get in trouble and I didn't want he should have any problems.</span> <span id="s251">He was a good guy, he helped us.</span> <span id="s252">So I tore up the card and that's why I don't know the name anymore, and I never got in touch with him naturally after the war.</span> <span id="s253">So we went over the border, we walked over the border for eight hours on January the 2nd, 1941.</span> <span id="s254">The snow was maybe three-foot high, over the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">ER: Did you have proper clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">IR: It was cold when we left so we had the clothing, and the guide took us walking and shortly before we crossed the border he had a place like a roadhouse where we had to stay until nightfall because in the daytime you cannot cross the border.</span> <span id="s257">And he chose the 2nd of January because it was New Year's Eve before and he figured the guard is drunk so they won't--this was really the way he figured out--and so we had no trouble crossing the border.</span> <span id="s258">We had to be quiet and we were cooped up in the rooming house without any toilet, without any food and I had to go so urgent.</span> <span id="s259">Anyway, I survived.</span> <span id="s260">So, we crossed the border and we walked and then after the border there was a taxi waiting for us to take us from the border by car to the capital which was Zagreb.</span> <span id="s261">So that all went smooth according to the arrangements.</span> <span id="s262">So all right, we came into Zagreb, but where are we going to go from there?</span> <span id="s263">We had no place to stay.</span> <span id="s264">I mentioned before that I was young and pretty, and that guide took a liking to me.</span> <span id="s265">He was sort of falling in love with me, but he was married, 50 years already, an old man compared to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">ER: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">IR: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s268">So he took us to his apartment.</span> <span id="s269">He called his wife and he said he is bringing somebody along and she should make room.</span> <span id="s270">[unclear].</span> <span id="s271">He lived very well.</span> <span id="s272">So we were staying there a couple of days, because you have to consider that we entered the country illegal.</span> <span id="s273">We had no papers; in Europe if you check into a hotel or someplace you have to have papers, to sign, and you have to give your passport, and you have to fill out the form; this is the law even today.</span> <span id="s274">So, we couldn't register anywhere; we were illegal in this country, sort of in hiding.</span> <span id="s275">So anyway, we were staying there a couple of days until we could make a contact with the family who originally sent the guide to their family and since we didn't have any money, all we had was 10 marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">ER: Were you able to smuggle any jewelry out?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">IR: Nothing, you couldn't smuggle anything, because before they let you go, the Germans examined your body everywhere, I mean there was no--anyplace where you could hide anything.</span> <span id="s278">They looked into everything.</span> <span id="s279">[So, this is going to take a long...] So, how we are going to live?</span> <span id="s280">So that guide, as I said, he fell in love with me, gave us back half of the money we paid him to get us over the border, so we were able to find accommodations through these other Jews.</span> <span id="s281">They told us that somebody in the suburbs, who has a house, some kind of relations or whatever, and they have a house, and their janitor has a house for himself and they rent rooms and they don't pay too much attention to the law.</span> <span id="s282">They need the money.</span> <span id="s283">So we went there and we were able to rent a room and these people who owned the place were Jews, as I mentioned before, but these people were converted.</span> <span id="s284">As a matter of fact their son became a preacher, but that didn't help him, they killed him anyway, even as a Catholic preacher, he was killed.</span> <span id="s285">Okay, so through that family we were introduced to other Jews who lived there, some of them, and so one thing led to another.</span> <span id="s286">The Germans made a law--but that was before the Germans moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">ER: Right.</span> <span id="s288">Were you able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">IR: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s290">We were illegally there; nobody knew you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">ER: April 6, 1941, is when the Germans invaded Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">IR: Right, but this was in January, and so we just vegetated, you know.</span> <span id="s293">Whatever we were able to do--but my mother got sick and it was a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s294">Anyway these people who owned this house introduced us to other Jews and one of them was a young man who came from Czechoslovakia and he lived there for quite a long time, a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s295">I am mentioning because he was part of my destiny which followed.</span> <span id="s296">I just want to mention, going back to the guide which took us over the border, there was absolutely nothing going on; he just helped us, and the few days we were staying there and then I think only two days.</span> <span id="s297">And then we moved to that room and then I didn't see him anymore because he went on another trip to pick up people and he was caught and put in jail and that was the last I saw of him.</span> <span id="s298">I called his wife later and that is what she told me that he was caught and never came.</span> <span id="s299">I want to make sure that you know that I never had any relationship--anyway, my mother was always with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">ER: When you came over the border with him, was it only you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">IR: No, another family, but all the other people which went--there were two other families, another a mother with a daughter and a single man, I think, was there.</span> <span id="s302">But these people went to the Jewish agency and registered and the Jewish Agency took over and put them in a detention camp for Jewish refugees which was allowed in the state but they were not in a concentration camp, and since we didn't want to go, we wanted our freedom, we never went to Jewish agency to get any support, financial support.</span> <span id="s303">That was one reason why when the Germans moved in in April, the first thing they took over the Jewish agencies and had all the names, but our name wasn't on it.</span> <span id="s304">But that guy which I mentioned before from Czechoslovakia had some kind of-business with the Germans, somehow.</span> <span id="s305">I never wanted to know and I never found out, but he took me for a cup of coffee one afternoon in a café and one of these Nazis, which he knew--I think he exchanged money with them, they didn't know that he was Jewish, he looked very non-Jewish--recognized him, and he asked, he just left the table and said, "Excuse me," and after when he came back, he said that guy wanted to know who I was and so he found out that I am illegal in this country.</span> <span id="s306">But this was a Nazi, anyway he was a German, so he checked the list and our name wasn't on this list so he wanted to know what we are living on since we don't get any support from any Jewish agency and so they figured we must have smuggled out something, and then the next time I saw this guy he said, "The Gestapo's after you, and they are going to find you sooner or later, and I just want to warn you," this is what happened.</span> <span id="s307">Now I have to go back.</span> <span id="s308">We did not live in that room anymore because when the Germans moved in they pasted a decree that anybody who is hiding, giving shelter to Jews, will be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s309">So naturally they came in at 4 o'clock in the morning, "You - you, have to get out, we cannot keep you anymore.</span> <span id="s310">We don't want to die."</span></p> <p><span id="s311">ER: So, where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">IR: What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s313">In the meantime we went to other Jewish families.</span> <span id="s314">One was a Jewish woman who was married to a non-Jewish guy, so she was sort of protected, and they were acquaintances from that guy from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s315">There is too much detail...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">ER: Very intricate, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">IR: But, I have to mention it because through these connections our lives were saved.</span> <span id="s318">We didn't know at that time, but this is how it progressed.</span> <span id="s319">We knew the Gestapo was after us but what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s320">At that time we lived in a place with a Jewish family and they needed the money because when the Germans moved in, they lost everything.</span> <span id="s321">All they had was their apartment and it was a very beautiful apartment and right across where the Gestapo had built their headquarters, and so they needed the money so they gave us the room.</span> <span id="s322">Anyway, we had no other choice; we decided my mother and I that we would go out voluntarily before they found us, because first of all if they found us they are going to make trouble for the family who is giving us shelter and secondly, what's the sense, sooner or later they will find us and deport us, so its better that we could have a clean conscience and we wanted to know what they want from us.</span> <span id="s323">But before this I wanted to mention, we had different places where we were able to stay one night.</span> <span id="s324">Imagine, you go up in the morning and you don't know where you are going to sleep tonight, and you walk the streets, just walk the streets, and then one day it was getting dark and we had no place to stay.</span> <span id="s325">So this family where the husband was non-Jewish and she was Jewish, they had a friend and--he went to school together and had a long, long friendship for many years--that man had a restaurant and he became a very big government official with the Germans, and they didn't know what do with us; they couldn't hide us because they were in danger themselves.</span> <span id="s326">So the man went to him and he said, "Listen," and explained the story and he said, "You are an SS man; you are the high official in the party, help me, these people are innocent."</span> <span id="s327">Imagine!</span> <span id="s328">He said, "I'll tell you what: for that one night I will let them stay in my place."</span> <span id="s329">So he took us to his parents--he was still living with his parents--and they were so hostile, I mean they were so hateful, and he gave us his room, he slept someplace else and he left us there for that one night.</span> <span id="s330">In the morning he said, "That's it, my job is in danger and I just did that because of the friendship to the others," so now we were back to square one.</span> <span id="s331">That was all before the Gestapo was after us.</span> <span id="s332">Then one time we found out that some person, a farmer on the outskirts will have us and we went there and again early in the morning he came on the door and woke us up: "You've got to get out; the Germans are moving in," and really we saw the German soldiers coming.</span> <span id="s333">Anyway, we had one overnight case, that was all we had left, and since we had to leave, we could not walk with it, there was no transportation you had to walk, so we left it there and we told him somebody would pick it up, and they kept it; we never saw that again either.</span> <span id="s334">I had a diary which was in there, so really we had nothing except what we were wearing.</span> <span id="s335">So, on the way to the station to catch a train that was going back to town, to Zagreb, because this was on the outskirts, we had to go through-the woods and the German soldiers were standing there next to the highway with their trucks and their kitchen and stuff, and they stopped us and they said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s336">in German, so we said, "We don't understand."</span> <span id="s337">By the way, the guy that stopped us was Austrian, I could tell from his dialect that he was Austrian.</span> <span id="s338">So we said, "We don't understand what you are talking to us," and they said, "If you don't get out of here, we are going to shoot you.</span> <span id="s339">Mach schnell!"</span> <span id="s340">We understood, but we pretended not to.</span> <span id="s341">Anyway, he let us go and I broke down at that time and I really didn't want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s342">I remember that I was lying on the ground in the woods there and I was crying my heart out.</span> <span id="s343">Anyway, we reached the station and we went back to the city and then we found the place with that Jewish family.</span> <span id="s344">So we decided to go to the Gestapo voluntarily and find out what they want.</span> <span id="s345">Each of us had a vial of sleeping tablets in case they won't let us go.</span> <span id="s346">We are going to commit suicide, because we are not willing to go to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">ER: Where did you get the vial?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">IR: These we had, my mother took already before we left.</span> <span id="s349">We had them always with us.</span> <span id="s350">Now, I have to trace back to before this.</span> <span id="s351">I had a girlfriend in Austria who was Jewish and her aunt and uncle lived in Zagreb, and they were unable to get out because her father had a factory and they took everything, they closed the bank account they were completely destitute.</span> <span id="s352">They didn't have ten dollars to their name anymore, and they were very wealthy.</span> <span id="s353">And if you wanted the guide to smuggle you over the border you had to pay and they didn't have the money; so my mother offered to pay for her, but she didn't want to leave her parents.</span> <span id="s354">She said, "I cannot leave my parents; I cannot do that but," she said, "I have an uncle and aunt there.</span> <span id="s355">If you come there tell them they should send somebody, they should pay and send somebody for me so I can get out with my family."</span> <span id="s356">So we did contact those people, which were Jews naturally, and we gave them the message and they invited us sometime for tea.</span> <span id="s357">They were not very hospitable.</span> <span id="s358">None of the Jews there were very hospitable.</span> <span id="s359">Anyway, we were desperate at that time; we said, "Look, the Gestapo is after us and something has to be done."</span> <span id="s360">Now, their daughter was married to a guy who was the editor of a Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s361">So the first thing they did was arrest him because he was a prominent Jewish personality.</span> <span id="s362">Now they had a nephew.</span> <span id="s363">That nephew was a collaborator with the Gestapo, a Jewish guy, and so she said, "I am going to get in touch with anybody that can save you.</span> <span id="s364">This guy's going to do it."</span> <span id="s365">So she got in touch and we had a meeting and he said, " I know they are looking for you, but they won't do anything because they need me.</span> <span id="s366">I am giving them, wonderful, huh?</span> <span id="s367">, all of the information that they need.</span> <span id="s368">I can pressure them to let you go.</span> <span id="s369">I promise you," he said, "that they only will question you, but they will not deport you."</span> <span id="s370">All right, so we went up with him.</span> <span id="s371">He showed us where to go and he brought us up, but the trouble is we went to the Jewish Agency to the synagogue, whatever was left, and we told them, "The Gestapo is after us, they are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s372">You have to help us to get out of here.</span> <span id="s373">If they do let us go, we have to go someplace else; we cannot stay here."</span> <span id="s374">I can remember in history that Yugoslavia was divided between the German part and the Italian part.</span> <span id="s375">So had a group of orphan children, Jewish orphan children from Germany, there in that detention camp, and they said, "The only thing we can do is put you as chaperones, and we can put you with that transport.</span> <span id="s376">They go to Israel these children, but you have to go to Italy in order to get a ship or something, so you can go."</span> <span id="s377">So, they supplied us with forged papers that we are chaperones to these children so nobody is going to look twice, to the Italian side of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s378">So, this arrangement was made before we went up to the Gestapo and the same night when we went up in the daytime, this same night we were supposed to leave.</span> <span id="s379">We met at the train station to leave that part of the country.</span> <span id="s380">Now that guy, the Jewish guy, his connection was not that close with the Gestapo, there was a middleman who was a friend of his who was a Yugoslav Nazi and that Jewish man supplied that Yugoslavish Nazi with the information and didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s381">Now that guy I was introduced to before we went up and he said, "Now this is the family and you have to guarantee me that they will get out," said the Jewish guy to the Nazi, and he said, "All right, you do me favors, I will do you favors."</span> <span id="s382">I grant you there was money involved.</span> <span id="s383">They got money for each one there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">ER: For informing on each one.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">IR: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s386">So anyway he made a date with me, that Nazi, he said, "When you come out, I guarantee you'll get out, but you have to go out with me and when you come out we will meet the same night and go to the movies."</span> <span id="s387">And I said, "How can you go out, you are in uniform, an SS uniform, and I am Jewish?"</span> <span id="s388">"Oh, don't worry, nothing is going to happen, I will protect you."</span> <span id="s389">Anyway, I knew that I am going to leave the same night so I said, "All right, we meet there and there."</span> <span id="s390">And we made a date on that and that corner.</span> <span id="s391">So we were interrogated, my mother in a different room and I in a different room, and we sort found out through that Yugoslav Nazi what they wanted from us.</span> <span id="s392">They wanted to know how we are living because we were not registered in any Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s393">Obviously we had to smuggle money out.</span> <span id="s394">So we made up a story before, my mother and I, that she had two brothers in Switzerland that are free to travel, it was a neutral country; so one of them came to Yugoslavia and gave us money and we exchanged the money and that's how we live.</span> <span id="s395">So we were interrogated, I don’t know my mother and I separately, and the guy which was interrogating me was the typical Nazi which you see on television; bored, with the monocle with the uniform, with the boots, with the SS uniform, and you know the SS had on their collar the signet of a [pause] when you die the, what's it called?</span> <span id="s396">A skeleton.</span> <span id="s397">A skeleton I don't know if you know.</span> <span id="s398">Anyway, he was a high officer and he kept on yelling at me and he kept on pounding at me, "Where did the money come from?</span> <span id="s399">I know you are a prostitute.</span> <span id="s400">I know that is how you make your money."</span> <span id="s401">And so I got very angry--I don't know where you take the courage, but I didn't care anymore--I said, "Listen, I want to see a doctor.</span> <span id="s402">I want to be examined.</span> <span id="s403">So, I can prove to you that I am not a prostitute, I am still a virgin."</span> <span id="s404">And I made a point of it.</span> <span id="s405">Then he kept quiet.</span> <span id="s406">Anyway, they kept to their promise and let us go, which is a miracle maybe, once in history.</span> <span id="s407">They let us go and they told us, "If you ever move for the place where you are now"--we gave them a wrong address; we lived right across but they didn't know--"you have to report it to the police and to us."</span> <span id="s408">Okay, we left and the Jewish guy was waiting downstairs and he said, "See, I promised you."</span> <span id="s409">Okay, so we were afraid to go where we lived because we thought they were going to follow us.</span> <span id="s410">So we were wandering the street and in one house we stayed a few seconds in the door and then went on again, and this went on for hours until we finally figured maybe we lost whoever is following us.</span> <span id="s411">So then we went where we had the room rented and we took whatever we had left, I really don't know, and went to the train station.</span> <span id="s412">And I was afraid because I had a date with that Nazi, so I left a note, a note, "I'm sorry, my mother got seriously ill and I had to call the ambulance.</span> <span id="s413">She's in the hospital, so this is the reason that I cannot keep the date."</span> <span id="s414">And I sent somebody there, the woman, who was married to the non-Jewish guy, and she had a son, and that son went with the note because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s415">Anyway, we got to the train station and we boarded the train, thank God, with the children.</span> <span id="s416">The guide was a man and he knew about us.</span> <span id="s417">There was no problem with the paper work because it was a group and they knew the group is going leaving the country and from there we go to Israel.</span> <span id="s418">They didn't care about that.</span> <span id="s419">So, we came to the other side which was Italian-occupied, called Slovania, part of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s420">So where are we going to go from there?</span> <span id="s421">There we really had no place to stay, not even an acquaintance and no language and you are illegal in the country.</span> <span id="s422">No, this time I wasn't illegal in the country anymore because we came with these children but under forged papers.</span> <span id="s423">But this wasn't our name.</span> <span id="s424">All the documents we had had a different name so we couldn't use them.</span> <span id="s425">At that time we had to go contact the Jewish Agency who took care of the children.</span> <span id="s426">So we were informed that there is this place there, a deserted sugar factory, which used to be a Jewish area, and there they have all the refugees wherever they come and catch them, and there they are concentrated and they give them shelter.</span> <span id="s427">And the Jewish population, I don't know from where, because they were persecuted themselves, I don't know where the money came from, probably the United States, I don't know, but they gave them food and they gave them shelter until their departure, wherever they went.</span> <span id="s428">Now, we didn't want to live again in a mass shelter, so we found a room, we still had some money left, and we rented a room with very nice people this time.</span> <span id="s429">An elderly woman and her son and daughter-in-law lived in that place, and he was in the underground already, because he was witnessing the Germans raped one of his sisters or somebody and took her away so he swore to take revenge.</span> <span id="s430">He was a very intelligent person; he was a professor at school, a university professor, and he went in the underground.</span> <span id="s431">So they already had an understanding for what happens.</span> <span id="s432">But I mean you had to pay, but they were very nice; they let us use the kitchen and so on, and it was humane.</span> <span id="s433">I have to come back, I mentioned that we had jewelry.</span> <span id="s434">The jewelry which we had was taken from my dressmaker in Vienna to our relatives in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s435">She was not Jewish so we paid her for the trip, and she delivered it there, two trips once and she made two trips.</span> <span id="s436">One half she brought to our uncles in Switzerland, the other half she brought to Yugoslavia to these Jewish people which were related to my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s437">When we knew we were going to go there, she went the day before and deposited.</span> <span id="s438">We figured in case we needed money we could sell some.</span> <span id="s439">When we left the German part, after the experience with the Gestapo, we were afraid to take anything, so we left the jewelry with the people, where we had our first room, that the son converted and became a preacher, a father in a cloister, and so she said, "We are not safe either, but I tell you I'm burying it under this tree."</span> <span id="s440">So she showed us.</span> <span id="s441">Anyway, we left with anything.</span> <span id="s442">When we came to the Italian part--the town is called Ljubljana, that is the capital of the Italian part of Yugoslavia--as time went on the money got less and less there was nothing coming in, so my mother told them that we have jewelry there with this family, but how are we going to get it?</span> <span id="s443">So the man that was in the underground, the son of that woman, said, "I have connections and I will get you the jewelry.</span> <span id="s444">Give me the address and everything."</span> <span id="s445">Anyway, before that happened the Italian government passed the law that anybody who is Jewish has to be in a concentration camp, and so we were again caught, not caught, but we had to go.</span> <span id="s446">This is where I met my husband, in that town in Yugoslavia in the Italian part.</span> <span id="s447">I went out with him once.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Tape two, Side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s449">ER: This is Ellen Rofman interviewing Ida Rudley.</span> <span id="s450">You were saying that you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">IR: I met my husband in that place, in Yugoslavia, in the Italian side.</span> <span id="s452">And he didn't live in that community place either; he had his own room and did some business there and he earned some money, and he was able to sustain himself.</span> <span id="s453">Anyway, we had to leave and we left before we got our jewelry, we had to go.</span> <span id="s454">So we were ordered to report to the train station, boarding the train, locking the doors, we couldn't get out anymore.</span> <span id="s455">We knew we went to Italy, but we didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s456">Anyway, it took, I think, five or six days and nights, until we finally arrived.</span> <span id="s457">But you have to consider, Italians are not Germans, and Italians are very humane and without hate and a completely different type of people and it was not strict.</span> <span id="s458">The only thing, we were not able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">ER: You were taken to what part of Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">IR: South Italy right across from Sicily.</span> <span id="s461">Italy is like a boot and that is where the toes are.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">ER: What was it; do- you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">IR: It was a concentration camp; it was Ferramonti, the next town was Cosenza.</span> <span id="s464">There were mountains there and Cosenza was on the mountain and this was in the valley, and because it was in the valley there was malaria because it was muddy.</span> <span id="s465">They built in the mud the barracks.</span> <span id="s466">And so, a lot of people had malaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">ER: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">IR: I was 26 months in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">ER: Can you tell me about some of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">IR: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">ER: And, what kind of treatment you received?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">IR: Well, in a way, we were relieved because at least we had someplace to stay and food and we had a roof over our head.</span> <span id="s473">Now the climate was the worst thing there because it was tropical climate.</span> <span id="s474">And Italy is a very poor country; they didn't have much for themselves so the rations that we got for food was very, very small and everybody was hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s475">But we were not mistreated and you did not have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">ER: You did not work at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">IR: You could if you wanted to, but you weren't forced to do anything that you didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s478">And men were separated from women, but there were different facilities for people with children, families so we did get a room, my mother and I, for ourselves, with a little kitchen so we were able to prepare supplements to the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">ER: Were you ever aware of or in contact with any resistance groups, Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">IR: Well, in that camp there were not just Jews, as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s481">There were partisans which the Italians called them, which were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s482">And Greek partisans were there, and Italian and Yugoslav partisans were there which were not Jewish and the rest were Jewish population from all over.</span> <span id="s483">There were a lot of Jews which were living in Italy already, immigrated from Germany, Austria and someplaces else.</span> <span id="s484">And they were not caught; they were ordered deported into this concentration camp from all over Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">ER: Now, when Mussolini was defeated, did the situation change?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">IR: I wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s487">Well, with Mussolini there was one thing in the history; that Hitler ordered Mussolini that he should deliver all the Jews he had, - the White Paper, or whatever it’s called, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">ER: No, the White Paper was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">IR: Anyway, we knew about that, and he refused.</span> <span id="s490">He said "I take care of my Jews in my own way."</span> <span id="s491">This is when the concentration camps started.</span> <span id="s492">So that was saving our lives because if he had given in we would have been sent to Auschwitz, and we were able to hear the Allied news report so we knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">ER: Did you feel strengthened in your experiences by religious faith or by an ideology such as Zionism or socialism, by hope in a speedy Allied victory?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">IR: When we were, liberated from [by] the Jewish brigade, which was part of the British military establishment.</span> <span id="s495">These were Israelis, the Jewish brigade, they were Israelis.</span> <span id="s496">Naturally, it was completely different when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s497">We were the first Jews to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">ER: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">IR: It was, I think, in 1943, 26 months later.</span> <span id="s500">And they gave us whatever they had, their rations to the children.</span> <span id="s501">They immediately took over the children which they found, and a lot of them left when they left and went with them to Israel, teenagers and so on.</span> <span id="s502">They made us aware of Israel because nobody thought of that at that time.</span> <span id="s503">It was not a free country; it was Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">ER: Although you said you were a member of a Zionist group.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">IR: Yes, but, I mean they couldn't help us in anyway at that time; as a matter of fact, as you know anybody who wanted to enter Palestine at that time was turned back from the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">ER: By the British mandate.</span> <span id="s507">At any time during your suffering in the camps, did you ever think of an escape plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">IR: No, there was no way to escape because there was nothing around there; it was completely isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">ER: You don't know anyone that escaped or tried to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">IR: No, nobody escaped; there was no place to go; there was nothing!</span> <span id="s511">At that part Italy is very narrow and there is only one highway going from the north to the south to Sicily.</span> <span id="s512">And we saw the whole German army going to Africa on that one road, and we only wondered all the time why don't they bomb that road?</span> <span id="s513">We saw the airplanes of the Allies, so why didn't the Allies bomb that road so they weren't able to go there?</span> <span id="s514">But nothing happened.</span> <span id="s515">And on the way back, when they lost Africa and later we saw them coming back the same road.</span> <span id="s516">Now, they entered the camp on the way back because they were short on supplies and they wanted to stock up.</span> <span id="s517">The Italian director--the camp was under the control of the equivalent of the SS from Italy, and the director was a civilian but he was a Fascist and an engineer, but this was the elite of the Fascists.</span> <span id="s518">They had wonderful jobs there.</span> <span id="s519">And then there was the militia, they were soldiers which were surrounding the camp so nobody can escape and they had to stay 24 hours on guard and had their place where they were staying.</span> <span id="s520">When the administration knew the Germans were coming back they were concerned about our well-being, and they opened the doors and they said, "You go and hide because the Germans might come into camp and we don't want any harm should come to you."</span> <span id="s521">So we were in the woods with a farmer.</span> <span id="s522">You see, all of this couldn't have happened in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">ER: No so you really, basically, you owe your survival to the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">IR: Yes, that's true, at that point, before--whoever individual helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">ER: What did you do during the days in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">IR: First of all, the climate was unbearable.</span> <span id="s527">It was awful hot; during the day you weren't able to do anything--you just looked for relief or some cool air--actually nothing.</span> <span id="s528">But as Jews are, they organized.</span> <span id="s529">They organized all kinds of classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">ER: They had schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">IR: That was the number one: there were schools and kindergarten and the synagogue and the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">ER: The Italians permitted this?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">IR: They permitted this.</span> <span id="s534">Hospitals, it was all Jewish-organized and a little place where you could buy supplies, food if you were able to, and hygiene and culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">ER: Did you have enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">IR: Well, we didn't have enough food because they didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s537">The food was brought in with the black market, through the police which guarded us.</span> <span id="s538">And you were able to exchange for cigarettes or whatever, or pay them, and they let you have whatever they had, and that's how you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">ER: How many people do you judge were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">IR: There were, I think, 3500.</span> <span id="s541">It was fairly small.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">ER: How about in your immediate barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">IR: Well, I had a family.</span> <span id="s544">It was called a family barracks where only families were...

you had to stand there and be counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">ER: So, there were religious services going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">IR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">ER: Was there any figure in the camp who helped you and others to hold on?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">IR: Well, it wasn't really necessary because we weren't harmed.</span> <span id="s558">The only thing you didn't have your freedom, and you suffered from the climate and you were detained, you were a number, you weren't a human being actually, and so you counted the days that the war should be over and you are liberated, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">ER: Now, you said you were liberated by the British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">IR: Yes, the British Army and the Jewish Battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">ER: You stayed in Italy, in that part of Italy after you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">IR: When we were liberated, the UNRRA--you heard the name UNRRA?</span> <span id="s563">It was American--United Restitution Refugee organization [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration], something like that--which took over the responsibility of taking care of anybody who was a refugee or had to leave wherever he came from.</span> <span id="s564">That was American already, but this was part of the Army.</span> <span id="s565">And they sent us after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s566">Some people had papers already to leave to go to the United States or Canada or wherever, and the ones who didn't they are able to go to a place on the coast which I mentioned before, where the Fascists had a summer resort.</span> <span id="s567">And the military, they took over and put us in these places to recuperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">ER: They repossessed these houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">IR: Right, for temporary, and there was already military rations and military medical attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">ER: Now, the war was still going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">IR: Right, the war was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">ER: And you felt safe where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">IR: Of course, you had your freedom again and you were taken care of.</span> <span id="s574">And so the Red Cross and so on, people tried to get contact through the Red Cross and see who was still alive.</span> <span id="s575">This was the first time that we found out about the German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s576">We didn't know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">ER: That was my next question.</span> <span id="s578">When did you find out about what was going on in the other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">ER: Well, we found out when these people, the survivors from these extermination camps were sent to Italy to recuperate from their...</span></p> <p><span id="s580">IR: But this must have been in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">ER: Yes, we were already liberated and they were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">IR: They were liberated.</span> <span id="s583">So you didn't know, before 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">ER: We knew something, but we didn't have contact.</span> <span id="s585">You didn't know the details about it, so what they did with them you didn't know exactly.</span> <span id="s586">You knew there were extermination camps and people died, but who it really was you didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">ER: You didn't know that they were being gassed, in other words, until 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">IR: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">ER: When you heard the reports did you believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">IR: When these people came, we already were big shots at that time.</span> <span id="s591">I was working, no salaries, but I was working for the UNRRA; my husband was sent out from the UNRRA to the next town to buy fruits and vegetables for the military occupation and for us, and so we were already sort of established in a sort of normal way.</span> <span id="s592">And then these people came and I remembered sitting there taking down their history so they would be registered, and that's how we found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">ER: Did you believe at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">IR: It was unbearable the way they looked and how scared they were.</span> <span id="s595">They weren't standing in front of you; they were like they were trained, standing away from the desk and their eyes down.</span> <span id="s596">They didn't look at you even though they knew we were Jewish, and then little by little the truth came out, what they did, and some of them had ashes in a container that were their relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">ER: After the war was over in 1945 did you go back to see if there were any surviving?</span> <span id="s598">How did you find out about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">IR: I didn't have a family except my sister which was in South America and my uncle, who was safe and that was it.</span> <span id="s600">I had family in Hungary which I didn't know what happened to them, and the people in people in Switzerland were safe, but my husband had ten brothers and sisters and none of them survived.</span> <span id="s601">And his mother was killed and some of these brothers and sisters were married and their children and their whole families were wiped out, and he found that out through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s602">There were no survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">ER: So, you stayed in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">IR: We stayed in Italy until our departure to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">ER: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">IR: That was in '47.</span> <span id="s607">I have to make one thing, an incident.</span> <span id="s608">When we were liberated, naturally the camp was open, and we were able to walk outside, that was the first time that we saw what was outside.</span> <span id="s609">It was a nice day, so my husband and I, we took a walk on the highway.</span> <span id="s610">And there was a little creek and like a little bridge and on the edge of the bridge on the embankment - all over you saw from the war, remnants, shells and things like that - military things and so there were two things lying there on that board which looked like shells, big, maybe a foot long and two-three inches wide, and my husband picked it up and said, "Look what they left, this must be an empty shell and maybe I will take it as a souvenir."</span> <span id="s611">It was engraved, I think, from the British.</span> <span id="s612">And all of a sudden I had some kind of a..</span> <span id="s613">.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">ER: Premonition?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">IR: Yes;

that was a transit camp that's what it was.</span> <span id="s640">So, we had our papers already and we were in that transit camp until the boat was ready to take us, because it was still right after the war and there were no civilian ships, so we went on a military boat to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">ER: So, most of your relatives survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">IR: I didn't have too many relatives to begin with, and they didn't live in Austria.</span> <span id="s643">I had relatives in Germany, which some of them left before, in '33; they didn't wait until the war, and some of them were killed in the concentration camp, and were very prominent.</span> <span id="s644">I had an uncle who was writing Jewish literature, Jewish books which were taught in Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s645">He was a principal of a high school, but he luckily died before.</span> <span id="s646">And he had two sons, one was a lawyer and one was a college professor, too.</span> <span id="s647">The lawyer got out but the other one perished.</span> <span id="s648">And I had two other relatives who, same thing, one got saved and one got killed.</span> <span id="s649">And the people in Hungary on my father's side, I had an aunt there who had six children, her husband died before, and three of them survived and three of them are dead.</span> <span id="s650">Now, I found out that one of my cousins is still alive there.</span> <span id="s651">The others left and they live in South America, but this one, he was the oldest and he was hiding in the Swedish embassy.</span> <span id="s652">And he was a professor of music and he had the synagogue choir.</span> <span id="s653">He did that as a hobby--and he was very musically inclined and he composed and all that.</span> <span id="s654">And three years ago, when I went [unclear] to Europe someplace, I figured why don't you once get acquainted again?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">ER: He's in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">IR: He lives in Budapest.</span> <span id="s657">We went to Israel at that time with a stop in Europe and so my son and I went from Zurich in Switzerland--there's a plane which goes like a shuttle to Budapest--and we took it and we went and I didn't tell him we were coming, I didn't even know and so I found the number in the phone-book and I called and he wasn't here.</span> <span id="s658">Anyway, I saw him after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">ER: I want to thank you very much for sharing your experiences with us and they will be very useful for people in the future to use to learn about what happened during those years.</span> <span id="s660">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
