We're gonna spend an hour together, and I'm gonna try to get a sense of what life was like for you before Hitler.</span> <span id="s35">How life got progressively worse under the Third Reich, how you survived, and how you've come to be here today.</span> <span id="s36">All right?</span> <span id="s37">So to start with, I'd like you to tell me as much as you can about your family that you were--the family of origin.</span> <span id="s38">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">MF: I was born in Radom, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">MW: Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">MW: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">MF: R-A-D-O-M.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">MW: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">MF: 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">MW: That would make you how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MF: I'm gonna be 57.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">MW: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">MF: And I was born to a very loving family.</span> <span id="s50">My father was an only son, and my mother came from a larger family of brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s51">And we were all very close.</span> <span id="s52">And I had a grandfather and grandmother and...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">MW: You had, your two parents, how many brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">MF: You mean, my parents?</span> <span id="s55">My father didn't have any, but my mother had, she had two sisters and a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">MW: In the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">MF: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s58">We was all in the same area.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">MW: A closely-knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MF: Very close, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">MW: And you had brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">MF: I had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">MW: And.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MF: And she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">MW: She survived too.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">MF: She is also in Encino, California.</span> <span id="s67">We were a, I w-...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">MW: How old is she, older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">MF: She is older.</span> <span id="s70">She is two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">MW: You lived in the same area as aunts and uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MF: Yes, yes, all very close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">MW: And you were close-knit?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">MF: Close-knit, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">MW: And loving.</span> <span id="s76">What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">MF: My father was in business.</span> <span id="s78">He was dealing in raw, in the production of leather, you know, the raw materials, in the hide, he was dealing in the hides of cows and sheep and so on.</span> <span id="s79">Like we would be wholesaling this to factories that processed it, to a processing factory.</span> <span id="s80">And later on during the war we were involved in manufacturing of shoes, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MW: Were you in a reli--was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">MW: You were...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">MF: Everybody was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">MW: You were given a Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">MF: Jewish education, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">MW: Did you also go to public school and to...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">MF: I, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">MW: Cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">MF: I went to public school and to cheder.</span> <span id="s91">And, but things became very hectic in the public schools, because the Polish children that were there, they were intimidating the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">MW: Before Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">MF: Before Hitler, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">MW: This was, something that went on for many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">MF: Yeah, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s96">They were very antisemitic, because they were taught by their pare--by their parents that the Jews were the whole cause of all the problems and that we killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s97">That's what they always, if, when, if they wanted to call you a name they would call you Jesus-killer, Jesus-killer, you know.</span> <span id="s98">And so eventually I had to leave public school and just go to cheder.</span> <span id="s99">And I had a very good Jewish education, and my parents would do anything to educate their children.</span> <span id="s100">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MW: Was there, besides the antisemitism in the school you attended...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">MW: In this community at large, in the general community, were you and your family the object of any kind of antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">MF: Well, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MW: Before Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">MF: We usually lived in a community where there was, you know, a majority Jewish population, so we didn't really feel it.</span> <span id="s107">But the only time we felt it is if you went o--we went out of our area, see.</span> <span id="s108">You were always intimidated by the Poles, by the, they were antisemitic.</span> <span id="s109">Every one, and during the war the Poles were even worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s110">They were just, you know, when the Germans ordered all the Jews to be turned in, or to turn in let's say their radios, to turn in their own things, but the Poles would be the ones that would show a finger at the Jews, which are Jews and who has it and all so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">MW: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s112">Are you saying you were protected from antisemitism because the community was kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">MW: Closed off...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">MW: From the regular community?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">MF: Yes, because we had not, we didn't have much to do with the Poles.</span> <span id="s118">Well, mainly, you know, circulation with the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">MW: When did you first begin to feel the impact of Hitler's government?</span> <span id="s120">When, how did it, when did it...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">MF: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MW: Begin to affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">MF: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">MW: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">MF: Right away, as soon as they came in, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">MW: 1933?</span> <span id="s127">1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">MF: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">MW: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">MF: Well, as soon as the...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">MW: That was when Hitler invaded...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">MW: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">MF: Poland, and they marched into our city.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">MW: And what happened?</span> <span id="s136">How did that affect you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">MF: Now, first of all, slowly they started to take away all the businesses, and they took away the properties, and they would, the apartments and homes they would take away and settle Germans in them.</span> <span id="s138">And the Jews had to move in together.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">MW: Is that what happened in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">MF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">MW: When did you move into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">MF: We moved into the ghetto I think in 1940.</span> <span id="s143">We had to live like three, four families in one apartment, in order to make room for the Germans, because they had confiscated apartments to put the German soldiers in.</span> <span id="s144">And then when we went into the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MW: You, you lived with other families...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">MW: You, with your parents and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">MF: We lived in the ghetto with one more family and we have taken, two grandmothers lived with us, all in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s149">So we were about three, four, six, eight, ten people, ten people in a one-bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s150">And after that, they liquidated this large ghetto, and made a small ghetto out of it.</span> <span id="s151">Much smaller one because most of the Jews, they took away, you know, to gas chambers, from our city.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">MW: Before, I want to go into that, but before we do, can you tell me a little bit more about life in the ghetto with your family?</span> <span id="s153">How did you support yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">MF: Well, first of all there was a shortage of food always.</span> <span id="s155">And we used to smuggle in goods from outside the ghetto into the ghetto, and you know, this is how we supported ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">MW: By selling the food that you smuggled?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MF: By, smuggled in, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">MW: Food mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">MF: No, soft goods and different material things that we would smuggle in and sell it in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s160">And also by taking things from the ghetto that we made and take it outside the ghetto to sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">MW: Was that legal?</span> <span id="s162">Or w-...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MF: It was illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">MW: Was it, if you got caught you would lose your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">MF: Got caught, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MW: And yet you still did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">MF: Yes, we had to do it.</span> <span id="s168">We had to do it because we had to support our families.</span> <span id="s169">And, I was a child.</span> <span id="s170">I was only ten years old at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MW: What were your thoughts, when you had to leave your home and you had to go into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s172">Did you have, did your parents have thoughts about leaving?</span> <span id="s173">What were their fantasies about what was gonna happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">MF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MW: How did it affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">MF: My father was always a Zionist.</span> <span id="s177">So eventually, even if the Germans [unclear] and we were, he was always hoping anyway to Israel one day, even when it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s178">But when this happened, there was no way out.</span> <span id="s179">I mean it was life or death if you were to leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">There were so many instances...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">MW: Before you went into the ghetto...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">MF: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">MW: What were the restrictions that you, you had to sell your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">MF: Well, no, not that we have to sell.</span> <span id="s185">They took it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">MW: You didn't get anything for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">MF: No.</span> <span id="s188">We were not allowed to listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s189">We had to turn in all the radios.</span> <span id="s190">There was no television at the time.</span> <span id="s191">We had to stand in line, I think, I remember it took us a day.</span> <span id="s192">It was a life-threatening situation, that if you didn't turn in the radio and they caught you, you know, you could get shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">MW: Did you see people getting shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">MF: Well I didn't see, because I didn't know of any that withhold the radio at the time.</span> <span id="s195">You know, they didn't want us to hear what's going on in the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s196">And slowly, you know, they took away our rights.</span> <span id="s197">We had to wear armbands, and if a German would walk on the sidewalk the Jews had to walk, get off the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s198">Slowly.</span> <span id="s199">And then eventually they, you know, they threw us in into a small area.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">MW: O.K., before they did that, when these kinds of restrictions were being imposed...</span></p> <p><span id="s201">MF: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">MW: What did you think about that as a ten-year-old child?</span> <span id="s203">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">MF: I thought it was terrible.</span> <span id="s205">I mean, there was no freedom, no freedom of movement.</span> <span id="s206">Of course we were used to some discrimination before the Germans came in, because of the Poles.</span> <span id="s207">But that made it that much worse.</span> <span id="s208">And the Poles were cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s209">They were helping them.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MW: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">MF: In what way?</span> <span id="s212">Like, you know, they never put up any resistance when the, when the Germans were evacuating the Jews out of Poland, or into concentration camps, or into death camps, you know, like Treblinka.</span> <span id="s213">They never protested.</span> <span id="s214">They never did anything to help a Jew.</span> <span id="s215">There's very few instances where the Poles would help Jews.</span> <span id="s216">Of course, my wife, she was hiding out with a Polish family, but only because her uncle kept paying money.</span> <span id="s217">And every time that if there was any kind of a threat, they would tell her, "Just go out and take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s218">You're none of our business."</span> <span id="s219">They didn't try to hide her or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s220">Every one of us can write a book that big if we wanted to go into details.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">MW: What I would like you to do today, as you come to it, tell me little anecdotes.</span> <span id="s222">Give me a real flavor what it was like for you as a human being to be subjected to this kind of cruelty.</span> <span id="s223">I want to get a sense of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">MF: Well, I was about 14, maybe, 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">MW: This, you were in the ghetto at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">MF: No, this is later on when they took us into a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">MW: So, hold that for a minute...</span></p> <p><span id="s228">MF: Yeah, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">MW: O.K. Let me get...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">MF: You mean something in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MW: Yeah, how long were you in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">MF: In the ghetto, I think about a year-and-a-half, or two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">MW: With your folks...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">MW: And your sister, and all...</span></p> <p><span id="s236">MF: We were all...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">MW: The other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">MF: What happened is my mother got taken away before in, from the [unclear].</span> <span id="s239">Because one day they came and they chased us out of our homes.</span> <span id="s240">And they diminished the population at that time by maybe three-quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">MW: They took them where?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">MF: They took away to Treblinka, to death camp.</span> <span id="s243">And at that time they took away my two grandmothers and my mother, and the rest of my mother's family, which we never saw again.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">MW: Do you remember when that took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">MF: This must have been in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">MW: What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">MF: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s248">Now, at that time, and that's when I saw people being shot and killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s249">When we were standing in line and they were, you know, it was a matter of a hair between life and death.</span> <span id="s250">Like they would, there was an S.S. officer would say, "You go here, and you go to the left, and you go to the right."</span> <span id="s251">And one row was to go to the gas chamber, and one row was to still live on, but we didn't know for how long.</span> <span id="s252">We knew that sooner or later we're gonna be finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">MW: So they deported a large number of people from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">MF: From the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MW: You remained there?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">MF: I remained.</span> <span id="s257">Yeah, I remained with...</span></p> <p><span id="s258">MW: With, with your father and...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">MF: My father and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">MW: And a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s262">And also, there was a surviving child, my cousin.</span> <span id="s263">Because her parents were taken away all together, and she was younger than I was at the time.</span> <span id="s264">So we took her in and she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s265">She is here today too.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">MW: How much longer were you allowed to stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">MF: Not too long, maybe we stayed in the smaller ghetto, you know, they herded us into a very small area, and they let us stay over there, because we had a--there was a big manufacturing area where they were producing for the Germans garments and different things, and that's why they let us stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">MW: Oh, you worked as a, in a factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">MF: Yeah, we--there was factories, there was shoe factories, garment factories.</span> <span id="s270">And we worked there.</span> <span id="s271">And from there they took us away to a ammunitions factory.</span> <span id="s272">And that's the one that's called Pionki.</span> <span id="s273">I think I wrote this down here.</span> <span id="s274">Yeah, let's see, here.</span> <span id="s275">We went to Pionki there.</span> <span id="s276">And this was a terrible experience, because the people that they...</span></p> <p><span id="s277">MW: P-I-O-N- right?</span> <span id="s278">So you were taken from the ghetto and you had, you lived at Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">MF: Pionki, yes, and that, this was a terrible experience over there, because I was very young, and over there if they would catch somebody smuggle, they would hang you.</span> <span id="s280">And they would take and chase out all the people from the barracks into the square, and hang them right in front of us, to scare the people off we shouldn't, you know, smuggle things.</span> <span id="s281">So, in order to support ourselves, to have some mean of living--besides, you know, just whatever they gave us like a quart of soup and a cup of coffee and a piece of bread--in order to get medicine or things like that, you would have to smuggle and sell things out on the outside.</span> <span id="s282">And during [unclear] they hung three or four people at the same time and made us watch it, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">MW: You were, you were about 12...</span></p> <p><span id="s284">MF: That was very...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">MW: At that place...</span></p> <p><span id="s286">MF: Yes, yeah, and this was a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">MW: It must have been terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">MF: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">MW: Was your father with you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">MF: Yeah, my father and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">MW: They were in that labor camp as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">MF: Yeah, yeah, we all, they split us up.</span> <span id="s293">There was times where I as the young boy had to work 16 hours a day, and sometimes they'd make us work 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">MW: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s296">It was, and from there--this wasn't everything--when the Russians were getting close, then they moved us on to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">MW: Before you get to that...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">MW: In Pionki, how, what were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">MF: They were not living conditions.</span> <span id="s301">They were surviving conditions, let's say.</span> <span id="s302">It was like they put in 20 people into one room, you know.</span> <span id="s303">We had bunk beds, and the bunk beds even, two had to sleep in one bunk bed, in one bed, because it was just crowded.</span> <span id="s304">And the sanitary conditions were terrible.</span> <span id="s305">And then there were times where I didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s306">We had to live, ma--when, you know, when they couldn't get in and out because the war was getting closer to us, there was times where we had to live maybe just on rice or cheese, old cheese, [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s307">MW: What were the years you were at Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">MF: [unclear] say?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">MW: What were the years you were at Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">MF: What year did I put down?</span> <span id="s311">I think '42...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">MW: '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">MF: '42-'43.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MW: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">MF: At least a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">MW: How were your parents doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">MF: Well, my mother wasn't there any more.</span> <span id="s318">My father had a hard time, because, you know, he wasn't used to that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s319">He was a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">MW: And I suppose for both of you, not knowing what happened to your mother must have been pretty...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">MF: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s322">Well we...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">MW: Pretty depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">MF: We had a pretty good feeling that they were taking them all to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s325">We, we got reports that that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">MW: Where did you get the reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MF: From people that, some people that, that ran away, that risked their lives.</span> <span id="s328">They jumped off the trains, you know.</span> <span id="s329">They took us in trains.</span> <span id="s330">And some people who risked their life and jumped off the trains would come back and tell us all about it.</span> <span id="s331">Because they came back to look for their relatives.</span> <span id="s332">People that were brave enough, you know, ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">MW: Did you have any other source of information about what was going on in the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">MF: Once in a while, but it wasn't reliable, because it would come from the Poles.</span> <span id="s335">And the Poles, either they would make up a story, but once in a while they would tell us the truth.</span> <span id="s336">But they never, never tried to rescue people, or to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MW: The transportation from this first place that you were at, from the ghetto to this labor camp, how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">MF: We went in open cars, boxcars, no cover, nothing, even if it was raining or snowing.</span> <span id="s339">No water, no water for days, no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">MW: Did people die on the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">MF: Oh yeah, many people died on the trains or some of them got shot because they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s342">[pause] We were always transported in open boxcars, because that would help the, that would help them to solve their, you know, the "Jewish Problem".</span> <span id="s343">You know, instead of putting them to the gas chambers, dying out on the way, when they were transporting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">MW: What was the year you were transported from the ghetto to, where was the first camp you went to, the first place you went to after you left the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">MF: We had a, well, Pionki.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MW: It was Pionki.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">MW: O.K., how long did it take to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">MF: Well, probably at least two days.</span> <span id="s350">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s351">MW: In cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">MF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">MW: Were you and your mothe--you and your father together in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">MF: You mean in, in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s355">MW: In the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">MF: Yeah, well we always tried to stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">MW: Was it hard to stay together?</span> <span id="s358">Were there [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s359">MF: It was very hard, because many times they were trying to separate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">MW: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">MF: Because, you know, like, we were young, me and my sister.</span> <span id="s362">And my father a little older, and they always tried to keep the different ages separate, because if anything happened they figured that the young people, they could get out a lot of work from them still, before they kill them.</span> <span id="s363">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s364">MW: How long were you at Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">MF: For about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">MW: Did you have any contact with your sister there?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">MF: Yeah, yeah, we lived together.</span> <span id="s368">At that time they allowed us to live together in our families, because this was the, more of a work camp than a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s369">Of course we had no rights or anything, but they would--we would walk to work, you know, it was all-inclusive area for--you could never get out.</span> <span id="s370">It was all surrounded by barbed wires, between the living camp and the camp where we were working, you know, the factories.</span> <span id="s371">It was all enclosed with barbed wire and, you know, the German soldiers were patrolling it with machine guns and these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">MW: Did people, were people shot at that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">MF: Shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">MW: At Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">MF: Oh many times.</span> <span id="s376">If they tried to escape, they were shot.</span> <span id="s377">Or if they smuggled, so you see, we were making ammunition over there, and ammunition is made of alcohol.</span> <span id="s378">And alcohol was a good item, you know, to use, to sell to the outside, because you know, for alcohol you could get bread, you could get eggs, you could get butter.</span> <span id="s379">You know, and the alcohol was expensive, because it was 100 proof.</span> <span id="s380">In order to produce the good ammunition, it had to be 100 proof.</span> <span id="s381">So whenever somebody tried, you know, like a--if somebody got sick in the family and the--he had no medicine, he tried to do anything.</span> <span id="s382">So people tried to smuggle outside the alcohol, and sell it...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">MW: To save their family.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">MF: To get medicine.</span> <span id="s385">I remember I was in one of the camps with my father and I got sick.</span> <span id="s386">I had a fever.</span> <span id="s387">I had pneumonia.</span> <span id="s388">And my father had hidden some jewelry.</span> <span id="s389">And he went out.</span> <span id="s390">In order to get a couple aspirins he gave away a gold ring.</span> <span id="s391">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s392">MW: How long were you ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">MF: Oh I was ill almost till they transported us.</span> <span id="s394">I was about two months in the hospital with pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">MW: They had a hospital bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">MF: Yeah, it was, yeah, it was very, very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">MW: And you had pneumonia there?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">MF: They didn't do much for you.</span> <span id="s399">They just let you lay there.</span> <span id="s400">Mo--the older people, if they got sick, they just shipped them out to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s401">Younger people they didn't do it so.</span> <span id="s402">And besides, you know, you had to be very, very shrewd and conniving in order to survive.</span> <span id="s403">You had to do so many different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">MW: You as a child, were you doing things like that, or mostly it was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">MF: No, me, because then after we were separated from my father, we had to do the things in order to survive, to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">MW: When were you separated from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">MF: I was separated from my father in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">MW: Were you at Pionki all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">MF: No, no, we, they shipped us out...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">MW: When...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">MF: To coal mine and...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">MW: From Pionki you went to a coal mine?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">MF: Coal mine in Upper Silesia [German: Oberschlesien] in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">MW: In Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">MW: You and your father and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">MF: My father, no, no, then they separated us by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">MW: Where did she go?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">MF: You see, we, they sent us out from Pionki to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s420">And in Auschwitz they separated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">MW: So you, when you worked in the coal mine, you were living at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">MF: No, they, that was after Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s423">Because Auschwitz was like a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">MW: Let's take the first step, O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">MW: When you left Pionki.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">MF: Yeah, then we went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">MW: O.K., when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">MF: This must have been in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">MW: O.K. And it was you and your father and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">MF: Yeah, we all, we all went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">MW: Were you separated from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">MF: Yeah, in Auschwitz, yes, they separated us.</span> <span id="s434">But I was still with my father in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">MW: But you were separated from your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">MF: Sister, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">MW: Tell me about, how long were you at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MF: I must have been in Auschwitz maybe a couple months.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">MW: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">MF: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">MW: Was it worse than Pionki?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">MF: Yeah, because Auschwitz we knew was a death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">MW: So it was more terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">MF: Yes, because just a few blocks from where we were living, and besides, you know, we were already in regular barracks like for cattle.</span> <span id="s445">It wasn't, you know, like before.</span> <span id="s446">And you had to struggle to survive, to get a piece of bread, because we got a slice of bread may be and a pot of black coffee and maybe a quart of soup for the whole day.</span> <span id="s447">And in order to have something better, you'd have to do some kind of a service where you can manipulate and, to find food.</span> <span id="s448">So, that's what I was going to tell you, that a, an interesting episode happened to me in Auschwitz when we came.</span> <span id="s449">They took us all out, outside.</span> <span id="s450">And you know, they were supposed to check us in to each separate blocks, so many people into each block.</span> <span id="s451">And each block, a block was considered like, you know, a big barrack, one block.</span> <span id="s452">And each block had like a foreman.</span> <span id="s453">And that foreman could be a Pole; it could be a Jew; it could be a German.</span> <span id="s454">Because they were also, you see, they kept over there criminals too.</span> <span id="s455">You know, like German criminals, they were considered somebody that's against the government.</span> <span id="s456">And Poles also that would be resisting the Germans.</span> <span id="s457">And the Jews, because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s458">So, but most of the, those block foremens were either Germans or Poles.</span> <span id="s459">There were also some who...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">MW: Who tried to resist it?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">MF: Yeah, they were resistant to Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">MW: How did the people get that particular role?</span> <span id="s463">How were they chosen to be the commanders?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">MF: Well, if they would cooperate with the Germans, and they were good and healthy, and, you know, they could, then they would see that, you know, like they could beat up somebody, you know, if they would have the guts to beat people and do, to treat them like dirt, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">MW: Did the Jewish people do it to other Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">MF: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s467">It happened.</span> <span id="s468">There's always some rotten apples in the barrel, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">MW: So let me not interrupt your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s471">So, at that time, you know, we were assigned to a certain block, a certain barrack.</span> <span id="s472">And we were all together.</span> <span id="s473">And there was, I think there must have been 150, 200 people in that group.</span> <span id="s474">And there was a few young, younger people, and then most of them were older.</span> <span id="s475">And that block foreman came out, and he said--and I was about 12, 13, 14--and he came out and he said, "Who is a chef, a cook, in this whole group?"</span> <span id="s476">And I never knew how to cook or never knew how to do anything at home, because we always had a loving family.</span> <span id="s477">We had a maid that did everything.</span> <span id="s478">We didn't have to do nothing.</span> <span id="s479">And in order to survive you had to lie and cheat and tell things that you, you know.</span> <span id="s480">So I, I stepped out, you know.</span> <span id="s481">I kind of took a chance.</span> <span id="s482">I said, "I'm a cook."</span> <span id="s483">He says, "O.K. You're gonna cook for me."</span> <span id="s484">And that was it.</span> <span id="s485">And, being a cook, you know, you had access to food, to eggs, to food that had protein.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">MW: Who was it that you cooked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">MF: For that block foreman.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">MW: For the foreman.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">MW: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">MF: You know, a lot of them were also looking for young boys, to use them as homosexuals and so on.</span> <span id="s492">But this did not happen to me, thanks God.</span> <span id="s493">But, so I became the cook, and being a cook I was able to help my father and help friends, because if you had access to the food, you know--like in order to get a dozen eggs, you had to sacrifice seven breads.</span> <span id="s494">You know, it was trading, back and forth, in food.</span> <span id="s495">But he had all the food he wanted.</span> <span id="s496">He had meat; he had fruit.</span> <span id="s497">He had salami.</span> <span id="s498">He had eggs.</span> <span id="s499">And, which we never saw.</span> <span id="s500">I mean, as a--all we used to get is some potato peels with water as our food.</span> <span id="s501">And we- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s502">MF: Which helped me survive, because everybody was just getting down to bone and skin, because we had no nutrition.</span> <span id="s503">We had no protein, you know.</span> <span id="s504">Most of the people were so skinny.</span> <span id="s505">Like when I was liberated in 1945, I only weighed less than 100 pounds.</span> <span id="s506">And I was at the age where I should have been growing and being healthy.</span> <span id="s507">So the people were going down the drain slowly, the ones that didn't, couldn't help themselves, or didn't get any help from the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">MW: People were dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">Slowly, eventually they would die, or when, you know, they used to come, you know, that Dr. Mengele that they're still looking.</span> <span id="s511">I met him personally.</span> <span id="s512">I saw him over there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s513">He used to come, and look over every block of people every so often.</span> <span id="s514">And when he saw somebody wasn't as healthy, he'd say, "Out, to the right."</span> <span id="s515">And then they would load up the carloads of people and take them over to, to the gas chambers, not gas, gas chambers, and then to the ovens.</span> <span id="s516">And my worst experience there was that two blocks from us you could smell the burning of the flesh of the people.</span> <span id="s517">We didn't see it actually, but at night you could see the flames.</span> <span id="s518">And we knew that's what it was.</span> <span id="s519">They would take the people, select them, the ones that were assigned to die, and ship them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">MW: How did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">MF: My father was fine, being that I was able to help him with everything, until 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">MW: So you were, but you were only in Auschwitz temporarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">MF: Temporarily, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">MW: When did you leave Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">MF: In Auschwitz, after a couple months we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">MW: You were a chef while you were there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s528">I was a..</span> <span id="s529">.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">MW: A cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MW: And then you went to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">MF: Then, you see, we had a friend in Auschwitz that was an accountant.</span> <span id="s534">And he was working in the office.</span> <span id="s535">And he was a good friend of my father.</span> <span id="s536">And we asked him if whenever something comes along that they're gonna have a place out--we wanted to get out of there--to let us know where we can get in, and out of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s537">So he told us once that there was a transport going to that Upper Silesia, to the coal mines, which was good, because it wasn't any more or so.</span> <span id="s538">You know, they always had access to it.</span> <span id="s539">They could have always come and get us, but we thought that maybe the war will get closer, and we'll have a chance to survive without having to come back to Auschwitz where you will go to the gas chambers or to the ovens.</span> <span id="s540">So, that's the reason we got out of Auschwitz and went to the coal mine town.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">MW: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">MF: That was in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">MW: You and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">MF: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">MW: And how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">MF: We must have spent there about nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">MW: What were the living conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">MF: The living conditions were better than in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">MW: You had more to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">MF: Well, better food, and a little more to eat.</span> <span id="s551">And being that we were considered laborers, and not, you see, when we were in Auschwitz, we didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s552">They were just chasing us back and forth and doing things, make us do things that were unnecessary, in order to keep us occupied so our mind wouldn't work and plan things like an uprising.</span> <span id="s553">But, over there, we did manual labor and working in the coal mines, whoever was healthy enough.</span> <span id="s554">And whoever got sick or anything, then they shipped him out and back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s555">So we tried to stay healthy, and you know, I being young, were always able, I was always able to organize things so we had a little more food than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">MW: You were pretty clever, weren't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">MF: Well, you had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">MW: But it sounds like your father really depended on you more than you depended on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">MF: He, at the time, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">MW: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">MF: Because for an older person it was very hard to get around.</span> <span id="s562">Because he would be recognized.</span> <span id="s563">And right away, you know, they called him names if they found out.</span> <span id="s564">The younger people they didn't pay so much attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">MW: Where did you get your strength from during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">MF: The what?</span> <span id="s567">The strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">MW: Where did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">MF: You see, we had one thing in mind, is to survive, and to be able to say, "We were there, and we saw it all."</span> <span id="s570">And, my father, you know, we were always talking about that we hope the day will come when even when he's dead we should, we should, to come to his grave and say, "We survived.</span> <span id="s571">We're here.</span> <span id="s572">And the Germans are gone."</span> <span id="s573">You know, that we outlived the Germans.</span> <span id="s574">Because, we were always talking that the Jewish people had plenty obstacles in their life, and they were always, you know, persecuted.</span> <span id="s575">They were always trying to kill us off and [unclear] was doing the--you know, so many years ago, in the Egyptian times, and later on in the Spanish Inquisition, and then the Russian Czars with their pogroms and the Polish pogroms.</span> <span id="s576">But yet we survived.</span> <span id="s577">We outlived them.</span> <span id="s578">So that's what gave me strength, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">MW: The history of your people is what gave you strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s581">Yes.</span> <span id="s582">Because we knew that somebody is going to survive, no matter how few it'll be, but somebody's going to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">MW: And you thought it would be you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">MF: I was hoping.</span> <span id="s585">Everybody was hoping.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">MW: Did you have any sense for how long it was gonna take?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">MF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">MW: Did you think much about that...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">MF: We were...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">MW: I imagine you thought about it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">MF: Actually we were very pessimistic about it, the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s592">We knew that sooner or later that we were all gonna die.</span> <span id="s593">But how long it was gonna be, you know, we were always talking about it.</span> <span id="s594">We knew.</span> <span id="s595">We were very pessimistic about life.</span> <span id="s596">We knew it's gonna, it's not gonna, [unclear] under the conditions that we couldn't live.</span> <span id="s597">It was impossible, that there has to be some kind of rescue in order for us to survive.</span> <span id="s598">And this is actually what happened, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s599">MW: Before we get to that, Michael, tell me, you were at the coal mines for nine months...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">MF: Yeah, approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">MW: And then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">MF: From there, when the, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s603">MW: And your sister was where at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">MF: We didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">MW: You didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">MF: We didn't know, because we were separated in Auschwitz, and the men went to different, and women went to different direction.</span> <span id="s607">At that time, from what I found out later, she was already in Germany, in Bergen-Belsen, that famous death camp, you know.</span> <span id="s608">That's where Reagan is supposed to go and visit and lay a wreath.</span> <span id="s609">That's where she was liberated.</span> <span id="s610">But we didn't know nothing about her by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">MW: So, from the coal mine you went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">MF: To, there's a famous camp, it's called Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">MW: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">MF: M-A-T-H-A-U-S-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">MW: M-A-T-...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">MF: H-A-U-S-A-N.</span> <span id="s617">Just like you say it.</span> <span id="s618">[Mauthausen]</span></p> <p><span id="s619">MW: Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s621">And this was also like a transit camp, you know, temporarily from where they sent you, to other places.</span> <span id="s622">It was a type of camp like Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s623">It was a death camp.</span> <span id="s624">But many people got, you know, gassed there and killed and shot.</span> <span id="s625">When they evacuated us from that coal mine camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s626">MW: How did you get from the coal mine to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">MF: We had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">MW: And how long was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">MF: We must have walked at least for 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">MW: Without any rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">MF: Without food or water.</span> <span id="s632">We got very sick.</span> <span id="s633">So many people got sick on the, you know, people were eating the snow, because it was cold weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">MW: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s635">MF: And people were, you know, in order to sustain themselves, they took up a hand of snow and eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">MW: How were you dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">MF: Minimal, we were wearing the same clothes.</span> <span id="s638">And they, you know, we were wearing wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s639">It was impossible to walk for so many miles.</span> <span id="s640">And, you know, there were so many people who were dropping off on the road, and whoever couldn't walk any more.</span> <span id="s641">And they'd shoot them and throw them into the ravine on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">MW: What went through your mind on this walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">MF: Well, what went through my mind is that sooner or later it's gonna happen to me, because so many people couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s644">So, you know, what they were trying to do is finish us off slowly, so they don't have to, so many people in the way.</span> <span id="s645">Because, you know, there was a war going on and they had to move on.</span> <span id="s646">And they had to pull back and they didn't want the Allies should come in and see all the atrocities what they did.</span> <span id="s647">So they were trying to, you know, finish us off.</span> <span id="s648">And somehow that's what happened at that time.</span> <span id="s649">And then we came into that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">MW: When was this that you came to Mauthausen?</span> <span id="s651">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">MF: This must have been in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">MW: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">MF: First, you see, they marched us to a train for about 24 hours.</span> <span id="s655">Then they put us in into those open boxcars, and it was freezing and snowing.</span> <span id="s656">And the people were dying out slowly.</span> <span id="s657">Slowly they were killing us.</span> <span id="s658">And they took us with those boxcars into Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s659">In Mauthausen they left us outside, on the, I don't know, somehow they found pur--you know, on--I think it was on purpose, ways of getting rid of us, slowly, because of the conditions.</span> <span id="s660">Like when they brought us to Mauthausen, they left standing outside in the cold for 24 hours, while they were set--they were calling it delousing for the, you know, to clean us up from the camp before.</span> <span id="s661">It was completely unnecessary you know, in order to go to a shower, we had to stand in line for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s662">And we had hardly any clothing on, and the people were just dying slowly, you know, falling on the side.</span> <span id="s663">And whoever survived, survived.</span> <span id="s664">And, what happened at that, it was an ironic thing.</span> <span id="s665">You know, everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s666">They weren't giving us any food or water, anything.</span> <span id="s667">So, they, I don't know, either it was for, meant for to be for cows' food, or they were cooking this.</span> <span id="s668">There was laying, you know, like a pile of, they c--they used to call it, I don't know what they call this here.</span> <span id="s669">It's a, sort of vegetable.</span> <span id="s670">And they feed cows, and they also make sugar out of it, sugar beets.</span> <span id="s671">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">MW: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">MF: Those big ones.</span> <span id="s674">And there was a pile of it laying.</span> <span id="s675">It was all frozen, you know, because the cold.</span> <span id="s676">And that's what people tried to eat.</span> <span id="s677">And when they ate this, they got diarrhea.</span> <span id="s678">And they were dying off, hundreds of them, over night.</span> <span id="s679">And finally, after we got through this, so we thought we're gonna go to a better place.</span> <span id="s680">Then they sent us to a place that's called Ebensee.</span> <span id="s681">That was the last camp, where I was liberated from.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">MW: When were you sent there?</span> <span id="s683">How long were you at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s684">I mean, at...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">MF: In Mauthausen...</span></p> <p><span id="s686">MW: Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">MF: We were only I think a very short time, maybe a week or ten days.</span> <span id="s688">And so many of us, the ones that did go to Mauthausen, never came out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">MW: You and your father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">MF: We did, yeah.</span> <span id="s691">They send us to Ebensee, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">MW: How did you get to Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">MF: Also on boxcars.</span> <span id="s694">I really don't remember whether boxcars, or we walked, but it's one of the two, for sure, nothing better.</span> <span id="s695">And when we got there, this was really, that, in that Ebensee was really a death camp.</span> <span id="s696">Because over there, there wasn't really anything to do.</span> <span id="s697">It was a camp just to try and finish off the people.</span> <span id="s698">Because like, if they would take us out to the railroads, to the sidings of the railroads, so what they would make us do is take a pile of old, rusty steel, move it from one place to the other, just to keep us busy, keep us occupied.</span> <span id="s699">Even though that we were all, you know, weak, and sick, unhealthy, and you know, physically and mentally deteriorated, but just so they, they keep us occupied so we can't think, so we couldn't think and not organize you know, an uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">MW: Was there any resistance that you were aware of throughout this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">MF: Yes, there was resistance I remember.</span> <span id="s702">You know, the, in Auschwitz, there were people that worked in those gas chambers, in the ovens, that planned, you know, to rise up.</span> <span id="s703">And they, as a matter of fact they killed a few Germans.</span> <span id="s704">But it was always crushed, and quelled as resistance, because there was so many people that were spying and they would tell them.</span> <span id="s705">And they caught them.</span> <span id="s706">But there was resistance, very small resistance, not to the point like it was in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s707">You see, Warsaw Ghetto was an organized resistance.</span> <span id="s708">But in all through the years, I, we were, we would hear here and there about resistance, but it wasn't strong enough.</span> <span id="s709">They didn't give you a chance, you see.</span> <span id="s710">They were always planning to keep us so busy thinking about food, you know--the main thing in sustaining yourself and of trying to survive was to get some food.</span> <span id="s711">And as long as they kept us occupied in trying to organize a little food, we couldn't think about an uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">MW: So you had more primary needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s714">That's all anybody was interested in, is to try to get by from one day to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">MW: What did you do in Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">MF: In Ebensee, I remember, I got sick.</span> <span id="s717">I got an abscess here on the side, you know, an infection, and they put us into a hospital.</span> <span id="s718">"Hospital" it was called--where there was four people in a bed, in a bunk bed.</span> <span id="s719">And in each bunk was four people.</span> <span id="s720">And my father got sick too.</span> <span id="s721">My father got sick before me, and we were separated.</span> <span id="s722">And we were in the hospital together for a while.</span> <span id="s723">And I don't know what happened, whether he got well and they sent him out, and I never saw my father again after that.</span> <span id="s724">And I kept asking people, and they thought that he had died in the camp, in the hospital, but I never saw him after the liberation.</span> <span id="s725">But, was a..</span> <span id="s726">.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">MW: So your father did not survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">MF: Did not survive.</span> <span id="s729">But was an ironic thing, because when I was in that bunk beds, in the hospital, every night I would feel all of a sudden that I am cold, and then this person next to me would be dead.</span> <span id="s730">And within one week, I remember, they must have removed from there four or five bodies from the two bunks that I was in.</span> <span id="s731">Like if there was two bunks, so in each bunk was four people, plus four under the bed.</span> <span id="s732">And every time, when I was so, feel cold, I were, there was a dead body in the bed.</span> <span id="s733">They would remove him and leave us.</span> <span id="s734">And, that's when a--that was already the last straw.</span> <span id="s735">I felt that next I would be.</span> <span id="s736">And that's when the Americans came to liberate.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">MW: That was in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">MF: In '45, May...</span></p> <p><span id="s739">MW: And how long...</span></p> <p><span id="s740">MF: May 5th.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">MW: Were you in Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">MF: Till the Liberation, since 19--the end of 1944 till May, 1945.</span> <span id="s743">I would say about six months.</span> <span id="s744">You didn't have to be long there, not to be able to get out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">MW: What was that like when the Americans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">MF: It was like a, like seeing a Messiah.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">MW: Before they came, how did the Germans deal with the fact that they were losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">MF: Well, they'd never, they would never admit it.</span> <span id="s749">They were always, you know, so proud and, you know, hardheaded.</span> <span id="s750">But we had a feeling, you know, that things were going bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">MW: How did you get that feeling?</span> <span id="s752">Where did, how, where?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">MF: Well, they, they start losing control of the camp.</span> <span id="s754">And, how?</span> <span id="s755">Because some of, some of the soldiers, they, you know, when they ran away they, what do you call them...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">MW: Desert...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">MF: The deserter, you know, they would throw away their uniforms and then because they were, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s758">They knew that it was, that the day of judgment was coming.</span> <span id="s759">So they would throw away their uniforms and just mix with the, you know, civilian people out there after.</span> <span id="s760">And then the ones that still didn't believe it, they were such a, so hardheaded, what happened is since the German, I mean, since the Americans, we saw the Americans from where I was in that hospital.</span> <span id="s761">It was not far from the main road, and we looked, and we saw the American tanks coming down the hill into the camp--a day before [unclear].</span> <span id="s762">So, when we saw that, we started, you know, hey, hey you have to have the strength to stand up.</span> <span id="s763">So we started to dance and jump and sing.</span> <span id="s764">You know, the Americans were coming.</span> <span id="s765">When the Americans came in, it was just like, you know, feeling like you're born again.</span> <span id="s766">And those Germans that stayed on, they got killed off by the, by, you know, by the people from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">MW: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">MF: The ones that were strong enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">MW: How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">MF: They just grabbed them and beat them, and threw them, and cut their heads off, you know.</span> <span id="s771">Because, I'm sure that Jews didn't do this, but you know, there were so many other people from European countries like the Serbs, Yugoslavians, who were interned over there, the Poles.</span> <span id="s772">And the, they grabbed all those also the people that were in charge like they called them the kapos, they killed them off.</span> <span id="s773">They killed others off.</span> <span id="s774">And right away took revenge.</span> <span id="s775">Besides the people were so removed from civilization, that doing something like that would mean nothing.</span> <span id="s776">You know, we were dealing with death all the time.</span> <span id="s777">It would mean nothing to take a knife and cut somebody up or kill somebody, because we were just away from everything.</span> <span id="s778">We did nothing, and we didn't see nothing but death and destruction for so many years.</span> <span id="s779">Life didn't mean much to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">MW: Yours or some--anyone else's.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">MF: Yes, but I wouldn't have the strength, you see.</span> <span id="s782">I was, I was so weak that I couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s783">But, you know, the ones that were strong, were healthy, they would do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">MW: What helped you to keep your will alive to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">MF: Well, of course everybody wants to live, there's no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">MW: That's not true.</span> <span id="s787">People in those conditions committed suicide or did things that would endanger themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">MF: Not that many, not that many, not that happened in my experience.</span> <span id="s789">I mean, in my case.</span> <span id="s790">I think the main thing is what kept me alive is to be able, even if nobody else, to be able to tell the horrible experiences we went through, and to sustain the Jewish heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">MW: That's why you're here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">MW: To do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">MW: Did you think it, while you were in the experience itself that in the future you would feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">MF: No.</span> <span id="s797">When I first was liberated, you know, I said to myself, "Where is God?"</span> <span id="s798">There is no God.</span> <span id="s799">I mean, to leave me alone, a young child, without a mother, without a father, without any family.</span> <span id="s800">But I didn't know that my sister was survived.</span> <span id="s801">I didn't find her till about, I think, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">MW: Tell me, when you were liberated, you knew that your father was dead at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">MF: I didn't, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">MW: You just...</span></p> <p><span id="s805">MF: I didn't, I..</span> <span id="s806">.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">MW: You didn't know his whereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">MF: Thought, I was hoping that I'm gonna find him.</span> <span id="s809">I didn't.</span> <span id="s810">But when I saw the days were going by and I didn't find him, and I talked to people that knew him, you know, and everybody gave me a different version of the, there's no use.</span> <span id="s811">I was hoping that I would find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">MW: How old were you at the time of the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">MF: I must have been 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">MW: 14.</span> <span id="s815">And what, tell me about that.</span> <span id="s816">Did they, the Americans came in in tanks...</span></p> <p><span id="s817">MF: In tanks, and they, of course, I don't know at the time if the American force knew how to deal with us.</span> <span id="s818">And, you know, all the people that were healthy enough, that could get out, they jumped on the tanks, and they jumped on the Americans and they were kissing or hugging as the liberators.</span> <span id="s819">And actually, you know, to us, the Americans at the time were like we saw God.</span> <span id="s820">And they were trying to help us, but they didn't have much experience in how to deal with us.</span> <span id="s821">So what happened, so many, well, first of all when they came into our camp, there were hundreds and hundreds of bodies piled up, dead bodies, that they didn't have a chance to cremate.</span> <span id="s822">And among the bodies, what is an interesting story, you now, we were together afterwards, the Israeli--not the Israeli, the English army had a British brigade, I mean a Jewish brigade it was called.</span> <span id="s823">And this Jewish brigade right away started to smuggle Jewish children from the camps; a month after this happened we were liberated I think to Italy and then to Israel.</span> <span id="s824">So, so what they were doing is trying to put the young children together and then smuggle them out.</span> <span id="s825">And amon--in our group was a boy that was found by the American army in one of the piles of the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s826">He was one of those.</span> <span id="s827">He was dead already.</span> <span id="s828">When they found him, he was still breathing, so they revived him.</span> <span id="s829">And eventually he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s830">He was my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">MW: And you didn't go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">MF: I didn't, I wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">MW: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">MF: I was in Italy, and at that time was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s835">MW: So the Americans smuggled you, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">MF: The--no it was the Americans liberated us.</span> <span id="s837">And they--the--before that was, you know, this is gonna be--are you going to edit this, or is it...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">MW: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">MF: Leave it as it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">MW: We have about five to eight minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">MF: O.K.</span> <span id="s842">When the Americans liberated us in Austria in that camp, they didn't know how to deal with us, because, you know, it was an experience that, you know, only happens once in a lifetime.</span> <span id="s843">And they came in and they started to give us food and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s844">And we wanted a lot to eat because, you know, they had to do it slowly, in a slow way, because our bodies weren't used to that shock--food right away.</span> <span id="s845">And they gave us food and you know, so many of us got diarrhea and we were dying out, because we got diphtheria.</span> <span id="s846">They got different sicknesses from stomach.</span> <span id="s847">So, when they saw this, they stopped feeding us.</span> <span id="s848">And they were giving us just rice.</span> <span id="s849">And then they built, field hospitals all throughout the camp.</span> <span id="s850">And they put most of the people that got sick into those field hospitals.</span> <span id="s851">And that, that's how I survived.</span> <span id="s852">Otherwise I would have been dead too.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">MW: In a field hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">MF: Field hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">MW: And then you were taken to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">MF: And then, after that field, after I got well, in about a month, I was still walking with a cane.</span> <span id="s857">I couldn't walk...</span></p> <p><span id="s858">MW: You were in the hospital for a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">MF: Yeah, in an American field hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">MW: Had...</span></p> <p><span id="s861">MF: At the time we didn't think they were good to us because they were with holding food, because that's all we wanted was food.</span> <span id="s862">But that was for the best, because they knew that the food would kill us.</span> <span id="s863">So they started to give us medicine and everything.</span> <span id="s864">And the, you know, the younger people like me, they survived.</span> <span id="s865">And a lot of them died in the camps over there, in those field hospitals too, because, you know, they were just too far gone.</span> <span id="s866">They couldn't save them.</span> <span id="s867">And then I was in that hospital for a month and then I walked out one day on the street.</span> <span id="s868">And I ran into a couple people from our city.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">MW: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">MF: A couple brothers.</span> <span id="s871">In Germany, in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s872">I went out to, from the camp.</span> <span id="s873">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s874">MW: And you ran into some people who were...</span></p> <p><span id="s875">MF: That were in the camp with us, you know, because I never knew--saw nobody, because I was separated for a month from everybody.</span> <span id="s876">I didn't see anybody after the liberation.</span> <span id="s877">And I met them, we talked to them, and then I went back to camp.</span> <span id="s878">And we got word, you know, that the British army, which is the--was the Jewish brigade, was coming.</span> <span id="s879">They were taking the younger children away to Italy.</span> <span id="s880">They smuggled them through the border.</span> <span id="s881">What they did is put us into trucks, covered them up, and they would say that this is army troops in there.</span> <span id="s882">And the--but the idea was to smuggle them to Italy and put them on ships, and send them to Israel.</span> <span id="s883">You know, that wasn't legal.</span> <span id="s884">The illegal way, they were gonna do it.</span> <span id="s885">But, you remember that's how we had the Cyprus, they sent to Cyprus all those illegal ships.</span> <span id="s886">And I was supposed to be on one of the legal ships.</span> <span id="s887">Was 1500 that went from Italy that time.</span> <span id="s888">And I didn't get on to it, and I was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s889">And then on a--I got in contact with relatives from the United States, and they persuaded me to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">MW: And what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">MF: In '49.</span> <span id="s892">I stayed in Italy, by the way, four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">MW: How did you support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">MF: Oh, we were in camps that were supported...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">MW: DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">MF: DP camps, yes.</span> <span id="s897">Supported by UNRRA, was called, United Nations Emergency Relief or something [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration].</span></p> <p><span id="s898">MW: And you came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">MW: And, in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">MF: '49.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">MW: And you went to California?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">MF: No, I came to New York, because my relatives were living in New York.</span> <span id="s904">And I lived in New York for about a, oh, about a year.</span> <span id="s905">And I worked there.</span> <span id="s906">I got a job and I went to school and I learned the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">MW: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">MF: And then my sister emigrated and, she was liberated in Germany and she went to live in Sweden.</span> <span id="s909">You know, the Swedes took a lot of people from the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">MW: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">MF: So she went to live in Sweden, and I found her in 1946 by, through the Red Cross sent a list of people that were all over, and she w--her name was on that list.</span> <span id="s912">And we got in touch with each other and she came to visit me as a matter of fact, from Sweden to Italy.</span> <span id="s913">And I emigrated from Italy to the United States in '49.</span> <span id="s914">And then she followed me in about a year.</span> <span id="s915">[To someone else:] I'll be through in two minutes.</span> <span id="s916">Yes.</span> <span id="s917">And she followed me to the United States, and we both lived in New York.</span> <span id="s918">We both had jobs and we worked, both were going to school.</span> <span id="s919">And I, and she, a fellow came that met her in New York, and he said, "Why don't you,"--that was living here already, also a survivor, my brother-in-law now.</span> <span id="s920">And he said, "Why don't you come and live in California.</span> <span id="s921">It's so nice here," and all that.</span> <span id="s922">We decided to move to California.</span> <span id="s923">And she got married the same year.</span> <span id="s924">And I was working in California; I had a job and I went to school and I graduated from high school, from night high school.</span> <span id="s925">And I went to college, also night school for a couple years.</span> <span id="s926">And eventually I met my wife in 1954.</span> <span id="s927">She is also a daughter of a survivor, and she was also herself in the camp.</span> <span id="s928">She lost her mother and her brother in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">MW: And you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">MF: Yes.</span>

are very thankful to the United States.</span> <span id="s938">Because, we made something out of ourselves being here.</span> <span id="s939">We were able to help Israel too, because we were in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">MW: Well, thank you very much for sharing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">MF: I hope it'll be useful, and whatever I said.</span></p> <p><span
