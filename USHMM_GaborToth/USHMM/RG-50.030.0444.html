Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Okay, that’s August 27th, 1997.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: No, no, that’s okay, I can add that.</span> <span id="s17">Well, I have many questions for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I’m so glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And I guess I’ll start out by just asking you to talk and reflect a little bit about your childhood, and yo -- did you grow up in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born in Vienna, and I had three siblings.</span> <span id="s21">I was the youngest, and I lived in Vienna, but from ’32 to ’36 I was in Paris, and lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s22">And then I went back because I married a friend of mine whom I knew only 11 years.</span> <span id="s23">So we decided to marry.</span> <span id="s24">And I loved to be in Paris, of course, it was a wonderful experience as a young Viennese.</span> <span id="s25">People liked the Viennese people.</span> <span id="s26">They hated -- the French people hated the Germans, but they liked the Viennese, so I was lucky, and had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s27">I was working there, because one could only take little money there.</span> <span id="s28">I could live only three months of the money which I’ve taken with me.</span> <span id="s29">So I started es -- I wanted to stay longer than three months, and I started as soon as possible to earn money to stay longer.</span> <span id="s30">And so I stayed longer, I went always in summer back to Vienna, and also f -- I went skiing, and met my friends for Christmas, and then in summer I went also -- I really did a lot of mountaineering, summer and winter, fall and spring, all the time we were on the mountains as youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Well tell -- tell me a little bit about that and growing up in Vienna again.</span> <span id="s32">What was it like being a child in Vienna?</span> <span id="s33">Do you -- was it -- was it a -- was it a -- a memorable childhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: -- do you remember many things?</span> <span id="s36">What are some of the things you remember most about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Of course, first was school, and I was six years in the gymnasium where you learn Latin and I think at that time we learned English there.</span> <span id="s38">I feel I had a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s39">We had many friends and it was of -- was, of course, very different to what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s40">We didn’t -- we’re not allowed to go in a nightclub, or outside.</span> <span id="s41">We always had some sis -- parties, some parties at home, so that was with -- really lovely.</span> <span id="s42">We had a big apartment, and as we were four, we had many friends, and we [indecipherable] parents loved also to entertain, so we had to always saw the friends at home.</span> <span id="s43">My -- first, of course, I was not as much in the mountains, but when I grow up as a -- and had friends.</span> <span id="s44">If we -- if I say boyfriend, it does not mean like here that you sleep with them.</span> <span id="s45">S-S -- ju -- it was everything very platonic, and -- but we had many friends, and with them we went to theater, or to the concert, or weekend to the mountains.</span> <span id="s46">That’s -- I loved the mountains, and the f -- a-and whether it was skiing or rock climbing, everything was lovely for us, and for me.</span> <span id="s47">Then, after my six years of gymnasium, I decided to become a photographer, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: How old were you then?</span> <span id="s49">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: 16, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Just a minute.</span> <span id="s53">It was six, 11 -- no, seven, seven -- 17.</span> <span id="s54">Because five class -- five were ca -- public school, that means the lower classes, and then there for six years in the gymnasium, that’s 11 years, and you started with six years, so that was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: And first I worked at a photographer, and then I went to a school where I learned about photography and printing and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And what pro -- what drew you into -- what attracted you to photography?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I think it’s -- we always have taken pictures, and then I met somebody, a photographer, who talked about it, and suddenly I decided I’d rather to go two more years and to make my [indecipherable] as to go to study photography.</span> <span id="s59">But then, I admit my -- it was called master exam for photography, it’s not like here master.</span> <span id="s60">I was first an apprentice.</span> <span id="s61">It goes like -- I don’t know how you call it here, you know?</span> <span id="s62">And then I made my master for photography, and I worked at the photographer.</span> <span id="s63">Then -- I always have taken exercises.</span> <span id="s64">Not only me, everyone in Vienna had, Mother and everyone has taken exercises, and my teacher said, you’re so gifted, why don’t you study to be an exercise teacher?</span> <span id="s65">So I propose this to my father, who was horrified.</span> <span id="s66">You never will need to work, you will marry and never will need to work again.</span> <span id="s67">And now you have photographer, for what do you want to study to be a exercise teacher?</span> <span id="s68">Luckily, my brother-in-law, Dr. Felix Fleischner talked for me, he was all for it, said I st-study what I want, and luckily Father agreed.</span> <span id="s69">He had to agree because one has to pay, of course.</span> <span id="s70">And I studied to be a phot -- exercise teacher and got my diploma in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: When was this, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: The diploma, ach, I have it somewhere.</span> <span id="s73">Let me think.</span> <span id="s74">Six, 17, that was [inaudible] 24 - 25, probably ’29.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: ’29?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Nine, cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What year were you born, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: 1907?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: In seven, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, I will have my 90th birthday this year in November.</span> <span id="s83">I can’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You don’t look like you’re about to have your 90th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, I will look like 102, but I am not.</span> <span id="s86">Anyway, then, when I made my diploma, I worked for [indecipherable] photography, and I worked as an exercise teacher, after I have the diploma.</span> <span id="s87">In Vienna you have to have a diploma, not like here that everyone can put out her shingle without ever learned anything.</span> <span id="s88">And also, where you teach, it was -- somebody came to look whether it is the proper place to teach.</span> <span id="s89">Whether it’s clean enough, whether it has the shower and so on.</span> <span id="s90">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you need to get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: [indecipherable] [tape break] -- is not a nurse, but she was with my sister [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: And she calls sometimes, see how everything is.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Ah, oh.</span> <span id="s96">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Is settle.</span> <span id="s98">Do you have it on?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s100">Do you want me to turn it off?</span> <span id="s101">[tape break].</span> <span id="s102">Continuing.</span> <span id="s103">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I love to teach exercises, and too, I was very happy to start in Vienna with it, and I was also teaching like we have here, the st -- ca -- for instance, the Cambridge Center for Adult Education.</span> <span id="s105">So there were in Vienna [indecipherable] which were really started to make grandfather of the brother-in-law of mine, of Hartman, and I was teaching, for instance in the Luderhatte mon volksheim.</span> <span id="s106">And I probably did not work the whole day from morning evening, that I don’t remember, but I enjoyed to work, and to do things and of course weekend we always went away, a group of people.</span> <span id="s107">We were several who always met in the train and we went someplace.</span> <span id="s108">Then, in ’32, I got the chance to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s109">It was -- as I say, it was three months.</span> <span id="s110">I had some money and I loved to go to Paris, also to practice my French.</span> <span id="s111">We had always as children, when we were young, we had a governess very long, and then a French teacher, who went also with us at -- in summer for vacation.</span> <span id="s112">I think she learned more German than we learned French, but it was a possibility to learn French.</span> <span id="s113">And so I went to Paris, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Well yeah, okay, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s115">We -- we can -- let -- let me just ask you one specific thing about --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: -- about Vienna when you were a child.</span> <span id="s118">You know, in doing some reading about the history of anti-Semitism in Austria, there is quite a bit of history going back to long before you were born, and I’m just wondering, y-you’re describing us a ch -- an -- a nice, a pleasant childhood, do -- did you -- were there things when you were a little girl, I mean, before the anschluss that you noticed?</span> <span id="s119">I mean, were there -- did your grandfather have problems, did your parents have problems, did you have any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Never.</span> <span id="s121">Never.</span> <span id="s122">We had always also some Gentile friends, who went with us to mountains, we were invited.</span> <span id="s123">Everything went -- we -- I never felt an anti-Semitisms.</span> <span id="s124">I -- i-in fact grew up, my father was very religious.</span> <span id="s125">I was not allowed to write on Saturday at school, we had school at Saturday.</span> <span id="s126">And there was another girl who was not allowed to write.</span> <span id="s127">So there were never given written examinations on Saturday because we didn’t write.</span> <span id="s128">But there was never -- I never felt any anti-Semitisms as long we were there, til Hitler came.</span> <span id="s129">We were very lucky this way, we had always, as I say, Gentile friends, and in fact, our Jewish friends had very nice Gentile friends whom they married after Hitler to -- to go out with them.</span> <span id="s130">That -- to emigrate with them.</span> <span id="s131">So we were really a mixed group.</span> <span id="s132">More Jews than Gentile, but we were mix and I never suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you hear of anyone, any Jewish friends or -- or acquaintances, or even people you had heard about who had a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Only, for instance at the university.</span> <span id="s135">It was very hard for my brother-in-law, who was an x-ray doctor, Roentgenologist.</span> <span id="s136">He was only [indecipherable] and not -- could not become professor.</span> <span id="s137">Then there was, at the university, a Jewish professor, m-my husband’s uncle was professor of neurology.</span> <span id="s138">But that was really seldom that a Jew got a professorship.</span> <span id="s139">That I knew, that I heard.</span> <span id="s140">But otherwise I really never personally felt it, that the anti-Semitism was -- I knew it was there, but I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s141">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Ho-How did you know it was there?</span> <span id="s143">How di -- how were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: For instance, about this university, and then, now I try to think.</span> <span id="s145">I really -- I don’t remember anything special before Hitler --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: -- that is -- but I d -- I knew that there is anti-Semitisms.</span> <span id="s148">I try to remember, but I don’t know, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Were there stories, Mrs. Karplus, at that time of -- of Jewish families wanting to assimilate and in some cases actually convert?</span> <span id="s150">Wa-Was there -- were there conversions to Christianity going on i-in the desire to assimilate, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, not much.</span> <span id="s152">No, except that many, many who were not at all religious.</span> <span id="s153">For instance, we three sisters married three men who were not at all religious, but they -- they didn’t convert, I mean, and my husband said always for a joke he would never convert.</span> <span id="s154">Maybe, if he would fall in love with a woman, then he would co -- he would convert, but no-nobody I knew.</span> <span id="s155">That doesn’t say it didn’t exist, but nobody I knew converted.</span> <span id="s156">We all -- they assimilated really, very much.</span> <span id="s157">My father came what was afterwards Poland, at that time when he was born it was still Austria.</span> <span id="s158">But he was very religious, and that was really seldom that si -- si -- that one is so religious.</span> <span id="s159">More -- all my friends were really assimilated, and not at all -- and had Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So they weren’t practicing or observant in that -- in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, but re -- Christmas tree didn’t mean to us a Catholic festivity.</span> <span id="s162">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: M-More of a cultural</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: -- cultural, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: -- or a national --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s168">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: [indecipherable] again and again.</span> <span id="s170">And so, for instance, all of my in-laws had Christmas trees, and my -- and my mother-in-law, everyone had.</span> <span id="s171">But -- but we did not have it at home, because Father was Jewish religious, so we didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s172">In fact we had a kosher house, and we kept it as youngster, but then, more and more, we kept it less.</span> <span id="s173">But at first real -- we really ke -- were -- also tr-tried to do everything my father and mother wanted to do.</span> <span id="s174">We kept all the -- for -- for instance, all the holidays, Jewish holidays at home.</span> <span id="s175">So, as a youngster, I really did not suffer by anti-Semitism, was -- and we were very lucky probably, our group of people, because we were mix in, as I said.</span> <span id="s176">Two of my very good friends had Gentile friends and then they married them, so s -- they went together out from the -- Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And when you were a child with your -- with your father being o-observant, did you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: We went to synagogue when the parents were there, to visit, of course.</span> <span id="s179">We visited Mother, because it was -- sometime it was also separated, the men and the women in -- in one of the temple after [indecipherable] not.</span> <span id="s180">So we always went there to visit Mother, when she was af -- there.</span> <span id="s181">Father was probably more in the temple than Mother, but Mother also observed with -- with Father, and -- but a-as a little child, I felt also religious, but then less and less.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And how did -- what -- what kind of feeling was that as a little child, to -- to be religious as a child?</span> <span id="s183">Do you remember the feeling you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: It was -- I try to remember.</span> <span id="s185">It was quite of course, to go up as a little, little one with it.</span> <span id="s186">You know, it was quite of course that we thought like our parents were thinking.</span> <span id="s187">And this was so tradition to have all the holidays.</span> <span id="s188">And at -- probably felt myself religious because I wouldn’t have touched what wasn’t allowed, for instance, ham.</span> <span id="s189">I wouldn’t touch.</span> <span id="s190">I would not, never as a youngster, eat what I was not allowed to eat for the religious reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So that everything was kosher in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah, in my family, my family, but not -- one friend of my sister’s family was also kosher, but otherwise all our friends were not religious at all, brought up.</span> <span id="s193">They were conscious Jews, I think, but not religious.</span> <span id="s194">In general, they were very assimilated, really.</span> <span id="s195">We all felt Viennese, and not Jewish Viennese.</span> <span id="s196">We didn’t emphasize the Jews in -- but we felt very Viennese, of course, growing up there, and living there, and we loved Vienna.</span> <span id="s197">So, I am sorry I can’t say -- I mean, I think I only accepted what my parents expected from us children.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What many children --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: -- most children do.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: At that time.</span> <span id="s202">And then, afterwards, I mean when I was maybe 16 or 17 years old, I -- I felt different.</span> <span id="s203">I felt that it is really some of the things I didn’t want to accept.</span> <span id="s204">For instance, I wasn’t allowed to ring the bell when I came home the apartment.</span> <span id="s205">To me it was much more work to knock than ringing the bell like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Was this every day, or just on Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Every day.</span> <span id="s208">We were not allowed to ring the -- oh, excuse me, that -- that was a good question of you and a bad answer of me.</span> <span id="s209">It -- yes, it probably was only si -- as -- as -- as -- Saturday Shabbes, you are right.</span> <span id="s210">It was not the whole week.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: But -- but it mu-must have seemed like more, because you remembered it as every day, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, it is a few years ago, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: A couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: -- it’s [indecipherable] and my memory doesn’t get better.</span> <span id="s215">I mean, my si -- one sister had the wonderful memory and I never had the good memory and it didn’t get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Well, it seems pretty good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, no, it didn’t get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Well, let -- let me ask you a little bit about -- now, your -- your father and -- and his work, and -- and did his work allow you all to have a -- a comfortable lifestyle --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: -- or was it a difficult one?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Most of the time father -- we had the very good life.</span> <span id="s222">We had piano lessons and basic French and the English, and the -- and Mother had every day a hairdresser coming, and everything -- that was like that in Vienna.</span> <span id="s223">So we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Uh-huh, and domestic help, did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: And dom -- of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Maids and cooks?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: -- two domestic help.</span> <span id="s228">We had the lovely apartment we had and that means we moved from a smaller apartment to a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s229">You had to buy the apartment and Father could do it.</span> <span id="s230">And he really gave us all the opportunities to learn and to come and go.</span> <span id="s231">He was not delighted that I spent so much money when we went skiing when I was older.</span> <span id="s232">When -- I went skiing because that cost money, the train.</span> <span id="s233">And there he was not -- he thought that I spend too much money on the -- for the train, for the -- but to me it was important.</span> <span id="s234">And my future husband, who was always with us, had in fact a ticket for nothing because he had the high pos-position in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s235">So he had, for all the trains, if he wanted first class, to go first class, wherever he wanted, he had the ticket.</span> <span id="s236">So for birthday I got sometimes tickets, so to go, so to be able to go every weekend, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And did you all travel, did you take vacations abroad, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Always.</span> <span id="s239">When we were small, Mother went with us vacation.</span> <span id="s240">We went to -- first years always to Salzburg, because Mother’s parents lived there, and we went for summer and also Christmas, we went to Salzburg for our vacation.</span> <span id="s241">Close by -- to Salzburg was a suburban place, and there the parents rented the house, so we went always to this house in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s242">And the most exciting was that we were there at the beginning when Reinhardt started to have the place in Salzburg, because now it is quiet, of course, but my brother was in one of the place, and very little role so we could always go to all the [indecipherable] rehearsals.</span> <span id="s243">So it was wonderful, we knew all then, all the li -- wonderful actor and actresses.</span> <span id="s244">And that was the first year that was played “Jedermann”, by Hoffner -- by Hofmannsthal.</span> <span id="s245">Hofmannsthal was a Viennese and “Jedermann” was a play by him and it was played in front of the beautiful church, a lovely, lovely church.</span> <span id="s246">And we were very proud, of course that our brother was of the stage.</span> <span id="s247">We were very young.</span> <span id="s248">So Salzburg was important.</span> <span id="s249">Afterwards we went to Italy with Mother, and we went to -- where else?</span> <span id="s250">We -- fit -- Italy several times, and always to a beach to swim.</span> <span id="s251">And in the year 1914, we were, for instance in Italy at the beach in Carrado, and then we saw a man going with a drum on the beach, and we children, I was six and a half years -- we children were delighted, but in reality, he announced that the war broke out.</span> <span id="s252">1914 til ’18 was the war.</span> <span id="s253">So, of course, Mother was in despair only to get home.</span> <span id="s254">All she wanted, to get home.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And so this -- you thought this man was making nice music?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, that -- that was lovely for a child, a drum, to go with the drum, and I had no idea, of course, what it was, and then Mother tried to explain to us.</span> <span id="s257">But then it was the first World War, ’14 to ’18, and Austria was, up to then very big, and then it is -- became a very little country, because Hungary left many Romanian born a -- so many countries were taken, were occupied by the -- by the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s258">Austria became a small -- a small country.</span> <span id="s259">But st -- during the war, of course, we suffered very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: During World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Just awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And how is that -- tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: We didn’t get to eat, and you had to stand in line for hours to get, I don’t know how many eggs, maybe two eggs.</span> <span id="s264">And we children went all after school, always standing in line.</span> <span id="s265">And often we had the same dresses, but then we had to be different so that nobody knew that there are three people of a family who wanted to have eggs or meat or bread, I don’t know any more what all, we had to stand in line.</span> <span id="s266">And -- but really for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And now -- but your family was well off --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: -- and yet you still had to stand in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No -- yeah, nobody ha -- nobody h-had the possibility.</span> <span id="s271">Sometimes we got from a uncle, from Mother’s brother, who was in the military, an officer, but that was not only in the war, he was by ch-choice for his life, you know, he went to military academy and so on.</span> <span id="s272">Sometimes he came and brought us something special to eat.</span> <span id="s273">We had only one vegetable, for instance, all that we got for without standing in line.</span> <span id="s274">It was called rote and it is a kind of beet.</span> <span id="s275">I still have the feeling, the taste of it, because we ate every day this beet.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: When’s the last time you had one of those beets?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: But no, I eat a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: But -- but you -- you haven’t -- I was asking you, I wondered if you’ve had any of those beets since then.</span> <span id="s279">I bet you haven’t wanted to taste them.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s281">Never.</span> <span id="s282">Never.</span> <span id="s283">I don’t know whether they are here, I really don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: And you don’t want to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, I’m -- no, I’m not curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: It was really ec -- so that was very hard.</span> <span id="s288">Then, we had no shoes, we had wooden shoes only, there was no leather.</span> <span id="s289">And I [indecipherable] my feet very much with these wooden shoes, because they were so heavy on my skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: So even pe-people or families with means like yours --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Means.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: -- was as -- as if you were poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s294">Yeah, everyone was the same.</span> <span id="s295">That’s it, we co-couldn’t get really enough to eat.</span> <span id="s296">It was very, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Do you remember going to bed hungry as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No, that I don’t remember, because we surely got the roten, the -- the beets.</span> <span id="s299">I don’t remember that I was -- went hungry.</span> <span id="s300">But not -- it was not a pleasure to eat, this was -- we t -- it was not much there to eat.</span> <span id="s301">Yes, anti-Semitisms I met for the first time in Salzburg, that reminds me.</span> <span id="s302">When we went to Salzburg, there was a horrid paper.</span> <span id="s303">It was called Der Sturm, that means storm.</span> <span id="s304">And it was awfully anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s305">And there it was written the family from Albert Pollack, he was -- he had many, many things [indecipherable] and he was high up, you know, from the -- to -- very, very appreciated, he was an [indecipherable] and he was very appreciated in Salzburg then.</span> <span id="s306">It’s hoefe is -- means -- it’s aristocrats.</span> <span id="s307">And there was written the family from Vienna ca-came and eat and ate and ate, and they’ve taken us all the food away.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: O-Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: [indecipherable] accent whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: You were saying, taking all the food away.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Food</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: The food away.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s315">And that -- so, and that’s interesting because there were many Jews in Vienna, but not very many in Salzburg, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: There weren’t in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s317">My -- my grandfather, for instance [indecipherable] his brother, his sister to come.</span> <span id="s318">They were in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Oh, no thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: But you tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Okay, I will, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Is -- they were in Austria, all, and he ask them to come because he loved Salzburg.</span> <span id="s323">And I don’t know whether you know grandfather was a military in Salzburg and loved it, and then he -- when he got through with his military, he rented an apartment and a little shop.</span> <span id="s324">And then he was called to that -- it was some -- I think some Catholic high one who was in charge for Salzburg, and say, don’t you know, no Jew is allowed to settle in Salzburg?</span> <span id="s325">You have to leave right away, and -- and leave your apartment and shop.</span> <span id="s326">So grandfather went away, and talked to the military for whom he worked -- not worked, for whom he was with, and they liked him very much and appreciated him because he was a very good man.</span> <span id="s327">And they talked to this archbishop or whoever he was, and he called grandfather and say -- said come.</span> <span id="s328">You are granted to live here, but you will be the only Jew.</span> <span id="s329">But grandfather did not si -- maybe you have it, grandfather, after a little while his sister came, his brother came and so on.</span> <span id="s330">And then came more and more and more Jews to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s331">And he was wonderful because he was fighting for everything.</span> <span id="s332">They had no rabbi -- rabbi there.</span> <span id="s333">Rabbiner in German.</span> <span id="s334">Rabbi is English, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s335">They had no rabbi there, he had to come.</span> <span id="s336">They had no kosher meat for people who wanted kosher meat.</span> <span id="s337">So he had to -- everything to arrange.</span> <span id="s338">There was no temple, and when they wanted to buy some acres to build the temple, they were not allowed to buy it for that, for temples they were not allowed to buy.</span> <span id="s339">Then -- but one Jew had grounds and said he want to build a temple there, and then it was permitted, if it is not on the side -- close to the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s340">It has to be farther back so that nobody is offended by a temple.</span> <span id="s341">Perhaps the Gentile would be offended if there’s a temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: But they wouldn’t say that about a church?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">Not at all, because as -- they were all Catholic, of course.</span> <span id="s345">So -- but it was built.</span> <span id="s346">And that was hundred year old for -- two or three years ago when I went there.</span> <span id="s347">And so that was celebrated and grandfather was celebrated.</span> <span id="s348">All the time was spoken about Albert Pollack, and I was so proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Well I’m -- I’ve read a little bit about him in this chapter called Jewish life in Austria, and it just says about him -- I don’t know if you’ve seen this, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: -- s -- he was -- “Albert Pollack opened his antique shop and eventually attained prosperity and respect in the city.</span> <span id="s352">He was sought after as a patron by many associations.</span> <span id="s353">Then in 1872 he was the first Jew to acquire citizenship in Salzburg,” as you just said.</span> <span id="s354">And then it says, “Members of the Austrian imperial family were among his customers, and Pollack was honored with the title, Royal and Imperial Supplier of Antiques to the Court of His Majesty and Emperor of Austria.”</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: That’s a pretty --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: -- good title.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: He was very [indecipherable] and he was very liked as a person.</span> <span id="s360">For instance when Jews -- s-strangers I shouldn’t say, you know, when people came who didn’t live in Salzburg, they were always invited for the holidays in the house of my grandfather and grandmother, always.</span> <span id="s361">So, they had only eight children, so it was really bu-bu -- nothing, and he was very well off, because he u-understood a lot about antiques, and the whole family loved antiques, and had also -- many of them had the s-s-stores, antique stores, and dealed with antiques.</span> <span id="s362">Two of my uncles and an aunt, and my mother.</span> <span id="s363">At one point, probably when Father’s business wasn’t so good, she had also an antique shop.</span> <span id="s364">Everyone had antique and of course the apartment had only antique furniture and -- because they all loved antiques.</span> <span id="s365">[indecipherable] Grandfather, who understood a lot, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Going to turn the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: So now we were at my grandfather and we all -- we all grandchildren loved grandfather because he was very gentle and warm and caring.</span> <span id="s369">We had not the same feeling for grandmother, who was a little colder, but very beautiful.</span> <span id="s370">Have you seen pictures of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I will show --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What was her name, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Caroline.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Caroline.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Was Caroline Pollack.</span> <span id="s377">I show you pictures afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s379">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: You [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Let’s -- no, we can si --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I -- I get them now if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Okay, sure, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: -- you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: We’ll pause for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: You know, I -- [tape break].</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay, here we’re looking, and we’ve got the tape recorder on again, and tell me what we’re looking at.</span> <span id="s388">I’m holding a thick postcard in my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: My mother, who was the youngest of eight children, and st -- that’s an aunt of mine, her sister, who was the oldest, with her two children when they were small.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Look at those hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: It’s th -- it’s this one, the girl, the little girl was si -- in concentration camp, and from one concentration camp to the next one, she went.</span> <span id="s392">She really went through a lot, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Is that Mimi?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Mimi, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Ah, I read about her, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s397">And then her brother was a doctor in Vienna, but he committed suicide when Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: By the way, I think he was baptized.</span> <span id="s400">I think.</span> <span id="s401">But oh -- maybe one didn’t know that he is Jewish, he -- and -- but he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s402">But it is so adorable because it’s so old fashioned, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: We have, just to describe this picture, you have the two women, who look very -- almost like twins, don’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: They have the same expression, but they’re sisters, or -- or they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No, ju -- they are sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: They are

wooden chairs, in front of some evergreen trees, it looks like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: -- short needle pine trees on the gravel in front of a house.</span> <span id="s413">There’s a little bit of a iron fence behind.</span> <span id="s414">And when would you say, Mrs. Karplus, that this photo -- photograph was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: It was -- if I would be lucky -- no, it doesn’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: It doesn’t say on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: In the back, but --</span></p> <p><span

often.</span> <span id="s548">I even had to photograph from him -- him, in my folder, you know, my photograph folder where I -- I had to have pictures for my exam.</span> <span id="s549">And he had the office in Vienna and my brother worked also with him, yeah, when he grew up.</span> <span id="s550">And he had also a -- a [indecipherable] associate who worked with him.</span> <span id="s551">And it was in Vienna too, that you came always home for lunch, for a long -- for a long hour, because Father, for instance, we were eating and then he always was lying down.</span> <span id="s552">And that was not only him who was lying down, everyone in Vienna, all the parents were resting after lunch, before they went back to the office.</span> <span id="s553">Very few people, therefore, lived out of Vienna and had houses, we all had apartments because to be close to the office.</span> <span id="s554">My husband, for instance, also walked off -- always to the office, and came home for lunch.</span> <span id="s555">Lunch was our big dinner.</span> <span id="s556">That means the evening we had also plenty to eat, but less.</span> <span id="s557">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Oh well, let me ask you, i-in your father’s textile business, was this finished clothing, or -- or cut cloth that -- that he was importing?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, only en gros, en gros that means the big [indecipherable] of tex -- of textile, of material.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: And they were coming from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: From It -- from Italy and Switzerland I am sure, but now I thought also from England because one gentleman came always from England, I remember, but I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t remember, so I suppose that he also imported, you know, from England, some material.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Now, did he travel also to Switzerland, Italy, and England?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Father?</span> <span id="s565">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: He traveled a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Father traveled, yeah, traveled very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Now did you also -- did your family had property a-abroad at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: No, just -- it’s just in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: We didn’t have prop -- we had only in Vienna, a -- a lovely apartment, looking over a park, si -- one, two, three, four, five rooms in a row, looking on the park and then the living room and dining room were on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s572">But it was really lovely to look, the view was so nice, and the balcony was to the park.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Now let me ask you a little bit about Paris.</span> <span id="s574">What -- why did you decide to go there and what was it like when you got there for those fo -- for those four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: It was the first time that I left Vienna alone and did -- afterwards I realized how good it was for me, because I was always the youngest Sporer girl, and the never -- the sister-in-law of the famous Dr. Felix Fleischner, I never had the feeling I’m Erna Sporer.</span> <span id="s576">And in Paris, of course, I was in the first time alone, the first time I washed my own stockings and underwear, because I was a spoiled brat in Vienna, as we always had somebody to do it.</span> <span id="s577">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Even during World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No, that was ak -- as -- a -- much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Of course, I went to -- ’36 -- no, ’32 to Paris, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s583">No, no, but I mean y-you had people to -- to -- to wa -- even when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah well, all -- all the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: -- during the war you still had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: -- also afterwards --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: -- this is -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: -- we never washed our own laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s590">So you’re -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: But I need to -- I learned to wash my own laundry --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s593">And you’re about 25 years old when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: It would have been ’32?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: -- 20 into ’30 -- ’32, 24 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yeah, in summer I went there.</span> <span id="s599">And I was there three months, th -- I had only money for three months, so -- and I loved to stay longer, of course I had to ask for the permission of my parents because I was too young, I was 24 and a half.</span> <span id="s600">That was for Vienna young, and I had to get permission.</span> <span id="s601">And I went from one photographer to the next one, whether they want to have me.</span> <span id="s602">Finally, I found one who said yes, a German, if I type French, English and German letters.</span> <span id="s603">I said I’m willing to type, but I can only type with two fingers.</span> <span id="s604">But you don’t have to pay me for the overtime, because I need to -- so I worked for him, and that was in spring, I remember.</span> <span id="s605">And then I was very lucky, one day he was sick and so I had to go out to take a photograph, which was on a magazine on the -- on the top, how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: The cover?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Of the cover.</span> <span id="s608">So I was very proud [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Well, do you remember which magazine it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No.</span> <span id="s611">I think Vu, it was called.</span> <span id="s612">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Like a news magazine, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: A news magazine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Do you remember what the picture was about?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: And I worked for him, and then came a friend to Paris, who was really a friend of my older sister, who was already married at that time.</span> <span id="s619">And for him I was always the little Erna, but when he saw me in Paris I was grown up, and he fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s620">And he lived in -- in Spain, and he say, please come and t -- and it’s so beautiful in Spain, Madrid and so on.</span> <span id="s621">So I went to Madrid and spent also some weeks somewhere on a beach, but alone.</span> <span id="s622">And I went on the beach and didn’t know, I saw always men behind me.</span> <span id="s623">And then I learned one can’t go as a woman alone on a beach, that means one invites the men.</span> <span id="s624">And I had no idea, of course.</span> <span id="s625">So of -- I stopped to walk on the beach alone, yeah.</span> <span id="s626">I had no -- I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s627">And then I went back to Paris and there I met at -- my phot -- [indecipherable] photographer, a very nice young lady, who also invited me to go boating with them and so on.</span> <span id="s628">And I wanted to start now with exercises to teach.</span> <span id="s629">So I looked for a place where I can rent it for one hour or so, invited some people, invited some people to watch, and so I started to teach exercises in Paris.</span> <span id="s630">And I earned enough money to live there comfortable, made very good friends.</span> <span id="s631">And as I say, the French people were charming to me, and very nice, and as I loved to teach, and always asked, every year when I came back to -- before I came back in summer to the parents, I always say please, can there be another year?</span> <span id="s632">So I was four years there.</span> <span id="s633">I always had two months at least vacation, and then I’ve taken another studio again, where I was teaching.</span> <span id="s634">And then in -- four years later, in ni -- i-in ’36, my husband proposed that we should marry.</span> <span id="s635">So I always loved him, so it was easy for me to say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: In Paris.</span> <span id="s638">He wrote me every second day, a shorthand letter.</span> <span id="s639">His family, Karplus, always wrote only shorthand to each other, so I had to learn shorthand before I left, but I wasn’t as fluent.</span> <span id="s640">And as he wrote me every second day, I -- I was already -- the second day I wasn’t ready for the next letter.</span> <span id="s641">And so I went back to Vienna, but my pupils were terrific, when I said I will marry I got the most beautiful wedding gifts in Paris already, from my friends and pupils.</span> <span id="s642">And went back to Vienna and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Were you married in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: With all your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: A very small wedding.</span> <span id="s649">I mean, here everyone has it elaborate.</span> <span id="s650">I ha -- we had only the closest family.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And was -- is he from Vienna, also, was he from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: He, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: He was born in Vienna, and his father was a lawyer and my husband studied also law, but not to be a lawyer, only to be a good executive.</span> <span id="s655">To be a lawyer in Vienna at that time you had to study law, then to be seven years in a law firm before you’re allowed to be a lawyer, to open up your own office.</span> <span id="s656">But he never thought of being a lawyer.</span> <span id="s657">O -- really he studied only law to be a good executive.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s659">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: And then he --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Oh, let me just ask you, now yo -- when you -- you were married then in ’36 in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: And your -- your parents were happy about -- they -- they liked that he -- that -- they all get along, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s665">Everyone liked him.</span> <span id="s666">During the time I was away they were all the time in touch with him, and in fact he helped one of my sisters who had a -- opened a -- for children, a nurser -- nursery, and he helped her.</span> <span id="s667">They were always in touch with each other, and they all liked him.</span> <span id="s668">And then we were there til ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Now let me -- before you get into ’38, let me just ask you a little bit about those years from ’36 to ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: First of all, what was it like being back in Vienna?</span> <span id="s672">What was your life, your daily routine like, i -- did you work as the -- still exercise teaching and photographer?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, yeah, I was, yeah.</span> <span id="s674">Very little, but I did teach exercises.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And your husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: -- and of course I have taken exercises, of course.</span> <span id="s677">I have taken acrobatic til I broke my collarbone.</span> <span id="s678">And -- a very leisurely life.</span> <span id="s679">I’ve taken courses at museum, and my husband had always when -- if he wanted tickets for theater for -- because he -- for his position, and he -- weekend we always were in the mountains, of course, and I had a lovely time these two years I was in Vienna, and then we -- we bought [indecipherable] my husband bought the beautiful apartment, and we had it all redone with an architect, and the architect designed all our thing, all our furniture, and that friend who had the factory to make furniture, made it, and we had a lot of friends and always I saw now in this little booklet, even after Hitler, always we saw friends, friends, friends in Vienna.</span> <span id="s680">They were for dinner -- of course we had the maid and cook, so they were for dinner with us, we went for dinner to them.</span> <span id="s681">So we had the very social life, also.</span> <span id="s682">But Friday evening, which is the beginning of the Shabbes, we always have the whole fl -- all s -- four couples had to be at my parent’s for dinner.</span> <span id="s683">That was Friday evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Uh-huh, you had to be there, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: It’s -- our husbands didn’t appreciate this much, but -- but my parents expected it, so we did it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Yeah, it was just one of those family obligations --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: That -- family, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: -- that every family --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Family has --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: -- has, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s692">S-So should I tell you what my husband did?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Please, yeah, let’s talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: He -- he was the head of a big publishing house and that he became, in Vienna it was called director, if you are the head of.</span> <span id="s695">Here you call it publisher.</span> <span id="s696">There were five daily newspapers, then there were six or seven weekly newspapers, and books were published.</span> <span id="s697">There were 800 people and he was the head of it.</span> <span id="s698">He did not write himself, never, but he was the head of the -- chief editor and [indecipherable] of all the ones who wrote, and he, of course ha-had decided about the salary and things like that.</span> <span id="s699">Besides of [indecipherable] that he became in ’36, and therefore he decided to marry, because he had a very high salary, and said now we can live very well together, and I can take care of you.</span> <span id="s700">In Vienna one married only til the husband could take care of the wife.</span> <span id="s701">One didn’t expect to work -- that she was working.</span> <span id="s702">And so th-therefore, when he became the head -- he was not the head first, he was under the director, I wa -- he wrote me to marry.</span> <span id="s703">And of course, when -- should I tell you now when Hitler came?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yes, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Or not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Well, let -- let me just ask you one more question about -- about leading up to -- well, what was the climate there -- and I guess this get -- leads into the question a-a-about when Hitler came, did you feel when you came back after four years that the atmosphere, in terms of people’s attitudes towards Jews, and the anti-Semitism had changed?</span> <span id="s707">Did you notice a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No, but I have to say that some people were amazed that we -- that I went back to Vienna, because they were afraid what will be.</span> <span id="s709">And my husband -- my husband said he n -- he would not leave his wonderful position, which was interesting for him, of course, and he would not leave voluntarily.</span> <span id="s710">But there was some people who said, why did you come back?</span> <span id="s711">And for me it was a good reason to come back, to marry my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Well, what gave you the idea, or what was it that people said that gave you an idea that it wasn’t good to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Said that -- that Hitler is in Germany, and somehow they were afraid that he will really c-come to -- also to Austria and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: And what did you know about Hitler in 1936, and wh --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: -- what were you afraid of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: -- that -- I knew -- I knew about Hitler because I had friends in Germany, for instance.</span> <span id="s718">[sneezes]</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s721">Who came to Paris to bring money, that I take care of money, because they knew that they will eventually leave there.</span> <span id="s722">So I knew that in Germany it went on, but nothing is atrocities like afterwards.</span> <span id="s723">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s724">But I knew that Germany, he is against Jews, but they were not yet deported like later.</span> <span id="s725">In ’33, he started in Paris -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s726">So people were what -- what -- probably afraid in Austria that -- and ask me why I came back, and considered to come back.</span> <span id="s727">They were amazed.</span> <span id="s728">But, as I see, my husband said he would not leave voluntarily his job, his interesting job.</span> <span id="s729">And I loved to come back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s730">I loved Paris, of course, very much, and -- but I enjoyed to come back to Vienna because it was really my birthplace, and where I spent so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Were there times during those years, from ’36 to ’38 before the anschluss that -- that you did feel uncomfortable or -- or frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, I never felt frightened, and really it was a big surprise, the -- when Hitler marched -- not he marched in, but the SS men marched in.</span> <span id="s733">It was a big surprise for all of us, and Schuschnigg, who was our president spoke on the television to say good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: On the ra -- on the tel -- not the television, on --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Not television --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: -- on the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: -- the radio.</span> <span id="s738">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Now it is -- television is so handy.</span> <span id="s741">No, it was on the radio that he said good-bye, he has to give in, he can’t fight.</span> <span id="s742">And th-that was a horror, of course, for all of us.</span> <span id="s743">It was a surprise.</span> <span id="s744">Somehow one feared it, but it was a surprise when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Tell -- tell me about the -- the feeling that you remember, maybe, if you do remember the feeling at that time when he rat -- actually came to power, and what kinds of conversations were going on in your family at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: But in Germany was far enough for us, you know?</span> <span id="s747">We had also relatives in Germany, my mother’s sister and children were there.</span> <span id="s748">And -- but it was so f -- Germany was far for us, and at that time it was -- he didn’t start right away as horrid as he did afterwards.</span> <span id="s749">Even in Austria, I mean he started awful, but the horrid atrocities came later, much later.</span> <span id="s750">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Wh-What -- what was it about Hitler in 1936 and 1937, before Kristallnacht, and before the anschluss --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: -- that made you be fearful of him, or -- or -- or not --</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yeah, not secure --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: -- certainly not want him to come to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: -- let us say not sec --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Not secure, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: -- not secure.</span> <span id="s759">But we saw -- we spoke very little about it, I have to say, and we were not really so much afraid of it that we expected it.</span> <span id="s760">We didn’t expect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s762">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: But some people were afraid of it.</span> <span id="s764">I mean, my family didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: But -- but you knew something about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: What was it that you knew about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Just that h-he’s ridiculously anti-Semitic, and want to have only the blonde, blue-eyed people.</span> <span id="s769">Oh, I have blue eye.</span> <span id="s770">And that he wanted only to have won the race, that the Jews are impossible, that we’re all Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And how did you know this, from reading the --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Well, reading, probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: -- just from reading the newspapers, or listening to the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: -- in the newspapers, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I si -- don’t think we listed so much to the radio as we do here now.</span> <span id="s777">I think we’re g -- read newspapers, and I had plenty newspapers at home from my husband, [indecipherable] newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So when the anschluss took place, when the Nazis came to power in Austria, you said that it was a shock.</span> <span id="s779">What kinds of conversations was -- were you having with your family at that time, once the anschluss st --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: What should we do?</span> <span id="s781">Th-That was the first, everyone, what should we do, what can we do?</span> <span id="s782">That was the first reaction, of course, of all of us.</span> <span id="s783">It was on a Friday evening and we were at my parent’s, but my husband was not yet there.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Was he still at work?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: A-At his work, at his office, because two SS men came.</span> <span id="s786">The moment they marched in, two SS men went to the office, took my husband, with a letter addressed to Dr. Richard Karplus from Berlin to give his office to the two SS men who hand him the letter.</span> <span id="s787">Of course they had no idea what to do.</span> <span id="s788">It was prepared already because the newspaper was important, a democratic newspaper, and so many newspaper in his firm who -- which came out, you know?</span> <span id="s789">So everything was prepared from Berlin, that he should pa -- give over.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Because he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Of course, but -- but what -- let me ask you a naïve question, how did they know on the day that they m -- took power in Austria that, presumably many other people including your husband were Jewish and -- and owned property or factories, and they would have these letters ready.</span> <span id="s793">How -- how would they know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: I do -- that, I don’t know how they found out, but probably newspaper was very important, because a newspaper brought the news, and they didn’t want that it is against them, you know?</span> <span id="s795">That I can understand, that they really had the aim to stop Jews to be at the top of newspapers, you know?</span> <span id="s796">That was obvious, because the newspapers give you the news and they can be differently brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Now, when you say differently brought, do you mean like different kinds of perspectives depending --</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah, perspective, we se --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: -- on the political --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: -- we he -- see -- see it here, how the republicans --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: -- and the democrats [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Well, did -- were there newspapers that were publishing ideas about, you know, a Jewish conspiracy and these kinds of things at that --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: So there wasn’t that kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: -- Fascist --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s809">In the newspapers were the news, I’m sure about -- about Hitler, all these years, you know, that we learned about what’s going on in Germany, and -- but it was never in these papers how it was -- there was a single Jewish newspaper, but I -- I don’t remember to have seen it, really, and so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s810">But I can understand that the newspaper were in aim to stop right away to write how horrid Hitler is here, you know?</span> <span id="s811">They wanted to avoid that -- this.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So you mean -- you -- you were -- you’re saying that they did not want to write about how terrible Hitler was --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah, see --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: -- because the Nazis were coming to power in Austria and they didn't want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yeah, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: -- get their presses confiscated, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: -- [indecipherable] the Germans didn’t want that the newspapers write badly about the Germans, and to influence people.</span> <span id="s818">So that -- so they were really anxious to get it out of the hand of the Jew.</span> <span id="s819">But my husband stayed still 10 days, because he said he is the captain, he -- the people, of course -- 800 people lost all their heads, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: When you say they lost their heads --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Tha -- lost their head, that is probably German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: For -- for being -- lo-losing their jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Y-Yeah, not only losing their jobs, but that Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s824">That we are no more Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: They lost their heads, they were -- they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: We are no more Austrians, but not all of them, it was a mixed group.</span> <span id="s827">There were many non-Jews.</span> <span id="s828">For instance, the secretary of my husband.</span> <span id="s829">My husband called me up at my parent’s and said, Erna, don’t walk alone at home.</span> <span id="s830">One doesn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s831">I send you my secretary.</span> <span id="s832">And the secretary has taken, in the moment the SS men came to my husband, he has taken out the -- you know, h-he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s833">He was -- his secretary was in the party already, the Nationalistic party.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: And did your husband know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No idea.</span> <span id="s836">But he offered to come to take me home, because he had the -- how do you call it, you know, the party insignia.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Was it a -- was it a swastika at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: It was a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: For [indecipherable] Austria [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: And so -- and so he sent me him, that he walks me home.</span> <span id="s843">He was a -- very devoted to my husband, and that was again and again afterwards.</span> <span id="s844">Though you are a Jew, I love you.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So he was a member of the party, but he didn’t have anything against you, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, not against my husband, he wrote us and -- afterwards.</span> <span id="s847">He -- because he appreciated my husband as a person, you know.</span> <span id="s848">And said -- but that was not only with my husband, one heard it very often.</span> <span id="s849">I love you, though you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s850">But t -- all the Jews are, of course, horrid, but you are not horrid.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: When did you start hearing that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: After Hitler, of course, after Hitler.</span> <span id="s853">And also, I mean, I saw it with as -- a -- also the secretary was also not Jewish -- of -- of my husband.</span> <span id="s854">I’d say all -- I’d say -- not all, but they wrote all the time to my husband afterwards, because a -- as a person they liked him, it was only bad luck that he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s855">And he stayed this evening very long in th -- in the office, so to calm down the people, the reporters and everyone.</span> <span id="s856">And then he came home, and that I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s857">It was very late probably, and we walked up and down in the big living room, you know, what should we do, what should we do.</span> <span id="s858">And we were very lucky, we got -- we had friends in America who send us telegram whether we want affidavit.</span> <span id="s859">We got letters from Paris from the lady who has taken over my studio, that my pupils want to have me back, and I ha -- I have right away a job.</span> <span id="s860">The friends from Paris wrote me, they want to have me back.</span> <span id="s861">I wanted to go to Paris, but my husband, who was very intelligent, said, Erna, let us only once emigrate.</span> <span id="s862">Paris will be also a victim of Hitler.</span> <span id="s863">And he was so right.</span> <span id="s864">So we thought about America, a little about Australia.</span> <span id="s865">But my husband read always English, and knew so much about Boston, for instance, so we -- we wanted to go really to amer -- we decided.</span> <span id="s866">And then I started to go to the different embassies to get the visas, you know, to get the visa to go to France, and to Switzerland, to go through the different lands.</span> <span id="s867">And the French sent us an affidavit so we could really -- we could really go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Okay now, let me -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Okay, this is s-side A of tape two with Mrs. Karplus, our interview continues.</span> <span id="s870">Mrs. Karplus, you were just talking about emigrating to America, but I -- I’d like to back up a little bit to that --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: -- night that you and your husband were pacing back and forth in the living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And talking about what to do.</span> <span id="s875">I-I just want to ask you to r-recall as many specifics about that as you can.</span> <span id="s876">I mean, did you suddenly feel like your whole world was going to be changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s878">Of course.</span> <span id="s879">We felt awful to leave our homeland, and we were -- we were born, where we were so many years.</span> <span id="s880">It was a horrid s -- moment to think one has to leave that -- we were in the lovely apartment almost not two years, and made so many changes there, and built lovely [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s881">And so many things we did.</span> <span id="s882">It was an awful thing to think to leave, but the luckiest thing was that we were two.</span> <span id="s883">We did it for each other.</span> <span id="s884">Alone, I would have been much more lost fo -- to do it for myself.</span> <span id="s885">But I had the feeling I do it for my husband and he did it for me, not to collapse.</span> <span id="s886">So we were really ve -- horridly, of course, upset and unhappy.</span> <span id="s887">And what to do?</span> <span id="s888">That was the big question for everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Now, this was back in -- in March of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: ’36 -- ’38, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: ’38, March of --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: -- excuse me, ’30 si -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: -- Mar -- March of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: March ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: And you also have -- had family who were faced with the same kinds of decisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: What other conversations were going on in the family at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah, everyone had the same problem.</span> <span id="s899">How and where to go, and as fast as possible to leave.</span> <span id="s900">We were the first ones because the others were not confronted right away with losing the job or -- or stopping their job.</span> <span id="s901">Also my brother-in-law, who was a Roentgenologist, you know, he still continued to -- to see patients.</span> <span id="s902">And another brother-in-law was in a big firm, and he continued to be there.</span> <span id="s903">But my husband was really confronted, the first one of the family to lose his job.</span> <span id="s904">But -- so we made -- right away tried to make arrangements, but we were not sure what to do, really.</span> <span id="s905">I mean the -- because from the -- Paris, for instance, I got not the same day, I got the -- after a few days the letters, and we were not yet hundred percent decided right away, where we go.</span> <span id="s906">Eventually we worked through that, that America would be the right place, where Hitler would not come.</span> <span id="s907">And my husband was right that he said let us not go to Paris.</span> <span id="s908">Many people went to Paris and went through -- or to England, for instance, and were bombed there, I mean.</span> <span id="s909">So it was very clever of him to go -- to decide for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Let me ask you -- a-and I know some of this might be painful memories, but I want to ask you about some of the specifics of -- of 1938, and how you felt, a-apart from your decision about where to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: -- which I-I’m sure you were thinking about a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: What was it like living in Vienna in 1938, between the time that the anschluss started in -- in March, to the Kristallnacht in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: -- in the end, in November of ’38.</span> <span id="s917">What -- what was it -- what was it like th -- were you required to identify yourself as a Jew?</span> <span id="s918">Did you have to wear one of the yellow badges, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, not yet, because we left in June or July, very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: In -- in ’38 --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: -- or ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: 30 -- ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Oh, I thought you didn’t leave until ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: No, we left very early because we were really f -- as I said, one of the first one who were confronted with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: So you didn’t have to live through Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No, we were not there.</span> <span id="s928">Also, my sisters and brother not.</span> <span id="s929">The parents were -- were still in Vienna, I think, but not in their apartment.</span> <span id="s930">And we were no -- we left comparatively early.</span> <span id="s931">I have it in my book, I think</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: You have a little leather book that looks --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: -- about four inches by one and -- two inches --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: This is 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: We left fr -- Friday the 15th of July at two o’clock.</span> <span id="s938">We went to Zurich.</span> <span id="s939">So it was really early, you know?</span> <span id="s940">The 15th of July.</span> <span id="s941">We were very lucky.</span> <span id="s942">For that reason we could take all our silver, all our furniture, everything with us, only not all money.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: They delayed your money.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: We got very little money, but all our fur -- all we had, we could take with us.</span> <span id="s945">We were not allowed to buy something any more.</span> <span id="s946">No -- nothing new, we could take.</span> <span id="s947">So, for us it was really short in comparison, that we were in Vienna under Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: So from March to June is only three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: What were those three months like?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: The three months, I’m amazed that I see in my booklet how we saw every day friends, not -- at five o’clock, at seven o’clock, at nine o’clock, we saw friends, friends, probably we were all want to talk over what to do, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: And maybe you wanted to say good-bye to people, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Also that, but that was not right away, but I see my husband had [indecipherable] the 19th of March, and fr-friends came, family came.</span> <span id="s954">So we saw a lot of people in this time, and I think really because we were also excited what -- about the happenings, and what to do.</span> <span id="s955">And I went -- my husband went, I told you, the first 10 days to the office, got always in the evening some telephone calls with the -- they can put the -- now, how is it called, you said it before, the Hakenkreutz.</span> <span id="s956">Sometimes people -- I have the hole in my head.</span> <span id="s957">Is it -- to take off democratic paper.</span> <span id="s958">Of course, my husband say to everything yes [indecipherable] because he knew it doesn’t hurt him to forbid, you know?</span> <span id="s959">And then came two people, two SS men to our apartment to look whether we have s -- something against Hitler, some literature or so.</span> <span id="s960">And in fact we had the New York Times, where there was something, but they couldn’t speak English, luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: That was probably nex -- everything in ’38, so ma -- April, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Maybe April of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: But the horror was, of course that -- was that they take my husband with them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: They went through the whole apartment, in my -- my underwears, in the -- the -- they looked whether there is something hidden.</span> <span id="s967">They have taken 40 books of our books, which were from Jews, or Russian communists, and they looked everything over.</span> <span id="s968">And as I say, we had always the Sunday Times, and in the Sunday Times was something against Hitler, but they didn’t -- couldn’t read English, luckily.</span> <span id="s969">So they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s970">So they didn’t find anything, only these 40 books they have taken with them, and luckily they had to ha -- very heavy for s -- them to carry, they were very heavy.</span> <span id="s971">And -- but they didn’t take my husband, that was the big danger always.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And wh-why?</span> <span id="s973">Did you see that happening around you, the people who si -- men were disappearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yeah, for instance my brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Say that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: My brother-in-law, who was in a -- in an office, he was also doctor of law without being a lawyer.</span> <span id="s977">He did the same as my husband.</span> <span id="s978">To be a good executive, and he -- his boss was away in Prague, and when the SS --</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: His boss was?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: In Prague, Czechoslovi --Czeshuls -- I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Czechoslovakia, yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Right.</span> <span id="s983">And as the boss was not here, and he was next to the boss, the head of the firm, he c -- was taken to the police, the SS men taking him to the police.</span> <span id="s984">And when my sister went there, of course they didn’t let him go.</span> <span id="s985">They kept him because it was a Jewish firm, and the boss is not there, but he is representing the boss, so he was in the police.</span> <span id="s986">At that time it was only police, there was not yet concentration camps, that we knew.</span> <span id="s987">And my sister went, of course, there.</span> <span id="s988">I slept in her house because she was, of course, awfully upset and unhappy.</span> <span id="s989">I -- I didn’t remember that I slept there, but I read it in my little book.</span> <span id="s990">And she had two little children.</span> <span id="s991">And that was an awfully exciting time for my sister, and also for us, what will happen with him.</span> <span id="s992">Eventually he was freed, and they went also, but we were the first one to live -- to leave Aus -- Vienna.</span> <span id="s993">But soon afterwards, my sister, who was married with the Roentgenologist, and also my other sister [indecipherable] they left.</span> <span id="s994">My sister -- I know very little about my sister who was married with the doctor, because I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Risa Fleischner.</span> <span id="s997">Dr. Felix Fleischner.</span> <span id="s998">And I don’t know whether you know Lynn.</span> <span id="s999">Do you know Lynn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: I know who she is, cause I’ve read some of her questions --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Who she is.</span> <span id="s1002">And she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: -- this is your niece, your great-niece?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah, my great-niece, and she is the great -- grand -- she is the grandchild of my sister Risa Fleischner.</span> <span id="s1005">And her daughter, Lis says -- she lives in -- Lis Rosenman, she lives in New York, she says she knows a lot about.</span> <span id="s1006">I admit I n -- I know very little how they went through, because we di -- were a lot with my sister whose husband was his -- at the police, you know?</span> <span id="s1007">That was the most frightening thing for us, what will happen to him.</span> <span id="s1008">And I was, of course, also frightened the 10 days my husband went to the office, whether he came home.</span> <span id="s1009">If one of the 800 people could have said one word against my husband, he would never be allowed to go home and to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1010">But we were so lucky that not one person said anything against him.</span> <span id="s1011">He was very -- people liked him very much and he was a very fair boss.</span> <span id="s1012">I mean, he was just as much for the worker as for the executives.</span> <span id="s1013">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: And these were -- these were -- all 800 people were all employees in the textile --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1016">Not textile, in my husband’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: -- in the -- I’m -- excuse, not the textile --</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: -- the publishing house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: -- in the publishing, yeah, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yeah, the publishing house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1023">And my father closed the office, and at that time he -- he will -- had heart trouble, and he went to a kind of hospital [indecipherable] sanatorium it was called, where you go after your operation to recuperate.</span> <span id="s1024">That was a wonderful thing in Vienna, when you were operated, to have a place where to recuperate where there were doctors and nurses, you know?</span> <span id="s1025">You didn’t have to stay the hospital as long, and go home.</span> <span id="s1026">But you will go to the sanatorium.</span> <span id="s1027">Here, sanatorium is for mental sick people, no?</span> <span id="s1028">But we called it so -- like that.</span> <span id="s1029">So F -- Father and Mother were there, and I -- that was a -- horrid, of course, for me to say good-bye, because I didn’t know whether I will ever see them again.</span> <span id="s1030">That was really awful.</span> <span id="s1031">That was -- but you asked what we did in that time before we left.</span> <span id="s1032">Number one, I had to go to the different embassies, and I had always to stand in line, because I was not the only one who wanted to get the visa for France and Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1033">So that one had to have the permission that one paid all the taxes.</span> <span id="s1034">One had to have it black and white that we paid everything and can leave the country.</span> <span id="s1035">There were many things like that of course, for the police.</span> <span id="s1036">And one had to prove things, you know?</span> <span id="s1037">And then wa -- we prepared, of course, to leave -- I mean, to -- e-everything has to be packed, and to decide what one takes or not.</span> <span id="s1038">And, for instance, we didn’t take the dining room, because we thought we will never have as big a -- an apartment again.</span> <span id="s1039">And so it’s sad time, but what I was really amazed to see, how many friends we saw all the time, family and friends, also.</span> <span id="s1040">It -- it seems we were two hours there and then two hours there.</span> <span id="s1041">That I didn’t remember, frankly, you know?</span> <span id="s1042">I only saw it in my little book that we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: So, e-everyone in your family was -- most people in your family were thinking about leaving, you -- you talked about Risa and is it Felix Fleischner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1046">And I saw from my notes, I guess from your grand-niece that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Did you talk to my grand-niece?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: No, I didn’t, but I’ve -- but I saw some of the notes that she sent to Arwen at the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Oh, she did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1051">And she mentioned apparently that -- that Risa and Felix went away -- fled Vienna in ’38 also in a -- in a plane, in a little plane --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah, we -- the all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: -- to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1055">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: You were all in together?</span> <span id="s1057">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: -- yeah -- no, no.</span> <span id="s1059">They went after us, but to the same place we went, because we had a cousin over there, a cousin who lived with her husband in France, in Paris.</span> <span id="s1060">I saw her a lot during the time.</span> <span id="s1061">And then they were on vacation, this was summer, on vacation.</span> <span id="s1062">Whether it is France or Switzerland, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1063">[indecipherable] it was in Milan [indecipherable] and probably the name of the [indecipherable] I wrote down.</span> <span id="s1064">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1065">That -- we -- we went there, and my ha -- no, my brother left the first one, because his wife was pregnant and expected in August, a child.</span> <span id="s1066">So he was the first one who went to Italy, because in Italy we had the -- he had the business friends, really.</span> <span id="s1067">And also he could make business instead of from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1068">He makes the business from Italy, from Milano.</span> <span id="s1069">So he was the first one who left for his pregnant wife’s sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And that’s Agon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Agon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Agon, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Why do you ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Well, I just have these notes here, I just -- I just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah, he was Agon Sporer, my -- my name, my born name, shp -- my family name, Sporer.</span> <span id="s1076">I had also my studio here, under my -- my name Sporer, Erna Sporer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: And he was the first one, really, who left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Right, and -- and Risa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: And to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: -- left, and you left --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: -- we -- I -- th -- then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: -- all that year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: -- I left, and then afterwards Risa left, and afterwards Hella left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: And what about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: My parents stayed there in the apartment, and one day Mother said a-an SS man came -- we called them always SS, a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1087">Do you say Nazi here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Either -- either one, I think would [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yeah, came and said, your husband has to come with us to the police.</span> <span id="s1090">So Father had to go to the police, and was there.</span> <span id="s1091">Of course that means overnight in a -- in -- like in jail.</span> <span id="s1092">And Mother was, of course, horridly unhappy and said he has -- he’s a sick man with his heart and so on.</span> <span id="s1093">So after a week, they said, if you empty your apartment, we can have your apartment in one week, we will give him free.</span> <span id="s1094">So Mother had to empty the apartment in one week, and Father got free.</span> <span id="s1095">And then they lived with other families in an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: They stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah, that was -- but that was much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: So the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: When we all have left already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: But they were there until when?</span> <span id="s1103">Or did they say the whole ti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: That I don’t know exactly, I know only when they came here, but to -- my brother tried to get them to Italy, to Milano, but this was very, very hard to get them in.</span> <span id="s1105">And then, after many months, I don’t know how -- unfortunately when, but it was surely we left in June, July we left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: I think you said you left July 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: July, yeah.</span> <span id="s1108">July 15, yeah, we left Vienna.</span> <span id="s1109">It was probably November or December that they left.</span> <span id="s1110">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: That -- that your parents left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Par -- my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: So everyone left in ’38 o-of your main family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Everyone, yeah, luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: And my parents were in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: So -- but your parents lived through Kristallnacht then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Your parents lived through Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s1120">They -- they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: No, no, in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Oh, they were in Italy all -- by November?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: My parents lived in -- because th -- my -- no, they -- no, they lived in Vienna, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: In -- in -- during --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: And then they had to leave the -- the -- the apartment in one week to the SS men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: And then they lived with many other people in -- in -- in an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: The Jews were put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: But I was -- I was just suggesting that i-if they didn’t leave until December of 1938, Kristallnacht was in November of 1938.</span> <span id="s1131">Do you remember them telling you about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: No, no, no, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1135">I am not sure that’s -- and unfortunately I am the only old one, my generation.</span> <span id="s1136">I can’t ask anyone, because nobody is there.</span> <span id="s1137">So I am not sure when they left Vienna.</span> <span id="s1138">I know only that they were then in Italy, and we sent them -- peop -- fre -- people sent them an affidavit, and Mother went always to a consulate and it repeated about 15 times that the consul always asks one thing, that the affidavit giver has to do.</span> <span id="s1139">And after 15 times the af -- the man who gave the affidavit said, here is enough.</span> <span id="s1140">But the consul ask always Mother to come, it was far for her to come to the consul.</span> <span id="s1141">He was obviously an anti-Semite and didn’t want the parents go to America, so he never asked 10 things at the same time, no, one thing.</span> <span id="s1142">And she has always to come and come and come and come to the consul to get the affi -- to get the emigration.</span> <span id="s1143">So one said he has enough, he can’t do any more.</span> <span id="s1144">So we found somebody else here in Boston, who were very nice, and then what I was -- e-every evening I came home after work and cried.</span> <span id="s1145">That was all I could do for my poor parents who were there.</span> <span id="s1146">I thought Mother is so old, 60 years old, that she has to go through that, and Father was 74.</span> <span id="s1147">So, it’s tha -- for me the idea was awful, these old, old, people.</span> <span id="s1148">And a cousin of my husband married an -- a married lawyer who, when she met him in Vienna when he came to help Jews to come out of -- of Vienna, and then they married and he was very influential in [indecipherable] in -- in Washington.</span> <span id="s1149">So when Mother came one day again to the consul, the consul said, and whom do you have in Washington who has such influence?</span> <span id="s1150">And she got her affidavit.</span> <span id="s1151">Only through -- Alfred Shvetsky was his name.</span> <span id="s1152">He was in the big firm you probably know, Sullivan and Cromwell in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s1153">His father was one, I think, of the founders.</span> <span id="s1154">So anyway, the parents came with the worst boat [indecipherable] prepared it, the boat -- about the boat I had the newspaper clipping, the Navamari it was called.</span> <span id="s1155">And there were hundreds and hundreds of people on it instead of 50 people.</span> <span id="s1156">They were lying next to each other.</span> <span id="s1157">It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Fro-From where to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: From Portugal to New York.</span> <span id="s1160">Luckily we didn't know during this time, how awful this was.</span> <span id="s1161">For weeks and weeks they were on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: For weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Navamari was the name of the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: No, the -- you -- they were on the boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: My parents were on the boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: For weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: -- because it was -- for weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Why for weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: They stopped in Bermuda, I know.</span> <span id="s1170">Where else they stopped, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1171">They had very little to eat and drink, and there were very few bathrooms, and many people got cholera.</span> <span id="s1172">And they were lying one next to the other.</span> <span id="s1173">And many people went to court afterwards.</span> <span id="s1174">And I had an article, unfortunately I don’t find -- I also re -- wrote already for my grand-niece, for Lynnie about the Holocaust, because she wanted to know for her children, you know?</span> <span id="s1175">And I started it on vacation, and I can’t find it.</span> <span id="s1176">I feel ashamed, but I can’t find it.</span> <span id="s1177">I looked again and again for it, but I can’t find it.</span> <span id="s1178">And there was also, I found a note, a newspaper note about Navamari , how awful it was and -- in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1179">And afterwards many people went to court to get money for -- because it was so awful, the -- the -- the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: The boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yes, the boat, and how they were treated, horrid.</span> <span id="s1182">When they arrived, they looked so bad that I thought Father will die on the way to the apartment.</span> <span id="s1183">It was just that horrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: You -- you met them at the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: At the -- yeah, I was in New York, I met them at -- we all were at the port, we three sisters were at the -- at the -- to see -- to meet them.</span> <span id="s1186">My --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: September ’41.</span> <span id="s1189">Just before the war, we were in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Se-September 14th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: ‘41</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Se-September of ’41 you me -- they didn’t come until ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: No, because the consul -- first we didn’t -- they were in Italy, secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: [indecipherable] Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Then it started, my brother had to leave, because it looked for the Jews, they were -- secluded the Jews in Italy also.</span> <span id="s1196">So my brother left, and my parents.</span> <span id="s1197">Then we started worrying.</span> <span id="s1198">We didn’t start right away, we thought they are in Italy, in [indecipherable] and secure, you know?</span> <span id="s1199">And so it -- it -- S-September, and therefore, I was so afraid and so unhappy because I thought that soon we will be in the war.</span> <span id="s1200">In ’41 December, and we were in the war.</span> <span id="s1201">And so it’s -- I can give you some ice in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s1203">No, thank you, no, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No?</span> <span id="s1205">Don’t you want ice in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: No, no, I -- really, it’s fine, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Or -- unless you want some ice for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: No, I want only to be wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1211">Me, too.</span> <span id="s1212">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: So the parents came over, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: So what was that like standing there on the dock, waiting for your parents just to come --</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: It was awful, and luckily we didn’t know ho-how awful the whole trip was.</span> <span id="s1216">That was -- we were really lucky, because to t -- to travel all the time, all the weeks, would have been awful.</span> <span id="s1217">But I felt so sorry for my old mother, 60 years old, and she became 99.</span> <span id="s1218">Then she was little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Do you -- do you remember what kind of reunion it was?</span> <span id="s1220">It must have been both happy and sad, huh?</span> <span id="s1221">A: Ve-Very t -- very touching and af -- ab -- one, I think I went with Father into the apartment of my sister in New York, because Mother waited probably for -- with my other sisters for the suitcases, and Father of -- was, of course, in an awful state, awful.</span> <span id="s1222">Th-They looked horrid.</span> <span id="s1223">And we sisters were so unhappy.</span> <span id="s1224">It was really awful.</span> <span id="s1225">Am I excused for th -- for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Oh, please, please.</span> <span id="s1227">[tape break] -- to munch a little bit here.</span> <span id="s1228">Well, so we were talking about -- and you were -- you were talking about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Parents [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: -- a-about your parents journey.</span> <span id="s1231">And I wanted to -- to go back a little bit again to those few months before you all left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: What kind of preparations was everybody making?</span> <span id="s1234">You’ve t-talked about it a little bit, but did you -- was -- was it -- was there careful planning involved in -- in deciding on how to book the trips, and how to get your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: -- possessions out of the country?</span> <span id="s1237">How did you go about all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: We found out that we can take a big van and all our things, as I said, which we have.</span> <span id="s1239">We were not allowed to buy stockings new, or anything new we were not allowed to -- to -- and our money was right away blocked in -- at the bank.</span> <span id="s1240">And what was awful, of course, to go on the street, and to see that Jews have to kneel down and to scrub what’s an artist put paint on, and the Jews have to kneel on the street and to brush -- to try to brush them away.</span> <span id="s1241">That w-was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: You -- you s -- you were seeing this in -- right a -- right away in ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1244">I don’t know whether it was right away, I can’t -- that I can’t say when it was, when it started there, but I saw it.</span> <span id="s1245">And that was awful, it was really heartbreaking, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Did you -- did you ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: No, I never had it and nobody of my family had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1251">Why were other Jews required to</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: We have -- a-as -- it happened to be then on th -- I wa -- we were lucky not to be on the place where they just gathered them, you know?</span> <span id="s1253">I -- I only pass them.</span> <span id="s1254">But I mean, it was so that this was an awful, an awful sight.</span> <span id="s1255">My time was not yet a concentrate -- that people were deported to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1256">That was not yet at that time.</span> <span id="s1257">I don’t know when it started, frankly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Although, wasn’t the -- the idea of -- did they call it Judenrein?</span> <span id="s1259">Was Judenrein, or Judenrein --</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Ju-Judenrein wa -- were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: -- the -- was that -- was that -- that was one of the slogans of the anschluss, wasn’t that?</span> <span id="s1262">We-Were people -- do you remember that phrase then -- then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Yeah, yeah, people who were -- no.</span> <span id="s1264">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1265">This phrase I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1266">But you have to be completely Jewish when you had a Christian father also, and a Jewish mother, you were not allowed, I mean, to stay or to do things.</span> <span id="s1267">That way if you -- of my sister Hella Streicher, a brother of my -- of [indecipherable] Streicher, was married to a Gentile li -- doctor.</span> <span id="s1268">And they stayed there in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1269">But now I remember, he was once put also to the police and he jumped from the third floor down and broke several things.</span> <span id="s1270">So he got to the hospital and survived.</span> <span id="s1271">But he stayed there, and the children were all brought up Catholic, because mother was Catholic.</span> <span id="s1272">Not very religious, but they were.</span> <span id="s1273">Of course, I mean, one had a hard time when one was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s1274">One -- then it was called Jewish.</span> <span id="s1275">My brother-in-law, for instance, another from my husband’s side, Hans Hartman, who was a -- i-is still -- he’s dead, but he’s a very famous psychoanalyst, and he had -- he had both parents at that time were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1276">The grandfather was still -- one grandfather of him was Jewish, but he had a Jewish wife, a Karplus, so they had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: What about your -- your -- I think it was -- was it your sister Risa whose -- whose husband was in -- in jail and then she had to clear out the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: No, that was Hella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: That was -- that was Hella’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: No, to clear the apartment was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: That was -- okay, I’m sorry, I’m getting confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yeah, yeah, no but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Now, you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: -- it is hard, with my big family, it is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: -- y-your mother had to clear the apartment and it was your father that everybody was worried about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: My father was in the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Now, were those -- were those -- what ha -- when she had to clear the apartment, what happened to all the possessions in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: That was -- it seems she put it in storage, because it was then supposed to be [indecipherable] on the way to America, and they pretended that it was bombed, but we all think it was pretended, and in reality they have taken it.</span> <span id="s1289">You know, one never could prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: They lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Yeah, it’s lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: And they had the most beautiful antiques, everything antique.</span> <span id="s1294">And lovely things, but that was all lost, so -- and my sister got my brother-in-law out from the police without emptying the apartment, it was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Now, let me ask you, Mrs. Karplus about y-you -- you had a lot of friends who were Gentiles.</span> <span id="s1296">You -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Lot is too much, say it’s -- but some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Well, some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Now, w-were -- were any of those -- did you consider that you had close friends who later became sympathetic with the Nazis, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: -- members of the party?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: They not.</span> <span id="s1304">Only the secretary of my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: So there’s -- that one story was the only experience like that that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Yeah, that have -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: That has us wi -- were -- with us, continue with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: They were -- they stood with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Y-Yeah, yes, they were really good friends, close friends.</span> <span id="s1311">And also [indecipherable] and then I told you two of them have left also Austria, who were married to non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Now -- an-and among the friends and associates of other members of your family, did th -- were there any other stories like that, of -- of people who had been friends who suddenly turned against them because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: I didn’t -- I didn’t hear of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: [indecipherable] hear about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: I didn’t hear of that.</span> <span id="s1318">And we were -- I think one aunt died in a concentration camp, that was burned.</span> <span id="s1319">I mean, at -- in a concentration camp, because we didn’t hear

to Theresienstadt, we made in a wagon for animals.</span> <span id="s1386">It was a horrid, daily by day and night, very bad bombardments.”</span> <span id="s1387">Is this right?</span> <span id="s1388">Bombardment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Bom-Bombardments, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Bo -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1391">“We thought always to be killed by the bombs.</span> <span id="s1392">I was three months in Hamburg, then close to [indecipherable] there -- there were many bombs attacks in our concentration camp, and so I -- during the time I worked, I lost again everything.</span> <span id="s1393">I did not have soap, no toothbrush, nothing, only the -- only I had the very bad what I had on -- on.</span> <span id="s1394">Then we had to go away from there, and after two weeks again in a wagon for animals, 120 people in one wagon, were always te -- every day some dead.</span> <span id="s1395">We had to stand without eating, water, without water in a very bad” -- oh, sometimes it’s so hard, you know, [indecipherable] “we were in [indecipherable] and physically we were -- we came to the very badly -- a very known for bad, Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1396">It was a -- it was known to -- to the -- for that to -- that people die there.</span> <span id="s1397">I can’t tell you, my loved ones to -- what I went through.</span> <span id="s1398">Hungry, thirst and lice.</span> <span id="s1399">We were sleeping on the -- on the earth without any cover, all cl-close to each other through four weeks.</span> <span id="s1400">No piece of bread for many weeks, no water to wash, and if it’s -- was alright, very seldom a water soup with beets.</span> <span id="s1401">That was all -- in all the concentration camps our daily menu.</span> <span id="s1402">The people were all so down physically, that hundred died every day.”</span> <span id="s1403">Do you want to continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Well, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: I’m sorry I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: No, no, this is interesting, but I -- I think I’d like to ask you a little bit about -- I mean, cause probably we don’t have time to read the whole let -- the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: No, and because I’m also not prepared to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1409">No, no, th -- but this is -- this gives a -- a -- a feeling of a terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yeah, a better idea that [indecipherable] happened horrid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: What -- what do you -- what do you recall from having learned about Mimi’s experience?</span> <span id="s1412">What -- in addition to what you’ve just read, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: -- what kind of hell that she lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: She was very bad off.</span> <span id="s1416">She had tuberculosis afterwards.</span> <span id="s1417">And she had broken her arm, I remember.</span> <span id="s1418">I went in ’63 the first time to Europe, but I went to see her in Prague, and she was in very bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: This was at -- so you hadn’t seen her since -- when was the last time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: The last time I saw her later because a cousin of mine invited her to Austria.</span> <span id="s1421">They could get out of Prague when somebody guaranteed to take care of them, and so Mimi was lucky, through me, she -- the family learned then how she is in Prague, and my cousin who lived in -- close to Salzburg, at that time, invited her.</span> <span id="s1422">So I saw her then also there.</span> <span id="s1423">But I have sent her I don’t know how many packages, care was at that time, care packages we called it.</span> <span id="s1424">And she always asked me for things what she could sell.</span> <span id="s1425">For ins -- lipsticks it seems were not in Prague and she could sell, and for that she could buy what she wanted to, food or whatever.</span> <span id="s1426">And when I was in Prague in ’63, there were still the communists.</span> <span id="s1427">One person -- Mimi called for me at the airplane, and also one communist -- one official.</span> <span id="s1428">And then I was in a very good hotel and got everything beautiful to eat and the people outside were standing in line to get something to eat and had no-not a tenth of it.</span> <span id="s1429">So of course I invited many friends of Mimi and Mimi herself.</span> <span id="s1430">And I was horrified that in the hotel they offer everything what you want and the outside the poor people didn’t, and they -- in the trolley car one heard -- one woman heard us speaking German, so she came over and -- and said how horrid it is to live through all this with the communists.</span> <span id="s1431">So I was at a very bad time in Prague at that time, but I s -- really did my best to help Mimi.</span> <span id="s1432">At that time I didn’t have much money, but at tha -- my husband died already in ’58, so I was alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: He died in ’58?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1435">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: So -- so Mimi’s story is really a story of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yeah, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1438">It’s unbelievable that she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: What do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: I don’t say what I think.</span> <span id="s1441">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: So we erased that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yeah, but that is my m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: But y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: I never talked with somebody about it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1447">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: And I always thought, I mean, she was not a very beloved cousin, I have to say.</span> <span id="s1449">And my cousin in -- of Salzburg was very decent to invite her.</span> <span id="s1450">And it was very interesting, the little she [indecipherable] there, it was Lynnie and her sister Debbie, they were small.</span> <span id="s1451">They only liked my cousin who lived in the -- there, but they didn’t like Mimi.</span> <span id="s1452">That was so interesting, the children had the instinct.</span> <span id="s1453">But I felt so sorry for her, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Of course, yeah, I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Well, a horror to go through all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Do you -- a-a-and her brother was the other one in the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Yeah, and who committed suicide when Hitler came.</span> <span id="s1458">He was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: What -- what is -- what is the story -- tell -- what do you know about that story?</span> <span id="s1460">When -- was this in ’38, right away after the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Yeah, right away, right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: What do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Well, I don’t know, but we thought, the family thought that he was baptized, he was baptized, I think and didn’t want that they find out that he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1464">I think, but we don’t know really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: What -- what was his name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Bela.</span> <span id="s1467">B-e-l-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: B-Bela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Bela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: His last name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Herz, A -- H-e-r-z.</span> <span id="s1472">That means heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Bela Hertz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Herz, yeah.</span> <span id="s1475">No, Hertz one writes with t-z, and they are only H-e-r-z.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1477">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: And Mimi was not married.</span> <span id="s1479">She was once married, got divorced, but very short.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: So -- so he -- so this is maybe a story of Bela as someone who was discover -- he was afraid he was -- be discovered as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Yeah, I thought.</span> <span id="s1482">I -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: So he was maybe making adjustments for his own survival by trying to deny his identity to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Yes, I thou -- that is what I assume, but don’t know, you know?</span> <span id="s1487">And he was buried of course, there, but I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Well, let me ask you, Mrs. Karplus then -- we’re jumping around in time a little bit here, but I wanted to ask you one more thing about just as you were leaving in ’38.</span> <span id="s1489">You went to Zurich first, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: No, my brother was first [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: No, but I mean, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: -- you -- you first went to Zur -- I mean, in other words you -- your first --</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: I we -- we went to Zurich, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: -- destination after Vienna was Zurich, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: -- can you recall the details of the day that you left and how you traveled, and what it felt like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: It felt -- of course, I don’t remember exactly, but it felt -- I know that it felt awful to leave your homeland, and to go into an unknown country.</span> <span id="s1501">America was so far at that time for us.</span> <span id="s1502">We had an uncle I remember who came once from America.</span> <span id="s1503">Oh, he was in America.</span> <span id="s1504">You know, that was, really for us, so far.</span> <span id="s1505">At that time we went also with the boat there.</span> <span id="s1506">We were lucky, with the Normandie we went there from France to America.</span> <span id="s1507">But flying was not yet there.</span> <span id="s1508">Telephone was not yet between there, so it was really in an unknown nothing.</span> <span id="s1509">But we were lucky that we had the friends here where we could live the first week, so that was very lucky -- in New York.</span> <span id="s1510">We tried first New York.</span> <span id="s1511">My husband tried first to get the job in New York.</span> <span id="s1512">And I got one right away at Rubenstein, because they knew me from Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Did -- did you -- but it was ’38 that you went to Zurich and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yeah [indecipherable] ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: -- tell me how long -- how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: In Zurich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: In Zurich, s -- very short, because we went to my cousin, who lived in Paris at that time, and then in -- in -- close to Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: And she was with her husband on vacation from Paris and s -- and invited us to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: I stayed there about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1523">I don’t think that I have it here, where we -- when we g -- went to -- my husband, I know went with na -- the [indecipherable] cousin to make arrangements for the going.</span> <span id="s1524">In [indecipherable] I know we were in -- in August we came -- went to America and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: So it was August of ’38 that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yeah, ’38, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: So you only -- you were only</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: [indecipherable] one month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: -- in Zurich and -- and Paris for -- for maybe a total of a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1531">[indecipherable] in between, we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Those two?</span> <span id="s1533">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1535">Not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: They --</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: The most a month we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Maybe we make -- we started -- we arrived maybe beginning of August here.</span> <span id="s1540">I always said we are not a May flower, but August flower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: You were on the August flower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And what was the trip like to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Wonderful, the Normandie.</span> <span id="s1545">Yeah, that was such a wonderful boat, and so good to eat.</span> <span id="s1546">And we didn’t want to talk to all the immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: We talked not German to each other, I think, we talked French or English, I don’t know any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Bef -- we didn’t want to hear from everyone the misery.</span> <span id="s1551">There were so many people, so poor, you know?</span> <span id="s1552">Everyone lost somebody, we were so lucky that we didn’t lose people, you know?</span> <span id="s1553">And there were so many people who lost [indecipherable] the concentration camp, they didn’t know what happened and so on.</span> <span id="s1554">And we didn’t want really to talk to everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: I-It’s -- at this time in ’38, of course it wasn’t as much loss around you as y-y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: No, but sti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: -- at that time, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: -- no, tha -- you’re right, at that time nobody was still concentration camp, but everyone felt miserable, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Yeah -- yeah, and you -- maybe you just didn’t want to think about it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: We -- I didn’t, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1561">And we -- my husband and I decided we never talk about Vienna, how would it be now to be in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1562">We never talked about it, so not -- so to get used to the American life, to assimilate here and not what we lost.</span> <span id="s1563">We didn’t talk what we lost, we wanted to make our new life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: So you just stopped talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: About, yeah, we didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1566">Now we -- we would be this [indecipherable] now we would have the party, now we would -- we never talked about what we lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: But what -- what -- what about in 1940 and ’41 and ’44, and when the -- when the details of the Holocaust started coming out, did you talk about it then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: That -- of -- then, yeah.</span> <span id="s1569">Then of course, we talked about the Holocaust, but not what we, what we lost, what we would have n-now in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1570">The money, the positions, my husband never got the position here, a decent.</span> <span id="s1571">So, we were so occupied with here, and wanted to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1573">Did you -- did you ever talk about what it -- would have happened to us if we had stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: No, it was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: You didn’t need to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: I don’t remember that we talked about it.</span> <span id="s1579">We -- we surely talked about how lucky we were to come out, and specially with our things because we couldn’t buy a bed or anything, you know?</span> <span id="s1580">We had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: But you -- you left quite a bit of money behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: We -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Can you say about how much, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: But it was -- it was substantial amount of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: But it [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: And so how did you put your life back together financially here, when you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: I got very soon a job at Rubenstein, Helena Rubenstein, you know, had a salon in New York.</span> <span id="s1589">And she knew me because I was teaching her sisters in Paris, so she knew me.</span> <span id="s1590">And I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: I worked there, you know, and then my husband, we were told that he should take the first job, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1593">So a friend of ours worked in a store, and was asked whether he wanted to go with a couple to Canada and tutor children, high school’s children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: And -- and what the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Tutor -- tutor.</span> <span id="s1597">Tutor the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: And this young man, Eddie, didn’t want to go, so he asked my husband and my husband went to Canada for two or three months with an American couple and was tutoring all Latin and French and mathematic, everything, and skiing, because he was a very good skier.</span> <span id="s1601">The only thing he said he didn’t know was, when he was asked when friends came in and he helped to prepare, you know, the drinks and so, when he was asked for a Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1602">He had no idea how to do mixed drinks because we never had them in Vienna, you know?</span> <span id="s1603">And then they came back and we hoped through his -- that maybe there is a connection that they will get some job for my husband, but they got it only for me.</span> <span id="s1604">She knew somebody “Vogue”, at “Harper’s Bazaar”, and that was a write-up about me, and I got some private lessons through this write-up.</span> <span id="s1605">So I earned faster than my husband.</span> <span id="s1606">And -- but then this couple went away again, I don’t know where, and offered us their apartment for three months on Park Avenue.</span> <span id="s1607">So we didn’t have to rent -- to pay rent, we lived there for three months.</span> <span id="s1608">And then we went back probably, to a rented.</span> <span id="s1609">But after one year, when my husband couldn’t find a job because the publishers say you have no experience in America.</span> <span id="s1610">A small job we can’t give a man like you, and a high job you can’t get because you have no experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: So they were saying he was overqua --</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: My husband would have gone everything, he would have done I don’t know what, to rub the floor, I’d -- anything, only to prove --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: But they -- they said he was overqualified for the lower positions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: And he always loved Boston, and in fact, he [indecipherable] he paid very intelligently, not only storage, went to New York, but also to Boston, he paid in Vienna, because what he read about Boston he loved always.</span> <span id="s1617">Close to the mountains, academic place, so -- so -- and my sister and Felix Fleischner were already in Boston.</span> <span id="s1618">So he went ahead, and we went Boston.</span> <span id="s1619">I asked Rubenstein, she had the salon here, to transfer me.</span> <span id="s1620">I worked at Rubenstein and he looked for a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: And -- and when -- when was this, when did you arrive in Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: One year, ’39.</span> <span id="s1623">It was in ’39, ’38 August we came, it was probably September, October ’39, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: So that you were in New York about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: And where in New York did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: We lived -- first we lived with a friend on Central Park West, then we rented, also in the west, close to Columbia [indecipherable] an apartment, and hert -- the -- there was h-high-ups, the s -- subway, the -- not the su -- the trolleys were awful noisy, but we got used to it.</span> <span id="s1628">Then my husband went, I stayed alone in this apartment.</span> <span id="s1629">Then we were three months in Park Avenue with mice, and then probably we went back, that I don’t remember now, and mo -- probably went back to the west side because that was the cheapest at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Ha -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: And -- and in New York my husband didn’t get a job, but here he got a job, and [indecipherable] in a very disagreeable job in wal -- Waltham or Watertown.</span> <span id="s1632">He had to sell watches which are very bad and cheap.</span> <span id="s1633">And for him to sell, to know it is bad, he suffered awful.</span> <span id="s1634">It was awful for him.</span> <span id="s1635">And then he had different jobs, but never a real intellectual job as he had, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: So it must have been unhappy for him in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Yeah, he was very well balanced man.</span> <span id="s1638">He went home and read, you see all the books we have?</span> <span id="s1639">This is his books.</span> <span id="s1640">He read and [indecipherable] away.</span> <span id="s1641">And eventually he prepared all the dinner for me, and pre -- eventually he washed the -- he wa -- washed the linen, or laundry, because I worked long hours.</span> <span id="s1642">I worked before Rubenstein, after Rubenstein, and after four years I left Rubenstein and finally we agreed that I risk to have my own st-studio.</span> <span id="s1643">But nobody knew anything about exercises at that time.</span> <span id="s1644">That was ’41, I got my [indecipherable] four years [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1645">I think ’41, I started to -- to look for a studio, which was also very hard.</span> <span id="s1646">Very, very hard, because I make noise.</span> <span id="s1647">People jump, walk, noise.</span> <span id="s1648">It has to be in a region where people can park.</span> <span id="s1649">It was Tremont Street at that time, all right.</span> <span id="s1650">Because now I wouldn’t be on Tremont Street, but at that time it was all right.</span> <span id="s1651">And it was very funny, there was -- it was for the Young Man Christian Association, a house.</span> <span id="s1652">And I ask -- I talked to the director and said, I look for a place, but we have only money for three months rent.</span> <span id="s1653">I don’t know -- if I don’t get pupils, we can’t pay, and wa -- I have to move.</span> <span id="s1654">And in fact, the purple -- the person who was there before, she left without paying.</span> <span id="s1655">But he believed me and has taken me.</span> <span id="s1656">I was then 15 years there, because I worked up, you know, to pupils more and more and more and more.</span> <span id="s1657">And I never advertised.</span> <span id="s1658">I get them all -- got them only recommended.</span> <span id="s1659">And that was the wonderful thing, you know, not to get from the street anyone who smells or expects wonders.</span> <span id="s1660">So, my pupils suit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1662">Let me change tapes here, and just wanted to ask you a couple more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Then I can -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: -- with Mrs. Karplus.</span> <span id="s1665">This is the side A of tape number three, and I just wanted to ask you a couple more questions.</span> <span id="s1666">I-I -- I want to ask you how you kept in touch with you -- you all left your family, your fr -- -- your -- your parents.</span> <span id="s1667">You were all together in New York, in -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Yeah, first we were all together in New York.</span> <span id="s1669">My --</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: S-So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: -- the three sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: So you really kept in close contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yeah, with my sisters.</span> <span id="s1674">My brother was in Brazil, of course, and -- during the war it was no-not possible.</span> <span id="s1675">But my mother went first to him when his wife died i-in Brazil.</span> <span id="s1676">And otherwise, we three sisters were close because one stayed in New York, Hella and Richard Streicher with their children the -- my sister Risa and Felix Fleischner were here, they were only for a short time in Greenfield, but they came back because he got the job in the Beth Israel hospital, to be the head of the department, the [indecipherable] department.</span> <span id="s1677">And he is really a famous man because there is all over the world an association called Felix Fleischner Association, which meet once a year and there are, from all over the world the people come, the doctors -- it is for the chest, lung, and they come, also surgeons and so on, and there are some who give the lectures.</span> <span id="s1678">And there are hundreds and hundreds of doctors who get together, and I’m very proud that it is called Felix Fleischner lecture -- lectures, or association.</span> <span id="s1679">And in fact, there is also, here in Boston once a year, called the dinner for Risa and Felix Fleischner and they give some prizes to the best young people who do research for x-ray.</span> <span id="s1680">So, I always say I’m surrounded by famous people, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: And did you keep in touch with -- with your brother in Brazil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Yes, yes, and then the first time when he came with his daughter, we were awfully excited, of course.</span> <span id="s1683">But th -- it was already -- the daughter was already about 14 years old, so we hadn’t seen my brother for a long time.</span> <span id="s1684">We had no money to go there, and we -- and he probably also not.</span> <span id="s1685">So when he came with his daughter, we were very, very happy and excited, really.</span> <span id="s1686">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1687">But luckily, that all close -- also for my husband that the siblings, everyone came out, and that was a wonder.</span> <span id="s1688">Was really -- when so many people who were [indecipherable] no?</span> <span id="s1689">And had to go through the concentration camp, and only my cousin Mimi, who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: And even she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: -- went to the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: That’s -- that is a -- an amazing thing, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1693">I mean you must not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Mm-hm, very.</span> <span id="s1695">Very, and lucky.</span> <span id="s1696">I mean, so lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Do you ever think about how could this be?</span> <span id="s1698">I mean, you’re -- you’re -- so many people around you an-and so many other Jews all over Europe perished, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: -- and your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Was so lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Did you ever try to as -- attribute that to a -- a greater power or -- or any s -- fate, or any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: No, because we started early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: The people -- that made a big difference, it -- we star -- we started early, before people were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1707">And why did you start early and not other people, do you think?</span> <span id="s1708">What -- what was the difference between the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: I think, number one, if you had not still money, for instance, for the van.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: For -- for the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: For the van.</span> <span id="s1712">The van, it’s called, where we had everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: The van?</span> <span id="s1714">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: The van.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Oh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: It is a big, big --</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Oh, oh, like a van or like a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: But I tried to -- so many had not the luck to get an affidavit for instance, you know?</span> <span id="s1722">To America.</span> <span id="s1723">Because, I mean, we knew someone who was living in New York, a Viennese survivor of -- a psychoanalyst.</span> <span id="s1724">We knew here, and she was wonderful, she ta -- sent us right away a wire.</span> <span id="s1725">So anyone who got an affidavit could leave to America.</span> <span id="s1726">But many people didn’t know anyone --</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: -- in America, for instance --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: -- and go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Were a lot of people going to Palestine at that time as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: I don’t think many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1734">Not from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: I don’t think many [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: You didn’t know, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah, from my family, from my father’s family some went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: From Father’s family some went there, and -- to Israel, to Palestine at that time, but I don’t know whether many people went and frankly I don’t know if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Did you have friends that -- that went, yourself, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: No, and through [indecipherable] went there who only -- I only know of them, and they were a cousin and her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Did you and your husband ever think about going yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: To -- to Israel?</span> <span id="s1744">But never, we never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Because he was not really -- he was Jewish feeling, but this was nothing attractive for us to go to Palestine -- and to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: -- wa -- we never -- funny, we never thought of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: You never thought of the -- the Zionist dream of going back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: No, no, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Eretz Yisrael or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: -- we never -- we were not Zionists, definitely not.</span> <span id="s1753">And we thought -- I mean, and everyone of course thought of -- toward my husband, he will never have any difficulty to find a job, a man of this caliber, of course he will right away have a job, people thought.</span> <span id="s1754">And we thought too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Course, even in Israel today, there are many very, you know, people with Ph.D.s that are lucky to get a factory job --</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: -- even, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: -- nowadays it is different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: -- everything different.</span> <span id="s1761">At that time Palestine -- at -- it wasn’t so attractive.</span> <span id="s1762">I mean, it isn’t attractive for me today because it is much too much going on there.</span> <span id="s1763">It is -- it is a horror to see this shooting forth and back.</span> <span id="s1764">And I hate also when the Israelis shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: I hate it, because it is a oc -- no, we never thought of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Of course, I only thought of Paris, because I loved Paris and I knew the people who want to -- want to have me there teaching again, you know?</span> <span id="s1769">That -- that is attractive, of course.</span> <span id="s1770">But luckily we came to America, wi -- very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: And -- and like you say, you came early enough.</span> <span id="s1772">I guess I -- I just want to ask you whether -- you know, I’ve talked to other people who’ve s -- y-you know, in -- in -- in doing other interviews with other people who’ve survived --</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Oh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: -- there was one other woman whose name I -- I’ll have to look up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Where is she living, in Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1777">I imagine you might know her, let’s see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: I -- I th- --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: René Schorr?</span> <span id="s1780">René Schorr?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Schorr?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Schorr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: But Schorr is th -- is -- is -- sounds familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: I’m pretty sure she was from Vienna, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Schorr sounds familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: René Schorr, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: But I don’t know where to put her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1791">She lives near here, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1792">But -- but I don’t want to attribute this necessarily just to her, but in general talking to Holocaust survivors, people who survived this -- this era, this horrible era, there’s a f -- I felt a si -- a sense almost of why -- why me?</span> <span id="s1793">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: -- how did I survive and so many --</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: It is the biggest one that there is, that our family was so lucky.</span> <span id="s1797">It is really terrific, where we were so many, but I only think because we left early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: And everyone a -- only mothe -- parents lost their belongings, but the si -- my both sisters had also all the belongings here, as I had.</span> <span id="s1800">So it is really like a wonder that we didn’t have to go through that.</span> <span id="s1801">I mean, it was an awful time when my brother-in-law was in prison, because we didn’t know, do they keep him for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1803">Did you e -- did you or anybody in your family, do you think, ever feel guilty of the ti -- you know, I mean -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: That -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: -- not that it would be rational, but -- not that it was a rational thought, but that people -- I know pum -- some people felt oh, you know, it’s not fair that I survived and so many other people didn’t.</span> <span id="s1806">Did you ever go through that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: No, I never -- I never -- I never heard of it of anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: It might be, you know, you don’t talk about everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: And I have to admit, I was only thankful.</span> <span id="s1812">I didn’t feel guilty, only thankful that my husband decided America is -- is the right thing, and not Paris.</span> <span id="s1813">I am only thankful, because it was -- it was really up to him only to decide.</span> <span id="s1814">And I didn’t feel guilty, I felt only really, as I said -- I -- I feel it so -- such a luck is that we three sisters were in America, and could help each other, you know, in many ways.</span> <span id="s1815">Because my sister and brother-in-law went to Boston and I’ve taken care of sitting her children in -- in New York in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1816">You know, we could help each other with little things, which were important.</span> <span id="s1817">And -- and I was lucky they were here because I love children and so I saw children.</span> <span id="s1818">I had children here.</span> <span id="s1819">And then the grandchildren came, so I was very lucky as long my sister lived.</span> <span id="s1820">And now they try also to say al -- all nice to me.</span> <span id="s1821">And I have two nephews who are my husband’s side here, who are psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, and they are very nice to me, so I’m lucky, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Do you feel that e-even though your experience was not horrific and direct in -- in the way that many -- many others was, do you feel that there’s something that you want to say about your experience, or any lessons that you would like future generations to understand about what you’ve been through and -- and the way that you’ve thought about it in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1824">You know that I know that my -- for instance, Lynnie.</span> <span id="s1825">They will bring up the children with the knowledge of horror, what happened.</span> <span id="s1826">And therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write -- which I don’t write -- write -- she asked me to write about Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1827">And then she was so happy when she heard that you will interview me, because she wanted her children to know what was going on when we left Austria.</span> <span id="s1828">And she wanted the children know about it.</span> <span id="s1829">And I had a wonderful experience with friends here sht -- all my friends were pupils, of course.</span> <span id="s1830">And [indecipherable] invited in their house and the husband asked me about leaving Austria, about why, and so on.</span> <span id="s1831">So I told him I’m Jewish and so on.</span> <span id="s1832">And then children came for dinner and he said, I want that Erna repeats now, so that you know, what s -- what she went through.</span> <span id="s1833">And I admired that.</span> <span id="s1834">I was very happy, because these are people [indecipherable] of course not -- not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1835">And I admire that the father told the young children, you should know what was going on, why Erna is here, you know?</span> <span id="s1836">But I have really to say I always felt, because we are two.</span> <span id="s1837">I never felt I did it for myself.</span> <span id="s1838">I felt always I just make it as easy as possible for my husband.</span> <span id="s1839">And I’m sure he felt the same for me.</span> <span id="s1840">People who went -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I felt so bad for them.</span> <span id="s1841">I had a girlfriend, for instance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well, and she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and every weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to take her, because she was alone.</span> <span id="s1842">And that -- that is hard, to come alone.</span> <span id="s1843">And her mother died in Vienna, but not in the concentration camp, she was sick.</span> <span id="s1844">So it’s -- that is -- makes it really hard.</span> <span id="s1845">I feel this was a really -- lucky that I had the partner for whom to -- to be.</span> <span id="s1846">And I never regretted that I work hard, or so, I -- I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1847">I didn’t know it, the others knew it, but I didn’t know that I work hard.</span> <span id="s1848">I’d -- we were -- and I’m very lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable] so little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rubenstein.</span> <span id="s1849">We both earned 30 dollars a week, that I remember like anything.</span> <span id="s1850">Then his mother came, and we didn’t know whether we have enough money for it -- to -- for eating.</span> <span id="s1851">And -- and my husband always said, because we couldn’t put money aside, he said, what will we do v -- when we both retire?</span> <span id="s1852">And I said, we will be in a rocking chair and remember the good old times.</span> <span id="s1853">But I thought -- I collected many things about exercises, I thought I will write in paper, in newspapers about exercises if I can’t teach any more.</span> <span id="s1854">And I’m a very bad writer, but I thought I would.</span> <span id="s1855">My husband would have helped me.</span> <span id="s1856">So is -- it is really when I think back to the ’38, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you were born and where you lived, and all your friends there, and to leave the parents, that was the worst.</span> <span id="s1857">And then, when we left with the airplane, I think it was the first time I was in an airplane, and the cook came -- or maid came to the airport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that -- an awful experience, of course.</span> <span id="s1858">But I never thought again and again, of it.</span> <span id="s1859">Because I really -- we both wanted to assimilate here, even if my language is not assimilating, but we both wanted really to make the best with our life, and not make it harder, and we had no money to get -- go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s1860">’63 i -- i-is the first time I went back, after 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: You went back in si --</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: To Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Did you go to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: At that time -- I have to try to think.</span> <span id="s1865">Yes, I went back to Vienna and there was the friend who married a non-Jew, and they were in New Zealand and they were back, and he got back his factory for the -- he made furniture.</span> <span id="s1866">And the people kept the f-factory going, and when he came back, he and his brothers, they returned it to them.</span> <span id="s1867">Which was wonderful, it showed what good bosses they were.</span> <span id="s1868">And yes, I went then to Vienna, and with a car we went to -- with their car we went to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1869">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: What did it feel like to be in Vienna after that time, all that horrible things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: It was awful.</span> <span id="s1872">I went to the apartment -- I wanted to go to the apartment where my husband and I lived, but I started so much to cry that I didn’t want to ring the bell whoever was there.</span> <span id="s1873">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1874">But whether I went the first time, or another time, I went to the apartment of my parents, where we lived.</span> <span id="s1875">And that was -- that was very hard.</span> <span id="s1876">That was, of course very hard to see again, everything you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Did the people take you -- let you come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Yeah, the people -- the people were quite nice, but I think my sister was already here, she said, again somebody?</span> <span id="s1879">I said, but I wasn’t here yet.</span> <span id="s1880">Because I-I think my sister was there, or my brother, I don’t know who was there before, you know?</span> <span id="s1881">But to the apartment with my husband, I think I tried in ’63, and I think to my parents I went another time.</span> <span id="s1882">I didn't go often to Vienna, only to take a course close to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1883">I have taken a dance course.</span> <span id="s1884">But I -- but every year I was in Europe to Salzburg because I love Salzburg, and my tra -- my favorite cousin was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: So you traveled back to Austria many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Every year I went after ’63 -- I think [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: So you created new memories for -- for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1889">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: -- Austria for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: But I didn’t -- I don’t like Vienna as much as Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1892">Salzburg is -- do you know Salzburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: It is so beautiful, and so lovely a-as -- it has such an old part of -- Vienna, of course, too, but it is a lovely place.</span> <span id="s1895">So I went, and also I had a cousin whom I loved there much and they had at the lake, a house there.</span> <span id="s1896">So that was very nice, and I went to Switzerland a lot, to the mountains, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Well, is there anything else that -- that you’d like to say that I haven’t asked you about that you think it’s -- in -- that you’d like to -- to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: I’d say to -- I’d like to say that the Americans are -- were awfully nice to me.</span> <span id="s1899">There was -- I -- e -- very slowly I worked up my studio where I had pupils, as an exercise teacher.</span> <span id="s1900">I didn’t do any photography here.</span> <span id="s1901">And I feel always a f -- I started underground, and it was hard to get really on the ground.</span> <span id="s1902">And during the war, or af -- right after the war -- ’47 it was in fact, one of my pupil one day ask me, do you care to use our farmhouse in New Hampshire?</span> <span id="s1903">I said I will ask my husband.</span> <span id="s1904">My husband at that time had no job, and wanted that I go alone on vacation because I needed it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, which I never would have done, to leave him in Boston alone.</span> <span id="s1905">And of course he was delighted.</span> <span id="s1906">We met.</span> <span id="s1907">Before, she didn’t know my husband, I didn't know her husband.</span> <span id="s1908">All I knew her during the time, during the war, she has taken me -- sometimes in the evening she invited me for dinner.</span> <span id="s1909">And my husband worked for -- sometime in the evening at the -- to make teeth [indecipherable] teeth, false teeth.</span> <span id="s1910">So I knew her only from that.</span> <span id="s1911">This farmhouse was in New Hampshire, surrounded by 2,000 acres woods.</span> <span id="s1912">It was a dream.</span> <span id="s1913">Then she told me, but it has no electricity.</span> <span id="s1914">And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get the water down.</span> <span id="s1915">It was so lovely, it’s -- the first time, of course, we were together.</span> <span id="s1916">And then we were also some weekends, I think, together.</span> <span id="s1917">And they saw that my husband repaired everything, whether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy.</span> <span id="s1918">And I, of course, cleaned the house.</span> <span id="s1919">So we got the key.</span> <span id="s1920">Until six -- ’69, we -- my whole family went there.</span> <span id="s1921">We always spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family.</span> <span id="s1922">They came from New York, the Streichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1923">We had the house all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer.</span> <span id="s1924">In winter we couldn’t, in the -- when it was snow.</span> <span id="s1925">And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they had there.</span> <span id="s1926">So we left our car up, and -- but the first year, ’47, when she asked me whether we want to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car.</span> <span id="s1927">They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me, would you care to use my car?</span> <span id="s1928">I go on the cruise.</span> <span id="s1929">So we had a car of another pupil.</span> <span id="s1930">I thought that the [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific.</span> <span id="s1931">To let the house have us.</span> <span id="s1932">All the time we were there.</span> <span id="s1933">They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street.</span> <span id="s1934">Do you know where the -- the church is of the -- not Albanian, it’s a -- it’s Sparks Street and Brattle Street, the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: In Cambridge, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Yeah, in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: I -- I’m sure I’ve been past it, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yeah, because there the parents lived, with the biggest garden in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s1939">And they lived in the back, there was a kind of museum of a professor and they lived there.</span> <span id="s1940">But then they moved to Maine and used -- very seldom they went to New Hampshire to the farm.</span> <span id="s1941">So we were all the time there.</span> <span id="s1942">In summer we were there, because it didn’t cost us anything.</span> <span id="s1943">And my sister Risa, Felix and the children and the grandchildren, everyone was there, til ’69, and then they sold that.</span> <span id="s1944">But then also my brother-in-law died and the -- we wouldn’t have gone any more as much up there.</span> <span id="s1945">But from ’47 to ’69, and it was so wonderful for all of us.</span> <span id="s1946">And we learned how to make [indecipherable] and we learned how to cut trees, we never did it, but we learned it from them, you know, to saw wood.</span> <span id="s1947">I learned to -- how is it called when you swing the -- and split?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: S-Split wood?</span> <span id="s1949">With the axe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: Split wood.</span> <span id="s1951">Not with the axe, I couldn’t do the axe and I know now why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: With the hatchet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: A hatchet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: No, no, with that -- yeah, with a hatchet, but you have a word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: A wedge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: A sledge -- sledgehammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Sledge -- yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: A sledgehammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Sledgehammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: That I could do, but I couldn’t do a axe, I think I was astigmatic and couldn’t point, you know, the axe.</span> <span id="s1962">But we worked in the woods, and it was just wonderful for us.</span> <span id="s1963">We -- the first year when we didn't know what to do in the woods, when we were there, we went on all the mountains around, because we loved so much.</span> <span id="s1964">So it was really, I have a very good experience.</span> <span id="s1965">And now, walking with a cane, and walking with one eye black, people want always to help me.</span> <span id="s1966">They are so kind, and I always hope not to be seen by my pupils with a cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Well, Mrs. Karplus, thank you very much for sharing some of your stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1969">D-Do you think you have enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: I think this has really been a -- a very, very good afternoon.</span> <span id="s1971">Thank you for your time.</span></p>
