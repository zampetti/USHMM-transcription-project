Well, first the uncle was well-informed of anything that was going on.</span> <span id="s43">He could not drop me off back to Slonim where my parents were because Slonim was already being occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s44">Since he lived in this small shtetl there, a village, we were able to run away through the forest.</span> <span id="s45">So he packed up the wagon, took his wife, other relatives and myself and we got traveling through the countryside.</span> <span id="s46">We reached some of the big cities like Minsk but that was being attacked and then we reached the city of Mogulovin (ph)(c.79) and Kiev and that was being attacked.</span> <span id="s47">By then the horses were of no use to us and whoever remained of the relatives, the group that ran away from the shtetl, we traveled by train to the southern part of Russia.</span> <span id="s48">I remember lots of times, the trains would be bombarded by German planes.</span> <span id="s49">Every time planes would be overhead, we would run out of--and hide and then continue with the trains.</span> <span id="s50">I don't know the exact time but the train took us all the way to the city of Samarkand which is in Uzbekistan in the southern part, southwestern part of Russia.</span> <span id="s51">There we settled among the natives.</span> <span id="s52">It was very hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Were there other refugees at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s55">We were a whole group of people coming--a lot of Jewish people especially--coming on the train and other trains.</span> <span id="s56">Because that was the only safe place, is the further away from central Russia.</span> <span id="s57">When we settled there, we had to get used to the environment.</span> <span id="s58">It was very hot, a totally new language, even though some of the people spoke Russian, but the natives did not.</span> <span id="s59">A lot of us, the European people got sick, either malaria or typhus.</span> <span id="s60">The water looked like black coffee with cream and mosquitos and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Well, we had little houses there, I remember, little mud houses.</span> <span id="s63">Apparently the uncle did bring with him some kind of money because we were able to get a house.</span> <span id="s64">But as soon as we came there within six months, his wife died, other relatives died and then he became sick.</span> <span id="s65">And I think he became disillusioned because he thought that he was a big shot and he thought that the Russians were going to help him, the government and everything else.</span> <span id="s66">But once we were there, everything stopped and everybody was on their own.</span> <span id="s67">So within a year also he died even though he was physically a very strong man and capable of taking care of himself but he just---I believe he died either of malaria or of typhus.</span> <span id="s68">He was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s69">I used to come and visit him and somehow some of the other relatives or acquaintances died and then what happened was that I was taken into a children's home.</span> <span id="s70">That particular place was a mixture of I would say mostly Jewish kids but there were also some Christians.</span> <span id="s71">It was run by the Russian government probably.</span> <span id="s72">I don't have too many recollections there For those who survived--I believe it was really a miracle to get out of that place because the facilities was terrible.</span> <span id="s73">We slept on the floor and the mattresses were lined up on the floor one next to the other.</span> <span id="s74">You had a little place just to put your head there.</span> <span id="s75">The food was terrible.</span> <span id="s76">I remember that--I mean the children there ran probably from the age of three and four to the age of fifteen and sixteen, whoever they could... It was a gathering point.</span> <span id="s77">Every morning, we would take the mattresses to dry out because the facilities....</span> <span id="s78">First of all, we did not have indoor plumbing, okay.</span> <span id="s79">We lived among the natives and the authorities were kind of harsh on us.</span> <span id="s80">Anything you would do, they would beat you and yell and reprimand.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">What language, did you speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Russian.</span> <span id="s83">At that time we spoke Russian there.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">You had learned it just by ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Yeah, but among ourselves we did talk Yiddish.</span> <span id="s86">We knew that we were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s87">There was some kind of Jewish influence because I remember the older people, the older children would even try to recite some of the prayers, like the Shema to let us know, especially the younger children that there is hope and that sooner or later, all of this will be over and we'll go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s88">Now, also there was a lot of activities from Samarkand in those years that Jews went to Palestine through--we were right on the Iranian border.</span> <span id="s89">If you look at a map you'll see that Iran was next to--and at that time they would go.</span> <span id="s90">And especially the Polish army started there and they would go from Samarkand and the other places to Iran, then Iraq, and then to Palestine.</span> <span id="s91">As a matter of fact, I was reading about Menachem Begin.</span> <span id="s92">He went through this same route and that's how he came to Palestine then.</span> <span id="s93">So a lot of people, a lot of the Jewish people escaped, came to Israel, Palestine through that part.</span> <span id="s94">Well I did not.</span> <span id="s95">I remember a lot of the children who were in the children's home died and there was somehow every time you could see a new child would come and somebody would die.</span> <span id="s96">There was very little fuss about it.</span> <span id="s97">A child died, it died.</span> <span id="s98">There was like nobody to cry for the child because the parents have died already and there were no relatives.</span> <span id="s99">To the authorities we were just another name or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Did you have a sense at this point about your family, that you wouldn't see them again?</span> <span id="s101">Did you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Honestly speaking, somehow I didn't think of them.</span> <span id="s103">I start to think about my family much later.</span> <span id="s104">In those days, I think I was too naive.</span> <span id="s105">It was a question of survival.</span> <span id="s106">We would, no, no....</span> <span id="s107">I never dreamt of going back to Poland or to my city where I was born, Slonim, to go back there and meet people.</span> <span id="s108">It was so far away and such a different life that nothing really materialized.</span> <span id="s109">The--so I believe in 1945, I always mix up the years, '45 and '46 so, but ....</span></p> <p><span id="s110">You were liberated in '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">In '45, after the war.</span> <span id="s112">I was then considered as a Polish refugee.</span> <span id="s113">All the refugees were allowed to go back to Poland since Poland was under the Russian rule anyway so they did not make a fuss.</span> <span id="s114">So what happened was that we came back to Poland so we traveled by train from Samarkand back to Poland and we came to the city of Warsaw .</span> <span id="s115">That was the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s116">There we were put into a big gathering place and from there probably we were supposed to be dispersed to other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">At that point, did you know what had happened?</span> <span id="s118">Did anyone know?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">We heard that--well when we came back we saw a lot of destruction, physical destruction.</span> <span id="s120">I really did not know at that point the magnitude what happened.</span> <span id="s121">I did not know about the camps.</span> <span id="s122">That I learned later when I was with the Jewish organizations in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s123">But I must say I was very naive, I knew very little.</span> <span id="s124">It was just a question of survival.</span> <span id="s125">If you could--there was a point where you could steal a piece of bread or outmaneuver somebody, you would go for it.</span> <span id="s126">I really, in those days, never knew what was really going on.</span> <span id="s127">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s128">But when we came back to Poland, to that gathering place, there was a feeling of--they start to call us Zyd which is Jew in Polish and that was a derogatory remark.</span> <span id="s129">Somehow the Jewish kids were not welcomed there.</span> <span id="s130">There was a lot of bad feelings.</span> <span id="s131">That I do remember that Jewish people, they would call them messengers, would come and find out who is a Jew because a lot of the Jewish kids then did speak Yiddish among themselves or they knew... Because somehow, I believe, when I was in Samarkand, the Jewish people there were not what the--what I would call the modern Jew or the sophisticated Jew who forgot their Judaism.</span> <span id="s132">because among ourselves we did know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s133">At least my uncle spoke always in Yiddish to me and my aunt and the people who were around me.</span> <span id="s134">So those people from eastern Europe, we still knew Yiddish.</span> <span id="s135">With the kids that I was back in Poland, it was very easily, we could be very easily detected that we were Jewish kids, okay.</span> <span id="s136">So as a result of that, the messengers, the Jewish messengers tried to separate us and take us away, steal us away from the Polish authorities.</span> <span id="s137">In those days, in 1946, I believe, the Jewish organizations started to blossom in Poland.</span> <span id="s138">As the picture indicates, I joined a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s139">At that time, I was taken to the city of Lodz and there was a lot of Jewish activity there.</span> <span id="s140">That was a stepping place for us to travel to Palestine.</span> <span id="s141">The food was good, Friday night we were singing traditional songs.</span> <span id="s142">They taught us a lot of traditional songs and there was a renewed spirit--it was a very good feeling then.</span> <span id="s143">We were happy, we were able to sing, able to express ourselves and there was some kind of feel that we are on the way--away from Poland--to be among the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s144">So I believe we were about 150 kids, gathered from all over.</span> <span id="s145">Some of the people knew Hebrew, we were taught a little bit of Hebrew and a lot of Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s146">From there we were on--I think we were about six months in Poland and we were traveling illegally throughout Europe.</span> <span id="s147">So we traveled from Poland to Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia we came to Austria, from Austria to Italy and we just passed through those places.</span> <span id="s148">In Italy was the stepping--was the gathering place for the illegal migration travels to Palestine, Israel.</span> <span id="s149">Here a very important thing happened that changed my whole life again.</span> <span id="s150">On the way to the southern port of Italy, the city was Bari, B-a-r-i, somehow I got sick.</span> <span id="s151">They could not take me because they--I'm sure they did not have the accommodations since everything was illegal.</span> <span id="s152">I was taken back to Rome and all of a sudden I was not any more among my own people.</span> <span id="s153">Then, okay what happened was, as long as I was in the kibbutz, I was protected from the outside elements.</span> <span id="s154">By that I mean nobody else had authority over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Was this done by the Joint or by the Hechalutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">The Hechalutz movement with the cooperation of the Joint and the Jewish agencies to have us, whoever was in charge of the aliyah.</span> <span id="s157">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s158">But everything was organized.</span> <span id="s159">We were fed good, we were given clothing.</span> <span id="s160">There was always people to show us the way and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Do you remember any individuals or any names?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">No, I would not know.</span> <span id="s163">I don't know any names.</span> <span id="s164">But all I know is that once I start in the kibbutz, we were well taken care of.</span> <span id="s165">And even though we had to travel by foot to a lot of the places, like from Austria to Italy, we traveled by foot illegally through the borders... The way I understand this is that the borders were-- the border guards or whoever the authorities, they were taken care of so we could go through.</span> <span id="s166">That was a fact but it was still illegal to go through all of these places but we managed to go through.</span> <span id="s167">Like I say, when I was with these people, I think we were 150, I was protected from the outside elements, meaning Jewish or anything else.</span> <span id="s168">All of a sudden when I came--when I got sick and I came back to Rome, I was vulnerable to the outside people and this is where I change my life took place.</span> <span id="s169">Because what happened then was that the religious people, the religious groups, like Agudat Yisrael.</span> <span id="s170">You see in those days, everything you had to belong to a group.</span> <span id="s171">You had to belong whether it was to the left or to the right, or to the orthodox groups because I believe everything was registered and the groups or the associations would receive money to support you.</span> <span id="s172">So all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some people came and they started to talk to me and give me food and give me probably money or whatever and make me feel good and tell me that I should go with them.</span> <span id="s173">All of a sudden I was in an organization, Agudat Yisrael which was an orthodox group.</span> <span id="s174">I stayed with them for awhile.</span> <span id="s175">They prepared me in the orthodox way of life and they also said that they were going to Israel.</span> <span id="s176">But to them, Israel was not as important politically speaking because those people tried to migrate to the United States, a lot of them to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">But they were all based in Rome?</span> <span id="s178">Everyone was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">In Rome and they were in other outside places of Rome.</span> <span id="s180">They functioned quite well.</span> <span id="s181">So I was taken to that place and a few months later, I was actually--I was in the Agudat Yisrael in Livorno, in southern probably about 100 miles away from Rome.</span> <span id="s182">It's also on the coast.</span> <span id="s183">That's where they were.</span> <span id="s184">Then I was taken back to Rome and I was put into a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s185">The yeshiva as you can see from the pictures was also made out of refugees from Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s186">Most of those people were the real Hasidim from--who survived the war and from way back.</span> <span id="s187">Because each one belonged to different Hasidic groups like to the Gerer and the Satmar.</span> <span id="s188">Since I called myself a Litvak, I had nothing to do with the Hasidic movement.</span> <span id="s189">But I was in the yeshiva because that's where I was taken in.</span> <span id="s190">Somehow, as soon as I was taken in to the yeshiva, I remembered the very first thing they did to me is they cut my hair.</span> <span id="s191">As you can see in the picture, that was a total different style of life and after a while they called me a shaygitz[gentile boy] because I did not conform to their way of life.</span> <span id="s192">I did not wear the tzitzis outside and I did not have peyes and suffered.</span> <span id="s193">Anyways...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">That makes you a shaygitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Oh, yeah... Okay.</span> <span id="s196">From the yeshiva what happened was--they started--okay they ask me if I have relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s197">I said yes because everybody has relatives.</span> <span id="s198">So they took my name and they spread it, I think it was in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s199">As a matter of fact, they send my name like in those days what happened was--names of survivors appeared in the Jewish newspapers like the Forwards and Der Tog and the Morgen Journal, in all the papers.</span> <span id="s200">Here of all the names I had an aunt here in Boston, Dorchester that was reading, went through the names and saw my name.</span> <span id="s201">Remembering that as a maiden her name was the same way, so she put two and two together and somehow correspondence started.</span> <span id="s202">I am a nephew--I was recognized as being part of the family.</span> <span id="s203">This is interesting because my grandfather had 14 children with two wives, okay.</span> <span id="s204">He had ten children with the first wife.</span> <span id="s205">Most of those children came to the United States in the early twenties, okay.</span> <span id="s206">The youngest of the aunts whom I had here left my father who was a little child in Europe.</span> <span id="s207">My father was the youngest child from the second wife.</span> <span id="s208">So of the 14 children, he was the very youngest.</span> <span id="s209">He hardly knew any--I would say that if they would have met him, they could not recognize him that it is their brother.</span> <span id="s210">They send me a picture, they send a picture to Italy in the yeshiva of my parents and I did recognize that they were my parents.</span> <span id="s211">So that was proof that I am a Milkow.</span> <span id="s212">Then what happened was they started the proceedings for me to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s213">Okay, the yeshiva was 100% in favor for me to go to the United States rather than to go to Israel and join the old kibbutz.</span> <span id="s214">As far as they were concerned, I should have totally forgotten my previous association with the kibbutz because they were not orthodox and so forth.</span> <span id="s215">Now what happened was that, okay, here are another turn of events happened and this I just received papers, documentation that it really--even though it happened but I never had any proof.</span> <span id="s216">What happened was the yeshiva as a unit came to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">What was the name of the yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Yeshiva Meor Hagolah.</span> <span id="s219">The Light of the Diaspora.</span> <span id="s220">Okay?</span> <span id="s221">I could have gone with them as part of the yeshiva and there would have been no problem.</span> <span id="s222">However, my relatives wanted me to come to the United States, okay.</span> <span id="s223">I was--so what happened, the yeshiva migrated in 1948 as a unit to Canada, Montreal.</span> <span id="s224">I remained in Italy.</span> <span id="s225">Once again, you see, that's the second time I was left out.</span> <span id="s226">Once I was left out because I got sick and I couldn't go with my kibbutz and now the yeshiva left and I remained in Italy but under the supervision of other orthodox groups who were in touch with the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s227">I was still under their domination.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">How would you _____domination?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Whatever.</span> <span id="s230">Anyway, but meanwhile a lot of correspondence was going on from the relatives who lived in Boston to Canada, to Italy to get me into the United States.</span> <span id="s231">Well, the United States consulate refused to give me a visa, okay.</span> <span id="s232">Somebody decided that the best thing for me would be to go to Canada and from Canada I'll go to the United States.</span> <span id="s233">The year was already 1949, the end of 1949 and most of the refugees who lived in refugee camps in Italy and there were hundreds and thousands of them migrated, either to the United States or to Israel or South Africa, wherever.</span> <span id="s234">But there were already--- They were closing the quotas?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Right, they were closing the borders.</span> <span id="s236">It subsided.</span> <span id="s237">I was the refugee where in '46 and '47, you could see hundreds and thousands.</span> <span id="s238">All of a sudden, everything became smaller.</span> <span id="s239">Everybody tried to get out of Italy and find a place.</span> <span id="s240">Well, I am still in Italy.</span> <span id="s241">So what they decided is for me to go to Canada and from Canada I would go to--migrate to my relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s242">Well, in 1949, December 1949, I arrived in Canada by ship.</span> <span id="s243">I came to the yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">You did it all by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s246">But the Jewish agency, the Joint and the IRO took care of that.</span> <span id="s247">Actually also the relatives, at this point, I think had to contribute some kind of money or whatever.</span> <span id="s248">Oh, yeah, I traveled, I was very sophisticated.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s250">So I came to Canada, I was in the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s251">And within a week or so, one of my cousins came to visit me.</span> <span id="s252">This particular people--(a)--they were very prosperous in the United States.</span> <span id="s253">They had--so and I would say they were sophisticated.</span> <span id="s254">I mean they were professional business people.</span> <span id="s255">They came to Canada and they saw me.</span> <span id="s256">Somehow, from the image that they had of me, before they saw me, and the image that they had of me and the environment that I was in was a total different picture, okay.</span> <span id="s257">All of a sudden, they walk in.</span> <span id="s258">They saw the Hasidic movement and they saw me and I believe that somehow, they lost their appetite.</span> <span id="s259">They tried desperately, maybe they lost their appetite for the environment that I was in rather than the appetite for me, I'm not sure what happened.</span> <span id="s260">But they tried desperately to get me out of Canada to the United States.</span> <span id="s261">They were not successful.</span> <span id="s262">And I was in Montreal until, I believe, May 15.</span> <span id="s263">They took me out from the yeshiva and they set me up from the Jewish agency, Jewish Children and Family Service in Montreal and they even send me to a public school.</span> <span id="s264">And I was living with a--like a private family, okay.</span> <span id="s265">Then as I was doing that, they were working for me to go back to Italy.</span> <span id="s266">Yeah, I know it's strange.</span> <span id="s267">Anyways, on May 15, they decided that I should go back to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Who decided this?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">The cousins.</span> <span id="s270">Because from Canada, I was unable to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s271">I had to wait to become a Canadian citizen and then go to the United States.</span> <span id="s272">Supposedly, I was supposed to go back to Italy for two weeks and everything was arranged in Italy for me to come directly to the United States.</span> <span id="s273">Well, needless to say, this never materialized and two weeks passed and a month passed and another month passed.</span> <span id="s274">And I was stuck in Italy.</span> <span id="s275">I couldn't go back to Canada because I only had a two-week visa so I couldn't go back to Canada, I couldn't come to the United States.</span> <span id="s276">From that period of time, letters and documentation was written.</span> <span id="s277">It went as far as to the Congressman Christian Herter who later became the governor.</span> <span id="s278">I have a whole bunch of letters proving that everybody worked on my behalf and nobody could do anything.</span> <span id="s279">Well anyways, finally in August 15, 1950, I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s280">And basically, a whole new chapter started because I came to the United States and I was not prepared for my family.</span> <span id="s281">I would say that not that I was not prepared for them, they were not prepared for me.</span> <span id="s282">I had five aunts and uncles here.</span> <span id="s283">The youngest was 65 and over.</span> <span id="s284">I had a cousin who was in her sixties.</span> <span id="s285">Her mother--I had an uncle here who was in the nineties.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Can I stop the tape and flip it over for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Okay, go ahead.</span> <span id="s288">So anyways, when I came to the United States, somehow I don't think the family really know what to do with me, how to handle me.</span> <span id="s289">The simple reason is, they were uneducated, they still were reading the Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s290">Okay, what happened is some were--two families were real orthodox, the others were not and there was a clash between them and their own children.</span> <span id="s291">The children started to move away from--what I call the Jewish ghetto, self-imposed Jewish ghetto, and move out a little bit to suburbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">This is all in Massachusetts?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">This is all in Massachusetts, yeah.</span> <span id="s294">As you know, the Jewish people lived among themselves.</span> <span id="s295">So, they really did not know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s296">Some said for me to continue life like I--to send me to New York to a yeshiva and continue there.</span> <span id="s297">Some wanted me to be the all-American boy and go to public school.</span> <span id="s298">I was torn between them because I was going to one uncle's place and I did not have to wear a yamulka.</span> <span id="s299">Going to another place, I did have to wear a yamulka.</span> <span id="s300">For Shabbat, the orthodox families wanted me to have them with me because they didn't trust the other family and then the cousins who worked all of that--to get me into the United States--they did not agree with anybody.</span> <span id="s301">Finally, the end result was that I was put into---with a Jewish Family and Children's Service in Boston and they took care of me.</span> <span id="s302">I was put into a small children's home; there were only about 20, 25 kids.</span> <span id="s303">Mostly from natives who lost their parents or the parents were divorced or whatever.</span> <span id="s304">So I was put into that kind of place.</span> <span id="s305">I believe I stayed at least a year.</span> <span id="s306">Then I was put into a foster home.</span> <span id="s307">All of this, the children's home and the foster home was within the perimeter of my uncles because everything was in walking distance.</span> <span id="s308">So here I had an uncle two blocks away on one side, two blocks away on the other side and I lived with foster parents and in between.</span> <span id="s309">So I could walk over to one family, walk over to the other family but I could not sleep over.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Did the Jewish Social Services take over because there was so much feuding with the family or.</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Yes.</span> <span id="s314">Well the cousins saw to it.</span> <span id="s315">Actually--probably they meant good.</span> <span id="s316">The cousins saw to it that I really did not have a life among my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s317">They were so diversified, like I said.</span> <span id="s318">The orthodox people really did not know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s319">And those who--traditional but like the uncle worked... By the way the uncles were married to my father's sisters so they were really the outsiders.</span> <span id="s320">And so I lived with the foster parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">You were about what fourteen or thirteen years old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Yes, something like it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">What schooling... now I assume you didn't have schooling when you lived in Samarkand.</span> <span id="s324">.</span> <span id="s325">?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Okay, let's go back to schooling.</span> <span id="s327">While I was in the children's home in Samarkand, I think we did have some kind of schooling there.</span> <span id="s328">I remember very little of that.</span> <span id="s329">It was--we did not go to a formal school.</span> <span id="s330">Probably the schooling was within the children's home itself.</span> <span id="s331">We did know Russian, some Polish and I really don't know how formal it was.</span> <span id="s332">Now, until on the way back to Poland,-- okay.</span> <span id="s333">When I was in the kibbutz, I learned some kind of Hebrew and probably mostly Zionism because I would hear words like Jabotinsky (ph)(c.684) and I know about Menachim Begin in Italy.</span> <span id="s334">So there was no formal education, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">No math and science and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s337">Then when I came to the yeshiva, all I learned was the Siddur and Humash and all of that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s338">But definitely nothing to do with math or science.</span> <span id="s339">As a matter of act, an incident happened that I knew how to read Yiddish.</span> <span id="s340">Once while I was in the yeshiva, I picked up a book, which at that time I did not realize it, but it was a book by Mendele Mocher Seforim.</span> <span id="s341">And when I looked at it, first of all I associated that seferim is sefer which would be orthodox.</span> <span id="s342">Because they were talking about seferim so I thought it was an orthodox book and I was reading it.</span> <span id="s343">Then I showed it to some of the boys in the yeshiva and next time--and I was very proud of it.</span> <span id="s344">Next, I was called to the rosh hayeshiva and he started to hit me in my face.</span> <span id="s345">And start to yell at me, how dare I to read books that are forbidden, forbidden books.</span> <span id="s346">I couldn't reason with them and there was nothing to reason.</span> <span id="s347">I mean, they knew what they were talking about so then probably... The more they were in their beliefs, the more I was in my belief that I--the opposite way.</span> <span id="s348">No, okay--when I came in Canada for three months, I was going to--I was a fourth grader because I have a report card to prove it.</span> <span id="s349">I didn't even remember that.</span> <span id="s350">I did good in math but I didn't do good in any of the other subjects.</span> <span id="s351">Like I was supposed to take French and English and all of that kind of stuff, I didn't do good.</span> <span id="s352">English I did better than French, okay.</span> <span id="s353">Then when I came to the United States, I came here in August, 1950.</span> <span id="s354">From 1950, September 1950 through probably June '51, I went to a preparatory school.</span> <span id="s355">And then in 1951, I was put into a regular high school.</span> <span id="s356">So I went through the mandatory four years of high school and I did graduate from high school.</span> <span id="s357">I did good through the four years in math, I did good.</span> <span id="s358">As a matter of fact, one year I got an A in algebra and stuff like that so I did good in math.</span> <span id="s359">I took German, I did good and I took Latin, I did good.</span> <span id="s360">Because Latin was the closest to Italian, so I was able to do good in that... American history, I could not understand.</span> <span id="s361">a. I could not--I was unable to understand the inner workings of the American history and the language was hard so I didn't do good in that subject.</span> <span id="s362">But I did graduate and while I was in high school, I had an afternoon job and I was working.</span> <span id="s363">And while--and then--I'm thinking---six years--so in 1954 I entered the Hebrew College.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">In Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">In Boston, in Brookline.</span> <span id="s366">And I was--took me two years in the high school instead of four years and four years in the college program.</span> <span id="s367">So in six years, I graduated the high school in two years and the college in four years.</span> <span id="s368">So there I had a good Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s369">One year, in my junior year, they send me for a year to Israel to study.</span> <span id="s370">So that was good, I liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Did you ever go look up your kibbutz people?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s373">I had no idea, I should have, I should have.</span> <span id="s374">Because at that time, I still could have probably located them.</span> <span id="s375">But, honestly speaking, in 1958, I was very insecure of myself, very insecure.</span> <span id="s376">By then, I had lost my association with the family here.</span> <span id="s377">Most of them died, the cousins hardly knew me and everything that I did, I did on my own.</span> <span id="s378">So as long as I was still in school, especially in the Hebrew college, I felt I was among my own people, who in a way understood me.</span> <span id="s379">I could express myself with them, I also had spent about ten years in Camp Yavneh which is associated with the Hebrew College.</span> <span id="s380">I worked there in the camp and that was very good for me and the people accepted me.</span> <span id="s381">I really was very--I lived with people who were not relatives even though they were very good to me.</span> <span id="s382">Everything I did, I had to do on my own.</span> <span id="s383">The best thing that I decided which was really against my family was to go to the Hebrew College.</span> <span id="s384">Some of them want me to be the all-American boy and forget Judaism and forget everything else and I felt that that was a part of me.</span> <span id="s385">So I did go to the Hebrew College and I did graduate and until about two years ago, for about thirty years, I managed to teach Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s386">l feel l took as much as possible an interest in Jewish life as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">You--basically Hebrew teaching became your career?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Yes.</span> <span id="s389">The only problem is that you don't make a living out of it, okay.</span> <span id="s390">So as a result of that, I had to work to make a living and for the past 25 years, I've been in the same place.</span> <span id="s391">The company accepted me for all my mishagoss that I have and everything else.</span> <span id="s392">And I've been with them and thank G__, I was able to make a living from them and support a family.</span> <span id="s393">I didn't say anything about the family so I'll say a few words about the family.</span> <span id="s394">In 1963, I got married.</span> <span id="s395">We have been--I've been very fortunate because I have a very good wife and two very nice children.</span> <span id="s396">And there is a lot of feeling between us.</span> <span id="s397">It was, I believe, that married life was good for me because I felt that I did belong to something.</span> <span id="s398">The important thing is that I can share my--towards--with somebody and--the problems was that when you grow up by yourself and you share everything with yourself and think of life as an individual so as a--and then being--you see the important thing was you have to be, you have to belong to something.</span> <span id="s399">If you are a unit by yourself, you don't belong to anything.</span> <span id="s400">So being married was the right thing and it lasted and it's good.</span> <span id="s401">I hope it continues and ________.</span> <span id="s402">(c.809) Glad to hear it.</span> <span id="s403">Can I ask you again to go way back?</span> <span id="s404">Are there any incidents other than the life in the children's home in Samarkand or anything that happened in Uzbekistan that you can remember?</span> <span id="s405">Episodes or things that stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Well, the episodes that stand out in my mind are like this.</span> <span id="s407">Everything was very regimented in the children's home.</span> <span id="s408">Before that, my uncle--I used to visit him.</span> <span id="s409">I don't remember how my aunt died.</span> <span id="s410">She died before my uncle and I really don't have too good a recollection of her.</span> <span id="s411">With him, I had, I believe, a closer association.</span> <span id="s412">So while he was in the hospital, I would go in every day to visit him.</span> <span id="s413">And we would sit and we would talk.</span> <span id="s414">What I know about my parents is what he told me.</span> <span id="s415">He would say to me that, I remember, the way he said it is.....He would say it, of course, in Yiddish, not to forget.</span> <span id="s416">I remember he would say.</span> <span id="s417">forgesh nisht mine kind (c.830) He would indicate to me--he would let me know that we are here in a place, that it is a temporary place and if and when I get out of the place to remember what had happened.</span> <span id="s418">He had a feeling that he was not going to survive.</span> <span id="s419">Every day, it's very --- he was a man that was not a traditional Jew in the shtetl as we would picture to be.</span> <span id="s420">In other words, if you would neglect to go on a Shabbat to services, it would not bother him.</span> <span id="s421">But he was very nationalistic and he knew he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s422">He spoke Yiddish even though he was, all his life working with the gentiles and trading with them.</span> <span id="s423">I would say horse-trading but he knew what he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Do you have any pictures of this uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">No, I don't, no I don't have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">The chances are slim...that's the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">No, no, no,--because what happened was from Samarkand, I did not bring anything with me.</span> <span id="s428">I don't even have any proof that I was in Samarkand.</span> <span id="s429">The only proof is --that I was in Samarkand is what I remember.</span> <span id="s430">The only pictures that I have is when I was in the kibbutz and they took the formal pictures in the kibbutz of each individual and the group picture.</span> <span id="s431">That started my picture collection.</span> <span id="s432">As a matter of fact, when I was in the yeshiva, they confiscated the pictures.</span> <span id="s433">And for a long, long time I did not have them.</span> <span id="s434">Finally towards the end when they were already away, somebody gave them to me.</span> <span id="s435">The relatives here in the United States are all from my father's side, you see.</span> <span id="s436">I was from all the relatives from my mother's side so I survived, it's funny, I survived because her relatives took me away.</span> <span id="s437">And yet I came to the United States with my--the whole family is from my father's side.</span> <span id="s438">I do remember that in the children's home, they would beat us a lot and we would do a lot of stealing.</span> <span id="s439">Like if you would have an extra piece of bread or whatever, you would keep it under your pillow.</span> <span id="s440">Then you would go try to pick it up, it would be taken away so one would steal from the other.</span> <span id="s441">We would also go in groups from the natives and steal things like tomatoes or eggs or whatever that you could eat; or grapes, they had a lot of grapes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Were you hungry all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s444">But if you would get caught by the natives, they would beat you up badly.</span> <span id="s445">If they would bring you into the children's home, then you would get a double dose and the authorities would beat you up for going to the natives.</span> <span id="s446">Somehow I do remember that they would emphasize that Samarkand was the city that Alexander the Great was there.</span> <span id="s447">I remember they would take us sometimes to the mountains, because there were an awful lot of mountains.</span> <span id="s448">As a matter of fact, the building that we were in, was a one-story long building, made out of clay.</span> <span id="s449">And I--it's funny--I remember the mattresses.</span> <span id="s450">I remember them taken out.</span> <span id="s451">I do not remember a dining room, a place where we were eating.</span> <span id="s452">So I don't have too much of a -- of Samarkand.</span> <span id="s453">In Poland--okay let me go back to my parents.</span> <span id="s454">In Poland---- I assume they were orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s456">My parents--the way I understand--they were poor people.</span> <span id="s457">My father, being a baker--okay what I remember is-- That must have been in 1940 or '41, before I came to my uncle because I came there in the summertime, my father worked in the barracks for the Russians because the Russians came there in '39.</span> <span id="s458">What would happen is we would--I think where we lived we had one or two rooms at that time.</span> <span id="s459">Now I don't know if it was because of the war or maybe in 1939, we lived somewhere else, that I don't remember.</span> <span id="s460">But we had only two small rooms and he would work a whole day and at night he would come; or whenever he would come, he would bring some bread with him.</span> <span id="s461">The bread, most of the time, would be like broken in pieces but it was something.</span> <span id="s462">And then we would share it with the people who lived around us.</span> <span id="s463">I think where we lived at that time were like barracks, I would call it now.</span> <span id="s464">I don't know if it was --I'm sure it wasn't of their own choice but I do not know whether before 1939, they had a better place or in 1939 they had to run away and came....</span> <span id="s465">But I feel that they were like in barracks.</span> <span id="s466">I remember the poverty there and I remember him going to the--coming back with bags of bread and we would all share it.</span> <span id="s467">I remember my mother going to the marketplace.</span> <span id="s468">In those days you had open marketplaces, that they would come and sell stuff.</span> <span id="s469">Looking at the pictures, I could see that they were troubled people.</span> <span id="s470">Another thing is --also I feel that my father was not too much of an educated man.</span> <span id="s471">For instance, here is a card, that is Milkow, okay, and here is the city of Slonim, see that, Slonim.</span> <span id="s472">This is in 1940, that's the only picture that he sent to Dorchester.</span> <span id="s473">Of course that was the uncle I came to.</span> <span id="s474">This is in Russian, written in Russian.</span> <span id="s475">Now judging from that, from the picture of my father and mother that they had sent to the United States, probably that particular picture was mailed in the 40's.</span> <span id="s476">That particular picture of my parents was--you could see on their faces--they were not--I mean if you look at the face, you could see that this is a disturbed man, okay.</span> <span id="s477">Because an earlier picture I have of them, an earlier picture of them, you could see he was better dressed.</span> <span id="s478">And somehow, you see this is what I studied.</span> <span id="s479">No hair, so he must have been--looks like an army picture.</span> <span id="s480">Where here he did have hair and you could see that a disturbed face.</span> <span id="s481">So also taking a picture like this, it could be that this kind of picture was a documentation picture for the authorities, okay.</span> <span id="s482">So---this is the grandfather, this is one of his sons.</span> <span id="s483">Now I want to show you here, I know it is visual but--this is--look at the beautiful writing.</span> <span id="s484">I want to show you even if--see I have inherited---this is a beautiful handwriting.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">That's your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">No, no, that's my grandfather.</span> <span id="s487">My father, I show you, he was not--look this is his handwriting.</span> <span id="s488">Okay, this is my father's handwriting, which is not bad but----.</span> <span id="s489">See this is a classic.</span> <span id="s490">This handwriting is a classic.</span> <span id="s491">I showed it once when I went to the Hebrew College and I showed them this.</span> <span id="s492">They were all astonished because you know the....</span> <span id="s493">This is before, this is also Slonim.</span> <span id="s494">from my father Lazer Milkow, he spells it here with an F.</span> <span id="s495">But in 193_, I cannot make out--- but in 193_.</span> <span id="s496">.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">'31.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Thirty-one,l okay.</span> <span id="s499">So that was Poland, okay.</span> <span id="s500">I don't know--When I was able--the relatives they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s501">Actually I took it from them and I kept it all the years.</span> <span id="s502">So basically this is what I can tell you.</span> <span id="s503">I realize it is not...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Do you know their approximate dates of birth?</span> <span id="s505">Do you know how old they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s507">I don't even know my own.</span> <span id="s508">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s509">I wish...</span></p> <p><span id="s510">So this would be you?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s512">I don't know if this is me.</span> <span id="s513">Right, I don['t know when this picture was taken.</span> <span id="s514">I think I made a copy of this.</span> <span id="s515">The original one was....</span> <span id="s516">Here's the original picture.</span> <span id="s517">See I don't know.</span> <span id="s518">---It says Slonim.</span></p> <p><span
