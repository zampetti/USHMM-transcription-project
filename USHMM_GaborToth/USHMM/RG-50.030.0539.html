Saul Merin, on April 19th, 2009.</span> <span id="s15">We are very, very pleased that you have agreed to come and speak with us today.</span> <span id="s16">The interview is about your life story, and we’ll start, as we always do, at the beginning.</span> <span id="s17">Can you tell us some details about your birth, about your family, about the world that you were born into?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: And, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s19">I-I was born in a township, what they called shtetl, the small towns where most Jewish people lived in Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s20">This township was called Bendzin.</span> <span id="s21">It had a – between 50 and 60,000 people – population.</span> <span id="s22">And it was similar to so many other places like this.</span> <span id="s23">It was in southwest Poland, very close to the German border, of more than maybe five miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Was it a contested territory with Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it.</span> <span id="s26">It was in Silesia, Silesia.</span> <span id="s27">Schilesia in – in German.</span> <span id="s28">And the Germans thought that this is their country.</span> <span id="s29">The Poles thought that this is their country.</span> <span id="s30">Before the war, all of Lower Silesia was next to Germany, and Upper Silesia, most of it belonged to Germany.</span> <span id="s31">A small part rem-remained Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: In Bendzin, was it a multi-cultural town?</span> <span id="s33">Were there Germans living there, and Poles living there and Jews living there?</span> <span id="s34">A: That’s right, but really, the majority were Jewish people, in the town itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: How large was –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: About 60 percent.</span> <span id="s37">About 60 percent of the people living in Bendzin were – were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s38">And they – their language mostly was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s43">While a – in addition, they learned Polish, and knew Polish, but Yiddish was the major language.</span> <span id="s44">And there were people who lived there and spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: We spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s47">And – at home, it was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s48">I knew, of course, very well, Polish.</span> <span id="s49">And I knew a little of German, not much.</span> <span id="s50">But I learned German during the war, and after the war, as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And how is it – how was the town’s structure in social classes, for example?</span> <span id="s52">Were – were Jews in a certain merchant class, or a certain class and Poles in another and Germans in another?</span> <span id="s53">How was that split up?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: The whole town was poor.</span> <span id="s55">Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in town.</span> <span id="s56">Poverty among all classes.</span> <span id="s57">It was among Germans and among – among Poles, and among the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s58">The – the poverty was manifested by – by the houses, which were terrible dwellings.</span> <span id="s59">Many of them, there were no washrooms in the house, they have to go out to the courtyard.</span> <span id="s60">Sometimes this was seen even in – in houses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there.</span> <span id="s61">They had to go down and – life was not easy, not nice.</span> <span id="s62">Jewish people lived there probably for longer than many other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King Casimir.</span> <span id="s63">Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish.</span> <span id="s64">Kazimierz the Great.</span> <span id="s65">He was the Polish king in the 14th century who united Poland.</span> <span id="s66">This is why they called him the Great.</span> <span id="s67">After he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat –</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was that the Treaty of Lublin?</span> <span id="s69">Was he part –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No.</span> <span id="s73">This was – a-and he – he really thought – he ruled over Poland.</span> <span id="s74">This was unusual in Poland, because Poland was – the noblemen rule – ruled the country, not the king.</span> <span id="s75">But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14th century, must have been about 1345.</span> <span id="s76">He invited the Jews of Germany to come over and live in Poland.</span> <span id="s77">And he promised that he will take care of it – of them, he will support them, and th – especially, he will be the one who will defend them, if there will be problems about – in – in Poland.</span> <span id="s78">The Jews heard it and they just couldn’t come at a better time for the Poles, and for the Jews, cause this was the time after the plague, after the plague, disease, the plague epidemic, the Black Plague.</span> <span id="s79">While the Germans, which – which maybe – nobody knows how much, but it probably was not less than a quarter of the – of European population who perished at that time from the disease, from the epidemic, and they possibly wa – it came up from 50 percent a – of the jew – of the European population.</span> <span id="s80">The plague was brought by an Italian ship from the east, from somewhere in the east.</span> <span id="s81">The story goes, in 1943, the – the ship came and they tried to disembark in Messina, in south [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Not 1943, some pa – some other point, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: In 1343.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: 1343.</span> <span id="s86">And in Messina, the customs officer came on the ship and looked what kind of, how do you call it –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Goods they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Goods, what kind of goods they brought with them.</span> <span id="s89">And then he has seen th-the sick sailors.</span> <span id="s90">He has seen this, he left the ship.</span> <span id="s91">He told them, you are not allowed to go to Messina, you must leave immediately the port.</span> <span id="s92">And they left and they went around into Venice.</span> <span id="s93">In Venice they disembarked.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Brought down the goods.</span> <span id="s96">And unfortunately, one of the problems was, later for the Jews, that one of the businessmen in Switzerland had a Jew for his assistant.</span> <span id="s97">And – sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: And he was sent to Venice to bring the goods.</span> <span id="s100">And he came over there and took the goods and came back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s101">The goods were infected, like all of the goods which were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: This is – excuse me for interrupting, but it’s interesting to hear history – first of all, I’ll back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s103">I have a theory, it’s a not very deep theory, it’s a little superficial, but I have a theory that east Europeans carry around their history for 600 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Whereas Americans don’t remember what Vietnam War was: that’s already ancient history.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: How right you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And listening to you now, I hear an east European, because – because –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: This was just 600 years –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: – from that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And – and I’m wondering whether – whether these were stories and this was history that you grew up with in a – in order to explain how the Jews came to Bendzin, or is this –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: – information that you learned later, history that you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: No, it was – no, I th – I think I knew about it already as a child.</span> <span id="s115">I knew about it, because it’s very important for the life of Jewish people in Bendzin.</span> <span id="s116">You see, when the plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the plague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of the European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a –</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Result.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: – result of this.</span> <span id="s119">And when he invited the Jews to come, tens of thousands left Germany into Poland.</span> <span id="s120">Poland, til then, had one small community in Kalish(ph), a town more to the north [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s121">And after this there were many communities which were put up.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So you could sa – so one could say that Bendzin was one of the oldest Jewish communities in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes, that’s what I think, yes.</span> <span id="s124">This wa – this was what we knew about it.</span> <span id="s125">This was one of the oldest – because Jews settled near the king they loved.</span> <span id="s126">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: This is the other point I wanted to bring up, th – and again, excuse me for interrupting, but it sounds from what you’re saying, is that there are traces of a Polish patriot in you, in your telling, because of – now, I could be wrong, I’m – this is why I’m testing this out, because it sounds like the story was a favorable story to Poland, that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live.</span> <span id="s128">It was a country that offered survival and reprieve.</span> <span id="s129">And the reason I – I – I bring this up is that just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic studies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many Jews believed that about Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Many Jews believed that about where they lived.</span> <span id="s132">And so that’s why I’m asking you, is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: – is there something to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, I agree fully with this.</span> <span id="s136">Many Jews believe that they are – they are Jewish, but they – that the Poles can be depended upon, and we should live with the Poles.</span> <span id="s137">Th-This happened at the time of Tadeusz Kościuszko, when Berek Yoselevich(ph), a Jew from Warsaw, from the other side of Warsaw, Fraha – Fraga(ph).</span> <span id="s138">He put up a battalion that fought in the mutiny of Kościuszko, as a separate battalion under – under the order of – of yos – of Berek Yoselevich(ph), Berek Yoselovich.</span> <span id="s139">And Poles that remember this, will find his name anywhere oret – of how he fought.</span> <span id="s140">He fell in – in combat.</span> <span id="s141">He died in combat.</span> <span id="s142">But he dus –anyhow, in – in Bendzin, most Jews went to Kraków.</span> <span id="s143">Kraków was the place where the king lived, and they put up a town near Kraków and called it Kazimierz, which is this still today, after the king.</span> <span id="s144">But in this place, the castle which he built, on the shores of a river, he – this town was built, Bendzin, and Jews lived there, I think for centuries.</span> <span id="s145">I lived in the place where I was born, and I lived on the street corner called the Street of the Castle.</span> <span id="s146">And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was in the same –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: That was that close?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: It was very close, yes.</span> <span id="s149">It was on the same street.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you live di – were you born into one of those houses that had four stories high, and a courtyard below?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly like this.</span> <span id="s152">For there were three, like buildings around a courtyard, and I lived on the third floor in one of them, on the – the site where there was no building like this, there was a small building of three stores only, or what do – what – shops in the lower floor, and then two floors of apartments, which belonged to my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So, it was extended family who lived together?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Let’s turn a little bit to your own family, within this context, within this community and within this history.</span> <span id="s156">When were you born?</span> <span id="s157">What was the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: 1933.</span> <span id="s159">August, 1930 – end of August, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: August?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: But the date in August was – I – August –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: August 25th, 1933.</span> <span id="s165">Were you the only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, my sister was born two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: But there were the two of you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s170">And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Dina.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Nina?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Dina.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Dina.</span> <span id="s175">And your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: My father was Itzhak, Itzhak, and he belonged to the family Merin, that lived in this place, at least documented, I know, 200 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah, 200 – 1820, I could see the name of Merin written down in the Jewish community, where they had the list of all newborns, you know, and saw his name, the name Merin came back – back several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: My mo – my mother was Gruen, g-r-u-e-n, that’s the way –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Gruen?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Gruen.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: That’s the way they have written it.</span> <span id="s185">It’s probably more German, like this, the u-e.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: And they –</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: – she was born in – Gitl(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Gitl(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s192">She was born in a village nearby, a village about 20 miles from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: In this – in Bendzin, if there was such poverty, what did people do to make their – earn their living?</span> <span id="s194">How did they earn their living?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I think it was lot different from other places in Poland.</span> <span id="s196">They lived there as owners of small shops.</span> <span id="s197">This was – my father had a small shop given to him by his father, by my grandfather.</span> <span id="s198">And he became very religious, and – and my mother was really running it.</span> <span id="s199">And I –</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: What did you sell?</span> <span id="s201">What –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: They were selling all kinds of – they called it galanteria in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: You know, okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: So this was a galanteria.</span> <span id="s207">Was a big sign galanteria, I remember this as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: All kinds of haberdashery, I think would be the English phrase.</span> <span id="s209">Socks and gloves and umbrellas and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Yeah, hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s213">So this was one owners, shop owners.</span> <span id="s214">Then there were various professions, like tailors and [indecipherable] and –</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Do you think that that would have been your future, had there been no war, that you would have taken over the shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Oh, that’s a difficult question.</span> <span id="s217">I was too young to – to even – to think about it.</span> <span id="s218">I believe my father would like me to go to the yeshiva and become a rabbi, or like this, but it will – there was no chance for it, I would never agree to it.</span> <span id="s219">Already as a child five year old, I knew that that will not be my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: That’s interesting that at age five –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">At the age of three, I was sent to a chayder, so I learned with all these ren – religious way, I learned from the age of three.</span> <span id="s223">I hated.</span> <span id="s224">This I remember well.</span> <span id="s225">I did not like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s227">What – what is in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I didn't like the attitude of the rabbi.</span> <span id="s229">The rabbi was the teacher over there [indecipherable] on many occasion he would hit you with a –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Ruler?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: – a ruler, you know, which he had there, in his hand.</span> <span id="s232">A – and I hated it.</span> <span id="s233">And I did not like the way they were learning it, you know, to repeat after the rabbi what he said, and this was the way of learning.</span> <span id="s234">I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s235">This I know very well.</span> <span id="s236">And on any occasion I had, I wou – I run away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Well, three years old is a very young – for a small child to be so –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes, I probably started to run away at the age of four or so, after one year there.</span> <span id="s239">Not at the beginning, but already at the age of four I was definitely running away.</span> <span id="s240">My –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Did you get in trouble from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, I tried to – not to let my parents know about it.</span> <span id="s243">But my mother would certainly support me if I would – if she would know, she would say, well, let him do what he likes.</span> <span id="s244">And my father wouldn’t forgive me, no way.</span> <span id="s245">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: That’s kind of tough on a little child.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">But, it was – my friend was the – there was a man who lived in the same house, he had a cart and a horse to carry things.</span> <span id="s249">And he became – we became very good friends, and he tried to take me always when he was going to work, and I was with him on the cart there, going like this.</span> <span id="s250">The other people – so there there were all these professions, there were – was a bakery, and people worked in the bakery.</span> <span id="s251">There was a mikveh, and a synagogue, a shul, where they – and so many people are – were all in this.</span> <span id="s252">The most – the most common, I would say, and the most Jewish profession – you probably don’t know it, but the most Jewish profession at that time, my opinion, was porters.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s255">These people were taking things on their shoulders and carry them from – they were Jewish, almost exclusively Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Like loaders, people who would take heavy sacks on their shoulders and –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes, heavy loads and these were Jewish.</span> <span id="s258">Almost exclusively.</span> <span id="s259">We knew it –</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: How do you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well, th-the problem was that the Poles didn’t like Jews, and you know, if we liked King Kazimierz, there were not many like him.</span> <span id="s262">And he – he – he was exceptional.</span> <span id="s263">And the Poles tried to make, for Jews, life difficult.</span> <span id="s264">And one of things they did was not to – too much to work with them.</span> <span id="s265">Now, if you were a doctor, if you were a – a tailor, and you were good at it, and really they came to you, most Jews and Poles, and – and they worked with you, because it was good for them to do it.</span> <span id="s266">But if you didn’t have any education, if you didn’t have any professional education, you were not a tailor, you were not a [indecipherable] you didn’t learn anything, then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Carrying these loads.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: And I – I think this was the reason why they work.</span> <span id="s269">I knew – I knew children of the porters who were my age.</span> <span id="s270">I remember them.</span> <span id="s271">They had the very difficult time.</span> <span id="s272">Their income was low.</span> <span id="s273">They hardly could have shoes to walk around with them.</span> <span id="s274">And I – I’m not sure how mu – what they were doing about it, you know, and certainly their parents, uneducated.</span> <span id="s275">They couldn’t do anything else, except this.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Was there mandatory schooling for children, all children?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No.</span> <span id="s280">Schooling is another interesting fact about the place, because there was one secondary school, one high school, and the one high school was – my father learned in it.</span> <span id="s281">Was called Yavener(ph) at the time, and the language of teaching was Hebrew.</span> <span id="s282">This was the only secondary school, high school in town.</span> <span id="s283">So the Poles –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: So the Poles didn’t have their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: There was no education –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I – I’m not sure they have now, but they didn’t have at that time.</span> <span id="s288">This was the only one.</span> <span id="s289">And so when a Pole wanted to learn in high school, would get matriculation, for instance, the only way for him was to learn in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s290">Go to that school –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes, many did.</span> <span id="s293">Many did.</span> <span id="s294">It was [indecipherable] a – a – a chain of schools, Jewish schools, all over Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: But private, hm, not state.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Private –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: – private.</span> <span id="s299">But then, you know, life became very difficult, worse and worse from year to year.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Well, I would like to see – I would like to kind of weave in the general picture you’re painting for me with words, to what happened in your own family.</span> <span id="s301">And before we do that, I’d like to get a sense of what your family was like, what memories do you have of your family, of your sister, of your mother.</span> <span id="s302">You know, some people report that their pre-war lives were pretty idyllic, and that they grew up in warm, happy families.</span> <span id="s303">Some report that it wasn’t quite so, and their relations were more, how shall I say?</span> <span id="s304">Complicated.</span> <span id="s305">How would you describe your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Whe-en-en – if we speak before the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: – before the world changed –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: – before the war I was – I was five years old when the war broke out, I wasn’t yet six.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: [indecipherable] so during that time, I could only see what’s going around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: And already I knew at that time that what happens in town, and all over in Poland, because I heard my parents speaking about it, the anti-Semitism grew quickly.</span> <span id="s315">It became monstrous, I think, before breakout of the second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did your parents talk about what happened to them, or to people they knew, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes, I heard them talking about it.</span> <span id="s320">They – the – the major problem was that Poles organized into a – a – in – in the party, which was called Boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: And this was, really, this was their purpose, to boycott the Jews.</span> <span id="s323">And then they meant – fewer people came to the store to buy there.</span> <span id="s324">They could find a Polish store, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s325">I – I don’t know if you have ever seen, there is a book e – of pictures, published in New York, by Vishniac.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Oh yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Have you seen it?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Roman Vishniac, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Roman Vishniac.</span> <span id="s330">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s331">When you see [indecipherable] you can see the porters, who were the ones who suffered most of the Polish boycott, because they, you know, have – a Pole could take a load on his shoulders without learning anything, and take it over.</span> <span id="s332">And they suffered, the famine really, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: – [indecipherable] starvation, there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So you would see the effects of it, you would see the children of the – of the loaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Did you yourself, or your family, or the – the housing complex where you lived, was it almost entirely Jewish?</span> <span id="s338">Did you have interaction with Poles wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Entirely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Entirely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s342">The school, my father learned in this high school, until just one year before the end, when he said, I don’t want to continue here, I want to go to a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s343">And he left this and started the religious training.</span> <span id="s344">And several years later he married my mother, and she came from the s – village, which I loved.</span> <span id="s345">The village I loved [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What was – what was its name?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Mika – was Sztemaszitsa(ph) [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Oh my God, how do you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Sztemaszitsa(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Sztemaszitsa(ph)?</span> <span id="s351">Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s353">[indecipherable] I am saying.</span> <span id="s354">There were 2,000 Jews in this village, quite large.</span> <span id="s355">There were mats – but they were still only 15 percent of the population of this village.</span> <span id="s356">But I loved it, because this was open, and I could run around there.</span> <span id="s357">I had the large family, all my mother’s family lived there, this was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Were you closer to her than to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, I believe, yes.</span> <span id="s360">I – I loved my mother.</span> <span id="s361">And I didn’t like my father being so –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: – strict and religious and ja – I didn't like.</span> <span id="s364">You know, when – when you think about life over there before the war, that’s certainly on the one side, it’s the poverty, which became worse in 1930s, after my birth, when I was a small child.</span> <span id="s365">With every year it became worse for the Jews because of this, I mean, because of the boycott, because of what Poles did.</span> <span id="s366">And – but on the other hand, you – you must – it was a life you could enjoy, with all this.</span> <span id="s367">You know, you had something to expect, you know, you didn’t have enough.</span> <span id="s368">I think nobody, really, except some rich people, they didn’t have enough bread.</span> <span id="s369">They would eat more bread if they would be given.</span> <span id="s370">But they knew that in another 10 days, Pesach comes, Passover.</span> <span id="s371">And then they will eat as much as they want.</span> <span id="s372">Or another holiday, or the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s373">Was no way, even the poorest people, that on the Sabbath they would not – the whole family would not sit down and eat, really as one should.</span> <span id="s374">You know, no way.</span> <span id="s375">They would be ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s376">They wouldn't be ashamed during the week that they cannot give their children enough to eat, but on the Sabbath they would certainly be ashamed of, and they would do anything, you know, on Sabbath and the holidays, that they did – the behavior of the family is different, and they can – and this was really every Friday, I was going already as a four year old child.</span> <span id="s377">I was taking the cholent, the cholent, you know, which they prepared for the sat – for Saturday me – for the Saturday meal, I was taking it to the bakery, and then on Saturday I brought it back, see.</span> <span id="s378">So it was, you know, there was some enjoyment in this life.</span> <span id="s379">The school, the high school, which was kept by the community, broke down and the –</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: The Hebrew high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: The Hebrew high school, it broke down, they didn’t have enough money to continue to run it, once the boycott started.</span> <span id="s382">Was during the time I was already living there as a small child.</span> <span id="s383">My father stopped to go there earlier.</span> <span id="s384">And in the town there was one Jew called Furstenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Oh, that’s a very ar-aristocratic name.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes, without the von.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Furstenberg.</span> <span id="s389">And Furstenberg was a very rich Jew, but very.</span> <span id="s390">Very means that in the 1930s he had an airplane, a private airplane, which you know, unheard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: That’s Hollywood.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: He was one of the richest people in all of Europe.</span> <span id="s393">He became rich from a – from a mine which he founded, of zinc.</span> <span id="s394">And he – this was really the – the center of zinc export to all of Europe.</span> <span id="s395">So he – he took on himself the whole school.</span> <span id="s396">They changed the name of the school to Furstenberg and he was paying for [indecipherable] all the teachers, and thing, was paid by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: He was the benefactor.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: He was the benefactor of the school and everything [indecipherable] after it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So the war started after your sixth birthday, right after your sixth bir –</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No after, before my sixth birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, no after, immediately after –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Right after.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: I mean five days, six days after September first –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Just – just – yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: – ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How does a six year old boy experience a war?</span> <span id="s410">What was the – how did – how did it introduce itself into your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Frightening.</span> <span id="s412">It’s – I-I was never afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s413">I believed that I was never afraid in my life, there’s nothing that I could not overcome.</span> <span id="s414">But it was frightening because of the – of the people around me, you know.</span> <span id="s415">They were obviously afraid.</span> <span id="s416">And I could feel it, I could see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You were six years old, and these were the grown-ups, and the grown-ups were the ones –</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: – who provide security to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And if they’re frightened, of course the children are frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: That’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s423">I never expressed it, and the – nobody would know it, but definitely it was clear.</span> <span id="s424">When the Germans came in, which was immediately after the war broke out, they didn't have much to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: That’s right across the border, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Just across the border.</span> <span id="s427">The first Saturday after this, they came and burned down the shul, the synagogue.</span> <span id="s428">And they burned it down with all the people were praying inside.</span> <span id="s429">And whoever tried to escape was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: It must ha – I mean, was there any crime in Bendzin before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So this was – this is a shock to the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: That’s – yes, yes.</span> <span id="s434">They were – we lived on this Castle Street, which was on the same street, a little further, there was the synagogue, the central synagogue of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Did you see anything of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: And the – I don’t know, I was – at the time, on Saturday when they burned it down, they came and then they announced to all people around in the other houses to stay down in the basements.</span> <span id="s437">So we went down.</span> <span id="s438">When we came back we have seen some shots in the ceiling of – when they – they shoot around just to frighten people, you know.</span> <span id="s439">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Did you see any German soldiers?</span> <span id="s441">Do you remember seeing any?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">No-Not at that time.</span> <span id="s444">On that day I couldn’t see any, but yes, I have seen them.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: After –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: They came in, and after this, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: But then it was just sort of like this – if I can try and – and extrapolate, a – a child is hearing – is – is sensing the fear of the adults, does not yet see what it is that they are frightened of, is told that, along with his family to go to a basement, and at that time, it’s when the synagogue is being burnt down with people inside.</span> <span id="s448">Did you hear anything from what was going on down the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: It was a noise there.</span> <span id="s450">We heard that it’s burning.</span> <span id="s451">I heard them talking about it, that they burned down the synagogue.</span> <span id="s452">We didn't think that this happens with the people inside.</span> <span id="s453">And there were s-some survivors from it, succeeded to run away, and they went to a nearby church.</span> <span id="s454">And the priest of the church really hid them, he was hiding them.</span> <span id="s455">He later be – received a – a – what they call it at the Holocaust museum of Jerusalem –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yad Vashem, the – no, he received the khassidey umot ha-ola.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: I think it’s called Righteous Among –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Righteous of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Righteous, he – this – he definitely saved.</span> <span id="s462">Many of them were killed later, but at least he did what, really the only one who did anything for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: And – at that time.</span> <span id="s465">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Y-You know, and after this, when the Germans, after burning down the synagogue it became a little quieter.</span> <span id="s468">You know, there was nothing going on.</span> <span id="s469">Well, here and there some, I would say, things not on the level of the whole town.</span> <span id="s470">Like, for instance, I learned at home.</span> <span id="s471">I never went to school.</span> <span id="s472">And in 1940, my parents brought a Jewish young woman, was teaching me Polish.</span> <span id="s473">How to write, how to read, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Is she the one who taught you history?</span> <span id="s475">Because if –</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s477">She was – and she was really not a long time.</span> <span id="s478">I liked her very much, I still remember this.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I was six – no, no.</span> <span id="s481">Six or maybe seven years old, she was older.</span> <span id="s482">She looked to me the perfect lady, you know, th-the perfect girl, which could be I looked at her, I was waiting for her coming every time.</span> <span id="s483">Then one day – and she learned.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, sa – I learned how to write in maybe a couple of months when she was teaching me.</span> <span id="s485">Then she didn’t come.</span> <span id="s486">And I asked my parents what happened, they didn’t want to tell me.</span> <span id="s487">And then I heard that, one day a talk between them, and one of them saying that her parents are accusing my parents about what happened.</span> <span id="s488">And then I understood what happened.</span> <span id="s489">When she left our house after teaching me, she went back to her home.</span> <span id="s490">She had to cross a lawn which was on the way, quite a large lawn, and when she went through it a German soldier went by and just shot her, killed her on the way.</span> <span id="s491">I-I – I remember, when I heard this, I was shocked by it.</span> <span id="s492">First time in my life that I really started to understand what’s going on with the Germans in that time.</span> <span id="s493">All schools were of course closed, and there was no way, even religious schools, like I learned in the chayder, so I could like, continue, up to a certain time when the – the rabbi was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s494">And I start in another place and the rabbi also was taken away a short time later, and there was no way to learn.</span> <span id="s495">I started my school only a-after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: What happened with your mother’s galanteria?</span> <span id="s497">Obviously, even before the war, it must have suffered.</span> <span id="s498">Did you have Polish customers before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: One – and, yes, undoubtedly, most customers were Polish.</span> <span id="s500">Nearby was a shop, a butcher, and the butcher was Polish, it was not kosher.</span> <span id="s501">But my grandfather rented it for – to – to him, and he – he m – he was bankrupt.</span> <span id="s502">And this was the way they lived until the war broke out in – at the end of 1939, beginning of 1940, we were informed that the house of my grandfather is [indecipherable] too much into the street.</span> <span id="s503">And so they had to leave it in 24 hours, and they demolished it, the German – not the Germans, but the people who worked for them, and – including the Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So that meant that in this – was this house owned by your grandfa-father?</span> <span id="s505">In other words, it was his asset, it was his property?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Completely destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, the whole house was destroyed, yes.</span> <span id="s509">This was his major property, he lived on this because he rented this – the shops downstairs and – and he rented the other – th-the other apartments.</span> <span id="s510">He lived in one of them, and he rented the other, four or five other.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Tell me a little bit about this grandfather.</span> <span id="s512">Did you ha – did – did he play a role in your life, in your childhood?</span> <span id="s513">Do you remember, or was he a more distant person?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: H-He was – no, he was like a grandfather.</span> <span id="s515">When I was born, probably in that time, my parents didn't have an apartment of their own, they lived with the grandfather.</span> <span id="s516">I was born there, this I was told.</span> <span id="s517">Then they moved over to this apartment.</span> <span id="s518">H-H-He was – he was like a zayde should be, you know, like a grandfather, a zayde should be.</span> <span id="s519">He was the one always prepared for me something which I liked.</span> <span id="s520">And so I loved him, I loved him in that time.</span> <span id="s521">Like, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: – most grandsons would – would love.</span> <span id="s524">He was the one, o-or maybe it was 1941, it was already becoming very bad.</span> <span id="s525">The pressure was rising all the time.</span> <span id="s526">Was standing on the balcony of the – of the house and he said to me, you see, when this war will end, we are going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s527">It was – for the first time I heard the word Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s530">I had an uncle there.</span> <span id="s531">His son.</span> <span id="s532">He was the oldest son, went to Tel Aviv, and then there were four sisters, and then my father was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: This was a large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Quite a large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: – there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So you had lots of aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And did they all live –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I liked the – all of them, I liked them.</span> <span id="s541">Yes, they were all of them married.</span> <span id="s542">I liked them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And they were all in this apartment building?</span> <span id="s544">This – this house –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: They all left, they married and after –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So it was only your father –</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: – who kind of stayed wi – closer –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yes, to the grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: – to the grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, but when they demolished his house, we couldn’t take him in because our apartment was small.</span> <span id="s556">So we moved over to the place of my aunt, the oldest aunt who lived in the [indecipherable] in Bendzin.</span> <span id="s557">She had the large apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: These things sound terrifying, when I – I mean they sound terrifying at any age, but I am just trying to imagine still, a child of six and seven years old.</span> <span id="s559">How did your parents explain, or try to explain to you what was going on?</span> <span id="s560">Did they – did they comfort you, or were they so worried with their own fears that you kept quiet about your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: We spoke very little about it, if at all, if at all.</span> <span id="s562">They never, ever, ever, ever spoke with me about it, really.</span> <span id="s563">And the truth is that I think they – they were clever to do it, not to tell me anything, because it certainly frightened me, there’s no doubt about this.</span> <span id="s564">But they knew what’s going on in my head, you know.</span> <span id="s565">They knew that I live a – in an imaginary world.</span> <span id="s566">And all this just kind of doesn’t belong to me, and they knew it.</span> <span id="s567">And I remember my father saying to me, we’re going down to try to open the sukkah.</span> <span id="s568">The sukkah for – a sukkah.</span> <span id="s569">And they said to me, you know, and I was trying to explain to him, because there – there were several things he couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s570">He was not allowed to go at [indecipherable] outside, he had to put it in this – which is not according to the religious laws and the – there’s several things, also with the sukkah, he couldn’t put this way, he had to put it in another way, and he said that’s not the way it should be done, it should be – and then he looked at me and he said, you know, I envy you.</span> <span id="s571">It’s good to be a child at this time.</span> <span id="s572">You know, when – he knew I am living in an imaginary world, which is not the world of [indecipherable] during the war.</span> <span id="s573">And I think this was the way, really, you could keep yourself normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: How about your little sister?</span> <span id="s575">She was truly a baby, wasn’t she, at that point, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes, she was a baby, and I felt like this was always, for me she was the baby.</span> <span id="s577">And I always think I told her, look, I will take care of you, you don’t be afraid, I will always take care of you.</span> <span id="s578">And that’s really what happened later.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: So let’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I took care of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: I want to get to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Tell me, after you – after your grandfather’s house was demolished, how did things proceed, how did life continue to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: So my grandparents moved over to her, my grandfather died later in the – and I’m not sure, but possib – certainly from natural causes, but it’s also probable that he didn’t get the treatment which he could get if there wouldn't be a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: He died, and we continued to live.</span> <span id="s587">Th-The main problem was how to get away from the Germans, that they don’t catch you when they go in the streets and catch some Jews to send away.</span> <span id="s588">And there were several cases when it was organized.</span> <span id="s589">One day it was organized this way, that they came to surround our place, all the four buildings.</span> <span id="s590">And they took everybody to the police station, or whatever it was, and – and they said – they decided, whatever one of you is going back to his house, or is sent over for deportation, as they called it.</span> <span id="s591">Deportation was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s592">Auschwitz was not more than about an hour by train from our place.</span> <span id="s593">And so, at that time, we learned something.</span> <span id="s594">And we learned this, that they – they are taking away larger families, because it’s easier for them.</span> <span id="s595">If they have to take, they come over in there to bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it’s for them much easier.</span> <span id="s596">We survived this because what happened is that a Jewish policeman was there, they were helping the – the Germans.</span> <span id="s597">And they were policemen of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s598">And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of ours.</span> <span id="s599">So he said, you don’t take – stay here.</span> <span id="s600">Went out and locked the outer lock on the door.</span> <span id="s601">So it was clear to everybody who came over there, there is nobody inside, they left already and locked the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Did people know that they were being – go – going to Auschwitz, or did they just know they’re being deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s604">They were – they knew they were deported, and not at that time.</span> <span id="s605">Later on, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Later –</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Was there a ghetto formed –</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: – in your town, in Bendzin?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Much later.</span> <span id="s614">Was just at the end of ’42 that they oh – in ’42, one day, this was the second time after this, that they called all Jews to the stadium.</span> <span id="s615">And in the stadium, after a whole day [indecipherable] waiting, and th – everybody had to go through a station where Gestapo was sitting, and they decided every one, if he is going to be deported, or he is going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Did you remember that, did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: A-And – yes, I do remember it, very well.</span> <span id="s618">Because what I did was – and I did it myself, I had my – when – when my parents with my sister came over to the table, I kind of hid ara – behind them.</span> <span id="s619">So here seems three people, and he stamped the – the I.D.s and he gave it to them, then he has seen a fourth I.D.</span> <span id="s620">He looked around and see me and what’s that [indecipherable] cause then it would be already you couldn't change it any more.</span> <span id="s621">But they told me later, the parents that I saved them, because families of four, they were deported, and only smaller families not.</span> <span id="s622">So my hiding behind it, and so they – they manifested only three members.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And then the fourth seems to show up, but the stamp is already there –</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: – and so he’s allow – you know, one more reprieve.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s627">So they – they gave it to me, they let me out.</span> <span id="s628">Then the – a man came, a – a distant relative of mine.</span> <span id="s629">You know, I had maybe – I counted for si – Kaddish somewhere, maybe tomorrow, I counted – I had first relatives, first degree relatives, up to first cousins, there must have been some 25.</span> <span id="s630">And we speak about distant relatives, more distant, second cousins, so once – first cousins once removed, we’re coming to maybe 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: What a lot –</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Was a very large family.</span> <span id="s633">The name Merin is very – i-it was very popular there.</span> <span id="s634">Must tell you, it’s not really for this, but you know, once in 10 years I have to renew my visa to the United States.</span> <span id="s635">Last time when it was, I had to – well, usually I give it to the agent, to the travel agent, and he does it for me.</span> <span id="s636">Now, they changed the law, and the rules, and now you have to come yourself and be there.</span> <span id="s637">Takes half a day.</span> <span id="s638">I didn't have time for it.</span> <span id="s639">So I was angry about it, well, you cannot do anything.</span> <span id="s640">I came over there, it was four months ago.</span> <span id="s641">And I come in there and they – I was waiting with the others, and I come to a large hall where I’ve seen people waiting, they said, this takes the most time.</span> <span id="s642">You must wait here until they call you.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Was this the U.S. embassy in – in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: The U.S. consulate in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I didn't go to the embassy in Tel Aviv –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: – I went to the consulate in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s649">And they said, this may take two or three hours to hear.</span> <span id="s650">The minute when I come in, I sat down.</span> <span id="s651">Merin.</span> <span id="s652">I said to my wife, something wrong here, it cannot be.</span> <span id="s653">All these people were before us.</span> <span id="s654">But I come in there, a woman is sitting there, at one of the windows, smiling.</span> <span id="s655">And she says to me, you are Merin?</span> <span id="s656">I say yes.</span> <span id="s657">You are from Bendzin?</span> <span id="s658">I says, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s659">That’s not written there.</span> <span id="s660">So, she said, my father is from Bendzin, and he told me if at any time somebody named Merin will come, take him immediately, he is from Bendzin.</span> <span id="s661">And this was her.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: How wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: You know, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you know who her father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I didn't know him before, I don – she thought that I know, but I was a – you know, I’m a –</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: A lot of Merins, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: – I was so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I knew many Merins, but not – in 1942, a man came back, a distant relative of ours, and he had the broken hand, I remember.</span> <span id="s672">And he told us that he was on the way to Auschwitz, and he jumped out of the train.</span> <span id="s673">And he broke his hand, and – and th-this, but came back.</span> <span id="s674">And I remember him sitting down with my parents and I was listening from the side and I heard him telling about Auschwitz, what it means Auschwitz and what – that they are killing Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And you were nine years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: I was nine years, yes.</span> <span id="s677">When – when he left, I heard my father and mother speaking, they were angry.</span> <span id="s678">They said, he is lying.</span> <span id="s679">It cannot be that this is happening.</span> <span id="s680">It’s really – it’s a pity that he is saying things like this, which are not true, he’s frightening everybody.</span> <span id="s681">This was the attitude.</span> <span id="s682">There were a few people like him, but they didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s683">I think that this is probably the basis for not doing more to defend themselves, of the Jews, because it seemed so unreal, so impossible, that anybody, any country, they may not like Jews, but th – they – nobody would think about it, that there may be an [indecipherable] arrangement of – of massacre of Jews.</span> <span id="s684">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: And then – but it – in some ways it sounds like he gave you the idea that saved you, if we go further in your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s687">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: I don’t want to suggest, but you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Maybe this was, I – I ran away because of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Well, let’s get to that part.</span> <span id="s691">Let’s go – after this person visited, that’s very close then to the time that things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: That we moved into – into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: We moved into the ghetto and th-the starvation became much more serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: All right, so now – now we speak – excuse me Professor Merin, I’m going to pause once more.</span> <span id="s696">Press –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Press the pause, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Okay, so now I’m recording again.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And now stopped, you pause [indecipherable] again, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Record?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: No.</span> <span id="s703">It doesn’t.</span> <span id="s704">See, here’s the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s706">Now you have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: You did it, all right.</span> <span id="s712">So, we’re in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s713">Then –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: We moved into the ghetto end of ’42, and the main problem there was starvation, the – we didn’t have enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: How did your parents get food for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: They didn’t.</span> <span id="s717">They –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: They had no way, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s720">They cannot – I don’t have, we never forget, you know, just the two or three evenings before a – the end of the ghetto, that – from dinner, we had one egg.</span> <span id="s721">And we were sitting, all four of us, and my father or my mother said look, we discussed it [indecipherable] between us, and we could divide this egg into four.</span> <span id="s722">Or another way, one will receive the whole egg, and then when we get another one, the second one, third one and so on.</span> <span id="s723">So we decided we go for one, so that he can be stronger, and – and they said, we decided you’ll be the one.</span> <span id="s724">And they gave me the egg.</span> <span id="s725">You know, I was eating it [indecipherable] and you know, it looked to me like the delicatess(ph) of the world.</span> <span id="s726">And in the middle of eating this, I raised my head, I have seen the three people, both my parents, and Dina, my sister looking at me with hungry eyes.</span> <span id="s727">You know, I remember their eyes, you know, like it will be yesterday.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe this explains more than anything else, the starvation which we went through at that time.</span> <span id="s729">There was certainly not enough bread, not enough anything, ca – on the bread, you know.</span> <span id="s730">Not even all these ersatz, the – what – what – that came instead of coffee, like ersatz coffee and ersatz tea and things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Replacement, replacement, replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s733">But even that – this we couldn’t get.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: In all this time, do you remember having any contact with either the Germans, or any of the Poles, or the soldiers?</span> <span id="s735">I mean, did these – did any of these outsiders come into your world?</span> <span id="s736">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Not at –</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: It couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s740">It couldn’t – it couldn’t happen, it couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s741">The-They wou – th – our way of knowing things was through my mother.</span> <span id="s742">We used to go to the Judenrat, which was in the second town, just nearby, and to sit with them.</span> <span id="s743">The head of the Judenrat was also a me – a Merin.</span> <span id="s744">Probably a – I don’t know even, he was certainly not a relative of – a near relative, but maybe he was a distant relative, this could well be.</span> <span id="s745">And she was meeting him, and he was telling her about what’s going on.</span> <span id="s746">Towards the end of July ’43, she came back home and she said, they am going to cancel this ghetto.</span> <span id="s747">And, you know, my father said, how do you know?</span> <span id="s748">What happened?</span> <span id="s749">She say, I have seen today that the Gestapo took all the members of the Judenrat somewhere away, and they – they didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s750">This must me – mean that they send them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s751">We already knew at that time about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s752">Ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And so they started to believe the man who had come to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes, yes, at that time they already believed what’s going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: And so, it’s about a year’s difference, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yes, this was about –</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Didn’t you say he came at 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s759">And this was July ’43, when they – July ’43 already, it wa – it became clear what’s going on.</span> <span id="s760">Still tried to make normal life.</span> <span id="s761">I know – I remember my father, when we moved into the ghetto, my father tried to build a fence around the small piece of land which belonged to this – to the room which we had, because no Jew was allowed more than one room.</span> <span id="s762">So he built this, and I remember somebody coming over and said, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s763">They are going to kill off all of us.</span> <span id="s764">Why do you do it?</span> <span id="s765">Well, it was quite clear.</span> <span id="s766">When my mother said it, she said, we cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s767">They will cancel this ghetto.</span> <span id="s768">And they – they decided to leave the ghetto, and try to escape into the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did she know what was happening with her family from the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: She had –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: At that time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: There was no connection with the village, there was no way to know.</span> <span id="s775">But, we decided to leave, and we decided to leave on a Sunday where they – there’s less guards, fewer guards around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s776">So we decided to – to leave on the first of August, Sunday, in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Just before your 10th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Before, yes.</span> <span id="s781">In the evening of the 31st of July, you know, I remember how I went to sleep and I put on my clothes and I put them neatly on the chair, I thought, to have tomorrow when we leave [indecipherable] what I decided to take, and they were put down here.</span> <span id="s782">In the middle of the night, the Germans came.</span> <span id="s783">This wen – shouting of the streets, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s784">And Judenrein.</span> <span id="s785">Judenrein, they are taking everybody.</span> <span id="s786">It’s not that they select people, some to come and some not, they are taking everybody.</span> <span id="s787">The same – so we be – we had no choice.</span> <span id="s788">Now, there were – it was impossible, because they put heavy guards around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s789">It was impossible to leave.</span> <span id="s790">We went down into what we called the bunker.</span> <span id="s791">The bunker, many families arranged some way out, to escape, because, if it was not the Judenrein and they were coming and taking, then they took anybody whom they found.</span> <span id="s792">They – they didn’t look too much for it, but yes.</span> <span id="s793">So we went down into the bunker, and the bunker was a very good one.</span> <span id="s794">You had to go through a – through a cupboard like this, to move a drawer, and then to open another door like this, and went to go down over a ladder, and into the bunker.</span> <span id="s795">Very difficult, nobody could really – when you open the cupboard, you wouldn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s796">So we went down.</span> <span id="s797">This was prepared for exactly such a case.</span> <span id="s798">It was prepared for four people.</span> <span id="s799">In a short time we found ourselves with 16 other people, and you couldn’t say anything, I mean, all our family came, cause they knew that our bunker is the best.</span> <span id="s800">We stayed there for three days, probably the worst three days of my life.</span> <span id="s801">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s802">It was August, very hot, small place.</span> <span id="s803">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: No toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Of course no toilet, but there was no water in th-there.</span> <span id="s806">We didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s807">There was no water.</span> <span id="s808">There was no place to sit for everybody, you know?</span> <span id="s809">My father, remember, was sitting on the ladder, which was taking down.</span> <span id="s810">The thirst was terrible.</span> <span id="s811">On the third day they understood how it’s done.</span> <span id="s812">They came over there and they couldn’t find the entrance into this, so they went down into the basement and started to break the wall.</span> <span id="s813">Soldiers came and start to break the wall.</span> <span id="s814">When they did it, and they opened the hole, there were my cousin, older than me by three or four years shouted we – we give in, we don’t – we give up and we are – we are going out.</span> <span id="s815">So the soldier shouted, all right, how do we get in here?</span> <span id="s816">So he told him where to open it.</span> <span id="s817">Started to go out, and they took all of us to the place where we were waiting for the train to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s818">It was terrible three days, really, it’s not only – I tried once to go out, and it was quiet, to find water.</span> <span id="s819">And they couldn’t, there was no water anywhere, they closed the water, the Germans.</span> <span id="s820">So there was no water anywhere.</span> <span id="s821">I looked [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: So you had gone out of the bunker into your old apart – into your old room?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And did you remember seeing anything, or hearing anything –</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: It was a ground floor, I – I – I heard a cart on the street, so I looked out, and I looked behind it.</span> <span id="s826">It was a cart full of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s827">I remember the picture of it, was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Was this the first time that you saw dead bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Dead, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s830">There were so many of them, this I remember.</span> <span id="s831">Many, one on the other, on the other.</span> <span id="s832">But it were terrible three days.</span> <span id="s833">And then they were taken to the station, to the train station.</span> <span id="s834">It was – it was not the regular train station, it was a station which was made up for Jews, to take up the Jews.</span> <span id="s835">And we were waiting there surrounded by the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s836">And there my mother told me, you must run away, must run away.</span> <span id="s837">So I said, okay.</span> <span id="s838">I took my sister with me, and I broke out.</span> <span id="s839">There was a fence with – a wooden fence, so I could break up one place, and being a slim boy, could easily get through, and my sister was slim as I was.</span> <span id="s840">And we went through it.</span> <span id="s841">After a few minutes, when we were there hiding on the other side of the fence, I found out that we are in a German military camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: And of course it took another 10 minutes or so, and the soldiers found us.</span> <span id="s844">But luckily, you know, both of us looked sympathetic, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: You’re kids, you’re kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Kids, and the soldiers didn’t beat us or – as they would do otherwise, but they took us back, and they send us in.</span> <span id="s847">When I came over there I wanted to speak with my mother, but she said.</span> <span id="s848">when I was, not yet at her, she said, don’t come to me, don’t come to me, because us there will be, when they see that we are your parents, after you tried to run away.</span> <span id="s849">A second time, when we were – it was close and the – the train was already coming in, I thought, that’s the last chance that we have, and I tried it another time.</span> <span id="s850">And th-this time we succeeded.</span> <span id="s851">We went by, not far from the German watchman who was there.</span> <span id="s852">He – he was looking over the street on the other side.</span> <span id="s853">He didn’t look anybody would walk nearby him, cause he wouldn’t think that any Jew would do it.</span> <span id="s854">And this was just off the edge, where all the Poles were coming through.</span> <span id="s855">So, the only thing I felt was – my thought was only, how does it feel when the bullet would struck you – strike you.</span> <span id="s856">And so we – we could get out from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And Dina was not crying, she was not –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s859">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: She – she trusted big brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s862">She n – she never.</span> <span id="s863">But once when I was talking about it with the scouts, and then they asked a lot of questions; one of them was, how did you go out your sister, how much did you quarrel, how much did you fight with her and so on?</span> <span id="s864">And I said, never.</span> <span id="s865">We never quarreled.</span> <span id="s866">We never was fighting.</span> <span id="s867">Not in that time, and not after this.</span> <span id="s868">And that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Can I ask – can I ask you too, how did your relation to your father change?</span> <span id="s870">Because it sounds wi – the last time we left it is before the war, and he wants one thing for you and you want another.</span> <span id="s871">But certainly with the way things took, that was out of – that – that issue went off the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: How right you are.</span> <span id="s873">How right you are, you know.</span> <span id="s874">That’s exactly so.</span> <span id="s875">You know, for the first time in – in my life, my young life, I felt sorrow about my father, cause I felt how much he suffers.</span> <span id="s876">And for the first time in my life I came to him, I said, look, if you want to teach me religious stuff, I want you.</span> <span id="s877">Just say when, I am coming and learn it.</span> <span id="s878">First time.</span> <span id="s879">Cause he knew that I don’t like.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: And how did he react to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: He was – I think he was happy that he – he gave me lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Did you feel closer to him, besides having sympathy and seeing his sorrow, did – did you feel like he was closer to you, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s884">I think so.</span> <span id="s885">For the first time that he really – I felt that he understands me better.</span> <span id="s886">But I certainly did understand him.</span> <span id="s887">I knew that he is suffering this.</span> <span id="s888">So we went – we left this place, and the two of us went to town.</span> <span id="s889">And I knew about the Polish woman who was the maid in my aunt’s place before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Had you met her?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Y – I knew her well.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: You knew her well, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Very well, even.</span> <span id="s894">She came from a village in Poland, and she was the only Polish woman whom I really knew.</span> <span id="s895">I didn’t know anybody else.</span> <span id="s896">I went to her.</span> <span id="s897">And we stayed there for one and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: We were hiding in a place what – what – there was a – it was one room when she lived where she lived, but there was a connection to a small room after this.</span> <span id="s900">We put a cupboard between the two, so anybody who came in has seen only one room, and we were in the second room.</span> <span id="s901">Second room was about this size, maybe a little smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So, was this the last time you saw your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes, it was the last time.</span> <span id="s904">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s906">So this was the last time you saw your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yes, this was the last time I’ve seen my parents.</span> <span id="s908">I said the – this Polish woman, when – she was not at – at home, she was working in a German factory for ammunition.</span> <span id="s909">She was preparing the sandwiches for the workers, the bread wa – sandwiches were bread and jam, you know, and they – much di – that was her job.</span> <span id="s910">She was working there and when she came back home, she found us waiting for her out in the street.</span> <span id="s911">She was – I – I am not sure that she was very happy about it.</span> <span id="s912">I am certain that she was not.</span> <span id="s913">But she was shocked by th – us.</span> <span id="s914">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: How did she behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: [indecipherable] you know, she behaved all right.</span> <span id="s917">She behaved as – as she should.</span> <span id="s918">Sh-She said to us, after a few days, look, she said, if you had come with your parents, I would never take you in.</span> <span id="s919">This would be impossible.</span> <span id="s920">But you came alone, you two, you will stay with me here.</span> <span id="s921">And she was frightened all the time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Well, did she have a family, or was she living by herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: She was single, but her family was in the village.</span> <span id="s924">The family certainly did not support her.</span> <span id="s925">One day when I asked her what would your family do if they would know that you keep Jews?</span> <span id="s926">So she said they would go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s927">They would go, she would – she lived after the war in a – Italy, and I came to visit her several times.</span> <span id="s928">One day when I came, she was sad.</span> <span id="s929">I said, what happened Aniela(ph)?</span> <span id="s930">A – said, my brothers came to Rome to see the Polish pope, and – you know, there was a Polish pope – pope, and they didn’t call me.</span> <span id="s931">They didn’t come to see me.</span> <span id="s932">I am here, not far from Rome, you know?</span> <span id="s933">Just imagine, all the time she was in Italy, she was sending parcels to her family, of fruits, of – usually of some –</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: [indecipherable] like this</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: There wasn’t – there was nothing good in – you know, there were no fruits, there was no citrus fruits, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s938">She was sending it, every year she was sending it several times.</span> <span id="s939">And she say – sh-she was the one who taught me they would go and – and they’ll report me to police, to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Did she tell you while you were living with her, or many years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: At least twice.</span> <span id="s942">She was at that time telling me – no, I asked her, during the time was there, she said it.</span> <span id="s943">I thought maybe she’s not right.</span> <span id="s944">We were lucky because we didn't have, you know, she couldn’t – she had to pay on the black market to get some food for us.</span> <span id="s945">And luckily I knew where my parents – they told me before I left, they said, look, we put some money in this place.</span> <span id="s946">The money – and I knew where it is, and I told her.</span> <span id="s947">And said, I will never find it.</span> <span id="s948">You know, the way I explained to her.</span> <span id="s949">So we decided my sister would go.</span> <span id="s950">She doesn’t look Jewish at all, and she – they will take – she – so she went with her.</span> <span id="s951">On the way – they passed a park or so on the way, when suddenly Polish kids started to shout, a Jewish girl, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s952">You know, there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: How do you say that in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Żydówka.</span> <span id="s955">And when – when they – she succeeded to hide, my sister, run away [indecipherable] somehow found – found a place to – to hide, until it became dark, and then they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Did they find the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, they – they didn’t go there, didn’t go [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: They didn’t – they didn’t – didn’t get there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: – was on the way to – to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s960">But then I sat down with her, I explained to her how to find it and she went and found it.</span> <span id="s961">It was 20 Napoleons, about – you know what a Napoleon is?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Golden – was it a golden coin?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Golden coins with the head of the Napoleon.</span> <span id="s964">They were called Napoleons all over Europe.</span> <span id="s965">And she found them.</span> <span id="s966">She brought back 18.</span> <span id="s967">And I knew about it, it was 20.</span> <span id="s968">Now, years later, I asked her, at the end of the war I asked her, why did you take those two coins?</span> <span id="s969">So she said, I wanted to make [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s970">And I said, well, that’s – it was a side of – of somebody [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s971">So, sh-she was –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: She could not resist.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: She couldn’t resist.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Aniela(ph) Sabatska(ph).</span> <span id="s976">Aniela(ph) Sabatska(ph).</span> <span id="s977">She received righteous of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: But during that year and a half, how did you feel in her one and a half rooms?</span> <span id="s979">How did you interact?</span> <span id="s980">How much of the outside did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s982">We – we couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: You were just in that little tiny area.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s985">There was no way – we couldn’t talk loud in any ways, except – you know, and – and we couldn’t make any noise.</span> <span id="s986">And we played.</span> <span id="s987">It was a game, an imaginary world in which the two of us lived.</span> <span id="s988">We’re playing, all imagination.</span> <span id="s989">I remember she – one day she wanted to make a present to us, and she brought over paper figures for us to play, just to show that she wants to give us.</span> <span id="s990">And she was so angry because she found that we are not playing with this.</span> <span id="s991">And I couldn’t explain to her, we are not playing –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Paper dolls.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: – paper dolls, or we are not playing anything which exists, we are playing something which does not exist, just an imaginary world.</span> <span id="s994">That’s the only way that you can live in a place like this for so long as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Did you – did Dina cry, or did you cry at night –</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: – thinking about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: – no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s999">I never heard her crying and I was never crying.</span> <span id="s1000">There was no way that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Did yo – were you thinking about your parents during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Certainly thinking about it, especially when the war e-ended.</span> <span id="s1003">On the 27th of January 1945, in this place there was a cousin of mine who – who stayed with her, much older than I am.</span> <span id="s1004">He was maybe 15 years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: He also stayed with Aniela(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Oh, so were you together, or was he in a separate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: We were all – yeah, he lived in the first room mainly, he didn’t stay with us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Oh, so were you together, or was he in a separate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: We were all – yeah, he lived in the first room mainly, he didn’t stay with us there.</span> <span id="s1011">On the 27th of January 1945, he woke me up at six o’clock in the morning, and he says, rise quickly.</span> <span id="s1012">The Germans found us.</span> <span id="s1013">And I looked through the window and I have seen a lot of soldiers there.</span> <span id="s1014">And it was clear that they found us, and that’s the end of it.</span> <span id="s1015">And suddenly we see a Jeep passing by with a red flag, with the red army.</span> <span id="s1016">So this was not the – these were not Germans, but Russians, and for the first time.</span> <span id="s1017">So we left a few days later, this place.</span> <span id="s1018">Oh, and they found another apartment for us.</span> <span id="s1019">We stayed with Aniela(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Can I ask this?</span> <span id="s1021">In her one room, was she – did she have like a separate little house, or did she have one room –</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: – within an apartment building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: No, it was an apartment building with maybe six, seven apartments there.</span> <span id="s1025">At least six, seven, maybe 10, even.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Was it a courtyard as well, like you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No.</span> <span id="s1030">it was a entrance from the street.</span> <span id="s1031">What my cousin did, he closed the entrance to the building.</span> <span id="s1032">Was all the time kept locked.</span> <span id="s1033">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1034">And he – he destroyed all the other apartments so that nobody would move in.</span> <span id="s1035">So there was anything which could be broken, he broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: So, in other words, Aniela(ph) lived in this apartment building by herself, with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: With the three of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Yes, until one family moved in, in spite of the ruined house, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">And so we had to take care much more about it.</span> <span id="s1041">For instance, in the winter of 1944, it was a bitter winter, but one day when they – she came back from work, the neighbors say to her, look, what’s going on there?</span> <span id="s1042">There was the chimney, there was steam from your chimney.</span> <span id="s1043">And so she said, I left it, my mistake.</span> <span id="s1044">Nobody would keep it, because there was not enough –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Fuel for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: – fuel to run it.</span> <span id="s1047">So nobody would leave it when you are not at home.</span> <span id="s1048">But from that time we couldn’t heat the room in the bitter winter, you know, because it couldn’t – it would happen again, they would know that something fishy is going on there [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Did you interact with your cousin much, when she was not there?</span> <span id="s1050">I mean, were you then more together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes, yes, I was, you know, sometimes when – he told me about the world.</span> <span id="s1052">I didn’t know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: About the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: About the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Oh, the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: About what’s going on in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Wolfe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Wolfe Merin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Wolfe Schweitzer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Schweitzer.</span> <span id="s1063">Was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Can I ask an indiscreet question?</span> <span id="s1065">Were they – was she a young lady who – were they together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yes, yes, she was – they were together, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Did he come to her after she found – after you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: He came probably a short time before we came, because he was caught by the Gestapo and accused of trading the points, you know, which were given for – for – for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: And he was put, as they did it for a – before a court, which looked like any other court, except that they had only one sentence, this was the death sentence, and that’s what he received, the death sentence for this.</span> <span id="s1071">But a day later he ran away, he succeeded to flee from the prison, and he came to Aniela(ph), stayed there with her.</span> <span id="s1072">And that’s – after the war, this was the thi – like the third period, you know, once the – once the war was over.</span> <span id="s1073">I was still – I didn't learn in school at any time.</span> <span id="s1074">And I was really lucky, because two or three months later, in – in April, actually two months later, in April 1945, my aunt came from Russia.</span> <span id="s1075">She survived in Russia, she was one of the sisters of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Had she left for Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: In 1939 in August, just before the war.</span> <span id="s1078">She said, I will not stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Interesting, interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I’ll not stay here waiting for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1081">So that she decided to leave and run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did sh – how – I had a couple of questions here.</span> <span id="s1083">Did she have stories of how she had been treated, and what had happened to her when she was in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes, she was – she succeeded to get through to Lvov.</span> <span id="s1085">You know Lvov is today th – one of the three cities of Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1086">And she was there, settled there and – but she lived in Lvov with thousands, thousands of refugees who came over there, and life was not good.</span> <span id="s1087">She was a rich woman.</span> <span id="s1088">She was otherwise not like the other brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1089">And in Lvov, the rumors came in 1940 that it’s not bad with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1090">They didn’t know anything about killing Jews.</span> <span id="s1091">And they said, well, they are not very good, the Germans, but it’s not that it’s impossible to live with them.</span> <span id="s1092">In – in April 1940, the Russians announced that whoever wants to go back to the German side can do it, and they will help, they will make a train which will take them to the German side.</span> <span id="s1093">She decided to go back, like another one or 2,000 people who came to the train.</span> <span id="s1094">On a certain day they came to the train, and when they’re sitting in the tain – train, the Russians closed the doors, and they said, you are enemy of the people, you want to go back to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1095">You are all going to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: And this is during the Molovov-Ribbentrop Pact, when they’re friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: This was after this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Oh, this was after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was til the war, til the – til bast -- Barbarossa, til the attack of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Til 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Til 1941.</span> <span id="s1102">Til the 22nd of June 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Oh, and I thought you said it was in 1940 that she wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yes, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: So it’s – so it’s while they’re still friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1107">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: This was in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So that’s why I’m saying, isn’t it unusual –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: There were still friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: – that while they’re still friends, they’re called enemies of the people, and taken to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Don’t worry, that’s what they said, that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s1114">They took all of them to Siberia, all these who decided, according to their saying, and it really seemed unlikely that they will do anything, because they were friends.</span> <span id="s1115">They took them all to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1116">And many, many of them survived, because of this.</span> <span id="s1117">But what she did, she decided we’re not going to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1118">On the way [indecipherable] and succeeded to flee from that train.</span> <span id="s1119">They were stopping the train from time to time, once in a couple of days, and so – to supply, to buy some products, and that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s1120">And they went down and got back.</span> <span id="s1121">And they li – stayed there, until in ’41 the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1122">When the Germans came in, her husband was killed on the same thing.</span> <span id="s1123">They went from house to house looking for communists and Jews and took them, and all the men were shot in the same thing.</span> <span id="s1124">She told me how after a couple of days, she went to the Gestapo and told them look, my husband is in prison.</span> <span id="s1125">Would you – I brought him a sweater because it’s cold.</span> <span id="s1126">And the German looked at it, gave it back to her.</span> <span id="s1127">He doesn’t need it.</span> <span id="s1128">So she understood.</span> <span id="s1129">She stayed with her son, they changed th – on false papers.</span> <span id="s1130">Got an I.D. of a Polish woman and that’s what – what – what they did to survive.</span> <span id="s1131">When she came back in April ’45 – no, it was the first time, she said, I will take care of, we will not staying here with Aniela(ph) or with Wolfe.</span> <span id="s1132">You will come with me.</span> <span id="s1133">She had the son, the son survived with her and she really took very good care of – of me and in fact, she never let me feel that I am not her son, or Dina is not her daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: I was going to ask, did she take Dina, too?</span> <span id="s1135">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: She – yes.</span> <span id="s1137">We’re all – we were three of us there like brothers and sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: And you stayed in Bendzin, you moved to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, she moved to another town there, Hoczew, and this was the place where she lived before the war, not far from there, a more German town than ours, Bendzin.</span> <span id="s1140">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1141">In 1940 – in 1946, the chief rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Herzog, came to Poland, and he had an agreement with the Polish government that he can take children up to the age of 14, if they are orphans, they will go with him to Israel, Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s1142">And so we joined this train.</span> <span id="s1143">Went with him, but it was stuck in Prague, and then we went to Austria, where we had that distant relative of the new husband of my aunt.</span> <span id="s1144">And they stayed – w-we stayed there for some time, decided to go back to Poland because you couldn’t move on.</span> <span id="s1145">And it was a camp of the DPs in Linz.</span> <span id="s1146">The DP camps were run by the Americans, and by the Joint.</span> <span id="s1147">So there were Jewish people of the Joint there wh-who were really helping us a lot.</span> <span id="s1148">And the Americans, they were running the places.</span> <span id="s1149">And it was Bindermichl, and the other place in Linz was Wegsheid.</span> <span id="s1150">Just these days I see in the newspaper a picture of Wegsheid, which was not far from there.</span> <span id="s1151">So, we – we stayed there and came back to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1152">When – already in 1945, we understood that our parents will not come back.</span> <span id="s1153">You know, at the beginning, the first few months, e-every – everybody who knocking on the door, maybe they are coming back, or one of them is coming back.</span> <span id="s1154">But towards April or May, it was clear that nobody would come back.</span> <span id="s1155">In fact, I tried to find out what happened with them.</span> <span id="s1156">I went to Auschwitz, cause that time I was 11, I went to Auschwitz with my cousin, tried to look there over this, the only thing I could find is in – in the gas chambers that was written the kemar(ph) – revenge, which they have written with their blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Were there people, were there officials in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1158">Was there anybody manning – I mean, I don’t mean Germans, I mean, had anyone else come in, was the place empty, was it deserted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: It was deserted in that time.</span> <span id="s1160">The-They opened it as a museum much later –</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: But at that time it was just deserted.</span> <span id="s1163">You could come in, you could go in, look where – whatever you want, at wherever you want, and that’s – that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: And no one was – yeah, and no one was there keeping – you know, looking at the – whatever records they might have kept to say, okay, let’s see, maybe you’re – there was nobody there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: I – I wouldn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I wouldn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: You were 11 years old, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yes, I wouldn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1170">The Russians came in on the same day, on the 27th of January ’45,they came into Auschwitz –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: – the same day they came into our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: How did they behave?</span> <span id="s1174">Did you have any interaction with the Russian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s1178">My cousin left immediately, he had a – a red –</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: – banderola(ph) – armband, like this.</span> <span id="s1181">And he went down.</span> <span id="s1182">And I’ve seen the soldiers from the window, I’ve seen soldiers stopping him and talking with him, and shouting at him.</span> <span id="s1183">And then somebody ordering him to take it off, so he took it off.</span> <span id="s1184">No, there was not much communication with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1185">The Russians left Auschwitz also, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: So they were on to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Yes, they went on.</span> <span id="s1188">This was the south, I believe, to Berlin, where Zhukov and his army was more to the north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: This was a southern army that moved out.</span> <span id="s1191">The Poles didn’t behave too well after the war, you know.</span> <span id="s1192">I remember first time that I really went out, to the square of the city center, pole – position where a man stood at one of the windows and gave a speech about new Poland, and the communist Poland.</span> <span id="s1193">They called it the socialist party, and the socialist Poland.</span> <span id="s1194">And they said that the Russian promised that if they will behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party from the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland.</span> <span id="s1195">Very like today that they say that.</span> <span id="s1196">And I was standing there listening to him, together with thousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish?</span> <span id="s1197">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1198">She said, how do you survive?</span> <span id="s1199">So I told her, a Polish woman helped us.</span> <span id="s1200">She said oh God, she said, oh God.</span> <span id="s1201">And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from [indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew?</span> <span id="s1202">Ga – gave me a fist in my head, in my face.</span> <span id="s1203">And you know, to me, then I understood that they don’t like us too much.</span> <span id="s1204">I couldn’t find a – a barber to – to make my head, which looked terrible, of course, after all these years.</span> <span id="s1205">Nobody wanted to take me, when he understood that I am Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: That’s an awful lot for an 11 year old to have to look at, to deal with – 12 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1208">It was not nice.</span> <span id="s1209">You know, at that time it was really – later on – I went to Poland again.</span> <span id="s1210">I left in 1949 for Israel, when – when it was allowed, when the Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel.</span> <span id="s1211">But many years later I’ve been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s1212">So now they accepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a professor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist to come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but maybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel.</span> <span id="s1213">And they were very happy about it.</span> <span id="s1214">Made a dinner for me and so this was very nice.</span> <span id="s1215">And I tried to think all the time, is there still anti-Semitism in Poland?</span> <span id="s1216">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1217">It changed completely.</span> <span id="s1218">It became ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1219">It’s not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it’s an anti-Semitism of – of a ridiculous sort.</span> <span id="s1220">You could only laugh at it, you know?</span> <span id="s1221">I remember my – a – a cousin of mine in Israel went to the town, to Bendzin, and he took pictures, video pictures, he had a – a team which [indecipherable] for him.</span> <span id="s1222">And then he asked people, he went to the school.</span> <span id="s1223">The school exists, but it’s not called Furstenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: What happened to Furstenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Fursten(ph) was killed by the Germans, like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1226">It was – you know, they didn’t kill people because they were poor or rich, they killed people because they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1227">He was Jewish, that was enough.</span> <span id="s1228">He spoke at the school.</span> <span id="s1229">They asked him to speak, which – so he spoke with them, and si – before I start my talk, who knows what was the name of the school before the war?</span> <span id="s1230">Not one of them knew.</span> <span id="s1231">Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg?</span> <span id="s1232">Not one of them knew.</span> <span id="s1233">So he told them the history of the school and about.</span> <span id="s1234">Then he went into a place that looked very similar to our house.</span> <span id="s1235">So it’s three buildings around a large courtyard.</span> <span id="s1236">It was in another part of the city.</span> <span id="s1237">I knew that there were two places like this.</span> <span id="s1238">Ours was destroyed later, cause they put the – a road there.</span> <span id="s1239">They built a road there.</span> <span id="s1240">And the other place, he went there.</span> <span id="s1241">And in both places there were Jewish – there only Jewish people living.</span> <span id="s1242">And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked people, remember the Jews who lived here?</span> <span id="s1243">Nobody know.</span> <span id="s1244">He went into this house, where only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings.</span> <span id="s1245">And when they came out and they were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived here?</span> <span id="s1246">Not one.</span> <span id="s1247">You look at the people, he took pictures.</span> <span id="s1248">Old people that certainly lived there, you know, in the second World War.</span> <span id="s1249">Nobody remembers.</span> <span id="s1250">Then a dog passed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of the windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron.</span> <span id="s1251">So he says to her, that’s the name of the dog?</span> <span id="s1252">She says yes.</span> <span id="s1253">Why Aaron?</span> <span id="s1254">So she says, Aaron, that’s so that we remember the Jews who lived here.</span> <span id="s1255">This was the first time that he found somebody who remembered the Jews, you know, through the dog.</span> <span id="s1256">This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1257">That’s not the same anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even after the war, in the first years after the war.</span> <span id="s1258">It – it was just same like before the war, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: How do you explain that?</span> <span id="s1260">How do you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: You know, I’m not sure that I tried to think even about it.</span> <span id="s1262">It certainly changed, there’s no – today, it stopped at – it’s something on a personal level, it’s not – certainly not that [indecipherable] of a country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Did you feel when you were – when you were meeting with people, and they had this dinner, that there was a lack of sincerity?</span> <span id="s1264">That there was a lack of understanding, of genuineness, that somehow or other you couldn’t trust what it was that you were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: That they could not trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: No, that you could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Well, may – may well be like this, yes.</span> <span id="s1268">That – that I couldn’t trust everything that was said to me.</span> <span id="s1269">You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe three or four calls from the mayors of the townships of – which belonged to this area, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where Jews – Jewish people lived around, including Sztemaszitsa(ph), the – the village of my mother.</span> <span id="s1270">And after I left, and I left the invitation for one of the [indecipherable] from Dombrowa, one of the fi – five townships.</span> <span id="s1271">I got later maybe three or four calls from the mayors.</span> <span id="s1272">Look, maybe you take them for three weeks instead of two weeks.</span> <span id="s1273">And another one calls me, maybe you know, I have somebody else who may be better, maybe we’ll take two ones, you know.</span> <span id="s1274">[indecipherable] the Poles, one must understand it.</span> <span id="s1275">I don’t know if you read the book, it was Michener, was [indecipherable] Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: No, but I heard of it, I know of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: You know, when you read it, you – you read the history of a tragedy.</span> <span id="s1278">The Poles suffered always, from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1279">The Jews suffered more, but it was a tragedy for the Poles, what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1280">The Swedes attacked them, I think it was the 17th century, 17th or 18th, I believe 17th century, and massacred the Poles.</span> <span id="s1281">You know, they killed thousands, thousands of Poles.</span> <span id="s1282">And if it wasn’t the Swedes, then it was the Russians or the Germans, the Prussians, you know, all of the time.</span> <span id="s1283">They suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s1284">And on the – on the personal level, they suffered from the system, it was a feudal system.</span> <span id="s1285">Why are there so many Polish jokes, the Polack jokes in – in – in the United States, you know, because they came when the [indecipherable] was – was annihilated at the beginning of the 20th century, after the second World War, the end of the second World War, suddenly they could trave – they could g – and many of them traveled to the United States, they had relatives here or so – they came over here, most of them settled in Chicago, and it’s not only they didn’t know English, cause Ukraines also didn’t know English when they came over, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: You’re talking probably the first World War, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yes, first war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: First World War, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Did I say second?</span> <span id="s1290">No, first World War.</span> <span id="s1291">And the Ukraines when they came over, they also didn’t know English.</span> <span id="s1292">They didn't know English, but they didn’t know anything, they were uneducated.</span> <span id="s1293">They didn’t know to read and to write, most of them.</span> <span id="s1294">It – and – because in the feudal system they couldn’t go to school without permission to go to school was not given by the noblemen.</span> <span id="s1295">[indecipherable] want the educated people here, I need workers here.</span> <span id="s1296">And so, they [indecipherable] people like this, I think, always start trying to find the scapegoat.</span> <span id="s1297">The scapegoat for that – you know, it was a good feeling that there is somebody who is inferior to them.</span> <span id="s1298">And for this they have to show that the Jews are inferior.</span> <span id="s1299">And if they can kill the Jews, or you know, curse them or show their inferiority, then it gives them the superiority complex.</span> <span id="s1300">I think that’s the main reason for [indecipherable] anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1301">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1302">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: – I have five minutes more?</span> <span id="s1305">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: You have five minutes more, you have five minutes more.</span> <span id="s1307">You’ve more minutes, if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: You know, if I divide my history, my story into four periods, the fourth period was different.</span> <span id="s1309">That’s th – that’s the time when I came to Israel, and for the first time in my life I felt like equal with equals.</span> <span id="s1310">There was no problem any more.</span> <span id="s1311">I knew that when I go to school, I will not be chased up like in the Polish school where I remember very well.</span> <span id="s1312">In mathematics, I’m very good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s1313">I knew it, there was no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1314">But always I was given a very low –</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: – grade.</span> <span id="s1317">And I couldn’t understand it in that – in the last class when I was, I knew that I can get a grade which will not be enough to pass into the next class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: So you’re talking postwar, when you went to – postwar –</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Postwar, 1949, before I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: And I knew also that the teacher is anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1322">A young woman, anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1323">One day she came, and she said, whoever will – I’m giving here some exercises to do.</span> <span id="s1324">Whoever will finish it the first will get a very good grade.</span> <span id="s1325">A grade of very good.</span> <span id="s1326">And she was – I knew, that’s mine.</span> <span id="s1327">I filled it out for it, I came much before the second one, to give it to her.</span> <span id="s1328">And she didn’t take it, she was sitting there, she didn’t take it, she waited.</span> <span id="s1329">Then another boy came after me, and she took his.</span> <span id="s1330">I said, I was the first.</span> <span id="s1331">No, no, he was the first.</span> <span id="s1332">What can I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: And this happen – on the same day she gave another exercise and another exercise, and in all of them I was the first one of the whole class, by far, you know.</span> <span id="s1335">And then she had no choice, so she gave me good, but not very good.</span> <span id="s1336">She couldn’t – you know, all this changed, of course.</span> <span id="s1337">In Israel I was even.</span> <span id="s1338">And maybe that’s the best.</span> <span id="s1339">I went to school of medicine, became a doctor, became an ophthalmologist, professor of ophthalmology, so I could devote a lot to teaching.</span> <span id="s1340">I became a professor also here at the University of Illinois, where from time to time I have been there and I work there.</span> <span id="s1341">And in [indecipherable] I did many things for humanity, I would say, you know.</span> <span id="s1342">Like I went to Africa to work two years, with my family.</span> <span id="s1343">My wife and the two kids, when they – Zak, my son, who works here in [indecipherable] he was, at that time, five years old.</span> <span id="s1344">And the – I went to work for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: In what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: In Malawi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: In Malawi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Malawi is southeast.</span> <span id="s1349">And then I came back maybe 10 times to Africa, each time for periods of between three months to one month.</span> <span id="s1350">And I liked it.</span> <span id="s1351">It’s only mi – maybe five years ago when I went back to Rwanda to operate, to operate people.</span> <span id="s1352">And so there are, at least, 2,000 Africans who are walking around, who are walking around there seeing, just because I operated them, you know?</span> <span id="s1353">So it gives you a good feeling.</span> <span id="s1354">Maybe that’s the – the revenge on the Nazis – Nazis.</span> <span id="s1355">They not only didn’t succeed to kill you, but also they couldn’t prevent me, you know, doing things for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: – humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1359">They didn’t take away your humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1361">Didn’t stop me from doing it.</span> <span id="s1362">I’m in the last nine years.</span> <span id="s1363">I am in – a doctor, a specialist in Saint John Eye Hospital, which is an eye hospital in eastern Jerusalem that serves the Arab population of the West Bank and Gaza.</span> <span id="s1364">Mainly it serves the Arab population of Jerusalem, but also of all the complicated cases are sent over to me.</span> <span id="s1365">So I see there a lot of complicated cases from the West Bank and from Gaza as well.</span> <span id="s1366">And I continue with this, I like it, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Do you – do you have more interaction beyond – beyond being a doctor to them?</span> <span id="s1368">Is there any way of – of – I don’t even know how to put the question.</span> <span id="s1369">Do your Palestinian patients get to know you, do you get to know them in some ways?</span> <span id="s1370">A: Well, they know me and they like me, I’ve no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1371">You cannot get through a certain level.</span> <span id="s1372">A couple – also because of different attitude and different way of thinking, you know?</span> <span id="s1373">It was maybe three or four months ago, where I gave an injection into the eye of an Arab patient.</span> <span id="s1374">It’s a thing which I do a lot, I give at least 10 injections every week.</span> <span id="s1375">That’s the modern, new way to treat some eye diseases.</span> <span id="s1376">And I gave him this injection.</span> <span id="s1377">And he stands up and says, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.</span> <span id="s1378">After four or five times I say to my nurse, look, he knows two words in English, thank and you.</span> <span id="s1379">So tell him to speak Arabic, and you’ll translate for me.</span> <span id="s1380">So she said all right.</span> <span id="s1381">And he say something in Arabic, and she translates it to me.</span> <span id="s1382">He wants to bless you.</span> <span id="s1383">And he wants to tell you – to wish that you will have four wives.</span> <span id="s1384">So, you know, this was – so it is a different way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: But he means well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: He means well, I have no doubt.</span> <span id="s1387">I said they liked me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Professor Merin, the last question I have before we end, unless there is something else that you would like to add to what we have talked about, is that my impression is that you didn’t – you didn't have a chance to really be a child, except in very stolen moments, when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s1389">That you had to grow up and be pretty strong, very early on.</span> <span id="s1390">That’s my impression.</span> <span id="s1391">Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: That’s certainly very true.</span> <span id="s1393">I – in fact, the only thing that – the only thing that I behaved like a child is the place in – in – in the hiding place, there, wa – how I played with my sister.</span> <span id="s1394">And this was all about imaginary things with the – we put up.</span> <span id="s1395">So this was one and a half years that we played around with this, lucky, because I think that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least from th-the – the point of view of my soul, you know, about – which was a chil – child’s soul at that time, you know, at the – this was only one and a half years, just at the time when it was the worst time for me.</span> <span id="s1396">You know, li-living without my parents, living in a place like this, in a closed place like this, and living on very poor food.</span> <span id="s1397">Just in that time, I think I felt a child at that time.</span> <span id="s1398">Just playing around with all this, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: In – in these circumstances –</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: – I think this was lucky, yes, this was lucky.</span> <span id="s1401">I think it happened also with the other children, who survived at that time, that they – they survived because they played the imaginary plays, you know?</span> <span id="s1402">And this kept them alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: When you had your own children, did you play with them more because – because of that?</span> <span id="s1404">Did you – did – was there anything from this entire history that showed up when your children were the same ages that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: I never – I never made such decisions, but yes, the truth is that it was like this.</span> <span id="s1406">You know, you are all the time – I was already a doctor.</span> <span id="s1407">I – I married when I was a student, and I was a doctor when I had children already.</span> <span id="s1408">And in Africa when they came to – with me to Africa, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in the hospital in the evening, was not a now – a night that I didn’t sit down with them for half an hour at least, and tell them a story.</span> <span id="s1409">All imaginary stories, you know.</span> <span id="s1410">But they still remember it day – today.</span> <span id="s1411">My son here, well, I think he told to his children already, some of the stories I was telling them at the time.</span> <span id="s1412">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: This concludes our United States Holocaust Memorial
