<p><span id="s32">Q: And Dachau was the camp then that you had been involved with?</span> <span id="s33">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: How did you first hear about the camp, Mr. Barton?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: I really don't remember the first time or anything like that.</span> <span id="s36">The troops had heard of it even before we went over.</span> <span id="s37">We heard of Dachau and what was the other one?</span> <span id="s38">What's that other big one they have there?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: There's Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s40">There were quite a few camps.</span> <span id="s41">A: We just heard of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: But you did hear the names, is that it?</span> <span id="s43">How were they identified?</span> <span id="s44">Was the word "concentration camp" used at the time?</span> <span id="s45">You are not too sure.</span> <span id="s46">It’s a long time since, so its hard to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Right.</span> <span id="s48">Concentration camp was probably the terminology.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: How did you come across the camp?</span> <span id="s50">How did you get there in the area?</span> <span id="s51">A: We were riding right at that particular time.</span> <span id="s52">Just advancing.</span> <span id="s53">That’s all Q: And you came across the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: We heard that we were going to run into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Were you prepared in any way for what you were going to see?</span> <span id="s56">A: Really not.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: You were there and you saw the camp.</span> <span id="s58">What do you remember seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Just a large type enclosure.</span> <span id="s60">Before you got up to the main gate, though, there was an American tank that the Germans had captured and had fired back on the American troops, and the American troops had finally burned it up.</span> <span id="s61">That was standing there.</span> <span id="s62">That was the first thing we saw more or less, because it was right</span></p> <p><span id="s63">outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Do you remember the date that you were there?</span> <span id="s65">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: That’s all right.</span> <span id="s67">I was just interested to see whether or not you remembered.</span> <span id="s68">A: Those dates were....</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q Like a fog right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: That's right, just a day was a day, there was no significance.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: It completed when the night came.</span> <span id="s72">You knew the day was finished.</span> <span id="s73">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So you remember seeing the tank in front of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s76">And then we stayed around there awhile.</span> <span id="s77">Also, there was a railroad siding there and as well as I recall there were at least two or three rows of tracks.</span> <span id="s78">And those sidings were full of boxcars with human beings in them, and the smell, the stench, was just so awful that I said I don't want to go inside and see anymore of this stuff at all.</span> <span id="s79">So I just hung outside with some more of us.</span> <span id="s80">There weren't too many American troops right at that time, because we were advancing so fast, and I was just fortunate to be right amongst that little head group.</span> <span id="s81">I was in the medical detachment and we were right close following them for....</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Having been in the medical detachment, did you receive any assignments for this particular area for your detachment?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did you speak to those that did go into the camp when they came out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s86">I have some pictures.</span> <span id="s87">There was a.fellow that took pictures inside.</span> <span id="s88">I’ve got some of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did they share anything with you that they had seen or heard or experienced while in the camp?</span> <span id="s90">Did they talk about being in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, but just the horrors.</span> <span id="s92">The majority of the human beings there was nothing but skin and bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did you see any alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh , sure.</span> <span id="s95">They were all out near the fence area, and quite a few of them had even got out the main gate.</span> <span id="s96">Most of them were in striped uniforms, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did any of them come towards you?</span> <span id="s98">Were you near any of them?</span> <span id="s99">A: I don't even recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Do you remember your feelings at the time you saw these people?</span> <span id="s101">A: It’s just something that you didn't believe happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did you look at them as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s104">It’s just horrible to look at some of the pictures and see these [unintelligible] by the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s105">Just looked in those boxcars and just see such...as I said, it was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did you see quite a bit of combat in your war experience?</span> <span id="s107">You saw a lot of death?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: When you saw these boxcars filled with bodies, which meant certainly death, was your reaction any different to that than the reaction you had to seeing death in combat?</span> <span id="s110">Do you remember feeling any different between what you saw in combat and what you saw there, or was it just one war experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: It was a war experience you might call it.</span> <span id="s112">Q: How long were you around that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I presume we stayed around there close to two hours, then we went to hunt a place to stay for the night.</span> <span id="s114">And we moved into a beer hall.</span> <span id="s115">I think they call it a rathskeller.</span> <span id="s116">We were unloading the equipment to take in there, and the Germans opened up one of their guns.</span> <span id="s117">There was a fellow just about six feet in front of me who got hit on the head and on the shoulders with some of the yak yak.</span> <span id="s118">That was, as far as I recall, something like a couple hours or so, after we really had gone into the concentration camp as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did you say you saw any civilians?</span> <span id="s120">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s121">sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Were you able to converse with them at all?</span> <span id="s123">Did you have any knowledge of German?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I picked up a little, and also one of the fellows that ran around with me spoke German.</span> <span id="s125">He was a Mennonite, and of course I stayed with him.</span> <span id="s126">We were really quite close.</span> <span id="s127">[Unintelligible] ran right together every second and we even went in some of the German homes over there where the fields were.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: What were some of the things these people in the German homes shared with you?</span> <span id="s129">How did you feel about the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: In a way you felt sorry for the so-called family unit, because I think that they were in the same position we were, that they were forced into that situation.</span> <span id="s131">And in the military they made exceptions to that.</span> <span id="s132">They were all very devoted to their German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Were they Nazis as such?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: When we would get there, naturally they would say anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s135">That was their philosophy which I guess they did in order for us to accept them as anti-Nazi, instead of Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you accept them, really, or did you just have to make do?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: You just associated with some of them, so to speak, because you had no way of knowing what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: You weren’t fearful to associate with them?</span> <span id="s139">We are talking about the civilians.</span> <span id="s140">A: In a way, yes.</span> <span id="s141">I didn't trust some of them too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: But you did go into their homes?</span> <span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And when you went in there, did you see any obvious signs of their membership in the Nazi party?</span> <span id="s145">Pictures or uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: You’d see pictures of their sons or son-in-laws or something of that nature in their homes, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Would you question them if you saw those pictures?</span> <span id="s148">Did you question them?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: You might say, “Is this your son?”</span> <span id="s150">or “Who is this?”</span> <span id="s151">or something of that nature, and most of the time they would volunteer the information.</span> <span id="s152">The picture was prominent, and they would see your kind of gazing at it and would say when they saw that “That's my son.”</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was this after you saw Dachau that you went into the Germans homes?</span> <span id="s154">A: Maybe both.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you feel differently, after you saw Dachau, going into a German home as opposed to the way you may have felt before you saw Dachau going into a German home?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I really don't recall to be exact, because they were Germans, and that was the whole thing.</span> <span id="s157">They were Germans, and we just had a little reluctance in believing them or being associated with them in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: How do you feel about Germans today?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: To be honest with you, I am still not too close to a German.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t know why -- just can't accept them.</span> <span id="s161">I can't accept Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Japanese?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: As well.</span> <span id="s164">It's just something that you feel inside, that what those people caused in the world and in particular to individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you see the Holocaust TV movie?</span> <span id="s166">A: I saw excerpts of it, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: You chose not to watch it?</span> <span id="s168">You just didn't have time?</span> <span id="s169">A: I didn’t have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I thought maybe you specifically said I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s171">A: No, I just didn’t have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Have you ever shared the Dachau encounter with your family?</span> <span id="s173">Were you married at the time you were in service?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did you share that Dachau experience with your wife, through letters at the time?</span> <span id="s176">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Probably did.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: You have no letters?</span> <span id="s179">Letters weren’t kept?</span> <span id="s180">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Were your children ever made aware of your experience?</span> <span id="s182">A: Didn’t have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s184">Didn't ask you before whether or not you had children.</span> <span id="s185">Have you ever shared the Dachau experience you had before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: You mean mentioned it to people?</span> <span id="s187">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes, I have, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were they receptive in listening or did they not believe you?</span> <span id="s190">What was their reaction when you shared it with those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: They were just like we were -- just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s192">They just couldn’t believe that those certain conditions would exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: How did you see the Dachau experiences at the time?</span> <span id="s194">Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between thinking about it at the time and thinking about it after the fact.</span> <span id="s195">Did you see it as a total political means of war?</span> <span id="s196">Did you see it as a specific religious persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Political.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What about the other men that went into the camp?</span> <span id="s199">Did they share any view with you as to how they felt about what they saw?</span> <span id="s200">Were there any Jewish men in your group that you remember or that you can identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes, there were.</span> <span id="s202">In fact, this fellow that took the pictures and gave them tome was Jewish.</span> <span id="s203">Of course, he would just rave about it.</span> <span id="s204">He would talk about it, what went on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Was there a difference in the way he received that experience as opposed to the way you did because he was Jewish, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I just don't know right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Fine.</span> <span id="s208">I was just trying to find out exactly what you do remember from that period.</span> <span id="s209">And not remembering is information too.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Were there any German civilians around that you remember at the time that you were near, outside of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I don’t believe there were many German civil ians around.</span> <span id="s213">As I said, there weren't too many American troops right at that first so-called couple of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: You said you were not going to go in there.</span> <span id="s215">You had seen those boxcars and it was more than enough, apparently, for you to view at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Did you just stand out there?</span> <span id="s218">What did you do?</span> <span id="s219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Just stand.</span> <span id="s221">And when you stood out there, what did you see happening?</span> <span id="s222">Fellow soldiers going in there?</span> <span id="s223">Describe to us what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: They were just milling around, going into the camp.</span> <span id="s225">They wouldn't let too many of them go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Who wasn't letting too many go in?</span> <span id="s227">A: The American guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: There were American guards there?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes, after they took over, there were American guards there on the gate.</span> <span id="s230">There weren’t too many allowed in there until they investigated.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And did you see any reactions that your fellow soldiers had to what they saw --vomiting, looks on their faces?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s233">Like I said, the smell arouond there was just so horrible.</span> <span id="s234">You just couldn’t stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And you just kind of stood there and watched the action going on?</span> <span id="s236">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s237">Ready to move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Couldn't wait to leave the scene?</span> <span id="s239">A: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: What is your religion?</span> <span id="s241">A: I am a Methodist.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And did you consider yourself a religious person at the time?</span> <span id="s243">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And when you saw this scene at Dachau, were there any conscious thoughts of God or religion at the time that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Naturally.</span> <span id="s246">Just thoughts of one human being so called doing that to another human being without him being able to fight back.</span> <span id="s247">That’s the gist of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did that experience, specifically, at Dachau create a difference in feeling toward the Civil Rights movement here in the United States or Viet Nam war or The Mid East situation?</span> <span id="s249">Did it in any way affect your thinking about those political situations?</span> <span id="s250">Did you relate in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Haven’t thought too much about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No.</span> <span id="s254">I really haven't.</span> <span id="s255">I didn’t relate them really as similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Because you mentioned you saw this as a political situation and I was kind of interested in what you might have thought [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s257">Okay.</span> <span id="s258">Did you see the Dachau experience as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: That's really what it was classified as according to my understanding.</span> <span id="s260">More or less a Jewish situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Now, personally, I don't know whether they were all Jews or not so I couldn’t answer that.</span> <span id="s263">All I can say is that’s what we were told.</span> <span id="s264">I think it is more political than it was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Did this cause any change in attitude toward Jews as a people in light of that fact that you recognized that it was classified as a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I didn’t have any attitudes.</span> <span id="s267">A human being is a human being is my philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Do you feel a need to do something today to make sure a similar situation does not occur again?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Would like to, but here again it gets back into politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Your being here today is a help.</span> <span id="s271">Sharing your experience.</span> <span id="s272">Do you think teaching Holocaust which Dachau is certainly classified as part of is an appropriate subject to be taught in the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: There again, depends on which way that you are talking about as far as feeling out some of the information that existed as such.</span> <span id="s274">I don’t see any harm in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: You don’t see any harm in it?</span> <span id="s276">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What do you think it would do if, indeed, it was taught in the church?</span> <span id="s278">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s279">There again, you got pros and cons.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Let's talk about the cons.</span> <span id="s281">Do you think it could do some damage to expose a congregation to some of this [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I don't think so, really.</span> <span id="s283">I just don't see how it really could.</span> <span id="s284">Q: What good do you think it would do?</span> <span id="s285">Talking about the pros.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Getting back to your question you asked me what we could do to prevent an occurrence of something like that.</span> <span id="s287">There again, I don’t have the answer.</span> <span id="s288">I don't know what we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Do you think teaching it would be one way of helping at least?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: It would help at least.</span> <span id="s291">Yes.</span> <span id="s292">There again, if you get another type dictator in anywhere like Hitler, then everything is gone -- your morals, all your teaching, and everything.</span> <span id="s293">So there you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: In light of the Mid East situation today and the anticipated oil shortage, do you think something like this can occur again?</span> <span id="s295">To try to put the blame some place for the oil shortage do you think they would blame Israel and United States' connection with Israel?</span> <span id="s296">Do you think this is a feasible thing ?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s298">I just hope it doesn’t.</span> <span id="s299">Let’s just do it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Is there any other experience you had at Dachau that you would like to share with us that we have not covered?</span> <span id="s301">Any question that you have not answered.</span> <span id="s302">Information that you would like to share with us at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: We thank you very, very much for your time and sharing your experience with us.</span></p></body></html>
