Would you state your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Wallace – ah, at birth.</span> <span id="s18">Vodjemiuszph) Arkodiusz(ph) Witkowski, that is the full Polish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your name currently?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Wallace A. Witkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: January 12, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born in Kielce, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: In the previous interview, you spoke briefly about leaving Communist Poland to join your father in Detroit.</span> <span id="s26">Could you talk about what you remember that it felt like to leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, if you humor me for a second, it just struck me as you were introducing this interview, that today is September one, and to me it is a very emotional date, for more than one reason.</span> <span id="s28">First of all, as I may have put in my earlier interview, this is when my childhood essentially ended.</span> <span id="s29">I was 11 and a half and the German armies marched into Poland in 1939.</span> <span id="s30">By a curious coincident, although I don’t believe there are coincidence in – in creation, last September one my mother died at the age of 94.</span> <span id="s31">Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: That was just one year ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So this is the first anniversary of her death?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Today is the anniversary, yes.</span> <span id="s36">My father came to the United States about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s37">But of course – and he was located with a mission in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit, but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose and liquidated its activities and most of the people returned to England and Europe.</span> <span id="s38">However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the United States cell.</span> <span id="s39">By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a – where are we and obviously trying to bring us over.</span> <span id="s40">Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself.</span> <span id="s41">Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the country.</span> <span id="s42">My mother received that from the government, who – which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists could solidify their grip on that country and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave Poland and join her husband in the United States, but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948?</span> <span id="s43">I was 20, my sister was 18.</span> <span id="s44">So I determined to escape from Poland and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to get on a Swedish coal freighter, which was leaving Polish port city of Gdynia and was going to Goteborg, Sweden.</span> <span id="s45">I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my native land.</span> <span id="s46">To me it was escape from a prison, which was becoming worse and worse.</span> <span id="s47">And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route.</span> <span id="s48">And of course, I managed, I succeeded, my sister didn’t and was caught by the communists and briefly imprisoned.</span> <span id="s49">So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years.</span> <span id="s50">And I think I described in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the United States and trying to locate my father.</span> <span id="s51">But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s53">So, then you were in the United States with your father and later joined by your mother and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Sister having to wait several years before the gradual mellowing of the communist government permitted her to leave legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you speak English when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I had two years of high school English, so you can appreciate.</span> <span id="s57">A similar experience to American kids learning foreign languages in high school.</span> <span id="s58">It is essentially a very, very superficial knowledge of – of language.</span> <span id="s59">I walked around with a dictionary in my hand wherever I went, so that I – you could – I could look up words and communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I turned 21, you may recall from the interview, I managed to arrive in the United States three days before my birthday, my 21st birthday, on which the then American immigration law would cut me off as a minor child of an American citizen and would make me wait for a number of years before I could get under a Polish quota.</span> <span id="s62">But up until January 12, 1949, I could come in non-quota, and I made it within three days before the deadline.</span> <span id="s63">I was very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So you were able to become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: In due time.</span> <span id="s66">I – I – in thr – the law at that time – I was married in 1951, two years later, and as a husband of an American citizen, I didn't have to wait five years, I could become a citizen after three years.</span> <span id="s67">But I did not automatically become a U.S. citizen as a minor child.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So, you arrived, you’re living with your father, and you don’t s –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: In Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: In Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You don’t speak very much English.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: And I am several years older than my contemporaries, because the first thing that I did is to enroll again in an American high school, and had [indecipherable] to be sure, and try to graduate from an American high school, even though I was already a graduate of Polish gymnasium, and I had attended first semester of a polytechnic in – in Gdansk.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Okay, what year did you enter high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: American high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: I mean, what year of the high school, what class were you placed –</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: O-Oh, the senior year, senior year.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Senior year.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s80">The following – the following May I graduated, or June.</span> <span id="s81">And I went through the American high school rituals, including the prom and – and all the attendant other traditional activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And how were you received by other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: The other kids were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s84">Curious, open, positive.</span> <span id="s85">It was especially more – more reflective, more thoughtful.</span> <span id="s86">Kids tried to befriend me, tried to learn something from me.</span> <span id="s87">I-It was very interesting and very positive.</span> <span id="s88">I have encountered absolutely no – no negative reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were there other refugee children in your high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: In my particular high school, no.</span> <span id="s91">I found some other people who survived the war from Europe in my college years at Wayne State University.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I had one particular friend, whose name of course, now escapes me.</span> <span id="s94">But at the time, I discovered that he was a young Jewish boy, maybe a few years younger than I, but who attended the Wayne State University, who told me about his war experiences, and he was Jewish and his mother, in the last couple years of war, kept him in a barrel somewhere.</span> <span id="s95">It – and he lived in a barrel and that stayed with me.</span> <span id="s96">But in Hamtramck High School, it was just the typical American high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Proud, and loafers with pennies in them and stuff like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: What appealed to you in particular about being in that high school, having those friends, being in that teenage – well, you weren’t a teenage – but being – it was a teenage culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Oh, the girls were very pretty by my standards.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: And I – that was probably the most positive thing and – and I remember – I was just reflecting on it recently that I took to the prom a lovely Hispanic looking girl that was just absolutely beautiful and I barely knew her, but I asked her to go to the prom with me, and she did.</span> <span id="s103">The negative feelings were awareness of great loneliness, because I didn't really fit with the crowd, didn’t do anything with them, e-except encountered them in – in the school.</span> <span id="s104">And I did achieve a sort of a fame when in the speech class, by good old – run by good old Mrs. Homestead, I was given an assignment to learn and recite a poem, and I did.</span> <span id="s105">And in perfected English, which came with considerable difficulty at the time, I managed to impress the class.</span> <span id="s106">Forget what it was.</span> <span id="s107">How do I love thee, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And so it took awhile before you were comfortable with English?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: There are two curious stages that I believe not only I, but a number of people that I spoke, who – to – to who were in a similar situation, go through.</span> <span id="s110">One is, you begin to – I – I forget which came first.</span> <span id="s111">You begin to dream in English and then you begin to think in English.</span> <span id="s112">Maybe thinking comes first and then you begin to dream in English.</span> <span id="s113">And then you make this great, slow transition that is so wonderfully described by a woman who became quite a celebrity, the author of the book, “Lost in Translation,” Eva Hoffman.</span> <span id="s114">I enjoyed that book very much.</span> <span id="s115">Very, very similar experiences in some ways, and in some ways different.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Within two years, because in spite of the – in spite of being with the father, I felt estranged from him.</span> <span id="s118">He wanted me to be 11 year old that he left behind, and I was 21.</span> <span id="s119">So that may have contributed to my th – early decision to – to marry, and I met a lovely Polish American girl who spoke Polish and whose parents were very, very interested in her marrying a – a Polish fellow, of course.</span> <span id="s120">So I did that, sort of – well, this was the first girl I knew really intimately and so I married in 1951, and th – even though we were both in college, the children came.</span> <span id="s121">First my son, born in ’52, then my first daughter, born in ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Matthew and Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So those are not Polish names?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, he was called Maczik(ph) and she was called Elzunia(ph), which is in a diminutive form, Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: But their actual legal names were?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Oh, Elizabeth and Matthew.</span> <span id="s128">Which is curious because the two girls born of the second marriage, 20 years later, have their legal names in Polish, even though their mother was not Polish at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So was that mainly your idea, or mainly your wife’s idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, I – I went along with the – with the – it was a joint decision of the wife and – and myself to – to give them that – that identity, which first they hated and then they loved it when they discovered – my daughter, my middle daughter, Krisha(ph) got into the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, I’m convinced, by writing a very beautiful essay on how to – how it feels to be a child of – of the Polish immigrant.</span> <span id="s131">And that was a very impressive piece of writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So, with your second family you were more focused on your Polish roots, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I wouldn’t say that that was the case.</span> <span id="s134">If anything, in the second family, I was more focused on being a better father, because the second family – the first family was – and life of the first family was characterized by an intense effort to become Americanized.</span> <span id="s135">To learn the language, learn the language well, be able to command it.</span> <span id="s136">After all, I decided to become a lawyer.</span> <span id="s137">And the second and – and the – and the fathering or the parenting was largely traditional in the first marriage and – and largely unexamined.</span> <span id="s138">And so I now, in retrospect of 70 years of age, I think that I was a much better father second time around.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Going back to your earlier years in America, how did you decide to go to law school?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s141">I was first interested in speech and government and I studied a number of courses.</span> <span id="s142">But by chance again, which I don’t believe in, I was offered a job as a young assistant to two elderly gentlemen who were conducting a Polish radio program on WJLB station in Detroit.</span> <span id="s143">At that time this was one of the booth stations that specialized in ethnic programs.</span> <span id="s144">And every morning there were one or two hours of Polish language programs.</span> <span id="s145">Music, news, advertising.</span> <span id="s146">And I started as a – of what you call today, a disc jockey.</span> <span id="s147">And then finally wound up, while already in law school and using a nom de plume, giving news commentaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What was your nom de plume?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, Jan Alexander, which was sort of a compromise.</span> <span id="s150">It could have been Polish, it could have been some other nationality, so we – we – I deliberately fudged it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you – you choose the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I think – I think I did.</span> <span id="s153">Some – something struck me.</span> <span id="s154">I seem to recall that the reason I chose it was deliberate, but it was a connection to either the Polish – first Polish newspaper which – which was published in Poland over 300 years ago, or s – in – there was some reason, there was some rational – there was some rationale behind choosing that particular assumed name to broadcast under.</span> <span id="s155">So that was, at that time – however, I looked at the broadcasting and I did not see much future for the ethnic broadcasting, I felt that it would keep me a little bit too much in the ethnic community and I wanted to – not to limit myself.</span> <span id="s156">And I married –</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Wh-When you were broadcasting, were – were you broadcasting in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: In Polish, yes, so I continued my Polish and that’s why I was – I was picked by the owners of the program because I had good diction, good ra – what we called the radiophonic voice and therefore they thought that was a good addition of a good, fresh voice to their broadcast.</span> <span id="s159">And the young lady that I married, her father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s160">And so I worked part time in his office as a clerk, and then I thought hm, I like dealing with people, I like helping people, I – why not?</span> <span id="s161">And so I – by that time I was in the third year of my college education at Wayne.</span> <span id="s162">And at that time Wayne State University had a so-called combined curriculum.</span> <span id="s163">If you could maintain a certain level of grades, B minus I think it was, in the first year – first three years of undergraduate studies, you could go to law school, and assuming that you maintain your level of grades in the first year of law school, you would then receive credit for the f-fourth year of undergraduate sta – study and get your B.A., which is what I did.</span> <span id="s164">And then two more years and then I had my L.B., which was later changed retrospectively to J.D., juris doctor, doctor of laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And where did you go to law school?</span> <span id="s166">A: Same Wayne State University, since I lived in Detroit.</span> <span id="s167">I graduated from Wayne State in 19 – from the law school in 1956.</span> <span id="s168">And for the next six years, I joined my father-in-law in private practice, which was mostly probate and real estate and very simple neighborhood ethnic – ethnic practice because obviously we turned our bilingual skills into assets by – by working with the Polish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So you often dealt with your clients in the Polish language?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s171">Towards the last two years in Detroit, around 1960 or so, I was even appointed by two successive mayors of Detroit as a member of the community relations commission, which was a so-called racial commission.</span> <span id="s172">Detroit had a very checkered history of racial relations and they wanted some – they – they – people appointed people to these commissions.</span> <span id="s173">They wanted representatives of ethnic communities to kind of dialog and – and work together on racial problems of the city.</span> <span id="s174">But then, of course, I had to resign from that commission and give up my practice when in 1962 I was offered a job in Washington, which was to last three years, and it was again in – in the area of both languages, because it was handling the claims for World War II losses by the – by the American nationals who suffered these losses in Poland and it required knowledge of Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Now these would be American citizens, probably of Polish descent who had property [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Most of the claimants, interestingly enough, were survivors of the owners of property in Poland, very often relatives, a substantial number of them Jewish, who laid claims to compensation for reasons that the whole family in Poland was wiped out by the Nazis, that they were the next of kin now.</span> <span id="s177">But there were a number of requirements.</span> <span id="s178">The ownership of the property in Poland had to be established to – ownership had to be established that it – let me start again.</span> <span id="s179">Owners had to be American nationals at the time of loss, they could not have had it – it’s a legal issue that I don’t go into because it – I don’t think it’s – it’s too technical.</span> <span id="s180">If someone subsequently became an American citizen, it didn’t count because he was not a citizen of the United States at the time of loss.</span> <span id="s181">The language of the agreement between the United States government and government of Poland, communist government of Poland specified that these losses, these claims will be compensated only to the extent to – to – to – to which the owners were Americans at the time of loss.</span> <span id="s182">Do dogs bother you, Marcia?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And what appealed to you about taking this job, this position?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, two things, Washington, the capitol of the United States.</span> <span id="s185">An opportunity to broaden my experience as a lawyer, and a certain prestige that went with being selected as an identifiable Polish American to work on – on the Claims Commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And the content of the work, did that have appeal for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: That was very, very appealing from the point of view, not only being interesting, but also permitted me to utilize my knowledge of the country, my knowledge of Polish history, my knowledge and insight into – of character of many of these losses.</span> <span id="s188">Maybe not so much the character of the losses as being able to deliver to my government a – a f – a – a sort of a sober objective, hopefully, assessment of not only the possibility that these people really lost claims.</span> <span id="s189">There were a lot of outrageous claims that were based on total fiction sometimes.</span> <span id="s190">And being able to – to assist my superiors in saying that this is not probable, we better check this through our field office.</span> <span id="s191">And in fact, in 1963, within a year, I was sent to Warsaw for three months to help run the field office that was verifying claims of American citizens by going through the country, checking the land records if they existed, checking, investigating with the neighbors and people who still lived there, whether such and such family really owned the bakery or really had the butcher shop or – or – or owned the – an apartment house, and that was very rewarding, I-I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And what did it feel like for you to be back in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: It was also very gratifying because I went on official passports, so it’s a native boy who – who did well, comes back with the official U.S. passport, not the tourist passport.</span> <span id="s194">And I was given all the privileges of the American embassy in Warsaw and I – i-it was an accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you have friends and family in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Oh, I had many, many aunts and first cousins and we got together, it was a great time.</span> <span id="s197">It was also a lot of fun, in addition to working very hard and trying to – trying to adjudicate – not adjudicate, but recommend an adjudication of these claims.</span> <span id="s198">So it was a very good experience, from a professional point of view, which later qualified me to be offered a job in Western Pacific when – when I went to Micronesia in ’70, which I men – may have mentioned before.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: I don’t think that’s on your previous interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Maybe I skipped that altogether.</span> <span id="s201">I was already working for the Federal Trade Commission, when a general counsel from the foreign claims settlement commission called me and said, we would like to offer you a job in Micronesia, and I said micro-where?</span> <span id="s202">And of course I agreed, provided they borrowed me, as one agency borrowing an employee from another, so I could return to my steady job.</span> <span id="s203">And for three years I worked in the western Pacific, on the island of Saipan.</span> <span id="s204">I was a member of the Claims Commission at one time – well, I was a vice-chairman of the commission and at one time even an acting chairman when the prior chairman was sacked.</span> <span id="s205">But that permitted me to still extend my experience to a rather exotic location and assignment and – and continue my – my – my mosaic of – of legal experience.</span> <span id="s206">I was dealing with very – what we would call in this society, primitive societies.</span> <span id="s207">But I discovered it just because it was not a society that maintained good written records.</span> <span id="s208">Claims and stories that they gave us were absolutely accurate and we developed a system of – of dealing with claims similar to the one that we did when we were dealing with Poland.</span> <span id="s209">What stuck out of the profile of a typical claim required greater scrutiny than – outrageous claim required considerable degree of proof.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Do you think that your experience during the war had anything to do with your feeling about working for fairness and justice?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I felt very righteous doing the right things.</span> <span id="s212">I was not involved, thank God, in any le – any professional activity that would really be testing my values, or causing a crisis to me in what I believed in.</span> <span id="s213">I felt very righteous.</span> <span id="s214">In fact, I remember on a very crucial precedent decision that the commission issued, I sided with two native commissioners against two American commissioners.</span> <span id="s215">And because there were five members of the commission, the – the majority prevailed and – and I was the swing vote.</span> <span id="s216">I felt very good about it, when trying to look at the values from the point of view of the island culture and not from the point of view of American society’s values and – and – and culture, because the loss that these people suffered was a loss in their minds, in – in – in their terms, on their terms – no, in their terms, a-and that had to be addressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s218">We’re getting near the end of the tape, so let’s stop here and turn it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: – continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Wallace Witkowski, tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s222">Mr. Witkowski, could you continue to talk about your professional career?</span> <span id="s223">You were in Micronesia, and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I spent three years in Micronesia and like people who come to Washington get Potomac fever, I too had a very difficult time leaving the Micronesian experience behind.</span> <span id="s225">I think it was a turning point for me in the sense that I saw a very simple society, with very simple needs, very simple ambitions, that – whose members appeared to be very happy and very content.</span> <span id="s226">We did corrupt them a little bit with the ease of agricultural surplus commodities, availability.</span> <span id="s227">Using our standards applied to the island star – standards, most of these people were below the level of poverty, but they lived off of subsistence agriculture, and they didn’t know how little they had until the Americans told them.</span> <span id="s228">That was a turning point in the sense that I admitted to myself and discovered that I no longer need to try to be any more American than I became, and I can be just simply myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Well, how were you trying t – previously to be more American?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: It’s very hard to articulate, but any person born abroad, coming to America, tries very hard to become Americanized, at least it’s a typical, let’s say, pattern.</span> <span id="s231">I mean, there will be staunch individualists who will refuse to become American, they will be French or they will be German, or they will be this and that, for reasons of either because they think that their ethnic background or cultural background is superior to the American – many, many foreigners come to America with a rather superior feeling about their own culture.</span> <span id="s232">It’s a defense mechanism of sort, I believe.</span> <span id="s233">Here, I was trying to absorb American values, American customs, American tradition.</span> <span id="s234">I wanted my children to be American, after all, they are my roots in this country.</span> <span id="s235">I simply wanted to be able to live in this society and function in this society the best I could.</span> <span id="s236">Returning from Micronesia made me aware that I don’t have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another mountain, or – for example, when I returned to Washington, I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don’t care about the antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues.</span> <span id="s237">I spent two or three years battling a – a ca – in – in – fighting in a case in which the law was changed after – after a couple years and I felt the – like standing on a shifting sand.</span> <span id="s238">I realized also that I’m not happy not dealing with people.</span> <span id="s239">So then I switched in my career to consumer protection, because the Federal Trade Commission has two main functions.</span> <span id="s240">The antitrust – enforcement of the antitrust laws, which it shares with the justice department, and the consumer protection fo – mission.</span> <span id="s241">And I felt much more comfortable in the consumer protection area.</span> <span id="s242">And in fact, I continued from a year or two after I returned from Micronesia until I retired in 1994 – four.</span> <span id="s243">So that was the rest of my career in the government.</span> <span id="s244">I – I was an enforcement attorney, and a senior attorney, thought of well, getting good reviews.</span> <span id="s245">But I realized that I came to Washington for three years and I stayed in the government 32 years.</span> <span id="s246">I was qualified to retire, and I was getting – I was ready to move on, and in the meantime, personal crises, my second marriage failed also.</span> <span id="s247">I started worrying about myself, who am I and what am I doing with my life and what’s going on?</span> <span id="s248">And I started examining my life probably around the age of 50, not before.</span> <span id="s249">By that time I was a father of four.</span> <span id="s250">I was bravely putting them through school and supporting them and giving the older children educations.</span> <span id="s251">Thank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the – the last two daughters went to college.</span> <span id="s252">But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up.</span> <span id="s253">I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to.</span> <span id="s254">But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied.</span> <span id="s255">I went into therapy, first of all, because I really got scared when my second marriage failed and I felt unhappy and I felt alienated and I felt a failure.</span> <span id="s256">And so, started my spiritual journey with reading such semi-spiritual but still thought provoking books as memoirs of Carl Jung, “Memories, Dreams, Reflections,” or even M – what’s his name, ems – George Peck or Scott Peck?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Scott Peck.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Scott Peck, “The Road Less Traveled.”</span> <span id="s259">One of the unfortunate developments caused by the age that I – I forget names, places, things.</span> <span id="s260">We call it senior moments, but I’m sure you’ve heard that name before – that term before.</span> <span id="s261">Peck was an influence.</span> <span id="s262">A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to – to what do I believe in and where am I going and what’s happening.</span> <span id="s263">And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both individual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period.</span> <span id="s264">Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it.</span> <span id="s265">I spoke about the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from grade school were killed or murdered wa – together with their parents.</span> <span id="s266">I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn’t do anything while some people were brutalized by other people.</span> <span id="s267">I personally cowered when – when a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand told me to do things, and I had to obey him.</span> <span id="s268">Open up my briefcase, show him what I had.</span> <span id="s269">That was, by the way, a briefcase in which I carried music.</span> <span id="s270">I was, at that time trying to study piano a little bit, didn’t last very long, but I was stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and violated.</span> <span id="s271">These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will.</span> <span id="s272">So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private practice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than – than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that’s it.</span> <span id="s273">Although I am not complaining, I was – I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is – totally satisfies me.</span> <span id="s274">Spiritually, I went through a sort of a – I don’t know how to describe it, awakening.</span> <span id="s275">I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be responding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty.</span> <span id="s276">Although by the presets of my church, I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Now, you were Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s279">Catholics are very good on guilt and – and sin and sacrifice.</span> <span id="s280">I’m saying it somewhat sarcastically.</span> <span id="s281">I discovered a teaching, which is called a Course in Miracles, about 10 years ago, and I read the introduction and I said to myself, these are the words that I have always searched for, and these are the words that are saying what I have been craving to hear and to – to learn, to know.</span> <span id="s282">And started studying it, and I reached the point that the teaching was so powerful and so persuasive and so deep, that I started – I felt the need to share it with two closest beings to me, my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s283">At that time my father had died, died a fulfilled man, because he managed to bring his family together, managed to give me and my sister education in spite of the horrible ordeals of World War II.</span> <span id="s284">So I started translating some things into Polish that really moved me, really reached me.</span> <span id="s285">In the course of subsequent years, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You tra – excuse me, you translate –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Into Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: – into Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: – for what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: To share it.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: To share it with?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: With whoever doesn’t know English enough –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: – to – to study it in the Polish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I then discovered that there are other people who seriously want to translate the text of this teaching into Polish.</span> <span id="s298">There were already at that time going on, translations into a number of other languages.</span> <span id="s299">And to make the long story short, through a process of submitting samples of translations and reviewing them and commenting on them, the Foundation for Inner Peace, which is a publisher of the course, chose a young man in Warsaw, young man from my point of view, relatively speaking, the man in his 40’s, and – as a translator and me as an editor of his translation.</span> <span id="s300">We essentially were translating and making sure that the trans – the substance of each sentence, each paragraph and chapter is – is correctly rendered in Polish.</span> <span id="s301">And we just completed the task of translating 1200 pages of a very, very deep metaphysical work.</span> <span id="s302">And Friday I will be in the state of New York in – in a teaching foundation, where we will be talking about the publication of that.</span> <span id="s303">So that was my great, great project of translating, of course, volunteering, and what happened is – and I’m rambling, even though I thought that I would be doing more legal work of some sort after I gra – after I graduate – after I retire from the government, I discovered that practice of law is so bureaucratically impeded by various bar associations and I need to join and I need to l – be licensed that – that I na – just naturally evolved that I am a translator today.</span> <span id="s304">In the meantime, I picked up other pe-people and other projects that I acted as a translator or an interpreter.</span> <span id="s305">There was a period when the American labor movement was deeply interested in the evolution of the independent labor movement in communist Poland, the solidarity movement.</span> <span id="s306">And when the first representatives came to the United States, I was asked by UAW, United Auto Workers to be their translator and escort interpreter and I traveled with them.</span> <span id="s307">And I also attended a number of their constitutional conventions, whenever they have a delegate from Poland, to escort him and translate for him, and also what he says to the convention.</span> <span id="s308">And then, also came volunteer work for the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s309">That had deeper roots.</span> <span id="s310">I sought this work out myself.</span> <span id="s311">I felt –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: You know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t remember any more, but I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Had the museum opened when you sought [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes, oh even when the first efforts at the museum – at the organiza – or-organizing the museum took place, I was, as you can tell from the interview in 1990 – first of all, I donated a number of books and pamphlets and materials to the museum, because when I was handling the American claims for property lost in Poland, when I was working for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and when I was stationed in Warsaw, I managed to reach the people, the survivors who are running the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s317">And I obtained from them a number of unique publications, such as witness accounts of liquidation of ghetto of Sosnowiec or of some other – Bialystok, rather obscure publications, of which there weren’t very many, you know, issues available.</span> <span id="s318">You couldn’t find it in a library.</span> <span id="s319">But I brought all of these things with me.</span> <span id="s320">And when the museum opened, I thought I would donate all of these things to the museum and that’s how my cooperation with the museum started.</span> <span id="s321">I turned over all of those things.</span> <span id="s322">There weren’t very many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pamphlets, but they are today in the library.</span> <span id="s323">And then I think you then come in and you have read my interview in 1990, so you know where I felt that I needed to testify as a witness to what I knew from a unique perspective of being this boy scout troop leader who had a boy in my troop who told me the story about his brother being lost and then militia taking him, communist militia taking him to the house in which the Jewish survivors lived and saying to the little boy, it – is – were you kept here?</span> <span id="s324">And the kid said yes.</span> <span id="s325">That’s – that’s the version that I received from my – from my member of my troop.</span> <span id="s326">So I felt duty bound to give testimony to the truth as I know it.</span> <span id="s327">So that’s how the interview came about.</span> <span id="s328">And then I realized that I can be of help in the oral department.</span> <span id="s329">And I no longer remember – but I know that I submitted my offer to – to translate.</span> <span id="s330">That was lost somewhere and somebody – on somebody’s desk for a year, then I – nothing was done about it.</span> <span id="s331">One day I enquired, aren’t you interested in somebody who knows both languages and can translate?</span> <span id="s332">Yes, yes, submit an application.</span> <span id="s333">Well, okay.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t know what happened to – finally I – I was put in touch with the oral history department and was asked to help them in translating more significant key testimony of witnesses who were testifying in Polish.</span> <span id="s335">And over the last two, three years, I lose track of it because these were long translations, long projects.</span> <span id="s336">I worked on the Mordowicz translation, which is an incredible story of a man who twice escaped from Auschwitz and lived to tell.</span> <span id="s337">And another long and dramatic testimony of a woman who n – was one of the early inmates in Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ozhrenczim(ph) Druzhinikov(ph), and also lived – and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the camp, or after the camp, it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life.</span> <span id="s338">That was a very wrenching job to do.</span> <span id="s339">It was a type of work that I could work on, and then I had to go away from it for days sometimes, sometimes a couple weeks before I could return to it.</span> <span id="s340">It was just too devastating to relive with this person, what she had to say.</span> <span id="s341">I’m delaying giving you the name because I – I have a mental br – block right now, and I cannot remember her name, but of course, Amy Rubin knows because these are la – my two primary claims to fame as a translator, a volunteer translator for the museum.</span> <span id="s342">Why, the most difficult question to answer.</span> <span id="s343">Because you see, more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in Poland, but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something, because then I was not able to do anything.</span> <span id="s344">And secondly, on a deeper level, it is my feeling that in some way I am engaged in some act of expiation or – or contrition on behalf of my countrymen, for things that they did, or failed to do when they could have.</span> <span id="s345">Now, I do not minimize the mutual accusations between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles against each other.</span> <span id="s346">Anti-Semitism certainly was and is alive, unfortunately, which is a curious phenomenon because there are no more Jews in Poland and yet, something in – something has caught both groups in – in – in this vicious circle.</span> <span id="s347">Now there is a controversy about Poles putting up Christian crosses in – in the place in which both Poles and Jews died, and Jewish tradition, of course, requires that nothing be done there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s348">And – and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord.</span> <span id="s349">So I – somehow I – I just feel that whatever I can do to just assist the museum in its mission, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s350">And even though I am now in the process of moving to Michigan and I will be spending most of my time in Michigan, I will be connected by modern technology with Washington, with the museum, and Amy Rubin knows that any time she needs something from me, she can do it just like she did here.</span> <span id="s351">Give me the video of the interview of a witness in Polish, give me a transcript, and I will sit down and I’ll translate it and give it back to her, as long as I’ll – my mind is still working.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And you said you want to help the museum carry out their mission.</span> <span id="s353">What do you see as the mission of the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Well, it’s been asked of me a – a number of times previously, including some video interviews.</span> <span id="s355">This ties in very deeply with my spiritual values.</span> <span id="s356">I think – think that not only the mission of the museum, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated.</span> <span id="s357">But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a – from us, we – we are not going to find our way back to our creator.</span> <span id="s358">And I am a firm believer in that.</span> <span id="s359">And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the museum as – as possibly indirectly contributing.</span> <span id="s360">I am extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and – and – and – and energy with which the museum was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work.</span> <span id="s361">And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the museum is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca – Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be they Armenians or – or just because some county is in Asia, that should not matter less than a mil – million people were killed because they were Asian rather than they were other group, religious or ethnic.</span> <span id="s362">So I guess this is the best I can articulate at this point, why I committed to – to – to work for the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I only have concern that a lot of what I said is not going to be of – really of – of – well, maybe it will be of peripheral value, peripheral value to you to – to – to see what kind of people volunteer.</span> <span id="s365">But I think the – that – that I volunteer for a slightly different reason than let’s say a – a typical, if I may use that word, survivor volunteer works for the museum.</span> <span id="s366">There is a deep, tragic, desperate effort to make sure that the people who died, didn’t die in vain, without any – any lessons to be learned from it.</span> <span id="s367">So I can – I respect my – I – I – I – I am in awe of these people who come and travel a long distance sometimes, to spend a couple hours in the museum, just being escorts, or – or guides.</span> <span id="s368">My commitment is the same and yet somewhat different, because even though all the men in my family died as a result of the war, except my father, who survived the war, but I had uncles.</span> <span id="s369">One, a pilot who died in England, another persecuted and – and killed by the communists, I feel that I have the need to assist in preserving the story of the Holocaust and teaching.</span> <span id="s370">In one of the interviews I said six million or seven million died, and they’re silenced, so somebody has to speak in their place.</span> <span id="s371">Even if I am just translating little pieces of the – of the story, I – I hope that I am making a contribution.</span> <span id="s372">And I’m waiting for them to give me more while my brain is still functioning.</span> <span id="s373">After all, I am 70.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So you’re planning to continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Definitely, if – if they just don’t mind sending the stuff to Michigan, to rural Michigan rather than calling me to come in, or sending it to Arlington.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Anything else, before we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No, I cannot think of anything.</span> <span id="s378">The difficult part of it is that even though that interview in 1990 was a two videocassettes long, I can still not – I still cannot make myself look at it.</span> <span id="s379">Like I probably will not be able to listen to this interview that you’re conducting with me today.</span> <span id="s380">It is helping me in a sense that somehow I unburden myself, that I – that I lessen the weight of memory by talking about it, but I don’t want to review it.</span> <span id="s381">No, I cannot think of anything else that I would like to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Well, thank you very much for your contribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: My pleasure, in a new sense of the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Conclusion of Interview USHMM
