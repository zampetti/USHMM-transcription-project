your name and where and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is David Lieberman.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Poland, Czestachowa, in 1925.</span> <span id="s15">December 31st, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell us about your life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Before the war I lived in a small town.</span> <span id="s18">The town was named Czestachowa.</span> <span id="s19">That's the...uh...there was a big Catholic shrine there called the .</span> <span id="s20">That was the...uh... the pilgrims used to come from all the world and they used to say if you get there and if you're sick, you get well so thousands of people came.</span> <span id="s21">Town was a small town, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Uh...Before the...before the war in.</span> <span id="s23">.</span> <span id="s24">uh...the town had let's see...uh...let me see...uh...(rustling papers)...let's see...it was about 30...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Don't worry about statistics.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s27">About 39,000 people lived...39,000 Jewish people lived there.</span> <span id="s28">It was a poor little town.</span> <span id="s29">And...uh...people managed.</span> <span id="s30">Some of them had trades.</span> <span id="s31">Shoemakers and all kind of things they did.</span> <span id="s32">And they kept busy, and they worked hard for a living and that's how it was you know.</span> <span id="s33">There was a lot of programs, you know.</span> <span id="s34">Accusations that the Jews did that and the Jews did the other.</span> <span id="s35">You know if the weather was bad...let's if the Jewish holiday had the sun shining and the Catholic holiday this was raining, they say that the Jews paid of God.</span> <span id="s36">You know, what're you dealing, you're dealing with people which didn't know.</span> <span id="s37">They were very, what you call, hypocritical.</span> <span id="s38">And that's what you faced with and...uh...we had pograms, you know, burned our temples and...and attacked the Jewish community and we had to call for the National Guard.</span> <span id="s39">Took time til the guards came and stopped the thing.</span> <span id="s40">The temples were burned; every Jewish store was broken up, and that's what it was, so that's what life was before the war.</span> <span id="s41">I attended public school, segregated public school.</span> <span id="s42">Couldn't go to the same school.</span> <span id="s43">Our school was a very shabby school comparing like I would say...you take Rockefeller Center and you take some dump, but we had good education.</span> <span id="s44">We had good teachers.</span> <span id="s45">Principal was a very nice man and we got very good education out of that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">And we attended religious school too, and that's where we spent our time.</span> <span id="s47">And then the war started.</span> <span id="s48">You know, the Nazis came in in 1929...I mean 1939, they came into Poland.</span> <span id="s49">They declared war.</span> <span id="s50">They declared war when they were already in town, you know, Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Linda asked me to...for you to slow down a little bit and tell me a little more about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, my family...we were...we were a family of...9...9...l sister and 9 brothers and a father and mother.</span> <span id="s53">My family, we were very poor.</span> <span id="s54">My father's job was...he was a..</span> <span id="s55">.</span> <span id="s56">he got a job as a collector from a charitable organization.</span> <span id="s57">If you gave charity, he had to go and collect the money.</span> <span id="s58">By the time people pledged and by the time he came to get it, he got very little out of it.</span> <span id="s59">And he didn't make much.</span> <span id="s60">The kids were small.</span> <span id="s61">We were living in poverty, but when we got a little older and the kids got bigger, everybody got jobs.</span> <span id="s62">And we start doing better.</span> <span id="s63">My sister worked in a..</span> <span id="s64">.</span> <span id="s65">in a....tailor place.</span> <span id="s66">My brother worked in a..</span> <span id="s67">.</span> <span id="s68">a hardware store, and they all did...slowly we did, and then we got into a little business.</span> <span id="s69">We were making belts.</span> <span id="s70">And we did it by hand and we managed and then we were making you know for things.</span> <span id="s71">And we managed.</span> <span id="s72">We got along pretty well.</span> <span id="s73">It wasn't too good, but we got along.</span> <span id="s74">We lived in a very poor neighborhood, you know, but then when we were start doing a little better, we moved to a little better neighborhood.</span> <span id="s75">We still didn't have no .</span> <span id="s76">We still had to go and down in the yard a couple of blocks away and in the dark, we used to carry a little candle to see where we're going.</span> <span id="s77">And that's the way...that's the way we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: I need to take the papers from your lap because you're rustling.</span> <span id="s79">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s81">And Linda said not to worry, that you don't need the dates or anything.</span> <span id="s82">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Put them down.</span> <span id="s84">That's right.</span> <span id="s85">Because there' rustling and making noise.</span> <span id="s86">Q: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Uh...and was...was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Not too religious.</span> <span id="s89">My father was sort of religious, but the kids weren't too religious.</span> <span id="s90">Because what was going on town and these pograms and attacks on Jewish, there was no reason to be religious because, you know, a religion is a wonderful thing when you're comfortable and everything goes the way, but if things don't go your way, and you're being murdered for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s91">And they say...and the expression was God would help.</span> <span id="s92">Religious people always said, "Thank God for that.”</span> <span id="s93">But you know how much can you thank God for everything is going along, so my brothers were not religious.</span> <span id="s94">My father was religious.</span> <span id="s95">My mother she tried to keep the religion, but eventually it...it fizzled.</span> <span id="s96">It was no religion.</span> <span id="s97">Very little.</span> <span id="s98">We went to temple because...because to do in respect to the parents, but that's all.</span> <span id="s99">But not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Talk us about how your life changed when...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well when...then everything was fine.</span> <span id="s102">When the war started the...uh...the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s103">They were in 5 o'clock in town.</span> <span id="s104">We lived on the border, German...German border.</span> <span id="s105">They came in 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s106">The armies marched in.</span> <span id="s107">Powerful army.</span> <span id="s108">I mean as a kid I remember I see Polish armies marching.</span> <span id="s109">The most powerful thing I ever saw, and they came with trucks and with machine guns.</span> <span id="s110">Everything mobilized the proper way.</span> <span id="s111">The Polish army was riding on horses and the artillery pieces, two horses were dragging the artillery pieces, preparing for the German army.</span> <span id="s112">They declared war and they were in town the same way.</span> <span id="s113">And when they marched in the town, they put signs on the wall that says you know, destroying is very hard...very easy, and building is very hard.</span> <span id="s114">All people should live together and get along.</span> <span id="s115">Jews, gentiles, and everybody and building a future because your government was corrupted and from now on everything be fine.</span> <span id="s116">So we read that sign, figured well it's not too bad.</span> <span id="s117">How bad can it be.</span> <span id="s118">Okay, a day passed by and the next day we hear...we're sitting in the house, you know, everybody sitting, you know, hiding, not to stick your nose out too far, and we hear shooting and shooting and shooting.</span> <span id="s119">We thought who knows what's going on.</span> <span id="s120">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s121">We thought maybe the Polish armies coming back, which was impossible.</span> <span id="s122">Then they...uh...the police, the German Gestapo and the SS came into the...to the court yard and start screaming we should get out.</span> <span id="s123">Get out!</span> <span id="s124">Get out!</span> <span id="s125">He says and they start saying that someone was shooting at them.</span> <span id="s126">That was their excuse to start the trouble.</span> <span id="s127">And they dragged everybody out.</span> <span id="s128">Uh...the...the people which were...my brothers were at the age of 17, 18, or 19, they were dragged down to an army camp.</span> <span id="s129">Me and my mother and my sister...no, my sister wasn't there.</span> <span id="s130">My sister was in another town.</span> <span id="s131">Me and my mother and an older brother was dragged into a church.</span> <span id="s132">The church was a block away.</span> <span id="s133">We came to the church.</span> <span id="s134">We saw bodies laying all over....by the church there laying bodies because they were shooting constantly at anybody who was going, passing by.</span> <span id="s135">They accused us that we were shooting at them, which I don't believe nobody ever would dare shoot at them.</span> <span id="s136">Came to the yard, the church was stuffed with people.</span> <span id="s137">You know, they just stuffed us in.</span> <span id="s138">It was so hot that we couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s139">Finally, one German had a pity so he took that long stick to open the...the windows, the Gothic windows and busted the window.</span> <span id="s140">A little air came in.</span> <span id="s141">Horses were in the church there.</span> <span id="s142">They pushed in horses.</span> <span id="s143">They were doing all over.</span> <span id="s144">And...and eventually I..</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">I looked at the Germans.</span> <span id="s147">I didn't see much of them.</span> <span id="s148">They had a signed on their buckles, "God with us.”</span> <span id="s149">You know, that means God is with us.</span> <span id="s150">That's...every buckle on the German soldier.</span> <span id="s151">I figured maybe it's true.</span> <span id="s152">That's it.</span> <span id="s153">And we stayed there over night.</span> <span id="s154">And meanwhile the...the Pollacks were building bunkers for the...when the Germans...for the Germans come in so they're building bunkers to protect the...uh...in case tanks march into town, they had some holes.</span> <span id="s155">The tanks would go into the hole and never come out.</span> <span id="s156">But this never materialized.</span> <span id="s157">They filled up all the ditches with dead people.</span> <span id="s158">Just piled them up to the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Some was still alive, you know.</span> <span id="s160">The next day they let us out of the church.</span> <span id="s161">We walked home side.</span> <span id="s162">.</span> <span id="s163">side...on the side of the homes.</span> <span id="s164">We were afraid to walk in the middle.</span> <span id="s165">You get blown away.</span> <span id="s166">Came home and a couple of days later, everybody was sort of released from the army camps.</span> <span id="s167">My brothers came back and...and it got quiet.</span> <span id="s168">And then we knew already what it...what...what's happened.</span> <span id="s169">Because you can't...you knew already that they pulled a fast one, what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s170">Then slowly, we...they used to come around.</span> <span id="s171">They...we formed a..</span> <span id="s172">.</span> <span id="s173">a Jewish community was formed like a work for the...the Nazis if need anything.</span> <span id="s174">One day they came and they say that the Jews should...uh...give all the cameras....you have cameras.</span> <span id="s175">Then if you have any fur, if you have any expensive furniture, so you have to bring it down to the church...in the court yard in the church.</span> <span id="s176">Carried it down yourself, and if they liked it just keep it.</span> <span id="s177">If they didn't like it, they say bring it back.</span> <span id="s178">So and then every week was something else.</span> <span id="s179">And then they start...they see the...uh...they wanted to squash down all these things in case there be a riot or something against the Germans, so they decided to take all the intelligent people and try to put them in...in certain prisons, they put them in.</span> <span id="s180">And the time when this was going on...for a year, they building...they had built a concentration camp already.</span> <span id="s181">Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s182">they called it.</span> <span id="s183">Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s184">That camp was built for...for people like undesirables they called, and for intelligent people.</span> <span id="s185">Polish engineers, professors, all these people they...they picked up and shipped them there.</span> <span id="s186">And they shipped them, and a week later the wife or the children got a package in the mail and they opened the packages, there was these clothes over there and they say he died of an incurable disease.</span> <span id="s187">This was going on for almost a year.</span> <span id="s188">And they were sending out everybody.</span> <span id="s189">Anybody who was sort of intelligent, teachers, principals, anything which had something to organize.</span> <span id="s190">They were afraid if someone would organize, and if they had only a bunch of people, common people, no one would organize.</span> <span id="s191">This was going on and they were given notice to the community, any Jew has gold he should report the gold and we did that and we did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s192">Finally, we were start working in...in slave labor.</span> <span id="s193">They used to take us out every night.</span> <span id="s194">There was snow and they dragged us out and put us to the tracks in the middle of the night to clean...clean the snow from the tracks.</span> <span id="s195">And then they...we had a little Jewish hospital where we used to go there.</span> <span id="s196">So they used to take...some pick up...some most beautiful ladies, they picked them up, brought them to the hospital there, raped them and undressed them and made fools out of them, and then they released them.</span> <span id="s197">That was fine.</span> <span id="s198">That was no...not as bad then.</span> <span id="s199">And like I said, they're shipping out people this one the other one.</span> <span id="s200">And finally came a time they say we're going to form a Jewish community, a Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s201">They want the Jews to be separate from everything.</span> <span id="s202">They formed a big Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s203">The ghetto had around 39,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">People...they're weren't so many Jews living in town, but when the...uh...the ghetto was formed, people from other town which suffered more figured they'd come here because this maybe be a little better place to live, so people from all over, from the outskirting communities, little villages, all came into the town.</span> <span id="s205">And it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s206">And that was going on for a short time.</span> <span id="s207">And then the war...and then the war started between Russia and the Russian-Germany.</span> <span id="s208">The pact was broken.</span> <span id="s209">And that was fine.</span> <span id="s210">Everything was not bad.</span> <span id="s211">I mean it was bad, but not bad.</span> <span id="s212">But when the Germans start losing the war, when the Russians put up a fight and the Germans seen it's not working well, then they start taking care all these...they start going after the Jews.</span> <span id="s213">They decided to...uh...start sending people out.</span> <span id="s214">They claim they're sending them to labor camps.</span> <span id="s215">Okay.</span> <span id="s216">So they...uh...took the...took the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">They locked the ghetto in.</span> <span id="s218">You couldn't get in, get out.</span> <span id="s219">All the streets were locked with the Gestapo SS.</span> <span id="s220">And when they locked these things then the...they had a chief of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s221">His name was Degenhauf.</span> <span id="s222">He came with his cronies and stood in...at a certain block.</span> <span id="s223">He picked a certain block.</span> <span id="s224">Everybody got out of this block and he was passing by.</span> <span id="s225">And everybody was passing by in front of him, and he decided which way to go.</span> <span id="s226">Left and right.</span> <span id="s227">I didn't know which way was good.</span> <span id="s228">Left or right.</span> <span id="s229">Now I don't remember.</span> <span id="s230">Then I knew what was good.</span> <span id="s231">So he picked out...let's say he picked out from a block of 10,000 people, he picked out 500, 600 and send them in to a..</span> <span id="s232">.</span> <span id="s233">to a steel mill.</span> <span id="s234">It was like a..</span> <span id="s235">.</span> <span id="s236">a camp...made a camp out of it.</span> <span id="s237">People should stay there...send us in there.</span> <span id="s238">And this was going on, I think, for a week.</span> <span id="s239">Every block, every little district.</span> <span id="s240">Then it came to us, finally came to our section, because we looked out the windows we see what's going on.</span> <span id="s241">They were shooting and killing.</span> <span id="s242">Anybody who walked the wrong way was shot.</span> <span id="s243">So when it came to us, we lived in a certain section, so we decided we go up to the attic and break through the wall.</span> <span id="s244">Maybe we'll go to the next block, so we'll be able to survive another week.</span> <span id="s245">Maybe they'll change their mind and they would ship us out anymore.</span> <span id="s246">So we went to the...uh... about two houses away and we stood there.</span> <span id="s247">We laid in the...the yards.</span> <span id="s248">Finally, they took us too.</span> <span id="s249">They had enough cattle trains and box cars, so they decided they make a selection and clean out the rest of the block.</span> <span id="s250">When they cleaned...so we were standing in that yard, my brothers were still there.</span> <span id="s251">Not everybody, the older brother with his child was shipped out a day before because he lived in another section.</span> <span id="s252">And when they came to our block and came into the yard, they start looking around, they see too many people because people came from other buildings so they figured they'd scare and they start shooting.</span> <span id="s253">They saw my brother, so they shot him.</span> <span id="s254">They chased him and shot him by a garbage can.</span> <span id="s255">And...uh...and then they made a selection and when to...and I was picked to remain in the...in these camps...these what you call...they were big industry building.</span> <span id="s256">And they figured they'd stuff us in there meanwhile.</span> <span id="s257">So I was stuffed in in that building with my other brothers and we stood there for a day or two.</span> <span id="s258">Then they decided they still have too many people.</span> <span id="s259">They had a little idea.</span> <span id="s260">They had another metal plant there called Metalubia.</span> <span id="s261">That was a..</span> <span id="s262">.</span> <span id="s263">a metal plant.</span> <span id="s264">They decided...they must have had 10,000 Jews or more, so they decide they open the gates and the same guy stood with his cronies and start picking.</span> <span id="s265">And when I marched through he decided to ship me the wrong way, so I didn't...I had no...I had no idea what's going to be, but I followed.</span> <span id="s266">If I don't follow, I get blown away, so I walked a couple of feet, maybe 50 feet and I lined up with the...with the people.</span> <span id="s267">I seen the element which was picked out.</span> <span id="s268">So I knew I'm...I'm...I'm in bad shape.</span> <span id="s269">I'm going with the wrong people.</span> <span id="s270">Picked out some old people, some people couldn't walk; some people walked with a crutch.</span> <span id="s271">You know, they wanted pure...what you call, a guy who is working, a guy who wore glasses wasn't a candidate to remain either.</span> <span id="s272">You had to be...look like almost everybody looked.</span> <span id="s273">You couldn't look any different.</span> <span id="s274">Okay, so I was picked.</span> <span id="s275">And then the Gestapo was marching us down to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s276">There were a freight railroad station, not the main railroad station.</span> <span id="s277">We're marching down; everybody carried their pieces of luggage they had, and they...some of them couldn't carry so the...the SS were whipping them on the way when they carry, so they dropped the luggage and some other people which lived picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Some Polish people jumped out and picked up the luggage.</span> <span id="s279">They figured get ahold okay.</span> <span id="s280">When we came down to the...a..</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">to the railroad, they were stuffing people into the box cars, you know.</span> <span id="s283">And I seen I be next so I moved back a little.</span> <span id="s284">I figured if I move back maybe I'll still have a chance to remain, or if they haven't got no more box cars, maybe they ship me back to the...to this...uh...what you call Metalulia, that steel mill.</span> <span id="s285">Unfortunate, I waited too long.</span> <span id="s286">They brought a hospital with the incurables, and put every body in the train.</span> <span id="s287">And me put in there too.</span> <span id="s288">Most of them what they brought down were almost half dead.</span> <span id="s289">They had...they had typhus and all kind of diseases you could think.</span> <span id="s290">They stuffed me in there.</span> <span id="s291">I couldn't breath because they had these medications on them.</span> <span id="s292">I was a short fellow.</span> <span id="s293">I wasn't tall then.</span> <span id="s294">And I couldn't reach the window.</span> <span id="s295">You know, eventually I got stuck by a window.</span> <span id="s296">The window was covered with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s297">You couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s298">So first day I couldn't reach.</span> <span id="s299">The second day I reached already, because there were so many dead bodies laying, so I stepped on one or two and I reached the window and looked out.</span> <span id="s300">Looked out, I see the train keeps puffing; locomotives keeps going and puffing and puffing, you know.</span> <span id="s301">Some people say well, maybe we're going to a..</span> <span id="s302">.</span> <span id="s303">to a labor camp, maybe we're going here.</span> <span id="s304">You know, you always have hope.</span> <span id="s305">You can't say for sure...you know, a person lays in the hospital and he says you...he has no chance.</span> <span id="s306">Eventually some of them come out of too.</span> <span id="s307">And we puffed...I think the train was going for 2 days or 3 days.</span> <span id="s308">I would say most of them died in the train.</span> <span id="s309">They couldn't survived.</span> <span id="s310">And...and when the train arrived in the morning 3 days later, we were going up north.</span> <span id="s311">We going towards...towards ...uh...Warsaw.</span> <span id="s312">I don't know if I ever came into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s313">Maybe we went.</span> <span id="s314">Our destination was Malking.</span> <span id="s315">Was a junction up north near...pass Warsaw.</span> <span id="s316">We got there and...uh...we were all, like I said, there was nothing...just laying with dead bodies and the stench was unbearable.</span> <span id="s317">When we got to Malking...uh...I..</span> <span id="s318">.</span> <span id="s319">I looked out the window.</span> <span id="s320">I see the sun shining; beautiful weather; trees growing, but nothing for us.</span> <span id="s321">(crying) Took a half hour.</span> <span id="s322">They disconnected the train, what they did.</span> <span id="s323">Had a..</span> <span id="s324">.</span> <span id="s325">Malking was a junction.</span> <span id="s326">Treblinka was going back south.</span> <span id="s327">I was coming from south, but was south...southeast.</span> <span id="s328">The trains couldn't come in to...to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s329">Treblinka had a..</span> <span id="s330">.</span> <span id="s331">a platform for four, five...four, five...uh...uh...trains.</span> <span id="s332">So they disconnected and start pushing back.</span> <span id="s333">I looked out the window, and I..</span> <span id="s334">.</span> <span id="s335">I didn't know where I was going.</span> <span id="s336">Finally, they pushed, pushed very slow the train.</span> <span id="s337">The train was moving slow, and they pushed me into...to this concentration camp, was a death camp...pushed me in and I looked out.</span> <span id="s338">I seen Gestapo guards, dogs and guys with whips and waiting and they opened the door and start whipping and hitting people over the head and...and the dead bodies remained.</span> <span id="s339">And...uh...what happened so...I was out too, and pushed me into a little... like a little court yard.</span> <span id="s340">The court yard was a place where everybody got us and they told us to get undressed, you know.</span> <span id="s341">Man, ladies, everybody.</span> <span id="s342">Had some neighbors, very distinguished people.</span> <span id="s343">Her father owned a drug store.</span> <span id="s344">I remember she stood with a kid there and she walked over to the SS, and wanted to ask him, so he whipped her so hard with that whip and then he dropped her on the floor.</span> <span id="s345">I don't what happened there.</span> <span id="s346">What happened there, she died...she died any how.</span> <span id="s347">So what happened?</span> <span id="s348">Then they start picking.</span> <span id="s349">What happened in this camp in Treblinka, there were at least 900 or a thousand prisoners which were...didn't have more than that.</span> <span id="s350">So they needed...because they were killing people like flies so the...the quota was low, so one of the Gestapo decided to pick couple of people.</span> <span id="s351">I think he picked maybe 10 or 12.</span> <span id="s352">And I was half undressed.</span> <span id="s353">So I see he's picking so I jumped into the line.</span> <span id="s354">And then we marched away.</span> <span id="s355">We marched out to the main...main lot where people were dropping clothes.</span> <span id="s356">I dropped...I walked out there and he checked me and looked over and looked in.</span> <span id="s357">I'm fortunate.</span> <span id="s358">I don't why he didn't kill me immediately because I was half undressed.</span> <span id="s359">And then what happened...uh...decided there was coffee break or lunch so everybody marched towards the kitchen because it was around maybe 12:00, l:00.</span> <span id="s360">So, I marched towards the kitchen, got ahold of a couple rag shirts laying all over, shoes, and...uh...I was safe then.</span> <span id="s361">And the rest of them were send into that yard.</span> <span id="s362">From that yard, they got undressed and marched into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s363">You heard screaming fill the skies.</span> <span id="s364">You see mothers with little children on...on the arms walking, you know, screaming and using these...uh... religious like some people are gentile got...when he get's hit, he says, "Jesus Christ.”</span> <span id="s365">And a Jew gets hit he says .</span></p> <p><span id="s366">So that's what happened.</span> <span id="s367">They were marching in and when they marched in, they closed the door and the gate and you heard screaming like people choking to death and a couple of minutes quiet down and that was going on every day I was there.</span> <span id="s368">That's all.</span> <span id="s369">Was going on, and my job was the next...uh...in the afternoon, my job was on the...on the main lot to separate clothes.</span> <span id="s370">Uh...Let's say shoes to shoes, wool to wool.</span> <span id="s371">And after that, a day later, they decided the people which are coming into the camp, they should sep..</span> <span id="s372">.</span> <span id="s373">they should get their clothes...the shoes separate and the clothes separate.</span> <span id="s374">When they came out to the lot they dropped every piece of clothes on a different...different pile.</span> <span id="s375">The piles were high.</span> <span id="s376">I would say 3, 4 stories high on top.</span> <span id="s377">There were shoes.</span> <span id="s378">Millions, thousands of shoes, thousands of clothes, thousands of...uh...luggages and...and there were big metal boxes standing there and everybody had to throw in if he had some jewelry.</span> <span id="s379">Now everybody, you know, in the old country, you know, like in this country, people have property.</span> <span id="s380">Some cherish certain things.</span> <span id="s381">In the old country, if you had a little old ring or a gold watch that was...you...you were cherishing.</span> <span id="s382">So eventually these boxes used to fill up very fast.</span> <span id="s383">That's all.</span> <span id="s384">And they walked in there and they died.</span> <span id="s385">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s386">This was going on every day.</span> <span id="s387">Every day.</span> <span id="s388">And so...and I really didn't know where I was.</span> <span id="s389">I thought, as I was taught in school, that if you go to Heaven or Hell.</span> <span id="s390">So I thought that maybe I did something wrong as a young kid.</span> <span id="s391">You know, you believe in religion because, you know, if a rabbi or anybody else tells you that you...you have to believe in God, so I thought I went to Hell, because I couldn't believe what I see.</span> <span id="s392">Thousands of people were coming every day.</span> <span id="s393">And a hour later, puff.</span> <span id="s394">Fired.</span> <span id="s395">People were coming from Luxembourg, from Belgium, from Holland, from Germany.</span> <span id="s396">The Polish Jews were coming in cattle trains.</span> <span id="s397">The Jews from the...from the West, these...these people didn't know much where they're going because they lived in better environment.</span> <span id="s398">They were more intelligent.</span> <span id="s399">They didn't believe that...uh... something like this could happen to them.</span> <span id="s400">So they came with...some of them came with the maids taking care, and they all just marched in.</span> <span id="s401">They gave them...some of them gave a piece of soap, make believe they take a shower and marched in, and that's...that's what it was.</span> <span id="s402">And we lived in the...there were three barracks over there.</span> <span id="s403">Was barrack 1, 2 and 3.</span> <span id="s404">There were two original.</span> <span id="s405">One with...at night when we marched into the barracks, we were marched in, and the barracks was unbearable because people were making on their blankets, but you couldn't walk out.</span> <span id="s406">There was no such a thing as a..</span> <span id="s407">.</span> <span id="s408">a toilet or anything, so people were making on top of it because if you stuck your head out, you got blown away.</span> <span id="s409">And...uh...so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s410">And at night some people committed suicide.</span> <span id="s411">They couldn't take it, you know, because they knew that...uh...they survived and their children and their wives are dead.</span> <span id="s412">And...and that's all what was going in these...in these barracks.</span> <span id="s413">Every morning we marched out.</span> <span id="s414">But what happened at...going back to the...to where the...uh...when people came were from the trains, they...uh...some people got lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Some children got lost or some crippled people came which couldn't march into the...to that gas chamber, so they picked them up on a little...like a little stretcher, you know, piece of wood, and they brought them in...they called it a hospital, Lazarette.</span> <span id="s416">Had a sign Lazarette.</span> <span id="s417">What was this Lazarette, was a..</span> <span id="s418">.</span> <span id="s419">a ditch, the ground and two or three people stood there and...and the SS took the guy over or anybody else and he brought him in, he shot him, and then they burned him.</span> <span id="s420">They put some chemicals on, they burned him.</span> <span id="s421">And that was...the smell was horrocious, impossible.</span> <span id="s422">Sometimes, some children got lost.</span> <span id="s423">Little kids, 2 years old, l year old, they got lost.</span> <span id="s424">So brought them in there and burned them to death because they were...were too much of a deed to bring them there because by the time you bring him there, they're not going to waste any time.</span> <span id="s425">So that's what it was, so I was there for...for 11 days, struggling every day, seeing killing and hanging.</span> <span id="s426">And they were whipping people.</span> <span id="s427">If they got ahold of somebody he...I don't know, he did something wrong and maybe he didn't.</span> <span id="s428">They got ahold of him.</span> <span id="s429">They whipped him.</span> <span id="s430">When they whipped him, you couldn't recognize the color of his skin.</span> <span id="s431">And then they hanged him by his legs.</span> <span id="s432">Was hanging for 40 minutes, and he was dead.</span> <span id="s433">This was going on every day.</span> <span id="s434">Then they had...uh...prepared another barrack, barrack 3, by the kitchen.</span> <span id="s435">And then there were rumors when this barrack was ready, they shipped me into this barrack.</span> <span id="s436">Barrack was a little better, what do you call, cleaner for the first...uh...couple of days.</span> <span id="s437">But there were rumors that this barrack is going to be liquidated because these are people...so I figured the only way to do is to plan an escape.</span> <span id="s438">So I..</span> <span id="s439">.</span> <span id="s440">I planned with another friend.</span> <span id="s441">Then I got ahold of another friend, people which I went to school with.</span> <span id="s442">But...uh...there were other peoples which wanted to escape too.</span> <span id="s443">Kids which I knew from...I lived with them on the block, but some of them were sort of...I couldn't trust.</span> <span id="s444">What do you mean by trust?</span> <span id="s445">They weren't...they weren't enough...uh...reliable.</span> <span id="s446">You know, they are kids sometimes 10, 12 years which are very reliable people, and some kids are kids.</span> <span id="s447">So I left him back.</span> <span id="s448">I..</span> <span id="s449">.</span> <span id="s450">before I escaped he had a brother working with him.</span> <span id="s451">His brother got shot.</span> <span id="s452">He was a good looking guy.</span> <span id="s453">He looked too good, so maybe they shot him.</span> <span id="s454">So he was left alone, and he was crying to me.</span> <span id="s455">He had trouble with his toes.</span> <span id="s456">He had ingrown toe nails, the kid, my neighbor.</span> <span id="s457">So he was telling me, if you plan anything, take me with you.</span> <span id="s458">So I figured dead or alive, it's no time to play games here.</span> <span id="s459">So I got...I got these two other fellows and we planned to escape.</span> <span id="s460">We says we're going to escape at night because when we by the kitchen and drinking coffee, you know, and we start walking a little away.</span> <span id="s461">If any...worse comes to worse, they get ahold of us while we're walking too far, we can get a beating.</span> <span id="s462">That's all.</span> <span id="s463">Because they wouldn't bother opening the factory for...for killing.</span> <span id="s464">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first.”</span> <span id="s465">And before we escaped, I compared myself.</span> <span id="s466">I knew if survive it was good to have sugar, and there was plenty food laying which people brought.</span> <span id="s467">They thought they're going to a picnic.</span> <span id="s468">So I..</span> <span id="s469">.</span> <span id="s470">I got ahold of a bag...uh...a bag of sugar with a rope and I put it on my neck, so in case I starve sugar would keep me going.</span> <span id="s471">And the other fellows had other stuff.</span> <span id="s472">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first.</span> <span id="s473">You go first.</span> <span id="s474">Time is late.</span> <span id="s475">You go first.”</span> <span id="s476">So I figured, "Okay, I go first.”</span> <span id="s477">I went first and I ran into the...uh.</span> <span id="s478">.</span> <span id="s479">behind a..</span> <span id="s480">.</span> <span id="s481">a little...small little pool where they were having chickens there.</span> <span id="s482">Chickens and goose were swimming.</span> <span id="s483">I was working there too.</span> <span id="s484">So I ran in and I'm waiting.</span> <span id="s485">Finally, another fellow comes.</span> <span id="s486">My friend comes.</span> <span id="s487">He ran so fast I ripped his sleeve off on his jacket.</span> <span id="s488">I never seen him.</span> <span id="s489">When the third one came he ran so fast, but him...I eventually got a hold of.</span> <span id="s490">And we were both stuck in the woods.</span> <span id="s491">We knew that the...the...uh...the...uh...towers where they were watching, they're going off 9 o'clock, because if they're pushing you into the barracks and they stay on top with the machine guns, one barrack facing the other, if anybody walks out, so what's the use to...to watch the towers.</span> <span id="s492">So we waited.</span> <span id="s493">And had...had a plier in my pocket to cut the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">And we waited.</span> <span id="s495">Was 9 already, later.</span> <span id="s496">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s497">So we moved towards the wires.</span> <span id="s498">I moved towards the wires.</span> <span id="s499">And the guy on...on the tower was sitting up there.</span> <span id="s500">I don't know if he saw me, if he didn't see me.</span> <span id="s501">I can't explain.</span> <span id="s502">His machine gun was just moving back and forth.</span> <span id="s503">We cut the wires.</span> <span id="s504">We went through the wire.</span> <span id="s505">He went through.</span> <span id="s506">Before we cut the wire, we were walking like the army on our hands and feet because you couldn't stand up or cut the wire.</span> <span id="s507">Went through the wire.</span> <span id="s508">And we ran out, and then we start running and running and running.</span> <span id="s509">We didn't know where to run.</span> <span id="s510">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s511">So we ran almost a whole night.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">And we said, "If we're going to run, if we want to rest we should at least rest in the woods.”</span> <span id="s513">Unfortunately, we ran so long that we landed up in land, just big field.</span> <span id="s514">So we landed and we couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s515">So we sit down.</span> <span id="s516">And heavy storm came and soaked us through for hours.</span> <span id="s517">And we were sitting both holding on to each other.</span> <span id="s518">And in the morning around 5 o'clock, we started looking around.</span> <span id="s519">We seen a little house.</span> <span id="s520">A lady walks out from the house and she's trying to open her shutters.</span> <span id="s521">So I figured I'll walk over to her.</span> <span id="s522">So when I walked over, she knew already who I am because they knew.</span> <span id="s523">She says, "You must have been one from the escapees from here.</span> <span id="s524">You better walk away because the SS is coming through here, hundreds of cars going to the farmers to pick up milk and eggs for the...for their food.”</span> <span id="s525">So we was standing in...the woods and waited.</span> <span id="s526">She says, "You better leave.”</span> <span id="s527">She says, "Go a little further down.”</span> <span id="s528">So went a little further down, and then we met somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Somebody got a hold of us and he says to us, "You know, I could save your life and I could do this for you and other things for you if you have any money.”</span> <span id="s530">I had some money.</span> <span id="s531">I had some Polish money.</span> <span id="s532">So we gave him...he says he's going to go to get us some bread and he could do a lot for us.</span> <span id="s533">So we gave him some money.</span> <span id="s534">He left.</span> <span id="s535">When he left, we left because we knew what happened because the Gestapo's gave orders, 'if you bring a Jew, you get a pound of sugar.'</span> <span id="s536">And if he has good shoes, you could take his shoes too.'</span> <span id="s537">That was the price the Germans gave to the Polish people, but he didn't get a hold of me.</span> <span id="s538">He took off, and we...we marched.</span> <span id="s539">We marched another couple of miles.</span> <span id="s540">I got a hold of a..</span> <span id="s541">.</span> <span id="s542">walked into a farmer's house and the woman was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s543">She came out and walked with me and my friend almost for an hour, showed us to go to another road.</span> <span id="s544">Closed road where the police is not there.</span> <span id="s545">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s546">She came with a little baby on her back and walked and then she left us and she...she made a prayer, you know.</span> <span id="s547">You know, she took her cross out and made a prayer, God should be with you.</span> <span id="s548">And we went our way.</span> <span id="s549">Then we walked another, I think, a mile or two, walked into another farm house.</span> <span id="s550">We told the farmer we want to go to...to a railroad station.</span> <span id="s551">He says he's going to take us, but he's not going to walk with us...distance away.</span> <span id="s552">And he opened a barn.</span> <span id="s553">He says, "In case the SS comes, you just walked in yourself.</span> <span id="s554">I had nothing to do.”</span> <span id="s555">So he...uh...he walked with us.</span> <span id="s556">This man walked so fast that you had no idea, so fast.</span> <span id="s557">And we followed him.</span> <span id="s558">Finally, we came to a small little village.</span> <span id="s559">The village name was Soldavna.</span> <span id="s560">Little village.</span> <span id="s561">And he says, "Okay, you're on your own.”</span> <span id="s562">I says, "No, we're not going to give you the money til you buy us tickets.”</span> <span id="s563">He got made and bought us tickets.</span> <span id="s564">Went into the...went into the train, and we sat there.</span> <span id="s565">Train was crowded.</span> <span id="s566">People were going from the village to buy some food.</span> <span id="s567">And I been in that train for...overnight.</span> <span id="s568">In the morning, someone recognized me.</span> <span id="s569">He must have been some...he says, "There's a Jew in the subway.</span> <span id="s570">There's a Jew in the train.”</span> <span id="s571">And he caused a riot.</span> <span id="s572">And he says, "I'm going to get you and I'm going to get to the Germans.</span> <span id="s573">I can get a pound of sugar ad I can get your shoes.”</span> <span id="s574">So what happened, most of the trains when they come into town, they...they...they turn into town and they have to slow down because there...there's like a curve and they slow down.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">When the train slowed down, I jumped out of the train with my friend because I didn't get to the main railroad station.</span> <span id="s576">I figured if I get to the main railroad station, I'd be a dead duck because there's police and Gestapo and all this.</span> <span id="s577">I got up and the other guy jumped off the train and then we walked up the hill.</span> <span id="s578">Got a hold of somebody else and he said he's going to take us home.</span> <span id="s579">His father's a shoemaker and he's going to keep us, and we told him we want to go further.</span> <span id="s580">We want to go from the...from Warsaw because when we jumped off the train was outskirts of Warsaw...says we want to go to....uh...to Czestachowa.</span> <span id="s581">He says, "Well, you could sleep over my house and tomorrow I'll take you down to the train.”</span> <span id="s582">Came into his house, me and my friend.</span> <span id="s583">We laid down on the floor.</span> <span id="s584">We slept for 2 days.</span> <span id="s585">Then we got up, everything was empty.</span> <span id="s586">Anything we had in our pockets, he took out.</span> <span id="s587">He left us not even with a cent.</span> <span id="s588">And if you haven't got money where can you go?</span> <span id="s589">So we told him, "Look, if you give us some money back, keep some of it.</span> <span id="s590">If not, we'll blow the whole thing.</span> <span id="s591">We're not afraid.”</span> <span id="s592">We're not afraid to die because we knew we're going to die anyhow.</span> <span id="s593">So he decided to give us some.</span> <span id="s594">And then at night he took us down to the train and we went towards Czectachowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Same thing in the train.</span> <span id="s596">Much didn't happen because we're quiet.</span> <span id="s597">Train was crowded.</span> <span id="s598">When we reached Czestachowa, the destination...I knew the town well.</span> <span id="s599">I lived there.</span> <span id="s600">The train slowed down on a curve into the railroad station.</span> <span id="s601">We jumped out, and we walked.</span> <span id="s602">We got ahold of another...somehow, she walks in.</span> <span id="s603">She says, "Well, if you want, you could stay here.</span> <span id="s604">But I put you in in the barn.</span> <span id="s605">If someone gets a hold of you, I have no part of it.”</span> <span id="s606">She let us sleep over.</span> <span id="s607">The next day she chased us out.</span> <span id="s608">So my friend says that, "Look.</span> <span id="s609">I have friends here.</span> <span id="s610">Gentile friends which my father used to do business with, so maybe they could hide me out and until the war is over.”</span> <span id="s611">So I says, "I have some too.”</span> <span id="s612">So I..</span> <span id="s613">.</span> <span id="s614">he went with me.</span> <span id="s615">I walked over there and there was a store, a bicycle store.</span> <span id="s616">I walked in and his wife saw me.</span> <span id="s617">His wife knew me, and he knew me.</span> <span id="s618">There were customers in there.</span> <span id="s619">And he was winking with his eyes I shouldn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s620">And meanwhile he...my friend...was outside in the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">You know...uh... a country bathroom.</span> <span id="s622">I have to tell you, a board in a hole, and he was sitting in there because he couldn't stay outside.</span> <span id="s623">He says, "I'll wait for you.”</span> <span id="s624">Spoke to my old friend and he's telling me, he says, "Look, I can do anything for you in money, but I can't help you hiding.</span> <span id="s625">I wouldn't because I could lose my life.”</span> <span id="s626">I says, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s627">So I walked out.</span> <span id="s628">I walked toward the...uh...toilet.</span> <span id="s629">He wasn't there.</span> <span id="s630">He took off.</span> <span id="s631">He decided maybe he do better on his own than with me.</span> <span id="s632">So I was left all alone, you know.</span> <span id="s633">I knew the town.</span> <span id="s634">I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s635">I marched the town, marched up, sideways, all over.</span> <span id="s636">How much can you walk?</span> <span id="s637">You know, you're in danger because, you know, you get picked up, you're dead.</span> <span id="s638">So I decided maybe I should...I knew I had a brother working in a..</span> <span id="s639">.</span> <span id="s640">in a..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">in a..</span> <span id="s643">.</span> <span id="s644">in a steel mill.</span> <span id="s645">He was...he was living there because when the war...when they made a selection, they decided that...uh...they wanted good people.</span> <span id="s646">They figured if they send him into the ghetto, they'd never see him, so he remained there.</span> <span id="s647">And they slept there.</span> <span id="s648">They had a couple of barracks they slept in.</span> <span id="s649">So I decided, 'let me go down there.'</span> <span id="s650">I went down there and stood outside.</span> <span id="s651">I seen a horse with a wagon turned over right near the plant.</span> <span id="s652">So I walked over to the guy.</span> <span id="s653">I asked him if he knows if any Jews live here.</span> <span id="s654">He says, "Yal, there's some over there working.”</span> <span id="s655">I says, "Can you call out a guy by that name, "Martin .”</span> <span id="s656">He says, "I go in.”</span> <span id="s657">He went in.</span> <span id="s658">Took a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s659">He walked out.</span> <span id="s660">He saw me.</span> <span id="s661">He didn't know what hit him.</span> <span id="s662">Where did I come from?</span> <span id="s663">What come?</span> <span id="s664">What happened?</span> <span id="s665">Where's this one?</span> <span id="s666">Where's the other one?</span> <span id="s667">And, you know, he took me into the barracks and I explained it to him exact what happened.</span> <span id="s668">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s669">He didn't believe.</span> <span id="s670">And then what they did, they put me up in the barracks in the corner.</span> <span id="s671">They were hiding me.</span> <span id="s672">What to do with me?</span> <span id="s673">Because they didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s674">My brother figured he could remain there, but you couldn't report to the police that somebody else came in.</span> <span id="s675">Okay, it came at night...people came back from the shift and it's like...uh...they start asking.</span> <span id="s676">You know, it's somebody came in.</span> <span id="s677">After all they were for...for...a couple of weeks along, they didn't know what happened to their wife and children, so they started asking where I come from.</span> <span id="s678">What it is?</span> <span id="s679">So I didn't want to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Finally, they forced me to say where I come from so I told them exact what happened to their wives and children.</span> <span id="s681">That they're all gassed and died.</span> <span id="s682">So then they wanted to kill me because I'm lying.</span> <span id="s683">So then they asked my brother if I ever been in a..</span> <span id="s684">.</span> <span id="s685">a emotional sick.</span> <span id="s686">They got so furious about it that they squealed on the...squealed the police and if I don't leave, they're gonna report to the police.</span> <span id="s687">Middle of the night, it was 12 o'clock at night or l:00, I was kicked out and finally the police was notified.</span> <span id="s688">And they came out, start shooting, but I was sitting in.</span> <span id="s689">.</span> <span id="s690">in the...what you call, in the weeds...the high weeds.</span> <span id="s691">The dried up weeds.</span> <span id="s692">I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s693">Didn't care.</span> <span id="s694">Let them shoot.</span> <span id="s695">My life wasn't worth anything.</span> <span id="s696">It was just like you take a wastebasket, throw it out.</span> <span id="s697">I was waiting to...to die any time.</span> <span id="s698">What's the use.</span> <span id="s699">I mean it's like you want to dispose of your body.</span> <span id="s700">It was too much for you.</span> <span id="s701">I sat there and then it quiet down and they started screaming, "Hurray.</span> <span id="s702">Hurray.</span> <span id="s703">We got him.</span> <span id="s704">We got him.</span> <span id="s705">We got him.”</span> <span id="s706">I sat there and then I walked away and knocked at another house.</span> <span id="s707">The guy was making...uh...funeral boxes on the road there.</span> <span id="s708">I walked in and he says he can't do nothing for me.</span> <span id="s709">The only thing I do is get into the shop, stay there, leave the door open.</span> <span id="s710">If you're in there, you sneaked in yourself.</span> <span id="s711">I stood there in the morning.</span> <span id="s712">I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s713">I decided to go into the camp.</span> <span id="s714">To the same factory.</span> <span id="s715">Came in again.</span> <span id="s716">What're you doing?</span> <span id="s717">So my brother decided we're both go together to see where we could go.</span> <span id="s718">If we work out, we'll work out.</span> <span id="s719">If not, we'll both...if we die, we'll both die.</span> <span id="s720">So we took a walk in...along side the river...was a river there.</span> <span id="s721">Took a long side.</span> <span id="s722">We walked a couple of miles.</span> <span id="s723">Saw a little house, little farmer's house.</span> <span id="s724">The house must have been maybe 20 by 20.</span> <span id="s725">I walked in and the wife wasn't home.</span> <span id="s726">He was home.</span> <span id="s727">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s728">Up and down.</span> <span id="s729">I looked like...ever see a little...a little dog is lost and he knocks at somebody's door.</span> <span id="s730">He felt sorry for me and he says he can't do nothing til his wife come home.</span> <span id="s731">And meanwhile go into the barn.</span> <span id="s732">The same thing.</span> <span id="s733">Stay in the barn.</span> <span id="s734">Okay.</span> <span id="s735">My brother had to run back to the plant.</span> <span id="s736">If they see he's not there, if they get ahold of him or they find him out of the plant he gets shot.</span> <span id="s737">So he was...he left and then his wife came home and she fell in love with me and she says, "Yal, we're gonna keep him.”</span> <span id="s738">And I was there...the first day I was very useful.</span> <span id="s739">I used to clean the cows, clean the barn, wash clothes for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">And that's what I did for almost a whole month.</span> <span id="s741">And they got so used to me that they didn't want me to leave.</span> <span id="s742">Mine clothes I used to wash.</span> <span id="s743">I used to get insects in my clothes.</span> <span id="s744">They had a small place.</span> <span id="s745">So I used to take my clothes and put it to the river and put a rock over it, so the...the water was floating down the river, took all the insects out.</span> <span id="s746">And I lived there for a month, you know, every night, you know, they were used to me.</span> <span id="s747">and taking care of all the things.</span> <span id="s748">And then my brother came once and he says, "They're forming another little ghetto.”</span> <span id="s749">Because from the 39,000 everybody was liquidated, and there wasn't much left.</span> <span id="s750">And they didn't want the Jews to live in the plant because they were shabby barracks.</span> <span id="s751">Decided to take the old Jewish quarter and close in the blocks, you know.</span> <span id="s752">The blocks must have been what?</span> <span id="s753">...500 or thousand feet a block, close in the sides, so they closed up three blocks, four blocks.</span> <span id="s754">And...and these people which lived in the...uh...plants...they had some people coming down.</span> <span id="s755">Let's say you picked out...Let's say 5,000 people in a plant, they picked out a hundred and they gave them a certain section, and they said, "You make room for you people which come in.”</span> <span id="s756">So...so they organized a little ghetto.</span> <span id="s757">A small, little ghetto.</span> <span id="s758">And I found out, so I says, "I'm going to go into the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s759">So when that plant was marching in, a day shift...it was a day shift and night shift.</span> <span id="s760">So my brother says you stay aside of the road.</span> <span id="s761">When you're marching in, you jump into the line.</span> <span id="s762">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s763">I waited.</span> <span id="s764">The man in charge, the German policeman was an old man.</span> <span id="s765">He rode on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s766">He couldn't tell the difference from this one or the other one.</span> <span id="s767">Marched into the ghetto and...uh...met my brother and...uh...met my brother there and my mother was still alive.</span> <span id="s768">My moth...my mother was hiding in a bunker, you know, who had...who had build a basement and we ripped out the door and we glued up the door with bricks.</span> <span id="s769">It looked the same so you couldn't tell she was there.</span> <span id="s770">She was hiding there for 4, 5 weeks.</span> <span id="s771">Finally, they couldn't take it any more.</span> <span id="s772">There were children in there too.</span> <span id="s773">And the childrens were crying and someone heard the kids crying and they knew they're people hiding.</span> <span id="s774">So they opened the bunker.</span> <span id="s775">The shot more...half of the people were shot.</span> <span id="s776">My mother sort of survived with my...my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s777">And...uh...they brought in there...they remained in the little...the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s778">They stood in the little ghetto over there for awhile.</span> <span id="s779">And what happened with me is I marched into the little ghetto and I met them.</span> <span id="s780">My mother was still there and my sister-in-law was there with the little kids.</span> <span id="s781">And every day what was going on.</span> <span id="s782">Killing.</span> <span id="s783">Shoot a hundred.</span> <span id="s784">Shoot 2 hundred.</span> <span id="s785">One day they came and said...uh...we want all the...uh...intelligent people which was left.</span> <span id="s786">We have an order from England.</span> <span id="s787">England sent us a..</span> <span id="s788">.</span> <span id="s789">a cable that we want all these intelligent Jews to go...to Palestine or...Palestine then.</span> <span id="s790">So people were...figured they'd take any opportunity.</span> <span id="s791">So they loaded up about 5, 6 trucks with 5, 6 hundred people and they took them down to the cemetery and they threw in and shot them in a common grave.</span> <span id="s792">That was the end of these.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">That's was going on.</span> <span id="s794">And then we lived in the little ghetto in fear every day.</span> <span id="s795">One day I had a friend who just came from the same concentration camp with me.</span> <span id="s796">He got a hold of a gun.</span> <span id="s797">He bought a gun because he figured he couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s798">If he has to die, he's going to take some...some Germans with him.</span> <span id="s799">So one day they picked him up and...uh...you know, they always looked to...anybody looks suspicious...you walked the wrong way, you were shot.</span> <span id="s800">So one day, he walked and they had a little...a little store.</span> <span id="s801">A little small butcher shop by the police station in the little ghetto where anybody was suspicious was thrown in there.</span> <span id="s802">And then...uh...if they were in a good mood, they let you go.</span> <span id="s803">If not, they shot you in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">There was a..</span> <span id="s805">.</span> <span id="s806">a place where the people used to keep ice, you know.</span> <span id="s807">Here they have refrigeration.</span> <span id="s808">Then they used to go...in the winter used to go to the river and chop the ice and put it into that warehouse.</span> <span id="s809">So used to shot into.</span> <span id="s810">So...so one day, he had a gun on him.</span> <span id="s811">He had bought a gun.</span> <span id="s812">So when they took him out and they start shooting people in this...this little market, he pulled his gun out and wanted to shoot this German guy but unfortunate, his gun was so old, rusty, that it didn't fire.</span> <span id="s813">So what he did...he couldn't shoot him so he jumped on him and bit his throat.</span> <span id="s814">And meanwhile the other SS saw what's going on.</span> <span id="s815">They shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Then they decided...what happened every 10s going to be shot.</span> <span id="s817">So they took people out.</span> <span id="s818">I know there were a thousand people.</span> <span id="s819">And every 10 was shot and brought in the bodies.</span> <span id="s820">No, they brought the bodies into the yard.</span> <span id="s821">There is a big yard, and everybody had to go and see, and they were laying there.</span> <span id="s822">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s823">And then this was going on, I think, for a year.</span> <span id="s824">Was miserable living this little ghetto.</span> <span id="s825">There was no food.</span> <span id="s826">We were buying sometimes outside anything we got a hold of.</span> <span id="s827">Horse meat.</span> <span id="s828">Anything!</span> <span id="s829">Disease.</span> <span id="s830">Disease.</span> <span id="s831">The place was diseased.</span> <span id="s832">Was filthy.</span> <span id="s833">People were stuffed in in places, you know, so then what happened they decided they're going to liquidate that little ghetto.</span> <span id="s834">There were I think 6,500 Jews lived in that little ghetto, liquidation.</span> <span id="s835">What do you do with my mother?</span> <span id="s836">My mother couldn't walk out and...and face the music because she looked old.</span> <span id="s837">She wasn't old, but she didn't look young enough to be that, so we decided we're going to put her in in a attic, a little attic over the court yard, a little attic and my sister-in-law with the kid.</span> <span id="s838">And this was going on for the time we were in the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s839">They were looking for old people and children, so we made a false door too.</span> <span id="s840">It was dark, upstairs, old shabby house so we...we...we...uh...made a double door.</span> <span id="s841">Nobody knew, but somebody...there's always trouble-makers.</span> <span id="s842">And there were people which were sympathizing with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s843">They figured they survive.</span> <span id="s844">So one guy came and he said, "This is not...this is a false door.</span> <span id="s845">There's somebody in there.”</span> <span id="s846">So he...the Gestapo said, "No, that's no false.”</span> <span id="s847">And he said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s848">And they busted the door.</span> <span id="s849">And my mother was in there.</span> <span id="s850">And my sister-in-law was in there, and the little child was in there.</span> <span id="s851">But that little child was so sharp, each time he heard noise he jumped into a big pot and put a cover over it so nobody knew he was there.</span> <span id="s852">He survived.</span> <span id="s853">My mother survived.</span> <span id="s854">When they came in...the police came in...there was some Jewish police came with them.</span> <span id="s855">And the Jewish police knew my brothers, so they start screaming, "Where's the old lady?</span> <span id="s856">Where's the old lady?"</span> <span id="s857">So I says, "Aw, you got the wrong information.”</span> <span id="s858">He walked out.</span> <span id="s859">Okay?</span> <span id="s860">And this was going on.</span> <span id="s861">And then there was no more hiding.</span> <span id="s862">Nothing to hide.</span> <span id="s863">So we formed ourself over the court yard.</span> <span id="s864">It was like a little gate.</span> <span id="s865">There was a little...like a little small house, and the house had an attic.</span> <span id="s866">So we figured if they'd be a selection or liquidation, we knew the liquidation is coming.</span> <span id="s867">This is not going to be forever.</span> <span id="s868">A matter of time, you know.</span> <span id="s869">So we decided we're going to put them up there.</span> <span id="s870">Anytime we went to work in the morning we marched out because we used to march out like we used to shape up.</span> <span id="s871">We had kapos.</span> <span id="s872">What do you mean a kapo?</span> <span id="s873">A kapo was a foreman.</span> <span id="s874">He had his group.</span> <span id="s875">500 men.</span> <span id="s876">200 men.</span> <span id="s877">When we marched out in the morning, we had to meet in front a big market and the Gestapo checked out how many you got?</span> <span id="s878">How many you got?</span> <span id="s879">And we assigned jobs.</span> <span id="s880">The jobs were various jobs.</span> <span id="s881">Some jobs...mine job was to work on the Russian cemetery.</span> <span id="s882">The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war, so they brought them into concentration camp and never gave them any food.</span> <span id="s883">They gave them raw potatoes and they died on dysentery, all kind of diseases.</span> <span id="s884">So mine job is to work on the cemetery, dig holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">They used to bring truck loads or...or thousands of Russian soldiers and...uh...they used to roll off there...ever see, like you know how you see in the United States when they bring a garbage truck to a dump, the opened the back and out.</span> <span id="s886">That's the way they used to roll out and you know, I had...I had feelings all the time to people, any people.</span> <span id="s887">I always used to say when I used to stay there with my friends, we used to work.</span> <span id="s888">I used to say, "Here, look at this.</span> <span id="s889">So many thousands of people laying in this hole.</span> <span id="s890">(crying) I says, "So many thousands of people laying in this hole and a mother...a mother somewhere in Russia is waiting for her son to come home.</span> <span id="s891">And he's dead.: Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come home from the war and meanwhile they were laying in that ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Thousands of them.</span> <span id="s893">And this was going on for weeks.</span> <span id="s894">Eventually, they decide to liquidate the Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s895">By liquid...</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: We have to break here.</span> <span id="s897">They're going to have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s898">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s900">This is a good stopping point.</span> <span id="s901">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: So they...uh...before liquidation, they used to come in...Gestapo on Sunday, like the Lufbafer, that was the air force.</span> <span id="s904">They had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s905">They figured let's go down.</span> <span id="s906">We'll make some...make some trouble for the Jews.</span> <span id="s907">They used to walk in and kill people, you know.</span> <span id="s908">Like some people might say today, "They followed orders.”</span> <span id="s909">A lot of 50 or 70 percent was no follow orders.</span> <span id="s910">They came in and shoot and kill just for fun.</span> <span id="s911">And did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s912">They found a man with a beard.</span> <span id="s913">They burned his beard or they did a lot of crazy things they did.</span> <span id="s914">They used to carry on something.</span> <span id="s915">And that was going on...the ghetto was...each time you marched in at night.</span> <span id="s916">What we used to do, when we walked out to work, at night we used to march in and carry food.</span> <span id="s917">Somebody carried a bag of potatoes.</span> <span id="s918">One carry a half a bag of onions, carrots, peas, anything you can get ahold of.</span> <span id="s919">So they used to surprise it.</span> <span id="s920">When we used to march and turn the corner, we were a thousand feet away, we saw them standing.</span> <span id="s921">As soon as we saw them standing, we dropped the bags because if you brought in food, you got killed.</span> <span id="s922">So we dropped the bags.</span> <span id="s923">Sometimes they weren't there so we started marching so fast, and the police stood by the guard...the gate.</span> <span id="s924">They said, "Come on.</span> <span id="s925">Move.</span> <span id="s926">Move.</span> <span id="s927">Move."</span> <span id="s928">before they come out.</span> <span id="s929">That's it.</span> <span id="s930">So we were lucky and we brought some stuff in.</span> <span id="s931">Brought in meat.</span> <span id="s932">Who knows?</span> <span id="s933">Dog meat, horse meat, anything you got ahold of.</span> <span id="s934">The horse meat you could tell apart.</span> <span id="s935">It was red.</span> <span id="s936">More red than normal meat.</span> <span id="s937">And this was going on.</span> <span id="s938">They used to come in and they used to say...see a mother with a child...uh...with two children.</span> <span id="s939">They used to walk over, "Give me one of your child.</span> <span id="s940">One I want.</span> <span id="s941">Pick which one you want.</span> <span id="s942">If not, you get killed.”</span> <span id="s943">So the mother didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s944">What should she do?</span> <span id="s945">How can she give away one?</span> <span id="s946">So he shot them all.</span> <span id="s947">That's all.</span> <span id="s948">That was going on.</span> <span id="s949">That's what the German...German...not only the German people.</span> <span id="s950">The German people knew too what was going on.</span> <span id="s951">Some people say they didn't know.</span> <span id="s952">They...they used to smell the odor in...in Dachau, or in Buchenwald for miles away.</span> <span id="s953">It's like chicken feathers.</span> <span id="s954">People...my brother tells me he was in Buchenwald, that they used to march.</span> <span id="s955">Thousands of miles they used to march when the Germans...the Russian used to advance, so they didn't want to leave the prisoners.</span> <span id="s956">They used to march.</span> <span id="s957">On a march, there used to be, I think, 3, 4 hundred thousand prisoners.</span> <span id="s958">All types.</span> <span id="s959">Not only Jewish.</span> <span id="s960">All nationalities used to march.</span> <span id="s961">American soldiers too included.</span> <span id="s962">Anybody couldn't walk, he just took the rifle and threw him in the...threw him along side the road.</span> <span id="s963">Thousands of them died.</span> <span id="s964">Thousands.</span> <span id="s965">And then when they didn't have no food...they ran out of food, so they...they killed the horses.</span> <span id="s966">And they ate part of the food, but this was rough in general.</span> <span id="s967">But going back to the little ghetto, finally the...the Jews got smart and says, "We're going to try to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s968">What we're going to do, if the Germans come in and start liquidating, we're going to give him a..</span> <span id="s969">.</span> <span id="s970">a little fight.</span> <span id="s971">But what happened the Germans had a lot spies.</span> <span id="s972">What happened?</span> <span id="s973">They had people moved into little ghetto.</span> <span id="s974">If a guy was deaf and dump, he wore a yellow band with 3 black marks...markings, 3 black dots, so we know the guy can't talk.</span> <span id="s975">He can't speak.</span> <span id="s976">And the moved in there.</span> <span id="s977">And he most have been set up by the...by the Germans.</span> <span id="s978">And he sort of knew what was going on and meanwhile the Jews in the little ghetto used to make hand grenades.</span> <span id="s979">They used to take aluminum and...and pour it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">You know, primitive.</span> <span id="s981">And then had a lathe grind it and clean it and cloth it with the dynamite.</span> <span id="s982">And they had this prepared, you know, and we had built a tunnel.</span> <span id="s983">What we did, we collected pickle barrels and we were digging a tunnel.</span> <span id="s984">Each time we did a distance, we pushed a barrel, pushed a barrel, not to walk out but to crawl out and this supposed to been...the tunnel's supposed to go to the river.</span> <span id="s985">Eventually, they got all the information what's going on.</span> <span id="s986">Got ahold of everybody.</span> <span id="s987">Anybody who was in the tunnel was killed because they put gas in or something.</span> <span id="s988">And anybody who was caught was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s989">And that was the end of...the...uh...preparation for the...for the battle.</span> <span id="s990">And then they came in and start liquidating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s991">They took people down.</span> <span id="s992">They took truck loads down to the cemetery and shot them right in the grave, and they...they killed people and people and people.</span> <span id="s993">My mother was hiding in that little house with my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s994">They were there quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">We were trying to make contact with some people which knew...knew a little.</span> <span id="s996">They were closer to the police.</span> <span id="s997">Maybe we can get them out or what or when.</span> <span id="s998">But what happened...the Germans, after they cleaned out the little ghetto, they blew every house up.</span> <span id="s999">They were old, little shabby houses.</span> <span id="s1000">You could have pushed them with a..</span> <span id="s1001">.</span> <span id="s1002">with a strong hand.</span> <span id="s1003">So they were blowing up the houses, one house after another cause they didn't want to show it's there.</span> <span id="s1004">So when they're blowing up the houses, my mother and my sister-in-law walked out.</span> <span id="s1005">They walked out, and Gestapo got ahold of them and put them on the truck and says, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1006">We'll take you here and there.”</span> <span id="s1007">My sister-in-law and the kids...took them down to the Jewish cemetery and shot them in the same grave and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1008">That's all.</span> <span id="s1009">That was the end of my mother ad my sister-in-law and the kids.</span> <span id="s1010">And then they decide to put us back in the plants.</span> <span id="s1011">Build barracks and put us back in the plants.</span> <span id="s1012">The same town.</span> <span id="s1013">The plant was the Hassack.</span> <span id="s1014">That was a company...a company from Leipzig.</span> <span id="s1015">Original, we used to make...uh...what you call?</span> <span id="s1016">The Germans had no gas so they built like little...little ovens in the back of their truck or back of their car.</span> <span id="s1017">Used to put in hard wood and close it.</span> <span id="s1018">The gas from the wood used to push the car.</span> <span id="s1019">We used to do that from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1020">Then the plant changed.</span> <span id="s1021">We start making ammunition.</span> <span id="s1022">I was...what happened, the day they liquidate the ghetto, I remained in the plant.</span> <span id="s1023">Never went home.</span> <span id="s1024">So I didn't go home and there was no place to sleep, so we slept on the cement.</span> <span id="s1025">The hardest thing was to sleep on the cement.</span> <span id="s1026">You know, you couldn't...you turned and twist...there's nothing...the only thing you did to put your hand to your elbow on top under your head.</span> <span id="s1027">And each time they came in, they shoot...they were shooting people like mad.</span> <span id="s1028">If they were looking for somebody suspicious, everything was suspicious.</span> <span id="s1029">Let's say they looked for a guy...uh...uh...John Doe.</span> <span id="s1030">So if there were a hundred Joe Doe's, they killed a hundred John Doe's so they know they killed the one they supposed to.</span> <span id="s1031">And so...That's why had different names in difference birth certificates and all this, but after that the United States passed a law that these people can get away with it for that only reason.</span> <span id="s1032">So I was stuck in that camp with my brothers.</span> <span id="s1033">It was very rough.</span> <span id="s1034">No food.</span> <span id="s1035">You know, no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1036">The hardest thing was to sleep.</span> <span id="s1037">And...uh...and I worked in the ammunition factory, you know.</span> <span id="s1038">Mine job was, unfortunately, there some...were some good.</span> <span id="s1039">And I was what you call working in a division where they didn't need me.</span> <span id="s1040">I wasn't necessary needed there.</span> <span id="s1041">But eventually I pushed myself into a plant where I got...I worked very hard, but at least I was needed because I was afraid if I'm not needed, I'd be going.</span> <span id="s1042">So I eventually...we stood there for awhile, whether I think a week or two, and then they decided to...to make another selection.</span> <span id="s1043">They figured they're going to take out people which they don't want.</span> <span id="s1044">One was too heavy.</span> <span id="s1045">One was too skinny.</span> <span id="s1046">One wore glasses, and one looked funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">And every...uh...what you call boss, meister.</span> <span id="s1048">They called them meister.</span> <span id="s1049">Let's say, every boss was in charge...let's say, like mine...the German which was in charge of mine group, he...the Gestapo gave him orders, "You take out the ones you don't want.”</span> <span id="s1050">So he picked.</span> <span id="s1051">Eventually, I wasn't working there anymore.</span> <span id="s1052">The whole...the whole brigade went.</span> <span id="s1053">The whole brigade went.</span> <span id="s1054">Well, I worked in another division.</span> <span id="s1055">I worked in a machine shop there.</span> <span id="s1056">I was more needed.</span> <span id="s1057">So what happened?</span> <span id="s1058">They made another selection.</span> <span id="s1059">But they were afraid that this is not going to go by so easy.</span> <span id="s1060">People might revolt, so they took them out separate, 2, 4, 6, 8 and stuffed them down in a basement in the police station in the plant.</span> <span id="s1061">There were about 5, 6 hundred people in that basement.</span> <span id="s1062">They were afraid if they would march them out and put them on trucks they might start jumping off the trucks, so there was a..</span> <span id="s1063">.</span> <span id="s1064">uh...what you call , that's a..</span> <span id="s1065">.</span> <span id="s1066">the building industry, German fellow by the name Mosche, was his name.</span> <span id="s1067">He came from Leipzig.</span> <span id="s1068">He was what you call a boovon, a goovon, tough guy, you know, a German tough guy.</span> <span id="s1069">All of them were tough, but he was the one who says he's going to do it, so by taking the people out of the basement, they let them out 2 at a time, he stood with a sledge hammer, hit everybody over the head.</span> <span id="s1070">So anybody came on the truck was laying half dead and...and he locked and put him up and covered the truck with blankets and took him down to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1071">And that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s1072">And then we remained in that little place there, I think, I think, for 2 years... 2 years over there.</span> <span id="s1073">Misery, shooting, killing.</span> <span id="s1074">My brother was shot.</span> <span id="s1075">My brother...uh...was walking once, and there were a train came and with potatoes, and a potato fell out of the...uh...train, so he picked it up.</span> <span id="s1076">We always walked with little potties, because you never knew when you get ahold of some food.</span> <span id="s1077">So he had the pot, and a Gestapo passed by.</span> <span id="s1078">He see he carries the pot, and was a potato in there.</span> <span id="s1079">And they wanted to know where he got the potato.</span> <span id="s1080">He says he picked it up.</span> <span id="s1081">They didn't believe him, so they took him down to the police station.</span> <span id="s1082">He was there, I think, a week.</span> <span id="s1083">My brother told me.</span> <span id="s1084">I wasn't there any more.</span> <span id="s1085">I went to another plant to work.</span> <span id="s1086">My brother told me that you couldn't tell his color, what color he was.</span> <span id="s1087">He was blue.</span> <span id="s1088">And...uh...finally couldn't get out of him because he didn't anything, so one day this...uh...Gestapo man came down.</span> <span id="s1089">His name was Stiglitz.</span> <span id="s1090">He was a short fellow.</span> <span id="s1091">He was a midget, very short.</span> <span id="s1092">With a gun he carried...the revolver he carried was almost as big as he was.</span> <span id="s1093">And he took...went down to the basement and he told him to walk out, told him to pick up two pails of water.</span> <span id="s1094">And he walked with the two pails of water out toward the yard, and he shot him.</span> <span id="s1095">So he figured if him, the pail of water go over him so he wouldn't make a mess.</span> <span id="s1096">So my brother was shot then, and my other brother which worked in the camp took him down to the cemetery and buried him.</span> <span id="s1097">And there were other incident.</span> <span id="s1098">There were...there were...there was...there were...uh...killed with diseases.</span> <span id="s1099">People died on typhus....the camp.</span> <span id="s1100">I had cousins, relatives.</span> <span id="s1101">They died every day.</span> <span id="s1102">You spoke to somebody.</span> <span id="s1103">You see him now.</span> <span id="s1104">The next day he was dead.</span> <span id="s1105">They put them in paper bags.</span> <span id="s1106">They had big paper bags.</span> <span id="s1107">Shoveled them in and every day, they carried down to the cemetery people and people.</span> <span id="s1108">There was another section for incurable diseases in the camp.</span> <span id="s1109">Was circled around with wires.</span> <span id="s1110">So they used to take people down to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1111">And had nothing to do, for fun they used to give them a broom and sit them into the grave and shot them sitting up, standing up, and all these things.</span> <span id="s1112">That was going on with these people which claimed they.</span> <span id="s1113">.</span> <span id="s1114">they followed orders.</span> <span id="s1115">That's all.</span> <span id="s1116">And that was going on.</span> <span id="s1117">All we worked hard.</span> <span id="s1118">And then what happened mine division decide to move to another camp away from town.</span> <span id="s1119">Not far, maybe I would say in mileage, 10 mile, 20 miles, another camp.</span> <span id="s1120">I worked in Hassack Pilsary.</span> <span id="s1121">That was...uh...that was a division from Leipzig Hassack.</span> <span id="s1122">The company Hassack like...uh...uh...uh...like you take Mercedes.</span> <span id="s1123">Mercedes has a division too.</span> <span id="s1124">Hassack Pilsary had a division.</span> <span id="s1125">Yugosnyder that's another company had a division.</span> <span id="s1126">And I worked for Yugosnyder and shipped me to another camp.</span> <span id="s1127">I was with my brothers.</span> <span id="s1128">When I was with...with my brothers, I sort of managed...you know...uh...certain time in the day when we got around after work, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock everybody had something.</span> <span id="s1129">One had a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1130">One couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1131">One...we were wheeling and dealing.</span> <span id="s1132">Let's say, you gave me half a onion, he gave me a haircut.</span> <span id="s1133">I gave you half a potato, you gave me half a carrot.</span> <span id="s1134">And that was...and you gave me a piece of thread to pick my pants, I gave you a needle, you know.</span> <span id="s1135">And that's the way we operated.</span> <span id="s1136">When I got...when I left, I got to the other camp I was very miserable.</span> <span id="s1137">(Pause) (Crying) I was sick.</span> <span id="s1138">I must have weighed...who knows how...how much I weighed?</span> <span id="s1139">I worked and what happened in the other camp...had people from other camps coming.</span> <span id="s1140">They were camps from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1141">People came from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1142">There was a ghetto there.</span> <span id="s1143">They called it like Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1144">Certain sections, these people came there, there were tuffies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Tough, tough people, you know.</span> <span id="s1146">They only left the undesirable.</span> <span id="s1147">The intelligent they killed.</span> <span id="s1148">So they were tough.</span> <span id="s1149">And each time if there was some work to do, they grabbed us because we were the newcomers.</span> <span id="s1150">Took me down to the cemetery to break up monuments and build the roads.</span> <span id="s1151">And made me a fireman because any time, I don't know if was America or Russian...most American planes, English planes used to come over the city at night.</span> <span id="s1152">They used to flight at night, and each time this happened, they set off an alarm that we should go to the railroad tracks and stay there because, in case...uh... something happened, we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s1153">I was a fireman.</span> <span id="s1154">What I had in my possession is a little pump and a pail.</span> <span id="s1155">I was the fireman.</span> <span id="s1156">I was so sick I used to go to the bathroom 20 times a night.</span> <span id="s1157">Even if I didn't need it, I walked because I had no feeling.</span> <span id="s1158">And I used to carry a blanket with me...blanket, covered myself.</span> <span id="s1159">Cold.</span> <span id="s1160">I was shivering and walked back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s1161">And that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s1162">And I had a neighbor...a friend.</span> <span id="s1163">He worked the day shift.</span> <span id="s1164">I worked the night shift, then we changed.</span> <span id="s1165">I don't know if he was old or young.</span> <span id="s1166">I couldn't tell his age.</span> <span id="s1167">He was very nice to me, and he was like a father to me then.</span> <span id="s1168">Because we were both...so we both shared the blanket.</span> <span id="s1169">The blanket had more patches than the blanket, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">But he used to be a..</span> <span id="s1171">.</span> <span id="s1172">a tailor from years back, so for him to take the needle out and stitch it.</span> <span id="s1173">So he used to help me.</span> <span id="s1174">Each time I came I was downhearted.</span> <span id="s1175">I figured who needs this.</span> <span id="s1176">So he always used to encourage me, encourage me, you know.</span> <span id="s1177">And...uh...he used to do work, and I used to be in charge of machines.</span> <span id="s1178">I used to be in charge of bullet machines.</span> <span id="s1179">I didn't know much, but I learned a little.</span> <span id="s1180">And what happened?</span> <span id="s1181">The Germans had no equipment any more.</span> <span id="s1182">They ran out of tools because the Americans were bombing Leipzig and...and Swinford and all these industries where the German had.</span> <span id="s1183">They had no oil.</span> <span id="s1184">They gave us oil to oil the machines.</span> <span id="s1185">It was like kerosene.</span> <span id="s1186">It wasn't slippery.</span> <span id="s1187">Anything went wrong, we were blamed for.</span> <span id="s1188">One day...uh...one day, he gave me a part for a machine.</span> <span id="s1189">He says that's the only part he has.</span> <span id="s1190">If you break it, you be dead.</span> <span id="s1191">What can I do?</span> <span id="s1192">I could only put in the part.</span> <span id="s1193">I put in the part and the machine slipped because it didn't perform the job because there wasn't enough oil to slip the...the machine.</span> <span id="s1194">So I broke it.</span> <span id="s1195">So he took me to the police station, you know, and they gave me such a beating that I fainted and they threw me into the bath tub.</span> <span id="s1196">Then took me out, and gave me another beating.</span> <span id="s1197">Then the next day, the...the...the boss who is charge of me, Mr. Ginter, he found out.</span> <span id="s1198">So he says to the other boss, "Why did you do that to him?"</span> <span id="s1199">He says, "Well," he says, in German, " means gotta turn to victory, and this man didn't perform.</span> <span id="s1200">Okay.</span> <span id="s1201">I managed to stay on my feet, holding on.</span> <span id="s1202">I couldn't hold on to my thing.</span> <span id="s1203">I was so beaten up.</span> <span id="s1204">But he let me live, because if it would have been somebody else, I would have been dead.</span> <span id="s1205">He knew me.</span> <span id="s1206">He knew me for 2 years.</span> <span id="s1207">Why was I..</span> <span id="s1208">.</span> <span id="s1209">was he...he is, what you call...there's good enemies and bad enemies.</span> <span id="s1210">He was a good enemy, what you call.</span> <span id="s1211">He treated me...you ever see, you beat sometimes a dog.</span> <span id="s1212">You beat him so long that you have no use beating him.</span> <span id="s1213">You get used to him, so you beat somebody else.</span> <span id="s1214">He always picked on somebody else.</span> <span id="s1215">So he let me just live and finally he slipped in once a little cup of soup he got from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1216">He came to me...he says to me, "I'm going to give you a loaf of bread, if you tell me who's going to win the war?"</span> <span id="s1217">I says what a..</span> <span id="s1218">.</span> <span id="s1219">what a question to ask me, who's going to win the war.</span> <span id="s1220">I says, "I think.</span> <span id="s1221">.”</span> <span id="s1222">He says, "Think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Think about it.”</span> <span id="s1224">So I think about it.</span> <span id="s1225">I figured I be dead by the time he comes back.</span> <span id="s1226">Okay.</span> <span id="s1227">Came back 2 days later.</span> <span id="s1228">He says, "Who's going to win the war?"</span> <span id="s1229">I says, "You.”</span> <span id="s1230">He gave me such a beating again, the same guy.</span> <span id="s1231">He threw me on the floor.</span> <span id="s1232">He kicked me and kicked me and kicked me.</span> <span id="s1233">Finally, I got up and...and managed a little.</span> <span id="s1234">It was a weekend so we didn't work on Sundays.</span> <span id="s1235">So I laid in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1236">There was some doctors there which weren't...nobody knew they're doctors...had some medication and some water and I bounced back pretty fast.</span> <span id="s1237">And that's where I spent my time over there.</span> <span id="s1238">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s1239">That thing was terrible.</span> <span id="s1240">You couldn't work.</span> <span id="s1241">You couldn't...a guy used to come at night....at the night shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">We used to work night.</span> <span id="s1243">He came in and he used to insist...if we make a hundred percent he gives a..</span> <span id="s1244">.</span> <span id="s1245">a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1246">A loaf of bread was let's figure what you call...it was a kilo?</span> <span id="s1247">...let's figure a regular loaf of bread, a round loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1248">How do you make a hundred percent if you haven't got the machinery.</span> <span id="s1249">I had girls working for me.</span> <span id="s1250">You know, I had about 6, 7 girls working, you know.</span> <span id="s1251">We used to share even what we had...even...even a pit.</span> <span id="s1252">Anything we shared.</span> <span id="s1253">They were nice.</span> <span id="s1254">And there were some girls from...which were shipped from other camps there.</span> <span id="s1255">Very nice girls.</span> <span id="s1256">And they used to help, you know.</span> <span id="s1257">Not with food, but...uh...morally, they used to perk you up.</span> <span id="s1258">And I had friend which worked with me which died, you know, so I was left without him.</span> <span id="s1259">He used to help me out.</span> <span id="s1260">And anytime the machines broke, what happened...these girls never ate.</span> <span id="s1261">And the Germans used to shave their hair off and put like onion bags on top of them, made out of three holes for the head and for the two arms, and that's the way they used to walk around.</span> <span id="s1262">They had never dressed, you know.</span> <span id="s1263">And you know how a woman has to take care of herself more than a man.</span> <span id="s1264">They looked awful, but they were worked with me.</span> <span id="s1265">And anytime machine was broke and he came back and he got mad, he took and shot her in the back yard right away.</span> <span id="s1266">So there's one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">That's the way it was.</span> <span id="s1268">But...uh...it was part of my life.</span> <span id="s1269">I..</span> <span id="s1270">.</span> <span id="s1271">uh...I didn't care.</span> <span id="s1272">I couldn't wait it's going to be me, you know.</span> <span id="s1273">But how do you get rid of this misery.</span> <span id="s1274">And...he used to be...he used to drink a lot.</span> <span id="s1275">This...uh...German, who used to be in charge of me.</span> <span id="s1276">His name used to be Prosser.</span> <span id="s1277">Prosser.</span> <span id="s1278">He came back from the eastern front.</span> <span id="s1279">He lost two fingers.</span> <span id="s1280">So he wasn't good for the army, so they sent him to this camp.</span> <span id="s1281">He knew about machinery like I know how to be an astronaut today.</span> <span id="s1282">But okay, maybe he had some relatives.</span> <span id="s1283">And he came with his wife.</span> <span id="s1284">His wife used to be a blonde.</span> <span id="s1285">She used to be so experienced slapping people, I don't know how fast.</span> <span id="s1286">You didn't know what hit you.</span> <span id="s1287">She slapped you on both sides.</span> <span id="s1288">Even if you...you moved away, you couldn't miss her.</span> <span id="s1289">So fast.</span> <span id="s1290">Left and right, she used to slap.</span> <span id="s1291">She slapped...the woman used to slap, and kick em, and spit on them.</span> <span id="s1292">That's what she used to do.</span> <span id="s1293">But she was nice to me.</span> <span id="s1294">She saw that each time she saw me...not that she greeted me, but she threw sort of a friendly...not a smile, but a friendly look.</span> <span id="s1295">That's all.</span> <span id="s1296">And...uh...she used to help me sometimes.</span> <span id="s1297">You know, I used to say, "Can you give me some bread.”</span> <span id="s1298">She says, "I'm not allowed to.”</span> <span id="s1299">But what she used to do, each time she passed by the machine, she made believe she dropped something.</span> <span id="s1300">She looked at me.</span> <span id="s1301">Sometimes a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1302">But I used to work at night.</span> <span id="s1303">I used to work at night, so I used to go into his office because if I needed a part, I went into his office.</span> <span id="s1304">So he was sleeping.</span> <span id="s1305">He soundly slept, and he had a little satchel where he kept his food.</span> <span id="s1306">So if he was sleeping, he was drunk.</span> <span id="s1307">I took a sandwich out from his...uh...uh...attache case.</span> <span id="s1308">And I ran into the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1309">The bathroom wasn't cleaned for 5 years, so the odor and the salami sandwich sort of the combination, people were sitting there, they couldn't tell that I'm eating.</span> <span id="s1310">Then I washed my mouth out with water and say, "What are you eating?"</span> <span id="s1311">I says, "No, I got ahold of a piece of...uh...garlic.”</span> <span id="s1312">And got away with it.</span> <span id="s1313">That's helped me, you know.</span> <span id="s1314">Sometimes, some day, I went up and he was sleeping, I saw an apple.</span> <span id="s1315">I took in an apple.</span> <span id="s1316">For me to eat an apple, for me to eat a..</span> <span id="s1317">.</span> <span id="s1318">a..</span> <span id="s1319">.</span> <span id="s1320">salami sandwich, is like for somebody giving a shot to think that...that sandwich used to go into my stomach is like you're dropping a..</span> <span id="s1321">.</span> <span id="s1322">a something to an empty barrel, you know.</span> <span id="s1323">But I was swollen.</span> <span id="s1324">I didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s1325">I was...I was a mess.</span> <span id="s1326">I was a mess already.</span> <span id="s1327">Finally, what happened, in...uh...one night I was working, so friend of mine...friend, he was passing by with a..</span> <span id="s1328">.</span> <span id="s1329">with a metal, little wagon.</span> <span id="s1330">Was carrying something.</span> <span id="s1331">And I had no shoes.</span> <span id="s1332">I was wearing wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1333">So he went in back of me, and he ripped my skin off from my feet, you know, not knowing.</span> <span id="s1334">So I turned around and I rapped him in the mouth.</span> <span id="s1335">So the...the...uh... the police saw it, took my name down.</span> <span id="s1336">The next day they took me to the police station, and they gave me a beating.</span> <span id="s1337">So one guy tipped off said, "Leave him along.</span> <span id="s1338">His brother just died, so give him a break.”</span> <span id="s1339">They gave me a..</span> <span id="s1340">.</span> <span id="s1341">a less beating.</span> <span id="s1342">But that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1343">They used to carry on terrible.</span> <span id="s1344">Terrible things used to go...used to go on.</span> <span id="s1345">And then what happened finally...finally, the Russian army started advancing closer to...to Poland because the Americans helped them out with arms, with trucks because they were really in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1346">So they start advancing and the army was very powerful, you know.</span> <span id="s1347">Good soldiers they had.</span> <span id="s1348">They started reaching already closer to our town.</span> <span id="s1349">So they decided they didn't want to leave nobody, so they...they set up trains.</span> <span id="s1350">They had no trains.</span> <span id="s1351">They made you walk on the...on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1352">And shipped...shipped most of the...rest of the Jews to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1353">I was sort of the...uh...the old coot.</span> <span id="s1354">My boss thought that the Germans could fight off the onslaught from the Russian army, so eventually the fight...if he's safe, I'm safe, so he could open himself a little bit.</span> <span id="s1355">And slaves there's enough.</span> <span id="s1356">If there wouldn't be no Jews, there would be Pollack.</span> <span id="s1357">They wouldn't be no Pollacks, there'd be others.</span> <span id="s1358">Gypsies.</span> <span id="s1359">There were plenty, you know.</span> <span id="s1360">So I remain...I..</span> <span id="s1361">.</span> <span id="s1362">I was left.</span> <span id="s1363">I had...my clothes I didn't have.</span> <span id="s1364">The only thing I had one shirt...uh...polyester shirt which was already in shreds from washing in detergent, and I had a pair of pants which was ripped and was cold.</span> <span id="s1365">Each time it blew, it like air condition over hole.</span> <span id="s1366">And I was cold all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">And...and they start taking people out of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1368">Everybody.</span> <span id="s1369">This guy left.</span> <span id="s1370">The guy which used to be in with me sharing the blanket.</span> <span id="s1371">They took him.</span> <span id="s1372">And I was holding on to the.</span> <span id="s1373">.</span> <span id="s1374">uh...to the boards where we were sleeping cause I couldn't stay on my feet because I was too weak.</span> <span id="s1375">So I remained and they shipped everybody out.</span> <span id="s1376">At night...the same night after they shipped him, some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the trains and busted the trains up and let the prisoners out.</span> <span id="s1377">And some of them...and the Germans took off at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">They didn't take no train.</span> <span id="s1379">They walked on their...on the tracks.</span> <span id="s1380">So some of the Russian army got ahold of them and shot them right on the tracks and some of them escaped, but some of them most of the Jews were shipped to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1381">They were shipped to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1382">My brothers were shipped to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1383">Some came back and some didn't.</span> <span id="s1384">And I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1385">That's all.</span> <span id="s1386">I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1387">I was liberated and the Russian trucks and army came in and looked around.</span> <span id="s1388">So many sick and dead people.</span> <span id="s1389">Some died.</span> <span id="s1390">The flies were eating them alive and the insects and all this.</span> <span id="s1391">And I remained in the camp with not too many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Many people...some of them which were stronger were running toward the police station to pick up rifles when the German...uh...picked up rifles and they were shooting in the air.</span> <span id="s1393">And I figured, "Hey, this is not for me here.</span> <span id="s1394">If they ever come, we're finished.</span> <span id="s1395">Not that...I was finished anyhow.</span> <span id="s1396">I could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s1397">So I figured I take my little...uh...can I had.</span> <span id="s1398">I had all the time with me like a gallon paint.</span> <span id="s1399">It was a can.</span> <span id="s1400">And I used to make in that can.</span> <span id="s1401">I used to eat in that can.</span> <span id="s1402">I used to do everything in that can.</span> <span id="s1403">That can used to be for every use, what human use you could use.</span> <span id="s1404">And that's all.</span> <span id="s1405">Sometimes I didn't wash it because I figured, "Who cares.”</span> <span id="s1406">Didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s1407">So I decided I take that can and my wooden shoes I had and which were ripped.</span> <span id="s1408">They...I couldn't even walk in them anymore.</span> <span id="s1409">They were...and I decided I leave the camp.</span> <span id="s1410">Because I was liberated in the same town, I figured I march out.</span> <span id="s1411">If I marched out, it took me awhile.</span> <span id="s1412">I marched.</span> <span id="s1413">Some people say, "Where you going.”</span> <span id="s1414">Said, "I'm going.”</span> <span id="s1415">"Oh, you live in that town.</span> <span id="s1416">So you must know.</span> <span id="s1417">You got your house.”</span> <span id="s1418">They thought I got a house.</span> <span id="s1419">I got a mansion there.</span> <span id="s1420">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1421">I was a poor...poor family.</span> <span id="s1422">Marched out of town.</span> <span id="s1423">The community where I lived was destroyed.</span> <span id="s1424">The houses were blown up.</span> <span id="s1425">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1426">I marched into town.</span> <span id="s1427">Came into town.</span> <span id="s1428">Russian soldiers were there.</span> <span id="s1429">Were hunting down the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1430">Most of the SS were hiding.</span> <span id="s1431">Some of them were hiding in the big German trucks where they keep the tools, like big drawers.</span> <span id="s1432">They shoved themselves in there.</span> <span id="s1433">The Russians were very mad at them because, you know, the Russians lost over 20 million people, you know.</span> <span id="s1434">They treated the Russian very bad.</span> <span id="s1435">So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the Russian camp.</span> <span id="s1436">There was a Russian camp.</span> <span id="s1437">People were almost dead.</span> <span id="s1438">There wasn't much left.</span> <span id="s1439">They were sick and dying.</span> <span id="s1440">They liberated that camp, and put them on trucks.</span> <span id="s1441">Put them into hospitals.</span> <span id="s1442">And then the liberation started.</span> <span id="s1443">And we were free.</span> <span id="s1444">Not for too long.</span> <span id="s1445">Then they...what happened, the.</span> <span id="s1446">.</span> <span id="s1447">uh...the underground...Polish underground starts fighting, starts looking for scapegoats again.</span> <span id="s1448">There was some Jews left in town.</span> <span id="s1449">So they figured they were...there were 3, 4 different organizations.</span> <span id="s1450">There was a..</span> <span id="s1451">.</span> <span id="s1452">the exile government in London had a....an organization.</span> <span id="s1453">There was a communist organization.</span> <span id="s1454">There was other organizations.</span> <span id="s1455">They were fighting between each other.</span> <span id="s1456">And, you know, there weren't too many Jews in town.</span> <span id="s1457">There must have been maybe 500 or 700 Jews from that population close to 40,000.</span> <span id="s1458">And which side do you take?</span> <span id="s1459">So they accuse us, we're taking this side, the other side.</span> <span id="s1460">So they start shooting Jews in town again.</span> <span id="s1461">I figured that's no good, so decided to leave.</span> <span id="s1462">So I look the...I took the train with some other people and smuggled myself into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1463">From Czechoslovakia, I stood there for a while.</span> <span id="s1464">I met a..</span> <span id="s1465">.</span> <span id="s1466">a Jewish family, and they keep meeting over night there.</span> <span id="s1467">I went with my other brother, the two brothers we went.</span> <span id="s1468">Because we didn't want to go as a group because if we get caught, we're better off going separate.</span> <span id="s1469">My other brother crossed the...the border between...uh...Poland and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1470">Czechoslovakia we stood a couple of days then.</span> <span id="s1471">We went to Carls...Carlsbad .</span> <span id="s1472">That was the border between the United States and Russia.</span> <span id="s1473">We crossed the border there.</span> <span id="s1474">The American soldiers were standing and questioning.</span> <span id="s1475">If you were coming from the east, they say, "You go back to the east.</span> <span id="s1476">Wait til they...they ship you.”</span> <span id="s1477">If you were coming from...from Germany, from the West, they say, "Go back to your west.</span> <span id="s1478">When the repatriation would start, then they ship you.”</span> <span id="s1479">But unfortunate, I had a piece of paper that I..</span> <span id="s1480">.</span> <span id="s1481">I came from Czectachowa and the American soldiers saw Czestachowa and Czestachowa sounded like Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1482">The stamp was the same.</span> <span id="s1483">He couldn't tell the difference.</span> <span id="s1484">And he asked me where I'm coming from.</span> <span id="s1485">I says, "I'm coming from the west.</span> <span id="s1486">I want to go east.”</span> <span id="s1487">So he says, "No, you can't go east.</span> <span id="s1488">Go back to the west.”</span> <span id="s1489">And I was really coming from the east.</span> <span id="s1490">So he let me go over the border and then I went in over the border and then...uh...I walked across...a day and went into a small, little town in Germany.</span> <span id="s1491">Uh...Hof , that's where Secretary of State Kissinger was born in Hof.</span> <span id="s1492">Stood there a couple of hours, then we took the train and proceeded to a bigger town.</span> <span id="s1493">So I went into Bamberg and in Bamberg a couple more Jewish people lived there.</span> <span id="s1494">And I stood there for awhile, you know.</span> <span id="s1495">And it wasn't good.</span> <span id="s1496">You know, it was rough til I got a little apartment to live in.</span> <span id="s1497">I didn't want to live in a camp.</span> <span id="s1498">Lived in an apartment with no windows.</span> <span id="s1499">We struggled...struggled in a little town.</span> <span id="s1500">And then...then the UNRRA came, start helping out.</span> <span id="s1501">And there were a lot of Jewish soldiers in the American army.</span> <span id="s1502">So what happened...most anybody, wasn't only the Jewish soldiers...the...the Gentiles, anybody wanted to give their food away because they...they didn't want to eat that kind of food.</span> <span id="s1503">The white bread and the soup.</span> <span id="s1504">For American soldiers, was no good because this wasn't the best food, but for us it was good.</span> <span id="s1505">So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Everyday the Chaplain came down with the...with the...with the little hookup, the kitchen and brought us food into the little yard we lived in the... And we used to eat good.</span> <span id="s1507">And then things changed.</span> <span id="s1508">The UNRRA came.</span> <span id="s1509">Start getting packages.</span> <span id="s1510">You know, food packages.</span> <span id="s1511">And we used to sign the...let's say eggs, powdered eggs; two pound of rye bread, two pound of white bread, and...and cheese and chocolate.</span> <span id="s1512">And we had pretty good then you know.</span> <span id="s1513">And then...uh...what happened, we...uh...the American government wanted to organize we should do something because we were sitting...a lot of people needed help.</span> <span id="s1514">Psychiatrists.</span> <span id="s1515">Because they couldn't take it, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1516">So they organized soccer teams.</span> <span id="s1517">And that what happened organized...there was a lot of professionals from the past, and some young, and organized soccer team.</span> <span id="s1518">So I joined one of the soccer teams.</span> <span id="s1519">My brother joined one of the soccer teams.</span> <span id="s1520">And we were playing.</span> <span id="s1521">And the Americans...American officer got himself a..</span> <span id="s1522">.</span> <span id="s1523">a little job.</span> <span id="s1524">Each time we drove, he gave us the trucks.</span> <span id="s1525">I'd say 5, 6 trucks and we drove to another town to play against another camp.</span> <span id="s1526">So these...uh...officers or captains were betting...were betting against each other.</span> <span id="s1527">Make sure you win.</span> <span id="s1528">If you win we give you more food, better food.</span> <span id="s1529">We're traveling for days.</span> <span id="s1530">American soldiers were driving the trucks, you know.</span> <span id="s1531">And we had food and everything.</span> <span id="s1532">Anytime we won, they were happy.</span> <span id="s1533">They were betting on us.</span> <span id="s1534">And that's how we spend the time in Germany.</span> <span id="s1535">Playing soccer.</span> <span id="s1536">And finally what I wanted...I wanted to go to Palestine cause I figured I didn't want to come to another country.</span> <span id="s1537">Not that America was bad, but I couldn't come here.</span> <span id="s1538">I had no relatives.</span> <span id="s1539">So I figured, "Let me go...let me try to get there.”</span> <span id="s1540">But how do you go there?</span> <span id="s1541">There was no state.</span> <span id="s1542">So I joined a little kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1543">And they were teaching me ways.</span> <span id="s1544">And they supposed to send me to Italy.</span> <span id="s1545">But what happened the English government, Churchill was then the Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">He gave orders to the Italian government not to let Jews into Italy cause they're smuggling themselves by boats and only all means to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1547">So they shipped me back.</span> <span id="s1548">I went...almost ready to go, shipped me back to...to Germany, and I remained there, and then I figured it's hopeless.</span> <span id="s1549">What do I do here?</span> <span id="s1550">I don't want to sit here?</span> <span id="s1551">So I went up to the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s1552">And I registered myself and gave him my name and he asked me, "What are you doing?</span> <span id="s1553">What's your profession.”</span> <span id="s1554">I says, "I was tool and dyemaker.</span> <span id="s1555">I could do a job.”</span> <span id="s1556">It took, I think, 4, 5 weeks.</span> <span id="s1557">He called me down with my other brothers.</span> <span id="s1558">They all had good professions.</span> <span id="s1559">And we stood in a..</span> <span id="s1560">.</span> <span id="s1561">in a other army camp in Munich for, I think, 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s1562">They were checking us out, if we have any diseases, x-rayed, and all these things; and they found us healthy.</span> <span id="s1563">And they took us on a trip, and shipped us to Bramenhafen.</span> <span id="s1564">And we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1565">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s1566">Came in here and America was good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Anything I did in the United States was good.</span> <span id="s1568">My first job was 65 cents an hour, was great.</span> <span id="s1569">Who needed more?</span> <span id="s1570">I had food.</span> <span id="s1571">I got once...uh...I got once...the United Service Service gave me once $7.00 a week til I find a job.</span> <span id="s1572">That was a lot of money for me.</span> <span id="s1573">$7.00.</span> <span id="s1574">I went out on Brighton Beach Avenue.</span> <span id="s1575">I lived in Brighton then.</span> <span id="s1576">They got me an apartment for $15.00 a month.</span> <span id="s1577">I went out on Brighton Beach Avenue, brought a 2 pound of rye bread and bought a jar of herring and bananas and apples and a couple of oranges and I closed the door.</span> <span id="s1578">I says, "Who needs better than this?"</span> <span id="s1579">Free man, good country.</span> <span id="s1580">I went to night school and learned how to speak English.</span> <span id="s1581">And then...uh...$7.00 wasn't enough because I needed a haircut and I was going back to the United Service and there were Americans.</span> <span id="s1582">They were tell me if you want to be an American, be dressed like an American.</span> <span id="s1583">Don't wear these pants with the white cuffs.</span> <span id="s1584">You walk in the street.</span> <span id="s1585">They see you're a foreigner.</span> <span id="s1586">They bought me a suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">You know, paid for it.</span> <span id="s1588">And then I was doing pretty good.</span> <span id="s1589">Got another job, one job.</span> <span id="s1590">Landed in a machine shop.</span> <span id="s1591">Doing pretty good.</span> <span id="s1592">The minute I came here I did good.</span> <span id="s1593">As little as I worked and as odd job I got...jobs which nobody wanted to take, for me it was good.</span> <span id="s1594">Better than I had.</span> <span id="s1595">That's all.</span> <span id="s1596">Had my apartment.</span> <span id="s1597">Bought myself a little radio.</span> <span id="s1598">That's it.</span> <span id="s1599">And I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1600">And struggled, you know, years in the United States.</span> <span id="s1601">It wasn't easy, but...uh...live in a free country.</span> <span id="s1602">What else do you expect?</span> <span id="s1603">No one is telling you what to do.</span> <span id="s1604">You want a job, you get a job.</span> <span id="s1605">You don't wanta a work, you don't work.</span> <span id="s1606">If you don't work, you don't eat.</span> <span id="s1607">But America was great to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: You want to ask me some questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Is there anything else that you left out or that you recall from the earlier parts of your story?</span> <span id="s1610">A: Oh, I guess.</span> <span id="s1611">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Do you want to talk about your various siblings and what happened to them?</span> <span id="s1613">There were some that you didn't...it wasn't clear who happened...what happened to who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Well, the older brother was shipped to Treblinka with his wife and kids.</span> <span id="s1615">Q: You want to tell their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: HIs name was...uh...his name was...uh...Abram.</span> <span id="s1617">He could have remained maybe, because he was a healthy young man, but he didn't want to leave his wife and children.</span> <span id="s1618">His child...he had a young child.</span> <span id="s1619">So he says to his wife, "I go with you.”</span> <span id="s1620">So he went and he landed in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1621">That's all.</span> <span id="s1622">My other brother...had another brother, Jacob, he came to...to the ghtto...to Treblinka when I was there, but I wasn't...not that I could anything for him, but I was working in a different lot then.</span> <span id="s1623">And...uh...people were coming in in the thousands every day.</span> <span id="s1624">Trains coming in from distance.</span> <span id="s1625">They looked out their little windows, and they were wondering where they're going.</span> <span id="s1626">Sometimes they were asking.</span> <span id="s1627">What should I do?</span> <span id="s1628">What can I say anything?</span> <span id="s1629">Didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s1630">The worst thing I..</span> <span id="s1631">.</span> <span id="s1632">I couldn't...I couldn't...couldn't watch.</span> <span id="s1633">Like if they picked up little children, little babies 2 years old that got left from their parents and they just threw them into the fire.</span> <span id="s1634">But I'm wondering one thing which I can't comprehend as a humanbeing.</span> <span id="s1635">I mean I feel people are equal.</span> <span id="s1636">Maybe they're not equal when they grow up.</span> <span id="s1637">They join different organizations, different religions, but I can't comprehend a man...there's some...there some people which did that, and a lot of them are still alive.</span> <span id="s1638">What I can't comprehend is (pause) (crying) I can't comprehend a man like him who did that and he has his own children (crying) and he has his own grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1639">How does he feel?</span> <span id="s1640">(crying) How does he feel as a humanbeing?</span> <span id="s1641">And he's maybe a religious man.</span> <span id="s1642">He belongs in a..</span> <span id="s1643">.</span> <span id="s1644">in a certain religious thing.</span> <span id="s1645">How does he feel?</span> <span id="s1646">How can he live with him?</span> <span id="s1647">He killed somebody else's children which had no...didn't have your mind....didn't know what they are and what they is, and he took a child, picked up...same children by their hair and slammed it against a cement wall.</span> <span id="s1648">And here this is a man which was dressed clean, had his mind, and he went home to Germany.</span> <span id="s1649">And he married after that.</span> <span id="s1650">He had a wife and kids.</span> <span id="s1651">When his kids were walking around in the house or playing with him, how did he feel?</span> <span id="s1652">If this is religion, I don't know if there is anybody...if there is a God in Heaven.</span> <span id="s1653">If he could have seen these things and let them get away with it.</span> <span id="s1654">Can understand you kill a person.</span> <span id="s1655">You accuse him.</span> <span id="s1656">He's a murderer.</span> <span id="s1657">He did that.</span> <span id="s1658">He did the other.</span> <span id="s1659">There's always accusation.</span> <span id="s1660">A lot of innocent people die in other countries.</span> <span id="s1661">Now in eastern Europe accusations, and they were taking innocent people...innocent people.</span> <span id="s1662">If not, he got a hold of an old woman which could hardly walk and he called her, "You...You old prostitute.</span> <span id="s1663">You son-of-a-bitch (in German).</span> <span id="s1664">You've lived long enough.”</span> <span id="s1665">And he shot her.</span> <span id="s1666">And these people used to go home and have their grandmas, grandpas.</span> <span id="s1667">Where is justice?</span> <span id="s1668">Where did we go wrong?</span> <span id="s1669">I wasn't a millionaire.</span> <span id="s1670">My father hardly make a living.</span> <span id="s1671">I told what my father did in younger years.</span> <span id="s1672">He worked for a collection agency.</span> <span id="s1673">To collect charity.</span> <span id="s1674">If you pledged, he went to collect.</span> <span id="s1675">By the time he came to collect, there was nothing to collect.</span> <span id="s1676">People changed their minds.</span> <span id="s1677">So he was no...didn't belong to no organization.</span> <span id="s1678">He was an innocent, nice man.</span> <span id="s1679">He went to his temple.</span> <span id="s1680">He prayed to God according to the Jewish law.</span> <span id="s1681">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1682">That's all.</span> <span id="s1683">Look what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s1684">My mother used to do so many good things.</span> <span id="s1685">She used to...when a poor man they used to be what you call the...uh...the poor people.</span> <span id="s1686">They used to beg us.</span> <span id="s1687">You had a lot of beggars.</span> <span id="s1688">Here you have them in the streets.</span> <span id="s1689">In the old country, they used to come into our building and knock at your door.</span> <span id="s1690">She used to open the door.</span> <span id="s1691">They say, "Give me something.”</span> <span id="s1692">They wanted food.</span> <span id="s1693">We were a family of 10 children.</span> <span id="s1694">We hardly had food to eat.</span> <span id="s1695">Mostly likely, ceratin cases we didn't.</span> <span id="s1696">My mother used to cook a big pot of...of...of soup and if a..</span> <span id="s1697">.</span> <span id="s1698">if a poor man knocked at the door, she...she...she took the soup out of the pot and gave the poor...and made him sit on the steps and eat before she gave it to the children and then she figured there wouldn't be enough, so she took a..</span> <span id="s1699">.</span> <span id="s1700">a..</span> <span id="s1701">.</span> <span id="s1702">a picture of water and poured it into the soup, made the soup should be enough.</span> <span id="s1703">So here...here is a woman which...which didn't do no wrong.</span> <span id="s1704">As it goes now, I know she didn't do no wrong.</span> <span id="s1705">Like some people might say, "Well, here now, parents were rough.</span> <span id="s1706">My father and mother, anything he did to me, in the younger years...or beat me or hit me or my teacher or my principal gave me a beating, I deserved it.</span> <span id="s1707">All the time.</span> <span id="s1708">I know.</span> <span id="s1709">Maybe then I was accusing him.</span> <span id="s1710">He's bad on me.</span> <span id="s1711">I mean, but I deserve.</span> <span id="s1712">But my mother didn't know from no wrong.</span> <span id="s1713">She went out of the way to do people favors and...and anybody knocked at the door for some food, sometimes a pair of old shoes or this.</span> <span id="s1714">She always did a favor.</span> <span id="s1715">For that she deserved to be shot on a cemetery in a..</span> <span id="s1716">.</span> <span id="s1717">in a grave with hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1718">Maybe she wasn't even shot.</span> <span id="s1719">Maybe she was thrown in.</span> <span id="s1720">If they were firing shots, where everybody dies.</span> <span id="s1721">If there's so many people line up, they bring a truck load of people.</span> <span id="s1722">Zing!</span> <span id="s1723">That it.</span> <span id="s1724">That's what...that...that's what she...that's what she deserved it.</span> <span id="s1725">My mother and the rest of my brothers, honest people...never had a police record.</span> <span id="s1726">Never knew from a bad day.</span> <span id="s1727">Always worked for a living.</span> <span id="s1728">Struggled, brought every dollar home to help Mama out to feed the family, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1729">We used to...my mother used to sit for hours and used to fix socks.</span> <span id="s1730">Used to use a certain cotton to fix holes.</span> <span id="s1731">And my sister used to help out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">There was no shower.</span> <span id="s1733">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1734">As a kid, she used to put me in in a little...a round, little thing.</span> <span id="s1735">Used to wash me around.</span> <span id="s1736">I was ashamed.</span> <span id="s1737">And she used to wash around because she gotta wash around.</span> <span id="s1738">That's it.</span> <span id="s1739">We lived in an apartment from the beginning, was two big rooms, 10 kids.</span> <span id="s1740">We had no...not enough facilities to put beds out, so we used to have these folding beds.</span> <span id="s1741">At night we used to bring in from the outside and used to open them up.</span> <span id="s1742">At night, you couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1743">So that's what she had.</span> <span id="s1744">And that what kind of life we used to live, and that's what we got for...for that.</span> <span id="s1745">So that's what I'm asking.</span> <span id="s1746">Sometimes I'm wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">You know, I talk sometimes, you know, people sometimes say, "Oh, God in Heaven.</span> <span id="s1748">God in...” I mean the sun was shining any time the gas chambers were going and the people were being thrown like a..</span> <span id="s1749">.</span> <span id="s1750">like you see garbage, like you see...uh...they dump garbage in the dumps.</span> <span id="s1751">I mean if there was a God in Heaven, he should have looked down and...and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1752">And this wasn't only happen to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1753">Happened to millions of Russians.</span> <span id="s1754">Don't forget.</span> <span id="s1755">There were 6 million Jews died.</span> <span id="s1756">I think 6 million Pollacks died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Okay.</span> <span id="s1758">They were a bigger population.</span> <span id="s1759">They were then I think 24 million or something.</span> <span id="s1760">And 20 million Russians.</span> <span id="s1761">For what?</span> <span id="s1762">Why?</span> <span id="s1763">And now everything is fine and forgotten and now people come out now with books.</span> <span id="s1764">Some professors in universities, he says it never happened.</span> <span id="s1765">People made it up.</span> <span id="s1766">I came here to talk to you to make it up.</span> <span id="s1767">I have nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s1768">You know what this does to me sitting here?</span> <span id="s1769">(crying) Some people say...some people say you should forget.</span> <span id="s1770">How can you forget?</span> <span id="s1771">How can you forget?</span> <span id="s1772">You had a family.</span> <span id="s1773">You had...you had roots.</span> <span id="s1774">That's it.</span> <span id="s1775">My father find...my father died before the war.</span> <span id="s1776">They didn't even let him leave...live in.</span> <span id="s1777">.</span> <span id="s1778">in peace.</span> <span id="s1779">They took...they took his monument and...and build a road.</span> <span id="s1780">That's it.</span> <span id="s1781">They build a road.</span> <span id="s1782">Even if you want to go there and see it, you can't see it.</span> <span id="s1783">Before the war...what happened before the war started, the Germans had plenty spies.</span> <span id="s1784">And they steeled up the Polish people against the Jewish.</span> <span id="s1785">The said the Jewish...Jewish people are your biggest enemies.</span> <span id="s1786">They're going to take over the country.</span> <span id="s1787">Finally, when they marched in to Poland and my neighbors which I knew had stores, grocery stores and restaurants...uh...I knew they were...before the war started they were walking around in the Polish uniforms with metals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">When the war...uh...when the Germans came into town, the next day I walk out, I see the same guy wearing a German uniform.</span> <span id="s1789">That's it.</span> <span id="s1790">They didn't trust us.</span> <span id="s1791">They trusted them.</span> <span id="s1792">Why the Jewish cemetery?</span> <span id="s1793">Which the cemetery was, knows, since...uh...since the Jews came into Poland 500 years ago, maybe 600 years now, the Jews marched into Poland because the Polish people wanted the Jews to come in.</span> <span id="s1794">They didn't come in.</span> <span id="s1795">They marched in.</span> <span id="s1796">The...the king let them in because they were productive people.</span> <span id="s1797">They were shoemakers and...and tailors.</span> <span id="s1798">They were helping out.</span> <span id="s1799">For a poor man to survive, he could have bought himself, let's say a suit, a pair of shoes, and the Jew was good for that in Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1800">So they let...they let...let...let the Jews in to Poland, so... I don't know what... I got lost now.</span> <span id="s1801">I don't know what I was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s1803">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: And that's it.</span> <span id="s1805">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1806">And that was the end of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1807">And that's what...that's what we got.</span> <span id="s1808">The temples were destroyed.</span> <span id="s1809">The temples were burned.</span> <span id="s1810">The rabbis were...were slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1811">And what I wanted to say about this Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1812">Just forgot.</span> <span id="s1813">The Jewish cemetery...the...the Polish government gave orders to the...to every community that every Jewish cemetery, the war...should be taken apart because the Jews hiding out spies on the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1814">So they broke up the walls.</span> <span id="s1815">The walls must have been...uh...I would say...uh...6, 7 feet wide.</span> <span id="s1816">You know how you used to pour cement on, so they broke it down.</span> <span id="s1817">Since now, there's no walls.</span> <span id="s1818">Who could afford to build walls?</span> <span id="s1819">Who has money?</span> <span id="s1820">The communist government in Poland took half of the cemetery and made a steam mill out of it.</span> <span id="s1821">The people weren't even laying there for...for 20 years.</span> <span id="s1822">They already decided to...to liquidate the cemetery and make a steam mill out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: The one thing.</span> <span id="s1824">The more I hear, the less I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: I can't understand either.</span> <span id="s1826">I can't understand.</span> <span id="s1827">I'm asking a question.</span> <span id="s1828">Who do I'm asking a question.</span> <span id="s1829">Why?</span> <span id="s1830">Why?</span> <span id="s1831">I'm compassion.</span> <span id="s1832">I see people now.</span> <span id="s1833">I see somebody has a problem.</span> <span id="s1834">I always used to stop on the road to help as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1835">I never walked away from something.</span> <span id="s1836">I see an accident or something.</span> <span id="s1837">I always help.</span> <span id="s1838">Now that I wanted to be a hero.</span> <span id="s1839">That's in me.</span> <span id="s1840">That's in me.</span> <span id="s1841">That's part of my life.</span> <span id="s1842">That's in me.</span> <span id="s1843">I do things now.</span> <span id="s1844">I go out of my way for people.</span> <span id="s1845">I'm not looking for money.</span> <span id="s1846">Money's not everything.</span> <span id="s1847">I have enough to live on.</span> <span id="s1848">How much do I need?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1850">CONCLUSION OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
