born, and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was born -- I am Rose.</span> <span id="s23">My name, that’s f -- after my husband, but my maiden name was Luft, L-u-f-t.</span> <span id="s24">And then I -- I married, and my -- my name and my children’s name are Szyjewicz, S-z-y-j-e-w-i-c-z.</span> <span id="s25">Very hard to pronounce, a -- but that’s a Polish name.</span> <span id="s26">And then I married a second time, in -- in -- in Los Angeles in 1970 -- ’70, and in Vienna annulled the marriage after a year, and -- but I carry the second husband’s name because the other one was very hard to pronounce, so I changed the name, not the -- nothing else, not because of anything else.</span> <span id="s27">So I keep that name.</span> <span id="s28">And I was born in Poland, in a -- in a c-city near la -- Lublin.</span> <span id="s29">It was -- is Zamusht, and -- and I was the middle daughter, sister, ar -- mine two sisters and I am there in the middle.</span> <span id="s30">And I was left after the war, and my father -- with my father and brother, but we were -- we didn’t know about each other.</span> <span id="s31">My father was as a Gentile in L’viv -- Lemberg, and my brother was there too, Oss Bridotsky, and an -- an -- on Irish paper, and I found them after a year and a half after the war, through friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Before we go on, l-let me just say that you have been through a lot of different places.</span> <span id="s33">First you survived the ghetto in your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: That’s where your first little girl died, Margaret.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Then you went to the concentration camp in Poland, Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And then you survived two years, almost, of Auschwitz-Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And then came -- also in Poland, and then came Ravensbrück, for a short time in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And after that --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Meyerhoff</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: [indecipherable] Meyerhoff, that was a sub -- subcamp, I believe of rosen -- of Ravensbrück, also in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">For a -- over a year, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Yes, it was for mor -- for over a year.</span> <span id="s49">What -- when y -- when you think about this, and -- what -- what -- what do you think got you --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I need --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s52">You need your glasses?</span> <span id="s53">Okay.</span> <span id="s54">We’ll just stop before I ask the question --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: We’ll just stop for one second.</span> <span id="s57">So we just got an -- a tissue.</span> <span id="s58">So, my -- my qu -- my first question is that -- what do you think got you through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: God.</span> <span id="s60">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s61">I think you had to be -- or God, or lucky, or my parents, my mother, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s62">Because she came to me, I think you s -- you saw, in -- in my dream, and -- and -- and she was taking care of me.</span> <span id="s63">She didn’t let me run, and she said, “Because you are going to get killed.</span> <span id="s64">Just wait, and -- and do what they tell you to do.”</span> <span id="s65">And I -- maybe she was my angel, watching over me, because I was -- you know, like you see, I’m small, and I was very thin that I -- I -- I -- and I -- if I told somebody that I was married and I had a child, they didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s66">Because you know, like when you see a big, strong person, and he went through hell, maybe he was strong.</span> <span id="s67">I wasn’t strong, and I -- now I’m tough.</span> <span id="s68">I wasn’t tough that time, but somehow -- you know with friends, they helped me, she made from garbage peels with sand, soups, and -- and a friend of mine, and she woke me up to -- to eat it.</span> <span id="s69">You know, that -- because I wasn’t that organizer, to know how to survive.</span> <span id="s70">But somehow I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have a strong will to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No.</span> <span id="s73">Not at all, I just had a -- had a wish, that I had three uncles in the United States, and I said maybe someday I go to America.</span> <span id="s74">And I had a wish to die, or to live, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s75">To -- why don’t other countries bombard this -- this hell, to kill us all, but that w-would be to save our misery.</span> <span id="s76">But nobody came, and nobody bombed our -- bombard our -- our c -- camps.</span> <span id="s77">And maybe I -- we -- that hope that somebody will come and kill us, maybe that kept me alive, because you know, I saw how my girlfriends were dying of -- I -- you know what durpol is?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Yeah, it’s diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Diarrhea.</span> <span id="s80">And -- and they -- they were dying of malaria, and -- and a -- I don’t know, I didn’t have diarrhea, because I was constipated before the war, so I had -- th -- I-I survived.</span> <span id="s81">So that’s -- that’s all what -- I saw how they dying, in the -- in the mud, in the dirt, and how they throw those bodies on those wagons, and -- or in taking them to the -- to the con -- to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s82">So I wished not to be throw in like this, because my little girl was throw in like this, and I never know where she’s buried, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So what happened when you were really -- when you were finally liberated?</span> <span id="s84">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: When I --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Wh-Where were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: In ma -- in Meyerhof.</span> <span id="s88">They -- they -- you know, we were from one camp to the other, we were sended.</span> <span id="s89">And then I wind up in Meyerhof, and when I came to Meyerhof, the -- the sh -- the shtuber -- the -- the ous -- our -- ous -- what do you call it, the offsagerand, the -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: The guards [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: The ga -- no, the -- the most -- she was the boss over the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: The SS woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah, the SS woman.</span> <span id="s94">She was looking for somebody to -- for a beautician, and I was very good, you know, with what?</span> <span id="s95">With fingers, to make those wave for the fing -- what -- water and fingers, and I used to --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: It’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: -- know how -- no, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: -- just water, and with my fingers.</span> <span id="s100">And I used to make the waves that way.</span> <span id="s101">The children, the -- the girls, we didn’t have hair, but whatever grew back, I used to -- to do that, you know, put the -- so they said, one girl said, “I know who can do that.</span> <span id="s102">She can do.”</span> <span id="s103">And she took me [indecipherable] beautician.</span> <span id="s104">Just with wa -- cold water, and -- and -- and fingers, that’s all.</span> <span id="s105">So she put me to the shell command -- shell coo -- couran.</span> <span id="s106">She’s -- she -- kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: To the kitchen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s109">Ah -- to -- to peel potatoes, but she didn’t like my hands, how they looked, so she said, I am going to make you a cook, because you are working for my hair, and I want your hands to be clean.</span> <span id="s110">So that’s what I di -- I became a c -- a cook.</span> <span id="s111">What is the cook?</span> <span id="s112">Just to throw whatever they gave you, the -- that horse’s meat, and th-the -- and the bones, and the -- the bad leaves of cabbage, and what they threw out, and -- and that was the soup.</span> <span id="s113">And -- and a -- and a margar -- margarine, you know?</span> <span id="s114">That’s all.</span> <span id="s115">So -- but it was I was a c -- I was a cook.</span> <span id="s116">And -- and the hands weren’t so bad.</span> <span id="s117">So the -- sometimes the oafs -- alfsarins ask the -- the block -- the -- the -- the -- not the block, the -- the a -- she was the head of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Of the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, of the whole -- of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s120">So they ask her if they -- I ca -- can come to them.</span> <span id="s121">And it wa -- a few of them was very nice, because they weren’t SS women, they were women who used to work in factories, German women, factory women, because they didn’t have enough people to watch so many -- so many concentration camps.</span> <span id="s122">So they used to ask her a favor, to lend me to them, they -- they wanted me to like -- to clean the house, and to make the hair.</span> <span id="s123">So she sometimes said okay.</span> <span id="s124">So I had a few very nice ones.</span> <span id="s125">She used -- I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s126">She used to say, “Lie down on my bed, and I’m going to lie near you, and tell me about your life.”</span> <span id="s127">And she was very nice.</span> <span id="s128">And another one was the alfsarin of the kitchen, and she used to say to me, “E -- are you going to kill me after the war is ended?”</span> <span id="s129">And I said, “No, you my angel.”</span> <span id="s130">You -- she -- she used to give me a little margarine, and a -- and -- and she -- and she knew I have a little boy, not mine.</span> <span id="s131">A doctor’s wife was there, the doctor was killed already and they were doctor and she had the little boy, and the name, his name was Olish Umshwike.</span> <span id="s132">They were from lot -- from Lemberg, and -- and he was the only child in -- in -- in the camp.</span> <span id="s133">And -- and I use -- and he used to be on the block first, where I was, and I used to help that baby, a boy, he was nine years old, a lot.</span> <span id="s134">He made me m-miffin -- ma -- gloves --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: [indecipherable] gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: But you know, with all the fingers, by himself, from old sweaters.</span> <span id="s137">And in -- he used to say, “If I’m -- e -- I’m going to live, you’re going to be my second mother, because you’re my mother, you helping me a lot.</span> <span id="s138">So I used to tell that alfsarin that I have a little boy in the -- in -- in the block, and I like to give him a little margarine, and some sugar, and you know, help, because he is a very delicate little guy.</span> <span id="s139">So she used to say, “I didn’t see.</span> <span id="s140">I don’t see.”</span> <span id="s141">And I used to put it in my pants, in my panties, or between my legs, and I used to walk out with it, and I used to help that little boy.</span> <span id="s142">And I never forgot his name.</span> <span id="s143">Can you imagine how many times, and I remember exactly his name.</span> <span id="s144">Then came the -- then one day, you know, I -- I knew that his mother was very sick, and what happened to that little boy, I never found out.</span> <span id="s145">But there, all of a sudden one day, after I was there maybe a year, and we saw American soldiers with trucks, coming to the forner, you know, to the front.</span> <span id="s146">And -- and they used to go into the office, and we didn’t know what -- who they are, even.</span> <span id="s147">And they had, I -- I -- I guess you heard about Bernadot.</span> <span id="s148">The her -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: T-Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: This is -- he was from the Red Cross, and he was a prince from Sweden, and his name was Bernadot, and he used to exchange prisoners of war for pr -- for us, and they used to give one of us for a hundred prisoners of war, Germans.</span> <span id="s151">And it came to they gave the permission, to take t -- the 11 block, no more, and I was in the first, and I was the lucky one, that I -- and my girlfriend, who used to live here in the United States, in Scranton, she lived through, too.</span> <span id="s152">And -- Hannah Foorer her name was.</span> <span id="s153">And she was in the 11 block, and she couldn’t come with me.</span> <span id="s154">We were very close.</span> <span id="s155">She used to be my -- my best friend, and my confidant in everything.</span> <span id="s156">And in -- so I adore her, and she left there, and they told us, after a whole day pre-preparations there in the -- in the offices, they told us that we are going to the freedom, but they don’t know how many of us, and they gave us UNRRA packages, and they told us not to eat too much, because we going to get sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Were they in uniform, or were they in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Unifor -- uni -- uniform, uniform, but all the trucks had on top red crosses.</span> <span id="s159">They were big trucks, and so I -- they -- they came in, and everybody was pushing in, but they had a list, who is where, you know?</span> <span id="s160">So they called our names, and they told us to go out of the -- we were closed in -- in -- you know, in -- open -- they opened the doors for us to go to the freedom.</span> <span id="s161">That wasn’t freedom, really, but we -- the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s162">It was about -- it was about we -- the -- the end of the war came about the 15th of May, and this was in April, something a month before that.</span> <span id="s163">So they ex -- that was the exchange, and they gave us the UNRRA packages, and they were very, very nice to us, the -- the Americans.</span> <span id="s164">They put their hands under our feet to put us to the trucks, and we didn’t understand one word what they saying, and we -- we talked, you know, all German or -- or Polish, or what else?</span> <span id="s165">So -- but they said, “It’s okay, it’s okay.”</span> <span id="s166">And -- and they said, “No more, no, no, no, no.”</span> <span id="s167">So we knew that -- not to eat any more, just a little bit, but we were very hungry, of course you want to eat.</span> <span id="s168">They gave us chocolates, and I don’t remember what, and cheeses, and -- and things what we didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: But they knew you would get sick if you ate too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes, so they told us not to eat too much, and they -- and we were 40 in a truck.</span> <span id="s171">They load us -- l -- they load in a truck of 40 in -- it -- that took a whole -- a whole day, and that was the next day that we -- we were freed to go out the gates, but the Germans were watching who was going -- who was going out, with papers, with everything.</span> <span id="s172">So it was very -- a tragic moment, even we went for the freedom.</span> <span id="s173">We left our friends there, we left -- we didn’t know what’s going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s174">But it -- in one way it was tragic, in one w -- way it was freedom.</span> <span id="s175">And -- and we saw [indecipherable] you see we free to the birds, we talking.</span> <span id="s176">And I -- and we -- we used to say we free like you.</span> <span id="s177">Or a dog, we free like you, we -- we -- and they said, “Now, where you out of that -- of those ca-cages, you have the right to spit at them,” -- the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s178">“You can spit, you can throw whatever you want on them, and they have no right to s -- to e -- e -- seek you any more.</span> <span id="s179">You are in our hands.”</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s182">We were glad we out.</span> <span id="s183">We just say -- said to him, you know, like go to hell, or you -- you -- I -- I don’t even remember what we said.</span> <span id="s184">We said you -- you Nazis you -- you -- you killers, you everything.</span> <span id="s185">And some weren’t even Nazis, some were soldiers, taken there to -- to watch us -- watchmen.</span> <span id="s186">And they were afraid of their own skin, they said -- yeah, that’s true.</span> <span id="s187">Not all of them were -- were too bad, because before, when they came into our -- to our country in 1931, that was a lot of Wehrmarkt soldiers were very nice.</span> <span id="s188">One even send me a letter from the front, without the address, and he col -- he said to -- he wrote me, “Mine lieber Rosamunda,” and “I liebelish, and I’m never going to forget you.”</span> <span id="s189">And I just talked to him -- I didn’t even before, you know, like on the street, and they came into our business or something, and -- and they talked, they were nice people.</span> <span id="s190">They came to our house to say m-mutti you have dry hipshin , the orders, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Like credit orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah, and they -- my mother used to make them coffee, and -- because they were mer -- Wehrmarkt, the SS wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s193">And they were very nice people, they came to rob us, but when they saw three hipsha girls, they didn’t take from us nothing, they brought us food, okay?</span> <span id="s194">That’s the truth.</span> <span id="s195">What the truth is, it’s the truth, but not -- it was one in a million, okay?</span> <span id="s196">So the -- that’s not -- that wasn’t enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: The -- the Americans on the truck when they took you out --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did they speak, eventually, through a translator to you, so that you could understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No, no, we just understand un -- un -- you know, l-like dumb lag -- language, you know, like mute language, and they -- they took us up, and we went -- they took 40 trucks out, because in each truck was 40 people, and they had 11 -- 11 bro -- blocks, just the right to take out, because they didn’t have enough gifangyenna to change for the others, so they --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: P.O.W.’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Prisoners, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah, the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s205">So they exchange th -- so much, and so much, and they -- and we start leaving.</span> <span id="s206">It was a lot of crying, and a lot of happiness, and a lot of cursing, you know?</span> <span id="s207">It was.</span> <span id="s208">But we went out, and they were going.</span> <span id="s209">That was in middle of the night.</span> <span id="s210">And we were going, and we asked them where are you going?</span> <span id="s211">They said, now it’s Essen, now it’s this, you know?</span> <span id="s212">It’s -- it’s -- they told us -- that’s -- th-the towns, but I don’t remember really.</span> <span id="s213">I remember Essen, because it was food.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Essen is the German word for eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And it’s a city, the name of a city, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: That’s right, and the name of a city, and Essen I know.</span> <span id="s218">If ort -- I know German -- I knew German that time, and I -- I s -- I promised myself that I’m never going to talk Germ -- speak German, and I never did, you know, I -- I spoke beautiful Swedish, and I don’t, because you don’t use the language.</span> <span id="s219">So we di -- we were d -- going, and they were telling us where we going, we can -- came about -- I don’t know how many kilometers from Denmark, and they start shooting us from the -- our trucks, with a red cross on top, big huge.</span> <span id="s220">The airplanes were very low, the Germans, and they were shooting on our trucks.</span> <span id="s221">So the -- the Americans said, “Fast, fast.”</span> <span id="s222">They didn’t know, but they said, “Go on, go on.”</span> <span id="s223">And to -- to hide in the ditches.</span> <span id="s224">In -- y-you okay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Oh yeah, don’t worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: In -- in -- to -- to -- to go into the ditches and hide.</span> <span id="s227">But they were shooting anyway.</span> <span id="s228">So we had -- it was in nowhere, almost in nowhere, in -- it was a little maybe farmer’s little town.</span> <span id="s229">So we saw a house, a farmer’s house, and s -- and I was with them to run into that building, and you know, they said, “Juden arous.”</span> <span id="s230">They said that they didn’t know about anything now, they say.</span> <span id="s231">They didn’t know, nobody knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s232">Even in a little heck -- hick town.</span> <span id="s233">I don’t even know where it was, they didn’t let us into the building.</span> <span id="s234">They said, “Juden -- farfluked de Juden, rouss.”</span> <span id="s235">That’s all.</span> <span id="s236">Because we were still with the u -- with the -- the -- the uniforms and everything.</span> <span id="s237">And -- and dirty, and -- and you know.</span> <span id="s238">So they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s239">So the -- the ge -- the American soldiers told us to wait out in the ditches, til it’s going to -- til they’re going to leave, and fast to run into the woods.</span> <span id="s240">And through the woods we went, not with the -- but with the -- about three days we walked to -- to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: You walked to Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: To the Denmark, with -- wi -- through the woods, because we didn’t have another way.</span> <span id="s243">In the woods, they said it’s trees, they not going to see us.</span> <span id="s244">So that’s -- I don’t know, it may be two days, may be three day -- it -- it’s a long time you walked and walked, and they used to say to sit down, and -- and rest, and we came into Denmark.</span> <span id="s245">Before we came into Denmark, they said no speak bad German.</span> <span id="s246">No bad German, you know?</span> <span id="s247">Because in -- in Denmark it’s a lot of spice, shpionin.</span> <span id="s248">Okay?</span> <span id="s249">So we didn’t talk about Germans, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s250">When we came into Denmark, they took us in like we were -- we were queens and kings.</span> <span id="s251">They were so good to us, that I say that they are the nicest people in the world, til today.</span> <span id="s252">Sweden was very good to us, too, very good, but not comparing to the -- to the -- to the Denmark people, because they had the Germans there, and they knew how we suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Who -- who received you in Denmark, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: People.</span> <span id="s255">People did, the mayor, and people.</span> <span id="s256">They took us into -- to like s --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s259">.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: I think maybe we have to go to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Rose Warner.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rose Warner.</span> <span id="s265">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s266">So let me just restate the question.</span> <span id="s267">Who were the first people you encountered in Denmark?</span> <span id="s268">Were they Red Cross, or were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: They must be with Red Cross, because they were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s270">So it means that in that little town, I don’t even know the name of it, because you know, you came out from hell, and you came into heaven, okay?</span> <span id="s271">Heaven.</span> <span id="s272">They were waiting with white clothes on them, and -- and -- and -- and -- and greeting us with so much love, and so much attention, and with flowers, and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s273">And -- and they were in -- but we had like stables there, because they didn’t have so much place.</span> <span id="s274">So they -- they put new straw in the stables, and -- and -- and we -- and they made tables on the streets there, for us to dine, to eat.</span> <span id="s275">And they didn’t give y -- us too much, because they said -- they -- they spoke German, so they said not to eat too much because we going to get very sick, and we going to have to go to the -- to -- to the Riviera -- the Rivera -- the -- you know, the -- th-the hospital, because you going to get sick to our stomachs, and our stomachs are not used to those -- the food, and it’s different than -- than in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What did you eat then?</span> <span id="s277">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s278">What did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: They gave us I don’t know, but they told us don’t take seconds, please not to take seconds, because a lot of them did, and a lot of them got sick, and a lot of them died.</span> <span id="s280">That’s the truth.</span> <span id="s281">Because you know, you couldn’t get enough of it.</span> <span id="s282">We -- there, we had -- if I found a potato in the ground when we went to work, I was their -- I was their commando, and so -- and I ate the -- that tomato -- the potato I mean, with a little -- nothing on it, and with nothing -- with the sand, with the -- I said, “This is going to be mine dessert, where -- if I am going to live through that.”</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Just enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: A potato.</span> <span id="s285">Even dirty.</span> <span id="s286">Okay, that is going to be a dessert.</span> <span id="s287">An after dinner, if you going to have dinner, because it tastes so good.</span> <span id="s288">So whatever they gave us, it was delicious.</span> <span id="s289">So I don’t remember, it’s so many years ago, with -- to remember what they gave us.</span> <span id="s290">They gave us very good food, and they begged us not to eat too much.</span> <span id="s291">No seconds, no seconds.</span> <span id="s292">I-In -- in -- and so we didn -- a -- I -- I was listening to them because I was never a big eater.</span> <span id="s293">You can see me now.</span> <span id="s294">I am not a big eater, I can eat a piece of bread and I wa -- had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: You’re a petite person.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s297">I didn’t -- I didn’t eat that -- now I -- I -- I gained weight, because I can work so much, but I was walking with -- with weights in my hand, and I was walking I -- I never gained a pound.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Power walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s300">I walked a day, I -- here.</span> <span id="s301">An hour, fast, that I came home I had to take a shower, or I was wet, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did they tell you in Denmark what would happen at that time?</span> <span id="s303">Did you still know -- not know what was to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No.</span> <span id="s305">They said, “You going to be here for awhile,” and we going away to Sweden.</span> <span id="s306">But by -- by a boat.</span> <span id="s307">But in meantime we here, and they took a -- th-the best care in my life, except my home.</span> <span id="s308">In a -- they -- they gave us clean clothes, something to -- to -- to -- to throw -- they -- not exactly, because in Sweden they changed everything, but there, whatever somebody could bring, they brought us.</span> <span id="s309">And they -- and then, about two weeks later, it was maybe two, maybe a little more, I don’t -- ab -- it’s about two weeks.</span> <span id="s310">It was raining, terrible raining, they took us to the Bunhoff, to go to a -- to -- to the -- to the mem -- i-it was waiting for us, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: The train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: -- the -- the tr -- no, th-the -- not the train.</span> <span id="s313">They took us with a train there, to the boats.</span> <span id="s314">It’s a boat.</span> <span id="s315">24 hours just right.</span> <span id="s316">But they were -- it was pouring that day, this I never going to forget.</span> <span id="s317">And all the town, and around the town, came with flowers in their hands, and they were hugging us, and telling us good luck, and good luck in wherever you go.</span> <span id="s318">And they cried, and we went.</span> <span id="s319">We went to Sweden, 24 hours ride, and I am very -- I can’t go by ocean.</span> <span id="s320">I -- I was sick.</span> <span id="s321">I -- I am always seasick.</span> <span id="s322">I’m no -- even here.</span> <span id="s323">My friend had a boat, from -- from what do you call it, the -- the other boats are standing and -- and -- doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s324">A few miles, I can’t go by.</span> <span id="s325">So he used to give me pills to -- to -- to -- to -- didn’t help me.</span> <span id="s326">Even my son, who is now here, he used to throw up, too.</span> <span id="s327">It’s just from Marina Del Ray, til Santa Monica, I couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s328">I couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s329">So, you see -- and that was 24 hours, I was very sick, I didn’t see the ocean, I didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s330">But, I came to Sweden.</span> <span id="s331">We came to Mulmay, Sweden.</span> <span id="s332">They were there, it was prepared for us, big buildings with mattresses, wide.</span> <span id="s333">Can you imagine how a sheet on a mattress, a sheet, a white sheet.</span> <span id="s334">That was something I didn’t see for five years.</span> <span id="s335">In -- and they told us to throw away the lump -- lumpa -- th-the -- the -- the junk, the dirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: The lice, and everything, and they put -- they gave us something to wear, in -- you know, like a -- a sheet over us.</span> <span id="s338">And in the morning, we -- that was -- we -- when we came in, it was there at night, too.</span> <span id="s339">We had everything.</span> <span id="s340">They gave us something very light to eat, and a -- it was written, you know, in Swedish, on the walls, what -- to something forbidden, for -- so -- but it’s forbidden for Jude.</span> <span id="s341">No, you -- wait a minute, not Jude, something that it came out Jude.</span> <span id="s342">For Bude.</span> <span id="s343">Something, you know?</span> <span id="s344">So we didn’t understand, and I said, “Oh my God, we are Juden -- Jude here, too.”</span> <span id="s345">They said, “No, it’s just we -- that’s our language mixed with German.”</span> <span id="s346">So -- but they -- they were very -- then, the next day, they took us almost na -- with sheets on -- on our -- on us, they took us to department store, and they dressed us from bottom to top, even bras, what we didn’t wear for years, bras, and panties, and -- and -- and -- and dresses, and shoes, and socks, and -- and -- and from the underwear to a dress in our coats, okay?</span> <span id="s347">I took a brown coat, I remember that fit me.</span> <span id="s348">You had to take what they gave us to try on.</span> <span id="s349">What fits you, not just they gave you clothes, no.</span> <span id="s350">You tried on to fit.</span> <span id="s351">And that’s what we went -- we went a few -- we went back to Mulmay with the clothes.</span> <span id="s352">Can you imagine we looked like people, and we were dressed clean, with no lice, with no nothing.</span> <span id="s353">We would -- about I -- I personally didn’t have lice, I worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s354">I was clean.</span> <span id="s355">I didn’t have the beautif -- the -- the clothes what they gave us there.</span> <span id="s356">To me, that time, it was beautiful, with boots, high, high boots, because it -- it’s winter there, you know.</span> <span id="s357">It’s cold.</span> <span id="s358">Later on they took us to a very cold -- to -- to the -- to the south, and it was very cold there, a -- in Malhoffs, it was -- no, Mulmay, it was there, and we went to -- to -- oh, not -- I have a book.</span> <span id="s359">Can I --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: -- stop a minute, a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: You can stop for a second to look for the -- the name of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yeah, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Look, it’s -- it’s -- I -- I changed my name when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Rose, can you -- can you say that into the microphone [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So -- so you found the book where it says --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s370">Yeah, I found the book where it says where I -- I -- I remind myself before I found the book, but I have -- and that was in Norchepink, in -- in Veewar, in a quarantine, okay?</span> <span id="s371">In Norchepink.</span> <span id="s372">See?</span> <span id="s373">And -- and there I was with them, with this family.</span> <span id="s374">They adopted me later.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Carl Gustaf Johnson.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Carl Gustaf, yeah.</span> <span id="s379">And -- and -- and sh -- and her name was -- what’s was his name -- her name?</span> <span id="s380">Doesn’t matter, she thought I -- we were in a -- in a quarantine with a kitchen.</span> <span id="s381">They gave us ea -- a few of us, you know, l-lived together in a room, and they -- they cooked.</span> <span id="s382">We had like a -- a dinner time, and a breakfast time, and around that place was a beautiful lake, and you could swim in the lake, and I -- we didn’t have anything to -- to swim in, we were naked, swimming naked.</span> <span id="s383">It was only girls.</span> <span id="s384">And -- and in the side was beautiful forests, and we used to go to -- into the forest naked.</span> <span id="s385">And then th-the boys found out what there are girls swimming naked.</span> <span id="s386">So they used to come with little boats, boating there, and -- and we didn’t care because the Germans saw -- saw us all naked.</span> <span id="s387">But it still, you know, somebody i-in a different country, they see us.</span> <span id="s388">So we were sitting in the water, we didn’t want to get -- or we run to the -- to the forest.</span> <span id="s389">So -- and that was for months we were there, about a half a year in there.</span> <span id="s390">And we were fed very, very well, very good, e -- but every Sunday, people from Lunde, the sta -- the -- the big -- the bigger city, they used to come and look at us like -- and -- and from Norchepink, and from everywhere, look at us like monkeys in a cage, because we were something to them like they never saw.</span> <span id="s391">Like -- not animals, really, we were people to them, but we were like a wonder from -- like aliens from another world, because they never saw concentration camp people.</span> <span id="s392">They never knew -- they knew it’s going -- what’s going on some, but they didn’t see people with numbers in -- in -- in the people l-l-like we were -- I wasn’t, but that wa -- a lot of them were terrible wild, and terrible -- you know, from little towns from -- in Poland, or from Germany, they didn’t -- they didn’t know how to behave, they didn’t know -- they were like animals really.</span> <span id="s393">And so they used to come and look at us, at the zoo.</span> <span id="s394">A zoo.</span> <span id="s395">I-I’m telling you, it was all kind of monkeys in the zoo.</span> <span id="s396">So, a couple came to the -- to the -- the -- we were -- you know, like in separate, but you could see from the other side, like they were -- they made like -- how you call it, you know, separate us from -- but you could see through the --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: [indecipherable] fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Fences, but you can see -- tin fences like in -- like -- more like in cages, not fen -- you know, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Sort of mesh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Mesh, yeah, that’s right, that they could see us through the wire.</span> <span id="s401">And -- and they were in -- used to come and -- and look at us, and -- and really -- and we said, “Oh mine God, they think that we have horns, or they think we -- we not people like other people.”</span> <span id="s402">But they nice people, they -- they want to help.</span> <span id="s403">So we -- th-they -- we ca -- we came th -- a couple, like Carl Gustaf, and his wife, what’s her name, and -- hm, I -- I’m going to remind myself.</span> <span id="s404">They came, and they never had children, he was younger than she, and -- and they were -- he was very beautiful, and very tall, and he used to have eyelashes, l-l-like -- l-like not -- I never saw in my life.</span> <span id="s405">He was so gorgeous.</span> <span id="s406">Gunn.</span> <span id="s407">Carl Gustaf and Gunn, her name was.</span> <span id="s408">And -- and they used to look us through, and they saw me, and they called me closer, and they asked me in German, they spoke German -- he was an engineer, and she was a -- a -- working in a -- in a office someplace, and -- and they were asking me where I am from, and they ta -- ta -- ask me all kind of questions, and they say, “I see you next time,” and they left.</span> <span id="s409">And next Sunday they came again, and she said, “Do you -- how you swim in that water?”</span> <span id="s410">And I said, “Naked,” you know.</span> <span id="s411">So she said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s412">And -- and the third time she brought me a beautiful -- I have a picture in that -- a green bathing suit, to bathe in the bathing suit.</span> <span id="s413">And she ask me, and he, if they can adopt me.</span> <span id="s414">And I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s415">So, that has to take a few months, three months for the papers to -- a passport, to get a passport, and I had to be so much -- at least three months in the quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Why did you say of course?</span> <span id="s417">You -- you didn’t know if your father, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: I didn’t know what is better.</span> <span id="s419">No, I didn’t know, I -- I’m going to be free, I am not going to be in a quarantine like a monkey.</span> <span id="s420">I am going to be free.</span> <span id="s421">A-And -- and they seemed nice people, very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s422">And not adopt me, adopt me -- adoption papers, but they could make me -- they took me off.</span> <span id="s423">They are responsible for me, okay?</span> <span id="s424">That doesn’t mean adopt me forever.</span> <span id="s425">But they adopted me for the time being, to be with them, to live with them, and they make me a passport.</span> <span id="s426">So they made a passport for me, and they -- in meantime, they made one room for -- they furnished a room special for me.</span> <span id="s427">A beautiful room.</span> <span id="s428">And they make a bi -- made a big party when they -- I had to go to them, and they invited a lot of people, family and people, and it was the nicest party I remember for a -- for many years.</span> <span id="s429">And I -- and they were asking questions, all of those people, and I was answering.</span> <span id="s430">And they brought me beautiful clothes, and beautiful -- and he ask me -- he was an engineer in spinnerai fabric.</span> <span id="s431">You know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Yes, spinning wool?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Wool -- not wool, thread.</span> <span id="s434">And he said if I want to go to work, and they going to pay me 75 liras -- krona a day -- a -- a we -- a week.</span> <span id="s435">I said, “I don’t know what that is, but I -- of course I go.”</span> <span id="s436">And in that book, I -- he went -- lived with my girlfriend, and we used to, you know, how man -- how much money we used to spend for the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s438">Can you -- can you read just a few examples of --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yeah, like -- like potatoes, a dol -- a -- a -- a lir --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Krona?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: -- of krona.</span> <span id="s442">A big -- a lot of potatoes, or club soda, you know, for -- for 15 [indecipherable] -- five -- and things like bread for 50 liras -- krona -- not krona, 50 -- it’s -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the change, called -- a krona was a hundred of the cents, you know, like -- anyway, things like this add up, and we both shared.</span> <span id="s443">Later, not before, but when I was with them, they supported me completely.</span> <span id="s444">They took me to parties, and they took me to the movies, and they took me everywhere, til he -- I got back to my -- I -- I looked like a person.</span> <span id="s445">This is when I came out of Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: A few years later, yeah.</span> <span id="s448">That’s the way, I-I -- even that material I bought in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: What -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Y-You were 27 --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, I was about, yeah 25, something like it, yeah.</span> <span id="s453">And so I -- i-in the gro -- and the hair grew back, and -- and I looked already like a person.</span> <span id="s454">So he start -- I think getting too close to comfort.</span> <span id="s455">I was working in the -- in -- in the spinnerai fabric, and -- and they all knew he is my father, you know.</span> <span id="s456">Carl Gustaf is my father, he treat me like a child, and -- and -- and -- and I looked like a child, believe me.</span> <span id="s457">And so he -- so he was very good to me, and she was very good to me, and I loved Gunn very, very much.</span> <span id="s458">And they didn’t have children.</span> <span id="s459">He -- he saw me -- I -- and she was in the 40’s, you know?</span> <span id="s460">He saw a young woman, a young girl, and he used to sit on my bed when I went to -- to sleep, and talk to me.</span> <span id="s461">And I spoke already Swedish.</span> <span id="s462">It -- it was very easy for me to learn Swedish, I was very good in Swedish.</span> <span id="s463">And that time -- everything is easy when you’re young.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you tell him about, or did he ask you about what -- what happened to you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh yes, we -- we -- we -- we talked by the table, but on the -- on the bed, he came to say goodnight to me, you know, and -- and I thought that he is giving me the looks, and -- and I didn’t want to hurt Gunn.</span> <span id="s466">And I saw it’s too -- too much fo-for a man to sit on a woman’s bed when I go to sleep.</span> <span id="s467">I didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s468">So -- but I didn’t say -- they were very, very good to me.</span> <span id="s469">But one day I said, “Gunn, I am going to go with my good friend, we going to rent a little apartment.</span> <span id="s470">And she is working, and I am working, and we going to make a living.</span> <span id="s471">I am going to come to visit you.”</span> <span id="s472">I have their pictures and everything.</span> <span id="s473">Beautiful pictures, hi -- their wedding pictures, and -- and how they -- th-they -- really it’s -- it’s -- and -- but I had -- and I ha -- I met a guy, a Polish engineer there, Pierkel, and he even wrote me a beautiful poem when I was leaving, and he said to me, “If you not comfortable there, I find you another family.</span> <span id="s474">They don’t have children, and they are not so fancy, and they are not so -- and -- and -- you know -- they -- and she i -- has a beauty shop.</span> <span id="s475">And he is working someplace else,” I think something -- I don’t know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s476">He was so good to me, he was -- he was washing my underwear there, and I did -- I lived with them only in the daytime.</span> <span id="s477">And -- and they -- and I used to smoke cigarettes after the war -- in -- before the war, and after I was 16, and I smoked cigarettes at home.</span> <span id="s478">My mother didn’t know, she would kill me, but I smoked cigarettes because I, you know, boys and girls and school, and oh, why don’t you have one, and just -- and just, you know, don’t just let the -- them -- the -- them -- the smoke go, just -- just take it in --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Inhale?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: -- inhale it, and you going to feel

it’s that -- that -- that’s what I was reading.</span> <span id="s643">It’s when I was Jewish and -- and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s644">When I was a ma -- a little child, my mother gave -- breast feeded me, and she was singing to me, and she was -- she was a -- a -- happy, and -- and then you -- you -- you are a beautif -- you -- you -- even people want very rich, they bought new dresses for the children.</span> <span id="s645">You went out and the -- the -- the stones were throwing on you, and they said, “Jew, what are you so dressed nice?</span> <span id="s646">B-B-Because we going to -- we going to throw on you those stones, so what are you dressing so nice?</span> <span id="s647">And what are you -- what did you come on this world, because we should -- we should punish you for that, that you came on this world.”</span> <span id="s648">And it’s mun -- many more, it’s a long story, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Well, we’ll give a copy of it to the museum, so anybody who listens and is interested, can -- can look up with the -- the full text.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So -- so you had time, and the emotions came out, and you wrote it down in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: In Sweden, because we didn’t -- I can’t see with the glasses, we -- we are -- in Sweden we had a lot of times, sitting in -- in the -- in the quarantine, and we were coming together, and girls, and we put together words, and we put together poems, and we put together our -- our lives, our sufferings, and our happiness after that, but the happiness came too late, because we lost everything precious to us.</span> <span id="s653">Not things, things you can buy for money.</span> <span id="s654">This is not pleasures.</span> <span id="s655">We -- I lost two sisters, and I lost my sister’s children, and I lost my mother, and I lost my child.</span> <span id="s656">And I lost everything and -- what -- what wor -- worth living for?</span> <span id="s657">But we are -- a person is just a person, and everybody, in no matter what situation, wants to live.</span> <span id="s658">And I don’t know if I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s659">I -- somehow I came out alive, but that’s what I lost.</span> <span id="s660">Never I forget, and I never stop crying, never.</span> <span id="s661">Because, when you look around on my old age, I am seeing, even if I have children, they -- it’s not Poland, or my city.</span> <span id="s662">It’s a -- it’s a big country, and everybody goes someplace else where they can make a living, and I stayed here, and -- and it’s not -- the children are not the children that we used to be to our parents.</span> <span id="s663">The children don’t care about their old parents.</span> <span id="s664">They do, but in a different way.</span> <span id="s665">They just try to push you into an old age home, which some are doing it, but I am not going to let happen, because I am going to eat a piece of bread without nothing on it.</span> <span id="s666">I have to want my peace and quiet, and my korern.</span> <span id="s667">And I don’t want to be with my children, because they have their lives, and I have my life.</span> <span id="s668">They don’t owe me anything, but they -- they -- I’m not a -- because I brought them on this world, they didn’t ask for it.</span> <span id="s669">But, in the other hand, I am not -- I am me, by myself, and that’s my life, and I’m taking care of myself.</span> <span id="s670">I worked very hard in my life, in the freedom.</span> <span id="s671">I was everything in the world.</span> <span id="s672">I did everything, works -- worked in factories, and work -- cleaned stairs, and worked every -- I -- the only thing I wasn’t, I wasn’t a street worker.</span> <span id="s673">Otherwise, I did everything.</span> <span id="s674">And I, since 1996, and now -- now it’s ’99, I was alone with three children, and I worked in a bakery.</span> <span id="s675">I worked everywhere, in factories, in bakeries, and I put together a penny to a penny, because I knew that some -- and I made -- I married second time in 1970, just for a few -- for a year, and I found out that my second husband was molesting his daughter, he was sleeping with his daughter, and I -- after a year, I -- we annulled the marriage.</span> <span id="s676">I didn’t want to live in a home like this.</span> <span id="s677">So I am by my ow -- on my own through 1973.</span> <span id="s678">On my own, and I make my living, and I worked 12 hours a day, taking care, when I was still young, or old people.</span> <span id="s679">And 12 hours a day with old-timers, with all kind of people, and I washed them, and I b-bathed them, and I take -- took care of them, and I loved them like mine parents.</span> <span id="s680">And I made my living, and I put a penny to a penny, and now I live on my -- I was -- when I left -- I divorced my husband, because he was no good to me.</span> <span id="s681">So I -- after I divorced him, I didn’t have nothing, only a kitchen table, and a -- and a bed -- and a -- and a folding bed from -- a few folding backs, what my landlord gave me, and I made everything with my 10 fingers.</span> <span id="s682">I worked.</span> <span id="s683">I put every -- I didn’t go for vacations, I didn’t go no place, I just went to mine s -- to -- to Canada back and forth, because I had a sick -- first my father died, then my brother was sick, and otherwise, I didn’t go for any vacations, and I made my life.</span> <span id="s684">And that’s what I’m living on, and I’m never going to let my children put me in -- in an old age home.</span> <span id="s685">I rather kill myself, because I told them, and they know, no old age home.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Rose, I -- I need to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s687">We’ll talk more about your life now, and as a development.</span> <span id="s688">I would just like to go back to Sweden [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, I -- I go back to Sweden, but because we started with this --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: So I -- now I’m going back to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And you -- you -- you did have a husband somewhere, you didn’t know what happened to him at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yes, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Your brother and your father you thought were hopefully alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I didn’t -- I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s696">I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: But you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s698">So what -- what -- what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I -- then -- then I -- I -- in Sweden, I was looking to the Red Cross, and they changed their names, so I couldn’t find any of them.</span> <span id="s700">They did -- they -- they didn’t have my maiden name.</span> <span id="s701">My father was Katanoffsky, my brother was Bridotsky.</span> <span id="s702">How could I find people with different names, belonging to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: So they -- the Red Cross lists had names on it, but were changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: But they weren’t Jews, they didn’t -- they didn’t admit that they are Jewish, they were as Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: So they had Polish names, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Polish names, and Polish papers.</span> <span id="s707">But for money, you understand?</span> <span id="s708">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: But you didn’t know this.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I didn’t -- I didn’t -- I knew, but I didn’t know that my brother changed his name, because he’s l -- was living with a lady, and he -- he took her name, and my father -- I-I-I didn’t know for whom I have to look.</span> <span id="s711">So -- but I [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay, we-we’ll stop for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: It’s my neighbor from here.</span> <span id="s714">He has to tell me -- what you saw cleaning th-th -- the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s715">He’s a Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s717">So you didn’t know the names that your [indecipherable] had taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I didn’t know who I’m -- I have to look for, so I, being young, having still my -- my brains are still good, thank God, but I -- you know, I remembered the addresses for people who I knew in school, and knew my brother’s friends, and knew my mother’s girlfriends.</span> <span id="s719">She -- she was -- she was Gentile, but I knew the -- you know, where they lived, and we used to call her -- my mother’s friend aunt, you know?</span> <span id="s720">So I know my aunts address and everything.</span> <span id="s721">So I called.</span> <span id="s722">I -- I wrote -- was writing letters to Poland, and I wrote a letter to my friend, a boyfriend in Poland, and -- and I ask him, please tell me if you saw somebody o -- from my family.</span> <span id="s723">So he -- it took -- and I call -- and I wrote to my mum -- mother’s friend, so-called my aunt, and I call -- and I re -- wrote to my brother’s friend Bias, h-he didn’t even answer me, but I called to Korba.</span> <span id="s724">He was a -- a artist -- a painter, and I called to them, and they -- my brother and father was there when they got my letter, and -- and she -- and they were dancing, and they got all drunk, i -- because my brother and father, when the war ended, they came to Gdansk -- to Danzig, a -- but -- but they came to see the friends in our town, to Zamush, very far.</span> <span id="s725">And -- and so they -- they got the letter -- she got the letter, and they were dancing, and they were crying, and they were drunk, and they -- and they wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s726">I have still a -- a few letters, I don’t -- I can’t find them now.</span> <span id="s727">And I -- and -- and my mother’s friend co -- said to me, “Drink a little water, and -- and read that letter, your father is here.</span> <span id="s728">Drink a little more wa-water, you brother is here, and drink a little more here,” -- because I got married in the war time, in 1940, “dri -- you husband is here.</span> <span id="s729">He came from Mauthausen.”</span> <span id="s730">And so I had -- they knew that I am alive, and then I wrote to my boyfriend a letter, and he, the same time, he send me a letter that he said, “I -- I got your letter in the day, what -- w-when I received your letter, was the happiest day in my life, that you are alive, and I am go -- I don’t know where your family -- the rest of the family lives, but they live by the ocean, and I don’t have the address.</span> <span id="s731">I saw them here, they came for a -- for a soccer game, and they -- and I saw them.</span> <span id="s732">I didn’t had the letter from you to tell them the news, but I -- the letter I got later, but I saw them, and I can give you a good news, that they are alive.</span> <span id="s733">Your father, you brother, and your husband.”</span> <span id="s734">And so that was how I found them.</span> <span id="s735">And after I -- they -- they -- they -- I wrote to -- they send me -- my mother’s friend gave me their address where they lived, and I wrote a letter to them, and they -- they wrote a letter to me.</span> <span id="s736">My father said to come, he is -- he wants to see me, because he can’t go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s737">That time, you have to be a Swedish citizen to be able to bring somebody to Sweden.</span> <span id="s738">So I couldn’t take them, or they had to wait, and they wanted to see me right away, and my father was writing -- reading -- writing to me that I am the only one daughter from three, who is alive, and he wants to see me right now.</span> <span id="s739">So it took a little while, a year, til I came back to Gdansk.</span> <span id="s740">And to -- to see -- to my husband, I wasn’t in love with my husband.</span> <span id="s741">I got married only in the war time to him, because he said if I’m not going to -- to my mother -- if I’m not going to marry him, he his going to go to the Germans to be killed.</span> <span id="s742">And so my mother said, “What do you have to lose?</span> <span id="s743">We going to be killed anyway, a-all of us.</span> <span id="s744">Make him happy,” and -- because he was my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s745">Not a boyfriend, he -- we ha -- he met me and he wanted to be engaged to me, but I said, “Mother, I don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s746">And she said, “Don’t -- you not losing anything.”</span> <span id="s747">So -- and I got married in 1940, and I got a -- and after we marriage, even the Gestapo came -- not g -- SS men came to my marriage, we married in the house.</span> <span id="s748">And I -- and they were still not the way they later were, and it was about 12 SS mens on my wedding, and then I had a baby.</span> <span id="s749">I -- and whi -- in the meantime, when I was pregnant, my sister was married to a doctor, and his name was Arvald, but he came from the family of the -- of th -- I-I just this minute came out of my -- mine -- and he was a doctor, a -- a ped-pediatrician, and he married her because she was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s750">And -- and when the war broke out, he [indecipherable] and when they start beating us up, and you know, th-the -- like the carpets -- th-the Oriental carpets weren’t lying on the floor, they were hanging on the wall in most of -- i-in the houses.</span> <span id="s751">So they told them to take out -- off the -- from my mother’s house -- mother’s home, th-th-the Oriental rugs, and so -- and they beat him, and my sister said, “Why do you beat my husband, he’s doing what you want.”</span> <span id="s752">And she was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s753">They both were very beautiful.</span> <span id="s754">One went in the beginning, with two children.</span> <span id="s755">But this one, she said to me, I -- I -- I -- no, we going to sleep, because we had -- i-it was already in the ghetto, and we were -- she went to the house, and she told her -- she had a maid, and she told her maid to tell my mother that they’re going to sleep.</span> <span id="s756">They didn’t went to sleep.</span> <span id="s757">He gave her a morphine shot, and he -- he took two morphine shots.</span> <span id="s758">He died, and they revived her.</span> <span id="s759">She lived only three months, and she said she’s going to Metek, to him.</span> <span id="s760">And so I lost them both.</span> <span id="s761">Then -- and -- and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s762">And after my baby was born, after his death, his name was Metek, so I called my -- my little daughter Mulgosha, and if you stop a minute --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s764">Yeah, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: End?</span></p> <p><span

-- and he -- he -- with a knife, this poem, this thing in it.</span> <span id="s802">And I had it in my head in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: And Sylvia painted it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s805">And I told her how it looked, and she painted for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: That’s very moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s808">So that’s wh --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So what -- what happened when you -- wh-when were you reunited with your father, and your brother, and your husband, and what -- what did you talk -- what were the feelings, what did you talk about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I -- I didn’t talk anything.</span> <span id="s811">I was there waiting and call -- and -- and writing to them, and they write me -- wrote me back.</span> <span id="s812">And -- and -- and my husband said, “I want you here, and I can’t wait and -- to see you.”</span> <span id="s813">And I really didn’t love my husband, but he was a husband, so h -- I didn’t even expect that he’s going to find me, and he’s going to be alive.</span> <span id="s814">I didn’t, because in Majdanek -- being in Majdanek, we were together, but not in the same places.</span> <span id="s815">So he was mellorating.</span> <span id="s816">You know what mel -- meloration?</span> <span id="s817">The water?</span> <span id="s818">That they brought the water for the flowers, to -- to -- to -- to -- yeah, and I -- and we used to work there, by the flowers in -- in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s819">So he -- I forgot to give the Germans a gold -- golden earrings with my monogram, what I had from home, and I -- and I got them in the ears.</span> <span id="s820">In Majdanek they didn’t cut our hair, so I had my long hair, and I didn’t see that I left them in my ears, because we had to give our gold and everything.</span> <span id="s821">S-So I-I -- they s -- the girls, my friends saw that I have earrings in my ears, and they said they -- they going to kill you.</span> <span id="s822">So I took them off, and I c-cut a piece of my ni -- whatever I wore underneath in the dress -- oh, pants, I don’t know what I wore there, what they gave us, and I put them -- and I had still my home shoes, I only took off the -- the high heels.</span> <span id="s823">So I was walking like this, but I put them in my toes, one and in the other one o -- of each toe -- by each toe.</span> <span id="s824">And when my husband used to work someplace else, but he used to change with somebody to see me from far.</span> <span id="s825">And he was carrying the water, and I was working so, by the flowers, so I gave him this in his hand.</span> <span id="s826">And -- and that’s all I saw of him.</span> <span id="s827">And I never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So when -- when did you go to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, when he -- he was working to make for the Germans in -- in -- it was Scarjisk in Poland, a city, they were making yellow to sh -- for the -- for the pistols, you know, like yellow bombs, so -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s830">He was working with that, and he was completely yellow.</span> <span id="s831">And all of them working there used to die of poison in the body.</span> <span id="s832">And he was already swollen.</span> <span id="s833">So then, a Polish guy worked there from the freedom, and showed what to do, you know, by the -- by the picreena.</span> <span id="s834">That was picreen, I don’t know how it calls in -- in German.</span> <span id="s835">It -- yellow powder to make --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Ammunition.</span> <span id="s838">Yellow powder.</span> <span id="s839">And so he said, “I have some,” and -- and he was swollen already.</span> <span id="s840">The guy said, “If you not going to eat something, and you swelling goes to your heart, you die.”</span> <span id="s841">So he’s -- you have something to give me, to sell?</span> <span id="s842">He said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s843">I have a pair of earrings, I wanted to keep it for my wife, but I am going to sell it.</span> <span id="s844">How much y-y -- do you giving me?”</span> <span id="s845">He said, “300 Zlotas,” -- that time in Poland, “and I bring you bread for it.”</span> <span id="s846">And he sold it, and he -- that’s -- because of those earrings, he was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Was it sulfur?</span> <span id="s848">That -- that yellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Sulfur, like sulfur, yeah.</span> <span id="s850">They were -- they called -- they -- when they saw him on the streets going to work, they said, “The yellow are coming.”</span> <span id="s851">They were completely yellow, the eyes, and the -- the skin, everything.</span> <span id="s852">So this -- this was in Scarjisk in Poland, a factory for German ammunition.</span> <span id="s853">So that’s when I didn’t know that my -- he is alive, too.</span> <span id="s854">I wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s855">I -- I didn’t even thought about it.</span> <span id="s856">So when I knew where my brother and -- and father is, and my brother had, that time, a Polish -- Ukrainian woman for a wife, and -- and my brother-in-law of the other sister’s, he was on -- on pa-papers, too, and he lived with a Polish woman, and his name was gr -- Jellack.</span> <span id="s857">Okay, something different.</span> <span id="s858">How did I -- how could I -- so, and then, after the war, he lived in Vulbjif.</span> <span id="s859">You know where Vulbjif is?</span> <span id="s860">It’s -- it’s a German city, but Poland called it Vulbjif.</span> <span id="s861">I used to live in -- when a -- in Poland after Gdansk, in -- in -- in Shtolp.</span> <span id="s862">It’s -- was a German city in -- it -- Polish, it was Lupsk, because you know, they exchanged places.</span> <span id="s863">So anyway, I -- when I came to po -- I -- when they told me to come and to come, and I said to -- I went to Karl Gustaf and Gunn, and I said I have to say goodbye, and to my o -- other -- other parents, I had a lot of friends there, a lot, good friends what they helped me.</span> <span id="s864">That -- that’s what I’m alive, because a lot in Sweden died, a lot.</span> <span id="s865">In Sweden.</span> <span id="s866">Because they were bones and skin, and they ate, and they -- nobody watched them, and you know, and -- it -- it -- it -- not because they didn’t h-have good there, too good let’s say.</span> <span id="s867">Too good because they ate too much, and they were dying like -- like flies.</span> <span id="s868">Oh, forbuden they say, for-forbidden is forbuden.</span> <span id="s869">That’s the word.</span> <span id="s870">And I had said, “What is buden to you, too?”</span> <span id="s871">Anyway, so I -- I -- I said, “Okay, I’m coming home.”</span> <span id="s872">And after a year and a half in Sweden, I came to -- to Gdinia, not Gdansk, but Gdinia.</span> <span id="s873">Danzig is -- was a -- a free co -- free -- free city, but I came to the Polish, to Gdinia.</span> <span id="s874">And they -- the Polacks, took us in there, when I came from Sweden already, they -- in middle of the night, they didn’t give us n -- a little water.</span> <span id="s875">Not a piece of bread, nothing, I’ll --</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: How -- how did you go over to -- to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I -- I -- I made -- they made me papers, and -- to go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: But I mean, by -- by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: By -- oh, no, by -- by -- I don’t -- by train -- by tr -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s880">It was -- it was so many years.</span> <span id="s881">How did I go back?</span> <span id="s882">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s883">By -- by train from Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: That’s a long [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yeah, a long r -- I -- all by -- a half by water, and -- and I was -- I -- I don’t remember, because I was always sick on the water.</span> <span id="s886">I am -- maybe I went to -- back to Germany, and from ger -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s887">I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s888">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: So when you got there, the Polacks were not very friendly?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: N-N-No.</span> <span id="s891">I was hungry, and shivering, in middle of the night, and I didn’t know, I thought that when -- when I, Polish citizen, come to Poland after the war, they going to embrace me, they going to give me I don’t know -- I came there -- food and ev -- nobody.</span> <span id="s892">I was with valises, with -- with suitcases.</span> <span id="s893">I didn’t know in middle of the night where to go.</span> <span id="s894">And nobody -- and I walked, and my shoes w-wer -- I -- I couldn’t walk any more.</span> <span id="s895">Nobody wa -- in Polish I ask, “Where shall I go?</span> <span id="s896">I have to go to -- to -- to Gdansk.”</span> <span id="s897">You go, you go.</span> <span id="s898">You -- you -- you -- you are a Jew?</span> <span id="s899">You go.</span> <span id="s900">Okay?</span> <span id="s901">So you are in Polish, Zhidufka, go.</span> <span id="s902">Je -- You Jewess, go.</span> <span id="s903">Okay?</span> <span id="s904">I -- I came in middle of the night, it was five o’clock in the morning, I came to Gdansk.</span> <span id="s905">I had their address.</span> <span id="s906">I didn’t have money, I have kr -- to -- to call them.</span> <span id="s907">I had a hundred, no 75 s -- kronas I had with me.</span> <span id="s908">Oh, a -- a -- a -- a -- a, change is a erra -- eara.</span> <span id="s909">You know?</span> <span id="s910">Eara.</span> <span id="s911">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: I forgot -- I forgot, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Eara, eara.</span> <span id="s914">So you see, I’ve -- I remind myself.</span> <span id="s915">And -- and a few earas, and I couldn’t make a call.</span> <span id="s916">And I said I wanted -- I want to call.</span> <span id="s917">Nobody let me call.</span> <span id="s918">So I went walking from the station to Kastanyinwai, in Gdansk.</span> <span id="s919">Later they call it Lenjona, but it was still Kastanyinwai.</span> <span id="s920">And easy I remember the -- the -- the -- the names of the -- of the streets, apart -- Kastanyinwai, too.</span> <span id="s921">And I found the building.</span> <span id="s922">I came to the building, and I knocked in the door, and a -- i -- ma -- the door -- the -- the big -- big, you know, in the building, the -- the -- the -- the door, somebody opened with a key, and they let me -- and they said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s923">In Polish.</span> <span id="s924">And I said, “I am Luftoovna,” in Polish.</span> <span id="s925">So they said, “Oh, my God.”</span> <span id="s926">And they were from mine town, they lived in the same building.</span> <span id="s927">And they used to have -- making a beer brewery.</span> <span id="s928">And I said -- sh-she -- she came to visit me here.</span> <span id="s929">And -- and she said, “Daloo -- yeah, she said Damska, she got married to a Polish guy, and her name was Damska in -- in Danusha, and she opened the door, and she said, “Mine God, they -- you -- they live on the third floor, they waiting for you.</span> <span id="s930">And they -- they talked about du -- you, and we all cried.”</span> <span id="s931">And her mother came out, and they all cr -- we all cried.</span> <span id="s932">Because they knew me.</span> <span id="s933">And so, I -- I came to -- to Danzig.</span> <span id="s934">I came into the hou -- I knocked in the door, and my sister-in-law thought somebody -- you know, everybody came from the t-town to look for somebody who is still alive, and she said, “Who are you?</span> <span id="s935">What do you want?”</span> <span id="s936">And I said, “You Franya?”</span> <span id="s937">And she said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s938">“You my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s939">Open the door.</span> <span id="s940">I came from Sweden.”</span> <span id="s941">And -- and so she said, “Why didn’t you let us know?”</span> <span id="s942">And I said, “I didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s943">I didn’t know when I’m going to get the passport, and when I’m going to come.”</span> <span id="s944">I-It -- and it ca -- it took longer, I was sitting in Gdansk, in Gdinia a whole day.</span> <span id="s945">It was a whole mess.</span> <span id="s946">So I came in -- in -- in my -- and they were all screaming in middle of the night, five o’clock, and crying.</span> <span id="s947">And my husband was there, too, s-standing and shaking like a leaf.</span> <span id="s948">And -- and my father cry, everybody cried, and -- and so I lived with them for a little -- for a year, maybe a year.</span> <span id="s949">It was a big, big house, a big building in a -- in a big -- the whole third floor.</span> <span id="s950">So they gave me a room, we used the same kitchen.</span> <span id="s951">And then I -- I was living there, and I said, “It’s time for me to go on -- on their own.”</span> <span id="s952">We had a kiosk, you know what a kiosk is?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Yeah, it’s a small little place where you can buy anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah, so my husband had that.</span> <span id="s955">My father had a big store in Gdansk.</span> <span id="s956">So -- and I said -- and he -- I didn’t get along with him, I said, “I’m going to leave you.”</span> <span id="s957">I gus prug -- I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s958">The first time he made me pregnant, and he said, “Na -- you not going to leave me, because you pregnant.”</span> <span id="s959">Okay?</span> <span id="s960">So I had my first son, and he was born in -- in Gdansk.</span> <span id="s961">And then when he was a little boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Mark.</span> <span id="s964">And Mark lives in Arizona now, and he’s married to a -- an Arizonian girl, Cindy.</span> <span id="s965">And -- and they don’t have children.</span> <span id="s966">And so he -- I had that little Mark, and my husband was jealous that I gave love to Mark.</span> <span id="s967">I don’t love him, and I said I didn’t -- I never did, okay?</span> <span id="s968">It’s just for pity I’m staying with you, because I am not going to stay wi -- I stayed with him 23 years, and I had a miserable life, til here.</span> <span id="s969">I left him in -- in -- he left me thousand times.</span> <span id="s970">We didn’t live in -- in Montreal for months off and months on.</span> <span id="s971">I -- I

talk about them a little bit more later --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yeah, yeah, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: -- I just want to ask you one question.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: -- ye -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: One question.</span> <span id="s985">How was it to be -- to see your father again?</span> <span id="s986">What did -- what did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: It was -- it was -- it was coming from the ashes.</span> <span id="s988">I came back from death, and I saw them.</span> <span id="s989">And my father became my life.</span> <span id="s990">I brought him here to Canada -- here not to Canada.</span> <span id="s991">He was here nine months, nine and a half months with me, when he was still alive.</span> <span id="s992">And -- and -- and my brother, they were my life.</span> <span id="s993">I didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s994">No cousins, no -- nobody, only American uncles who didn’t give a damn about anything.</span> <span id="s995">They -- we were -- we didn’t know each other.</span> <span id="s996">My father didn’t recog -- didn’t know who they are, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Did you -- have you, after all this experience, had your faith changed, your feeling --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: -- about [indecipherable] Jewish [indecipherable] fathers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I am -- I am Jewish, and very much Jewish, and it hurts me that my children don’t want to believe in it.</span> <span id="s1001">And they don’t -- one has a Jewish wife, it’s not that they don’t have Jewish wives, but sometimes is hurting me.</span> <span id="s1002">His little girl, my middle son’s, said, “Teddy, can we go to church?”</span> <span id="s1003">And that hurts me, because I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1004">I don’t -- I -- I don’t go to synagogue, I am not a religious Jew, but this is my faith, and with this faith I will die.</span> <span id="s1005">I went through a Holocaust because of my faith, and I never going to change it.</span> <span id="s1006">Mine father became back Jewish, and my brother became Jewish back, and my sister-in-law was Ukrainian, in th -- in -- in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1007">She had one boy, he was religious.</span> <span id="s1008">He came with those -- you know, tha -- the very Orthodox Jews, she made out of him.</span> <span id="s1009">And she -- was a k -- Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1010">And she begged me when she was dying, she was 43 years old when she died of cancer in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1011">I brought them from Israel to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1012">And -- and she begged me to put her on the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1013">And she was never -- he’d never -- she’d never changed her religion, but she wanted to be on the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1014">See?</span> <span id="s1015">So I never changed my religion for nothing in the world.</span> <span id="s1016">And more older I am getting, more I am listening to Jewish prayers, in -- which I don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s1017">I don’t know how to read in Jewish, and I don’t know how to pray in Jewish.</span> <span id="s1018">But when I heard the Kaddish, you know, after the dead, and when -- I cry very much, because I am -- they are telling Kaddish for my family, okay?</span> <span id="s1019">So I -- I don’t know -- I don’t observe the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s1020">I -- I observe them only because this is -- the j -- the Jewish -- not rel -- not -- this is not religious, this is tradition.</span> <span id="s1021">I -- I -- I believe in my tradition, I believe in my God.</span> <span id="s1022">I believe -- I don’t go to a synagogue because I don’t believe in rabbis, I don’t believe in what they tell me.</span> <span id="s1023">I -- if the God, my God, is in the cher -- in the -- in the synagogue, he is in my house, too.</span> <span id="s1024">He is everywhere, and if I want to pray, I pray to Him with all my heart, with all my mighty.</span> <span id="s1025">And I thank Him every day for every day I live, I thank God for it.</span> <span id="s1026">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did your father have doubts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: My fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Or was he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: -- after -- after the war, my father -- see I s -- I feel I have the glasses.</span> <span id="s1031">Ma -- after the war in Danzig, my father was still the -- the -- the Catholic, you know?</span> <span id="s1032">He used to go to churches, because he was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s1033">He was in Lemberg as a -- as a Gentile, and a Polack from our town came in, a policeman, and he saw my father, and my father got white like this, and he t -- and my father had a store in -- in Lemberg, so that this policeman, Polish policeman, saw my father turning white, and he turned around, and he said, “Looft, don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s1034">I didn’t see you.”</span> <span id="s1035">In the wartime, okay?</span> <span id="s1036">And he walked out of that store.</span> <span id="s1037">So -- i -- i -- after the war, my father used to go to church because he thought -- he -- he started saying, “They going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1038">They going to kill me if they going to know that I’m a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1039">So he w-was going with the procession, first with the procession with the cross.</span> <span id="s1040">And I said to my father, “Father, if -- if they -- if I’m not going to be able -- I’m going to -- to Canada.</span> <span id="s1041">And -- first to Israel, and then to Canada, because I can’t go different ways.</span> <span id="s1042">But if you not going to change your name, they,” -- he was in jail at Oscojanolski.</span> <span id="s1043">I said, the Jewish Federation asking you what’s your real name, and you don’t want to tell them, because they going to kill me, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1044">My father, with the Jewish name -- with the Polish name, went to the Jewish Federation for a Passover.</span> <span id="s1045">You know what’s Passover is.</span> <span id="s1046">And he met another engineer guy, who was -- asked my father, he had a-a -- a Polish name, and they met there, in the Jewish Federation in Gdansk.</span> <span id="s1047">And this friend of my father said, “Katchanowski, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1048">He said the [indecipherable], because why did you l -- why did -- it was Passover.</span> <span id="s1049">So he came to -- to celebrate Passover with the Jews, but outside he was afraid that they going to denounce him, and he’s going -- they going to kill him, because they killed a lot of Jews in -- in Poland after the war.</span> <span id="s1050">Polack -- Polish people.</span> <span id="s1051">They made pogroms, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1052">My brother came to sell something what belonged to us, a house, and this, and -- and they told him, if you not going to leave here -- from here, you know what’s going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1053">So my brother left, okay?</span> <span id="s1054">So that’s the truth, what I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s1055">So we -- my -- so I told my father, “If you’re not going to change your name back to po -- to -- to -- to your name, you Looft.</span> <span id="s1056">You have to be Looft, you know?”</span> <span id="s1057">L-u-f-t, it’s Luft in -- in po -- in English, but it was Looft in Polish.</span> <span id="s1058">So I said, if-- it’s a German name, and -- and -- and -- and he said -- I said, “If you’re not going to change it, how am I related to you to bring you to wherever I am?”</span> <span id="s1059">So finally he came as Katchanowski to Israel.</span> <span id="s1060">And from Israel I said, “Father,” -- and my brother as Brodotsky -- “you can’t come to Canada if you not going to change your name, because they -- they ask me who is he to you?</span> <span id="s1061">He’s related -- why don’t you have his name?”</span> <span id="s1062">So they changed first, back to Luft.</span> <span id="s1063">My brothe -- brother died as a Luft, and my father died as a Luft in Canada.</span> <span id="s1064">And my bru -- father died in ’66, and my -- 1966.</span> <span id="s1065">My brother died just two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: We should --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: -- say that this is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Rose Warner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rose Warner.</span> <span id="s1071">This is tape number three, side A. And Rose, here’s my question.</span> <span id="s1072">What happened next?</span> <span id="s1073">So you went Poland first, but that -- but you didn’t stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: No.</span> <span id="s1075">So my father, I told you, was so Catholic that he was working with a -- with a cross -- with a -- and I said, “How I am going to take you to -- to Israel?”</span> <span id="s1076">So he changed the name, they -- my brother -- and my brother was married to a Ukrainian lady, and they all went -- after a year I was in Israel before I left for Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Why did you want to -- okay, we have to backtrack a little.</span> <span id="s1078">Why did you want to go to Israel, and why did you le -- let’s go to Israel first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Why [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Why -- why from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Because we had to run away from Poland, the Russian were there, and that was a very, very bad time.</span> <span id="s1084">The Russian arrested everybody for nothing.</span> <span id="s1085">They -- they think that he’s against them, or -- or whatever, you know?</span> <span id="s1086">They don’t want to be Communists or something, they were -- they were all in jail, my brother, and my brother, and my father, and my -- and my friend, she -- not Jewish, friend, she is in Canada, my -- my -- Helen Vineetska, my best friend.</span> <span id="s1087">We -- we friends for 55 years, she is Catholic.</span> <span id="s1088">And so, you see, in -- we -- and we had to run.</span> <span id="s1089">We didn’t -- we couldn’t -- we didn’t have any possible to go anyplace else, and Israel was taking in that time, people.</span> <span id="s1090">So we went to Israel, to wait for a green card from -- from -- in -- from cana -- can -- do -- the Canadian, for the Canadian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: When did you go to Israel?</span> <span id="s1092">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: About in ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: An-And why did you want to go to Canada from Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Because from Canada you could go to America.</span> <span id="s1096">That’s a whole story.</span> <span id="s1097">In Canada, I had -- in America I had uncles, and they said, “We can’t take you to America, because you have to wait for a quota.</span> <span id="s1098">You go to Israel, stay in Israel for a -- for awhile, and then go to can -- you going to Canada.”</span> <span id="s1099">I had cousins in Canada, and they send me papers to Canada.</span> <span id="s1100">To Canada from Israel you go -- can go in a year, okay?</span> <span id="s1101">So we, after a year and a half, I left Israel to -- to Canada, because in Israel it was very bad after -- the Israeli just got the country, and it was bad, and everything on -- on -- on carts, and -- and you couldn’t get enough -- it -- it -- that was -- I said, I -- I told my uncles, I called them, I am back in concentration camp, okay?</span> <span id="s1102">Because that was new, a new country, and they didn’t have so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Let’s stay in Israel then, for a second, because that’s -- the -- your impressions of the country are interesting.</span> <span id="s1104">So, for you it was not like it was for many others, sort of like a homecoming, really, to Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: It was a homecoming from Poland, in -- but not to stay.</span> <span id="s1106">I want to run from the home.</span> <span id="s1107">You understand?</span> <span id="s1108">I -- I -- I -- it -- it was -- for me it was too hard.</span> <span id="s1109">And you -- you -- we didn’t have a house, in a house.</span> <span id="s1110">We were in barracks, or in -- in -- in -- in -- in tents.</span> <span id="s1111">That -- it’s not a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: They didn’t have enough place for so many people coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: How did you live, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s1116">They gave us food, they -- they gave us car -- cards that I could get a -- a quarter of a pound of butter, all -- o-or a half a pound of butter for a whole month.</span> <span id="s1117">A chicken a month.</span> <span id="s1118">That wasn’t enough, they didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1119">That was -- it was a desert, now it’s a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s1120">When I came there, it was desert, and they didn’t have a place, so we stayed -- first we stayed in -- in -- in tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Where -- where was that in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: In -- in -- in Abarborra.</span> <span id="s1123">That means, this is just like a military place it used to be, and they -- and they ti -- the military wasn’t there any more, and they gave us up that place, to live there.</span> <span id="s1124">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1125">It -- I li -- then they gave me a barrack.</span> <span id="s1126">For three families, one barrack.</span> <span id="s1127">They didn’t have place, it’s a little country.</span> <span id="s1128">And all of a sudden they teed -- they took in so many people.</span> <span id="s1129">So, in -- in -- in -- and it’s not that, what I was looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: What were you looking for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I wa -- I was loo -- looking for freedom, not cartiseem.</span> <span id="s1132">I was looking for freedom, and not for a heat like this, in where I want to live.</span> <span id="s1133">So I --we went -- we went after a year and a half, we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1134">We -- to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1135">And Canada was very nice.</span> <span id="s1136">We -- my uncles came from the United State, and they rented for me two rooms, by somebody.</span> <span id="s1137">I had already three children.</span> <span id="s1138">I got one, I -- I beared the youngsters in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s1139">One in Shtolp, in Shloopsk, and one in Gdansk, okay?</span> <span id="s1140">So, I had three.</span> <span id="s1141">They -- my cousins knew I have only two, in meantime, I -- I gave birth to a third one.</span> <span id="s1142">Because, I would come earlier, but they know -- knew that I’m pregnant, they didn’t want me to leave til the child is a ha -- a half a year old, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Did you want all these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: No.</span> <span id="s1145">I wanted to -- to aborth -- abort th-th-th-the little -- in Israel, but my husband didn’t let me, and I’m glad.</span> <span id="s1146">I -- I -- I think I -- i-it would be the worst thing, but I -- I didn’t -- I was no -- in nowhere.</span> <span id="s1147">I was with -- you see, the light I’m getting to my eye already, sorry.</span> <span id="s1148">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: That’s alright, take your glasses off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">You know, I -- I was in a bad situation.</span> <span id="s1152">My husband worked

go on saying something else then.</span> <span id="s1155">You don’t want to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yi -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s na -- it’s a filmit, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: [indecipherable] you want me to stop?</span> <span id="s1158">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: A minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: We’ll stop for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: About this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Okay, so we -- we go on, and it was you were not in a very good situation at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Yeah, because we lived in -- in -- in -- in a barrack, and I got pregnant, and my husband wasn’t good t -- a good husband, and so I didn’t want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1164">That’s what I want to go run away fr-from -- from anything.</span> <span id="s1165">So I went -- we were -- he too, he -- we went to -- to Canada.</span> <span id="s1166">And in Canada, we -- we -- my uncles came, and they

America, and he said, “I’m going to send for you.”</span> <span id="s1228">And I didn’t want to go, so he -- he sent me papers from a lawyer, that if I’m not going to come to the United States, he’s going to sue me for desertion, okay?</span> <span id="s1229">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1230">And he -- in meantime, it was vacation, he took the children for th-the -- he said -- a friend went to Canada, and he said, “Bring the children here,” two of them, not the oldest, and the oldest didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1231">So he said, “I’m not going to send you the children, I’m going to sue you for desertion, and I’m going to keep the children,” okay?</span> <span id="s1232">So that was my life, and I came here -- after a year I went to work in Canada, I worked as a cashier in a big restaurant, and I -- and I -- you know, I didn’t want to come.</span> <span id="s1233">So he -- he was bombarding, and I said how I -- without the children, I said, “Mark, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s1234">Let’s go, and I -- yeah, and he went to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1235">And I said, “If he -- if you going to stay in Philadelphia,” he called me -- wh-whenever he called on the phone, I said, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s1236">That’s the way I -- we -- we -- we communicate.</span> <span id="s1237">And he said, “I want you to come.”</span> <span id="s1238">I said, “Not to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1239">When you -- if you going go to -- to California, I come.”</span> <span id="s1240">So, the children were here, he came to California, and I came to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Why California?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Because of the sun, and th-the -- the beauty of it, it’s warm.</span> <span id="s1243">I -- what do I have to go, I have winter in -- in -- in Montreal, why should I come to winter to -- to s -- to Philadelphia?</span> <span id="s1244">It’s cold there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: There was one more question about -- about Canada.</span> <span id="s1246">After so many years, you at least for 12 years found a country where you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: -- learn the language --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: -- you could settle down a little bit.</span> <span id="s1251">How was it to adjust to a normal life again, and did you find any happiness?</span> <span id="s1252">In what did you find any happiness there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: In -- in ca -- in -- in ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: In Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s1256">We were -- you know, like a lot of people came to -- to Canada, a lot.</span> <span id="s1257">I came even with a Ukrainian family.</span> <span id="s1258">She came from France by boat.</span> <span id="s1259">I was sick, and she took care of my children on the boat because I was very sick on the boat, coming from France to here.</span> <span id="s1260">Because I had to go to France from Israel, and for France, I came to Halifax, to -- to calif -- to Canada.</span> <span id="s1261">And so I -- she took care, and we became the best friends, til she died here.</span> <span id="s1262">She got married, then she married -- to California, and she died.</span> <span id="s1263">And we were the best friends.</span> <span id="s1264">She was an -- a Ukrainian lady, she was -- she had cancer.</span> <span id="s1265">So I came here, to Canada, because it was a lot of greenhorns, you know, coming from all over, to ba -- Canada was a easy country to come in.</span> <span id="s1266">After the war they let us in.</span> <span id="s1267">Here, they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s1268">They didn’t want to even the little children let in, okay?</span> <span id="s1269">So there, they let us in, and we came all to there.</span> <span id="s1270">From there, we start, you know, working where you want to go, where you gon -- really want to live.</span> <span id="s1271">I want to live in Canada.</span> <span id="s1272">I loved Canada.</span> <span id="s1273">They were nice, and you know, the -- the people were very nice to you, and they -- even the -- the French Canadian, we didn’t have anything to do with them, but they didn’t know Juif, or -- or -- or Jew.</span> <span id="s1274">No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1275">They just were nice to each other.</span> <span id="s1276">We were -- we were like -- more like in Europe in Canada.</span> <span id="s1277">Then, you see, they have -- like I -- I -- I was two years ago, when my father -- brother died, I -- I -- I used to go -- in a year I was five times in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1278">So -- because he was very, very sick, he’s had liver cancer.</span> <span id="s1279">So, there you go to the -- to the shopping center, you meet all of them, because they live all -- always the -- the Jews -- not only the Jews, only th-the European people live in one area.</span> <span id="s1280">You know, not f -- the French.</span> <span id="s1281">In one -- and there, you -- you met everybody when you go to -- went to the -- to the mall.</span> <span id="s1282">You -- you went to Cavandish mall, my God, in Montreal, Cavandish mall, you maneet everybody you want.</span> <span id="s1283">And this is a country like European.</span> <span id="s1284">You were close to everybody.</span> <span id="s1285">You met, you talked, you -- you go to weddings, and to -- to -- you know, here -- I live here, somebody -- I have a friend, she -- she moved out there, in -- in -- in there, and you know, you -- they live all over, and now, in the old -- old age, everybody there -- one is sick, and one died, and one had ol -- has Alzheimer’s, and -- and one doesn’t know who she is, and this is -- this is really very, very sad.</span> <span id="s1286">And -- and I am really very lonely, alone.</span> <span id="s1287">Mine children -- one lives in -- in -- in Arizona, and -- and one lives in Los Gatos mountains in northern California, and he lives in Oregon, okay?</span> <span id="s1288">And I live here, by myself.</span> <span id="s1289">Sometimes I sit and I talk to the walls, because my friends -- only I have one neighbor, she’s a German Jew, and we -- she calls, and I call.</span> <span id="s1290">But we don’t -- we -- we don’t -- you know, we don’t come together, we just talk on the phone.</span> <span id="s1291">I have a few -- it’s -- it’s an American woman, not a Jew, but she lives on mine street, and -- and Julia calls, and she said, “Rose, where do you live?”</span> <span id="s1292">She lives on mine street, only no -- south of Wiltshire, but on the same Ninth Street.</span> <span id="s1293">We know each other for 38 years.</span> <span id="s1294">So she ask me where do you live.</span> <span id="s1295">So, you see where the brain are?</span> <span id="s1296">One l-lives on 24th Street, and sometime [indecipherable] Polish woman, Wanda, and she -- she said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1297">How is the weather by you?”</span> <span id="s1298">I said, “This -- it’s raining.”</span> <span id="s1299">Isn’t this -- isn’t this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: You both live in Santa Monica --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Both in Santa Mo -- and the -- th-the one on -- on Ninth Street said, “You know what, it’s pouring -- no, it’s so pouring here.</span> <span id="s1302">How is by -- no, it’s so sunny here.”</span> <span id="s1303">And I said, -- “and how is by you?”</span> <span id="s1304">I said, “By me, Julia, is raining.</span> <span id="s1305">It’ s -- I have rain, and a storm, and -- and hailing.</span> <span id="s1306">It’s terrible.”</span> <span id="s1307">She said, “Really?”</span> <span id="s1308">So, you see, that’s the people I live now.</span> <span id="s1309">I -- I, thank God, touch wood, I knocked in the wood, that I have my -- all my brains together.</span> <span id="s1310">Maybe it’s heritage, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1311">I don’t know, but I -- I know -- the other day my son was looking something in my car -- I drive a car -- m-my son looked something in my car, just to touch up his car, he has a white car, too.</span> <span id="s1312">And I said, “You know, 10 years ago I think I bought a touch up thing, and it’s in my glove compartment.”</span> <span id="s1313">And he said, “You kidding.”</span> <span id="s1314">And I -- you remember, I said, “Yes, I have two of them.”</span> <span id="s1315">He found two of them.</span> <span id="s1316">You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: I could -- I couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I -- I remember everything what’s in, and what’s there, and what’s here, and what I have in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Let’s try to remember how it was when you came -- when you came to California.</span> <span id="s1320">I need to get back to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: So, you have still -- you had dreams and expectations when you came here, this is where you wanted to be, in California.</span> <span id="s1323">How was it when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Not dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Not dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Better -- better than alone there, with children in Canada.</span> <span id="s1327">Not dreams, I came from -- for the children, because he had them here, for necessory.</span> <span id="s1328">But I liked it.</span> <span id="s1329">I like the weather.</span> <span id="s1330">I liked -- it was freedom that time.</span> <span id="s1331">Now, they have the computers, everything they know about you.</span> <span id="s1332">That time, nobody -- it’s was mine private life.</span> <span id="s1333">Nobody mixed in in mine children, and nobody mixed in in any of the -- of that life.</span> <span id="s1334">Now, everybody has -- knows what you eat today, when you go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1335">That’s not right, okay?</span> <span id="s1336">That’s very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1337">They take away you children for foster homes.</span> <span id="s1338">Is it better, a foster home, there than that [indecipherable] parent?</span> <span id="s1339">No.</span> <span id="s1340">I -- I was very depressed because I am -- I am -- I’m falling in most of the time in a depression.</span> <span id="s1341">So, I have here even, in that picture, mine social wor -- not a social worker, she’s a -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1342">Psychologist.</span> <span id="s1343">That’s my psychologist I used to go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Th-The depression, where di -- where do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Th-That comes very often to me, because I am depressed.</span> <span id="s1346">I -- didn’t I go through enough to be depressed, in au -- and my life today is -- you know, I have depression with my son, I have -- I -- it -- it’s depression.</span> <span id="s1347">I have nothing against this country, I love this country.</span> <span id="s1348">This is my country, and here I’m going to die, and -- and here I lived for in -- f -- since 1962, I am here, okay?</span> <span id="s1349">And so a -- it’s my country, it’s so many years, and I -- but I don’t like th -- the mixing in.</span> <span id="s1350">That’s -- that’s the only thing I don’t like here, because that’s nobody’s business what -- they don’t ask me how you live, but what you have.</span> <span id="s1351">You understand?</span> <span id="s1352">They don’t -- they go into you, like you own -- owe anybody something.</span> <span id="s1353">I don’t owe a penny anybody.</span> <span id="s1354">When I charge something, I buy only what I can afford, and when the credit card comes to pay, I pay in full.</span> <span id="s1355">I never -- I -- if I paid one penny interest, anybody, so help me God, it’s not true.</span> <span id="s1356">Okay?</span> <span id="s1357">Never.</span> <span id="s1358">Because I live in my way, what -- how I can live.</span> <span id="s1359">I don’t overdraw.</span> <span id="s1360">I live, and I know that I -- today I spend so much, and so much -- you know, for this month, I can’t afford no more.</span> <span id="s1361">This is this -- I bought a dress this -- th -- I didn’t buy dresses for years, but if I bought a dress, I said, that’s enough.</span> <span id="s1362">Next time, when I’m going to have the money, I bought everything for cash, in what a [indecipherable] year, okay?</span> <span id="s1363">Nothing for -- for payments, nothing, because this is the rules, th-then they -- they make 47,000 dollars, 50,000 dollars a month, and they complain that they don’t have money to live on.</span> <span id="s1364">I say, in America is no hunger.</span> <span id="s1365">If you buy a chicken for when it’s on sale, and you can eat a chicken a whole week, and you not hungry.</span> <span id="s1366">And bread is cheap enough that you can afford a bread, and milk, okay?</span> <span id="s1367">So, it’s no hunger in America.</span> <span id="s1368">And that’s -- that’s -- I tell with my -- I said, “If I see those homeless, that they eat from the garbage,” I said, “this is not the way America is built.</span> <span id="s1369">Because it’s food plenty, if you want to work.”</span> <span id="s1370">Okay, and you spent -- n-not spending your money on -- on booze, and on -- and on -- and on dope.</span> <span id="s1371">Okay?</span> <span id="s1372">That’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Y-You said that for many years you didn’t buy a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Because I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s1377">I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: So how was -- what -- what did you do in the beginning, did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I worked all the time.</span> <span id="s1380">I worked al -- I worked when I came here.</span> <span id="s1381">So I was with -- my father wa -- came to visit me for nine and a half months, and my husband didn’t -- and I had a -- a two bedroom apartment for a hundred dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1382">And I had my -- I went to a bakery to work.</span> <span id="s1383">So, in the rest -- for the -- to -- to -- to pay so little, I washed the steps in the -- in the building.</span> <span id="s1384">I was the manager, a big manager, washing steps in the bil -- in the building, but I did.</span> <span id="s1385">I didn’t put my hand out, and I wasn’t -- how you call it when you get from the government the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: S-Social --</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Welfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Yeah, welfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: I wasn’t on welfare, ever.</span> <span id="s1390">Nobody -- I didn’t ask for a handout.</span> <span id="s1391">I worked like a -- I -- like a decent person has to do, work for you living.</span> <span id="s1392">Until today, nobody gave me anything, and I have 11,000 dollars for Social Security a year, and I live on it, okay?</span> <span id="s1393">And ta -- I got my husband’s, and I am glad, and I am happy.</span> <span id="s1394">I would never eat meal on wheels, because I -- I -- I -- I would throw up, I wouldn’t eat that.</span> <span id="s1395">So, I make -- I said, I rather eat a piece of bread, with a pe -- with an onion, in a -- in -- in -- in whatever -- i-it -- it’s cheap, this -- this week, I -- I -- on sale, I buy.</span> <span id="s1396">I -- I don’t, because I -- you know, I -- I -- I can live.</span> <span id="s1397">I can live.</span> <span id="s1398">I-I-It’s -- it’s -- it’s not a hunger in America.</span> <span id="s1399">You can live for how much you make.</span> <span id="s1400">I have the few dollars, you know, like I get.</span> <span id="s1401">Oh yeah, I get a pension from Canada, 48 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1402">That’s all pension, because I didn’t work enough there, only a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Well, it helps [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1405">So -- but you see, I -- I make my living comfortable in my -- what do you say?</span> <span id="s1406">In my -- you know, what I can afford, yeah.</span> <span id="s1407">And -- and that’s what I make my living, and I -- I buy what I -- sometimes I see something, I buy a ba -- my friend bought me this television, a good friend.</span> <span id="s1408">She had -- she was a princess in -- in Poland, and she had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1409">She doesn’t live here any more.</span> <span id="s1410">She said, “I buy for me a -- a Sony, and you buy yourself.”</span> <span id="s1411">So, she bought me a -- a Sony.</span> <span id="s1412">But I -- I -- I -- that’s not a handout.</span> <span id="s1413">She wanted, because I did for her a lot.</span> <span id="s1414">And so she said, “You my friend, I want to buy you a present.”</span> <span id="s1415">I said, “No, you don’t.”</span> <span id="s1416">“I want.”</span> <span id="s1417">So anyway, that’s what I ha-have.</span> <span id="s1418">The furniture I bought -- my friend died, and the daughter sold me for cheap, furniture, okay?</span> <span id="s1419">My friend, she was 90 se -- 94 when she died.</span> <span id="s1420">She -- she said I am her daughter, you know?</span> <span id="s1421">She died in -- a few years ago, in 1990 -- in 1990.</span> <span id="s1422">So she - her daughter said that -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rose Warner.</span> <span id="s1424">This is tape number three, side B. And now I have a few questions that go a little bit all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: We’ll see where it leads us.</span> <span id="s1427">The first question is, did you ever think about getting rid of your -- of your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: No.</span> <span id="s1429">I am proud that I’m alive.</span> <span id="s1430">My -- my -- that’s not a shame, to have a number, because this is -- I’m a -- proud that I -- I over -- I -- I li -- I live longer than Hitler, okay?</span> <span id="s1431">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Did you ever have experiences with Americans who saw it, and who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yes, to express, yes.</span> <span id="s1434">I -- you know, it was a movie, the Holocaust, a long time ago, the first Holocaust, and I came in -- I lived here for -- I lived here for 26 years, so I have in the corner there, by Montana, a -- a s -- a store.</span> <span id="s1435">It used to be save -- Safeway, and now it’s Pavilion.</span> <span id="s1436">So I used to go to sa -- went to Safeway after it finished, the movie, and -- and I was paying money by the cash register, and I was standing like, you know, by the cash register, and a guy was standing behind me, and he grabbed my arm, and he started kissing from my fingers til -- and I said -- and I grabbed my hand, and I said, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1437">He said, “Lady, I am so glad that you’re with us.</span> <span id="s1438">I am so grateful that you live.”</span> <span id="s1439">Okay?</span> <span id="s1440">Then, another one -- a lot of them, but the -- to just -- what makes me remember.</span> <span id="s1441">And he said -- I went to Kaiser Permanente, and -- and a -- and I ask a -- they’re -- call themselves now African Americans, yeah.</span> <span id="s1442">So they African American.</span> <span id="s1443">So I -- I saw a African American.</span> <span id="s1444">I -- I am not ashame I’m a Jew, and they shouldn’t be ashamed of they Black, but they want to be called African Americans, fine with me.</span> <span id="s1445">So I -- I met -- and I asked them, when do they open that window, because it was lunchtime, and he said to me, in 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s1446">And he looked, and he said, “Oh, my God, you -- is this what you really -- were you really are?”</span> <span id="s1447">And I said -- I forgo -- I forgetting sometimes that I have a number.</span> <span id="s1448">And a -- and I said, “What do you mean, what I am?</span> <span id="s1449">I am what I am.”</span> <span id="s1450">And he said, “No, that number.”</span> <span id="s1451">And I said, “Yes, I was there, wer -- what you think?”</span> <span id="s1452">And he said, “Mine God.</span> <span id="s1453">Tell me, tell me, and may I -- may I hug you?</span> <span id="s1454">May I give you a hug?</span> <span id="s1455">May I give you a kiss?”</span> <span id="s1456">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s1457">You know?</span> <span id="s1458">And so anoth -- and he called, “Johnny, Johnny,” to another guy, and he said, “I have here herstory.</span> <span id="s1459">Look, come here.”</span> <span id="s1460">So you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Was -- was that tou -- was that touching to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Very touching, very touching.</span> <span id="s1463">I c -- I cried.</span> <span id="s1464">Very touching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So it didn’t disturb you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1467">Both times -- many times, but those times, when they grab my hand, and they s -- they -- they -- they know what it is, they s -- I -- a -- they say, I am so glad that you’re with us, I am so glad that you behi -- you know, with the living, and -- and -- and -- and I gra -- I am grateful for it.</span> <span id="s1468">I said, “What do you have to be grateful for?”</span> <span id="s1469">And they said, “Because life, any life is a life,” okay?</span> <span id="s1470">So, I don’t mind when they ask me about the number.</span> <span id="s1471">I had a friend that she were -- I don’t know where she is now, a plaster -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- what do you ti -- th-the -- the tapes, the plastic tapes on -- on -- on -- on top of it, not to show her number.</span> <span id="s1472">I am not ashame of it.</span> <span id="s1473">I didn’t steal, I didn’t kill.</span> <span id="s1474">They didn’t give me that number because I was in jail.</span> <span id="s1475">They gave me that number that I’m a Jew, and I am not ashamed to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1476">I am proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1477">I like every -- every -- anyone who is nice, no matter if he’s a Jew, or a Catholic, or -- or a Protestant, or a -- a -- a -- a -- a Japanese, or whatever he is, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1478">Yellow or green or blue, doesn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s1479">If he is a -- a nice person, I admire them, I’m their friend.</span> <span id="s1480">But if they are not nice, it can be a Jew, and they are nice, I don’t want to talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Did you ever meet Germans of the war generation, or the second generation [indecipherable] America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: No.</span> <span id="s1483">Germans, yeah, I have a friend.</span> <span id="s1484">She is from the first generation, but they left to -- in 1938, they run away from Germany to -- to Israel, okay?</span> <span id="s1485">So I have a lot -- I -- I told -- I met a -- a girl, Helga, and she used to work with me in a bakery, and she was German.</span> <span id="s1486">But she was a young -- she -- that time she was about 30 years old.</span> <span id="s1487">She was a young girl, she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1488">She knew what the father told her, that it’s all a lie.</span> <span id="s1489">The Jews are making up stories, it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1490">Okay?</span> <span id="s1491">And then she wanted to know from me, tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s1492">She was my best friend, I worked with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: On the telephone when we spoke, you did tell me about an episode at a party where you met s -- a father of a friend, or of -- of your girlfriend’s son, of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1495">That’s -- that’s -- that’s -- that -- that’s what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Did you want to talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1498">That -- that Helga worked with me together in -- in the bakery, by Victor Vennish -- no?</span> <span id="s1499">Yeah, by Victor Vennish in the bakery, and she used to ask me questions, [indecipherable] tell me this, and she used to come to my house, and I used to go to her house.</span> <span id="s1500">She had -- she lived in -- in Westwood that time.</span> <span id="s1501">And -- and then she said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1502">I am going be -- have a dinner.</span> <span id="s1503">Mine parents are coming from Germany, and my father said that he was in the Wehrmarkt, and he doesn’t know anything what happened in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s1504">It wasn’t true, what happened.”</span> <span id="s1505">Whatever -- she said, “Father, something like this happened?”</span> <span id="s1506">And he said, “No, not what I know.</span> <span id="s1507">I was in the Wehrmarkt, and I don’t know anything.”</span> <span id="s1508">So when I came to dinner, I said, okay, if Helga invite me, and she said the parents are so nice, and he was a Wehrmarkt, he do-doesn’t even know what the SS means?</span> <span id="s1509">So I was so stupid, that was years ago, you know?</span> <span id="s1510">About 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1511">So I was still stupid, and I never talked about those things, because I kept it in my subconscious mind for many, many years, til it came to -- really to Washington Memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: We’ll talk about that soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1514">I never -- my children -- a few years ago, my son said, “Mother,” in -- in -- in -- in -- in the northern California, in Los Gatos, “sit down.</span> <span id="s1515">Tell me a little about you.”</span> <span id="s1516">And I start, and I talked about two -- two hours.</span> <span id="s1517">And he said, “I never knew about those things, you never told me.”</span> <span id="s1518">I said, “I didn’t tell anybody,” because I cried when I talk about it.</span> <span id="s1519">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: But why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Then -- then, it -- my girlfriend’s daughter took me to the -- she made an appointment for -- for me, her mother died bef -- before that, took me to -- to the -- no, she said, “I made an appointment for you by -- in the -- in the memorial in Washington.”</span> <span id="s1522">She lives in Potomac.</span> <span id="s1523">And she said, “I made an appointment, I want to -- you to be interviewed.”</span> <span id="s1524">I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s1525">I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1526">I don’t want to talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1527">She said, “You will.</span> <span id="s1528">Open, open.”</span> <span id="s1529">So I went there, and -- and I talked for five hours, and -- and then -- now, it comes -- I watched those movies and everything, it -- I have every tape.</span> <span id="s1530">I taped all the movies, and I had bought movies.</span> <span id="s1531">I bought e -- Kolchuk’s -- Kolchuk’s tape for 79 dollars in the memorial there, in Washington.</span> <span id="s1532">I have -- I bought “Schindler’s List,” in -- in the memorial there.</span> <span id="s1533">I could tape it, but it was to me something very, very new, what they show, you know?</span> <span id="s1534">And so I talked to my son, he said, “I never knew about it.”</span> <span id="s1535">So I always kept everything in my subconscious mind.</span> <span id="s1536">I didn’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: But was it to protect --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: To Helga, no.</span> <span id="s1539">To Helga -- she saw the numbers, so she just pulled from me.</span> <span id="s1540">I said I was in -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1541">I was in -- in -- in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1542">So, I wa -- I -- I didn’t tell her in details, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1543">So -- but when her parents came, I -- we sit down to dinner.</span> <span id="s1544">She made a beautiful dinner, and she said to her fa -- to her father, “Daddy, you see?</span> <span id="s1545">This is proof that it was something there.”</span> <span id="s1546">He said, “I know, I was there, I saw it.”</span> <span id="s1547">I got up, I finished my dinner, and I said, “Helga, I have to go.</span> <span id="s1548">I’m sorry, I’m going, because I -- I forgot I have to do something,” and she said okay, she understood.</span> <span id="s1549">And she said, “Rose, I see you tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1550">And I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Was he in fact saying that he had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: -- in a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: He -- no, he was working with the Germans, with the -- with the Heftlinger, you know.</span> <span id="s1555">Well, you know, that’s a Heftlinger.</span> <span id="s1556">With the -- with the -- with gefanginner, with our -- with -- with -- the -- the -- the concentration camp people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: So he had lied to his daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1559">And she said, “You told me you didn’t know about it.”</span> <span id="s1560">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: I just want to ask you w --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: -- one more question about -- to be just clear [clock chiming].</span> <span id="s1564">So it’s six --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: -- it’s six o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Yeah, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: I will ask you the question.</span> <span id="s1569">Why exactly -- try to say a little bit more about why it was that you didn’t talk -- that you didn’t talk about it to your children.</span> <span id="s1570">Was it to protect them?</span> <span id="s1571">Was it to protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1573">Because they -- they weren’t interested.</span> <span id="s1574">They didn’t ask me, and -- and I didn’t want to say to -- to have pity on me.</span> <span id="s1575">That they going to say, “Oh, she’s [indecipherable] up everything for -- that she was in the concentration camp,” everything, you know, to -- to feel sorry for.</span> <span id="s1576">I -- I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: So you didn’t want to cry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: I didn’t want to cry.</span> <span id="s1579">I cried on the movies, when I saw.</span> <span id="s1580">And they s -- ma -- my girlfriend asked me, why are you watching those movies?</span> <span id="s1581">I said, “Because I can cry out loud, and feel what they -- what I felt that time when I was there.”</span> <span id="s1582">Because “Schindler’s List,” was just a -- a country house, a country place, you know?</span> <span id="s1583">A -- a -- an enjoyment.</span> <span id="s1584">I wasn’t in a house like this.</span> <span id="s1585">“Schindler’s List” was to me just a very -- a very easy episode by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: How do you feel about these movies?</span> <span id="s1587">Do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: They should show -- the children should never forget.</span> <span id="s1589">Nobody should ever, never forget what happened.</span> <span id="s1590">My -- I ask my children -- I have tapes wha -- from me, what I’m -- they made my tapes.</span> <span id="s1591">Why don’t you look at them some other time?</span> <span id="s1592">My children are not interested.</span> <span id="s1593">They don’t feel, and that’s what I don’t talk.</span> <span id="s1594">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1596">Although, when your son asked you once --</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Once --</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: -- he asked me.</span> <span id="s1600">He has the tapes.</span> <span id="s1601">I said, “Why don’t you look at the tape?”</span> <span id="s1602">He doesn’t have time.</span> <span id="s1603">I said, “That’s not -- that’s not an excuse.”</span> <span id="s1604">Okay?</span> <span id="s1605">This is my life.</span> <span id="s1606">This is my life.</span> <span id="s1607">And when I see a movie, what’s really hurt my -- what I went through, I -- you know, I had 25 on my back, and I had -- I was -- I running from that, and I was -- terrible things.</span> <span id="s1608">And -- and I said, in --in that -- and if I see a movie, I sit and cry loud, loud.</span> <span id="s1609">Because this I can do, nobody is going to say stop it.</span> <span id="s1610">Or my girlfriend, she wasn’t in the concentra -- she run.</span> <span id="s1611">She was in Germany, and then she went to Israel in ’38.</span> <span id="s1612">She said, “Why are you watching that junk?”</span> <span id="s1613">Okay?</span> <span id="s1614">To me, it’s my life, it’s not junk.</span> <span id="s1615">Everyone had a different life there.</span> <span id="s1616">Every minute is different by millions and millions of people.</span> <span id="s1617">And so mill -- so many millions dead.</span> <span id="s1618">So my -- my mother I never saw after she was 45.</span> <span id="s1619">I never saw her in my life.</span> <span id="s1620">I don’t know where she’s buried.</span> <span id="s1621">I don’t know if she’s cremated, or she -- where she i -- her bones are.</span> <span id="s1622">Not my sisters, not my whole family.</span> <span id="s1623">Only my father I buried in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1624">Me, when they say, “Why are you want to be cremated?”</span> <span id="s1625">I said, “Because I don’t want it -- my mother was a young woman, and she -- who knows where her bones is.</span> <span id="s1626">I want to be cremated like all the Jews were.”</span> <span id="s1627">Okay?</span> <span id="s1628">That’s not a sin, to be cremated.</span> <span id="s1629">They -- the Jews, the very religious Jews said it’s a sin [indecipherable], because you have to be buried in Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s1630">And I said it’s not true.</span> <span id="s1631">I -- if th -- if they could be -- I don’t know where they ashes are, what am I different?</span> <span id="s1632">That I’m alive?</span> <span id="s1633">I’m not.</span> <span id="s1634">It’s not alive, it’s live with the deaths, all my life.</span> <span id="s1635">I live with the memory of them.</span> <span id="s1636">I used to scream in middle of the night, and they used to wake me up.</span> <span id="s1637">They -- you -- you didn’t have child -- so many children that time, I -- I said, “I’m looking for my sons, for my children.”</span> <span id="s1638">You didn’t have the children, you have them now.</span> <span id="s1639">Okay, so why should I be better than anybody else?</span> <span id="s1640">I can be cremated.</span> <span id="s1641">I don’t have to -- they not going to come to my grave anyway.</span> <span id="s1642">Because one lives here, and one there, they not going to -- I, when I come to Montreal, I go to my father.</span> <span id="s1643">When I was in Montreal, my -- my brother was dying, I went to my father’s grave, and I said, “Father, please, have mercy on -- take him already, because he is suffering terrible.”</span> <span id="s1644">And he listened to me, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1645">He took him in a short time later.</span> <span id="s1646">In a few days, a few weeks maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Do you have anybody you can talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Anybody who had similar experiences?</span> <span id="s1650">Not -- nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: I don’t -- everybody when -- you know, when you say to my friends, it hurts me here.</span> <span id="s1652">Me, too.</span> <span id="s1653">When you went through this, I did, too.</span> <span id="s1654">Oh, you don’t even know what I went through.</span> <span id="s1655">You know, so I don’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1656">I talk to myself.</span> <span id="s1657">In one -- when my children don’t give me the respect, I don’t want anything from them.</span> <span id="s1658">I don’t take from him -- from them.</span> <span id="s1659">I don’t ask for -- for help, for money.</span> <span id="s1660">I pay my rent, I pay my food, I pay my clothes.</span> <span id="s1661">I don’t go any -- any -- I don’t han -- han -- put my hand out for -- for giving me something.</span> <span id="s1662">Not to the government, not to anybody.</span> <span id="s1663">I am on my own.</span> <span id="s1664">It’s my life, and I have to take care of it, as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1665">And if -- if my children don’t understand me, they don’t owe me anything.</span> <span id="s1666">I didn’t -- they didn’t ask for be born, okay?</span> <span id="s1667">And I am just glad that I’m alive, and I can take care of myself.</span> <span id="s1668">And I don’t want anybody’s handout.</span> <span id="s1669">And that’s what -- and I can’t cry.</span> <span id="s1670">Everybody who u -- why do you have to cry?</span> <span id="s1671">And it’s as -- it’s a Jewish word, and it’s a -- I -- I think the words were, you cr -- when you cry, you cry a-alone, when you laugh, the whole world laughs with you.</span> <span id="s1672">Okay?</span> <span id="s1673">And that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s1674">Nobody wants to hear you crying, nobody wants to see you crying.</span> <span id="s1675">If the -- I cry, my children say, “Why are you crying, what -- what -- what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s1676">Nothing’s wrong with you, why you crying?”</span> <span id="s1677">Okay?</span> <span id="s1678">They don’t know their grandparents.</span> <span id="s1679">They -- they knew my father, and my brother.</span> <span id="s1680">But they don’t know my mother, they don’t knew my sisters.</span> <span id="s1681">That’s my sister, on top there, you see?</span> <span id="s1682">The -- the blonde.</span> <span id="s1683">This is the one was downstairs.</span> <span id="s1684">She -- she was a beauty.</span> <span id="s1685">Ev -- all of them.</span> <span id="s1686">I was the ugly one in the house.</span> <span id="s1687">And I -- and I -- and I don’t even know where the -- where the bones are.</span> <span id="s1688">So why not crying?</span> <span id="s1689">They -- they -- they come to me at night, and -- and I talk to them.</span> <span id="s1690">Okay?</span> <span id="s1691">I -- I dream about them.</span> <span id="s1692">Not to my children, to my children they are just a picture on the worl.</span> <span id="s1693">On the wall -- on -- I even don’t know what I’m talking -- on the wall.</span> <span id="s1694">And that’s -- and they are mine, mine blood -- flesh and blood.</span> <span id="s1695">See?</span> <span id="s1696">That’s what I -- that -- what -- what can I say?</span> <span id="s1697">I just say that’s what I see with the Ku Klux Klans, and with everything in here, and they let it happen.</span> <span id="s1698">This is n -- this is unbelievable, because Hitler started that way, and they shouldn’t -- why?</span> <span id="s1699">That he is Black, and I am Jew?</span> <span id="s1700">I-It was -- it’s one God, what we all believe, that he-he had a son, and we are his children, too.</span> <span id="s1701">He -- he wasn’t the only son, he had many sons.</span> <span id="s1702">Jesus had -- is a son of God.</span> <span id="s1703">I am a son -- a daughter of God.</span> <span id="s1704">Who made -- who -- who made mine life?</span> <span id="s1705">Okay, my father and mother, but somebody gave that life to me.</span> <span id="s1706">God.</span> <span id="s1707">And everybody believes in one.</span> <span id="s1708">It’s one, only one.</span> <span id="s1709">And I believe in that God.</span> <span id="s1710">And those Ku Klux Klans, what they doing in scott -- in scott -- scott -- i-is -- scottie or something, you know, like by -- by -- someplace in the United State.</span> <span id="s1711">They were marching, and they were killing, and the -- they -- they -- they are burning now synagogues.</span> <span id="s1712">The German burned my family.</span> <span id="s1713">My -- my father’s, my mother’s sisters and brothers, and my father’s, in a synagogue, okay?</span> <span id="s1714">They put them all in a synagogue, not they went there.</span> <span id="s1715">They put them, and they burned that synagogue with the people in it.</span> <span id="s1716">So -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s unbelievable, and we shouldn’t let that happen again.</span> <span id="s1717">And they should show the pictures, and talk about it, and everything, because this is very important.</span> <span id="s1718">Now young kids see me on the street, and know -- they know what it is.</span> <span id="s1719">Before, they ask me what number is it.</span> <span id="s1720">Mine granddaughter said, “Why do you have that number on the hand?”</span> <span id="s1721">And I said, “Becau -- that’s my telephone number.</span> <span id="s1722">Daddy didn’t tell you?”</span> <span id="s1723">She said okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: But that has changed now, a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: The younger --</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1728">They don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1729">They don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s1730">Once, my son asked me about it, and -- and -- and -- and -- and they don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s1731">I said, “Why don’t you -- look, I have so many tapes of it.</span> <span id="s1732">M-My own tapes.”</span> <span id="s1733">Nobody’s looking at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: But do you think the younger children now know a little bit more [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Not mine, not mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: No, I mean in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah, the children in general, yes.</span> <span id="s1738">A lot of generations, bu -- other people.</span> <span id="s1739">Mine children believe in science.</span> <span id="s1740">They don’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s1741">They don’t -- I said, “It’s a God.”</span> <span id="s1742">What God, what?</span> <span id="s1743">Okay, maybe it’s there.</span> <span id="s1744">But they don’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s1745">They -- the children don’t know what the grandmother went through.</span> <span id="s1746">They don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Are they observing of the Jewish tradition --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: No, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1749">They observing -- they observing Christmas, okay?</span> <span id="s1750">They put a -- my s-son down -- on -- on -- in -- in -- in Los Gatos mountains, has a cathedral ceiling, so he buys a 16 foot tree, and that’s the holiday.</span> <span id="s1751">I gave him a Hanukkah lamp, and I said here -- she is -- is there with the Hanukkah, my granddaughter, he doesn’t show it in the house, cause he has clients, they don’t -- shouldn’t know that he is Jewish?</span> <span id="s1752">Q: What is he doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: He is in why -- vineyards, but they know, because a guy as -- said to him once, “Eddie, you so smart like a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1754">And he said, “And you are good business an -- me -- you make delicious wine, and you smart like a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1755">He said, “Because I am one.”</span> <span id="s1756">I said, “ You said it?”</span> <span id="s1757">Okay?</span> <span id="s1758">Because he gave him a compliment, that he’s so smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Was the --</span></p> <p><span

have here al -- a Mexican friend, and -- y -- what do they know?</span> <span id="s1927">What do they care?</span> <span id="s1928">I don’t talk to them about those things.</span> <span id="s1929">I’m

id="s1934">Q: Why did you agree to do this interview?</span> <span id="s1935">Was it important to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1937">I wanted to call you a few -- a few days ago.</span> <span id="s1938">I said to my friend, “I think I’m going to call, because I have her telephone number, and I’m going to call, and I am going to say that I have nothing to say, because my life is nothing to talk about.”</span> <span id="s1939">And she said, “Don’t do it.</span> <span id="s1940">Just say -- say it.”</span> <span id="s1941">No, to my son I said, “I think I’m going to call it off.”</span> <span id="s1942">He said, “No, go ahead.</span> <span id="s1943">Do it if it makes you happy, do it.”</span> <span id="s1944">I said, “It doesn’t make me happy, it’s going to make me very miserable, but at least I am going to say what I feel here.</span> <span id="s1945">What I have it all -- here in my heart.”</span> <span id="s1946">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: After we have talked now, do you think it was important that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Yes, because you see, you can’t tell a friend what hurts me here, because it’s going to

care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: But do you think there’s something in there that would -- that is import -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Everything is important.</span> <span id="s1958">It can teach children to be better to their parents, to -- more feelings.</span> <span id="s1959">To -- to -- to -- to give them more understanding.</span> <span id="s1960">Everything is better than ab -- than the mother, and they -- they -- they just throw me in the face.</span> <span id="s1961">You -- you -- you didn’t like this ca -- Mark liked -- no, you -- Eddie liked a -- a -- a chocolate parisienne, and you said you like a white parisienne.</span> <span id="s1962">Can you imagine those such -- cakes?</span> <span id="s1963">This is what they threw me in the face.</span> <span id="s1964">You told Eddie this, you -- I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1965">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1966">And you see, that’s what I keep my mouth zipped, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1967">I have nobody to talk to, and -- and children, you should be open with children.</span> <span id="s1968">You should -- you should be able to open you soul, and you heart to the children.</span> <span id="s1969">I am not.</span> <span id="s1970">That’s what -- if I open to a stranger, I know he’s not -- you not going to tell why don’t -- what -- you did this and this.</span> <span id="s1971">I didn’t do anything, I was the best mother in the world.</span> <span id="s1972">I was lucky after the war, for the first child I had, that I still am able to bear children.</span> <span id="s1973">And that was my -- my son and light.</span> <span id="s1974">And they don’t understand that, only that I told them not to do this, or not to do this.</span> <span id="s1975">I taught them how to -- to behave, and how to -- how to have respect for older people, and how to -- to -- to do this.</span> <span id="s1976">And how to -- how to be nice to people.</span> <span id="s1977">They don’t now.</span> <span id="s1978">If I say something to my granddaughter that you shouldn’t do this, you -- you -- you should take the book, and r-read, and use -- use -- you -- you all the time with the feet -- she is very hyper, that little one, because her mother is a drunk, and I think she was drinking when she was pregnant with her, and doping.</span> <span id="s1979">And I said, “What does you mother do -- did?”</span> <span id="s1980">When she remembering, she was three years old, she said, “She is partying.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: How many grandchildren do you have?</span> <span id="s1982">A: Three.</span> <span id="s1983">My son who has the -- the -- the -- the vineyard has two.</span> <span id="s1984">He said he’s going to -- he had them very late, because the -- the oldest is only 11 years old, because he said, “Til I’m not going to have a dynasty, I’m not having children.”</span> <span id="s1985">Okay?</span> <span id="s1986">And -- and she is nine years old, the girl.</span> <span id="s1987">Nine?</span> <span id="s1988">Yeah, she is almost nine.</span> <span id="s1989">So, you see -- so in -- and the third one doesn’t have any, and he has one.</span> <span id="s1990">So he is not with his -- it wasn’t a wife, it was a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1991">He lived with her, and she took everything, and now he lives with her -- in -- in

<span id="s1996">No.</span> <span id="s1997">They live in the woods.</span> <span id="s1998">And he’s a doctor.</span> <span id="s1999">I sent him to school to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s2000">I said, “I pay for you the first year, 12,000 dollars, I pay for you,” and I send him 500 dollars each month to live on.</span> <span id="s2001">And then I said, “Take a -- a -- a loan,” for the -- for the school, and he did.</span> <span id="s2002">I don’t know what he paid, or he didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s2003">She -- she spent everything.</span> <span id="s2004">She owed his credit cards.</span> <span id="s2005">They called me for 40,000 dollars he owes.</span> <span id="s2006">She took on -- on dope.</span> <span id="s2007">And she -- whatever the child want, had.</span> <span id="s2008">That’s what she wants from me, and I said, “I have hard made money, and I can buy you food, I can buy you clothes, what you don’t have.”</span> <span id="s2009">She -- I bought her new clothes a few -- two weeks ago, and every piece of clothes for six -- for -- I bought -- I spent 500 dollars for them.</span> <span id="s2010">So she had on her, four pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s2011">She took new pants, and went to the garage, and -- and walked on the knees.</span> <span id="s2012">And I said, “This is my hard made money, and I can’t afford this.</span> <span id="s2013">I can give you food, I can -- I bought,” -- yesterday I said I’m not going to buy anything, she wants nachos, and she wants this and this, and I bought everything.</span> <span id="s2014">I spent 13 dollars for -- just for her junk.</span> <span id="s2015">And I am no good.</span> <span id="s2016">I hate her, he says.</span> <span id="s2017">You hate her, because you hate Rosie.</span> <span id="s2018">His -- his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2019">And I don’t hate her, I just want her to behave, and to do what’s -- it’s right.</span> <span id="s2020">He said, “Yeah, you would like the hand on her, to -- to discipline her.”</span> <span id="s2021">I said, “Why not?</span> <span id="s2022">She needs discipline.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Did -- were you ever interested in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: No.</span> <span id="s2027">I am not interested in politics, I -- I don’t like what sometimes d -- democrats are doing, sometimes the republic -- I like the democrats, because they are for old people, and they are really care, and -- and the -- the republican is for the rich

you, and for everybody.</span> <span id="s2030">So w-w-what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s2031">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2032">I say sometimes it’s not right, it’s a -- they shouldn’t -- they shouldn’t take away this, and they shouldn’t do this, and -- and they shouldn’t look in in you private life, because it’s not nobody’s business, okay?</span> <span id="s2033">Nobody’s business.</span> <span id="s2034">Now it’s -- it’s -- if you have stucked away something no -- they -- they know about it.</span> <span id="s2035">That’s right.</span> <span id="s2036">You can’t -- you -- you used to say this is for my -- for my rainy day.</span> <span id="s2037">But they know about everything, because the banks are the government.</span> <span id="s2038">Am I right?</span> <span id="s2039">You can’t say nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: I’m supposed -- not supposed to say [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: I-I know, you -- you -- you -- you -- you don’t, but I am saying, that’s -- that’s p-priv -- they took -- I -- I loved America, and I still do, because it was a free country.</span> <span id="s2042">It’s not any more.</span> <span id="s2043">It’s not free.</span> <span id="s2044">Not -- I don’t mean free the money, you have to work for ev -- everywhere for -- to make the money.</span> <span id="s2045">Some is lucky, some are not lucky.</span> <span id="s2046">I -- I worked very hard my life.</span> <span id="s2047">So I made -- I -- I -- I am lucky that I made something for my old age.</span> <span id="s2048">I am lucky because I put it away.</span> <span id="s2049">I stacked it away, every penny.</span> <span id="s2050">And -- and -- and I was happy, oh, I have 10,000 dollars to put into the bank.</span> <span id="s2051">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2052">It -- it -- it -- it was unbelievable, but I was happy, and -- and it was a free country.</span> <span id="s2053">Now, whatever -- you can say anything, you can do anything, and -- and -- and -- and they -- they said in canda, y -- I come in, “What is your social security?”</span> <span id="s2054">They know everything about me.</span> <span id="s2055">That’s not right.</span> <span id="s2056">Y-Y-You -- you -- you -- you do -- do -- does the government have to know when I’m going to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: The -- the government has to know what I’m doing i-if I eat today.</span> <span id="s2059">They don’t -- they don’t give you, but they want to take.</span> <span id="s2060">And that wasn’t before.</span> <span id="s2061">No way.</span> <span id="s2062">That was a beautiful, beautiful country.</span> <span id="s2063">You made whatever you made, and you didn’t take from them, and you didn’t ask for nothing.</span> <span id="s2064">What else can somebody ask?</span> <span id="s2065">I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Is there anything that you would like to add Rose, because I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: What shall I add?</span> <span id="s2068">About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: [indecipherable] asked you question -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: I -- I -- I -- I would like to say I’m not a politician, that the politics -- the politics are too much in this country.</span> <span id="s2071">Too much for us.</span> <span id="s2072">For older people -- they should take more care of the older people, how they live.</span> <span id="s2073">They live in the streets.</span> <span id="s2074">I don’t like to see the homeless.</span> <span id="s2075">I don’t like -- they look to -- to help other countries with the children, how about the children in America?</span> <span id="s2076">They should help the children in America, because it’s plenty of children hungry, and plenty of the -- of the streets, and plenty give -- make -- giving sex for money, because they need the money.</span> <span id="s2077">And plenty of them dying of -- of AIDS, because they -- they have to live, tho -- the -- they don’t care who they sleep with.</span> <span id="s2078">This has to be taken care in America.</span> <span id="s2079">I am not a politician, I am only an old lady, but I see what’s wrong.</span> <span id="s2080">And this is not right.</span> <span id="s2081">Why are you helping Honduras, or whatever in there, or koso -- Kosovo, that’s a very tragic ti -- th -- you have in here, first you have to feed your own in the house, and then look behind you.</span> <span id="s2082">Because if you full, then you look for something else to do, to help somebody else.</span> <span id="s2083">Am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: This time I would say I’m with you.</span> <span id="s2085">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Rose Warner, and thank you very much, Rose, for speaking with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A:
