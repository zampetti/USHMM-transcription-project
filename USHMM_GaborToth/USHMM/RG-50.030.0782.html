war years, I’m going to ask a number of questions about what your life was like in pre-wars years; and the idea is to get a sense of the world you were born into, the people that you knew, who you were close to; so that when the war comes we can understand how things changed, and what was lost.</span> <span id="s15">So my first question is the very basic: can you tell me the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: June 15, 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Village Bahuszets(ph), county of Przemyśl in

to get information from him.</span> <span id="s66">And he knew quite a bit, but he didn’t tell them anything.</span> <span id="s67">And so after three or four times of that, I was ready to give myself up to Gestapo, you know, to save him.</span> <span id="s68">But my mother told me, he already is – have some problems, and the – with his health after those tortures.</span> <span id="s69">So they

local priest, you know, the village priest a very influential person?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well, it depends.</span> <span id="s232">In my time there were two.</span> <span id="s233">One was a long time, but he was not very liked.</span> <span id="s234">And then next one came about two years before – two years maybe t – yeah, t-two years, t-two – three years an – before the war.</span> <span id="s235">And he was very liked, and he was influential, and – and he was completely different than his predecessor.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Bi – what?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, he wa – he’s – he was more with the people, when his predecessor was more of a Ravla(ph) Karszitski(ph), you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: More with the – with the landlord, and more –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes, aristocratic people, and so on.</span> <span id="s242">And – and this wa – they not – successor was more with the people.</span> <span id="s243">And I have something to do with that because when we came, I just happened ba – I [indecipherable] run into him.</span> <span id="s244">And we have a long talk, he asked point blank what happened, because in – bishop, they tell him that this – that this vil – village is qu-quite communist, many communists, which was not true.</span> <span id="s245">It was one.</span> <span id="s246">But the predecessor, well, that was local problems.</span> <span id="s247">There was a – the peasant party, and a youth organization, wici(ph), which was quite radical.</span> <span id="s248">And the organizer of the wici(ph) became communist.</span> <span id="s249">He had some friends in France, and they tend to be communists in France, and they send him some literature –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And he was influenced?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: And he be – got influenced, so he became communist.</span> <span id="s252">But then – and that was the reason the government ca – the county office closed the – the local wici(ph) organization</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: The youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s255">And so they got somebody else on his place, and so he was not influential, this guy in the village, really, but that is what happened.</span> <span id="s256">And 1935, I believe, there was a problem in the village, because the – the landlord had lot of land, and he need – and not much machinery.</span> <span id="s257">He had already some machinery, but a lot of work was done by hand, by people.</span> <span id="s258">So he pay from about a zloty a day, with a – with – on your own food.</span> <span id="s259">So, only a zloty a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So that’s considered not a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: There was not a lot of money – well, that was a lot of money, but not enough, you know.</span> <span id="s262">Food would cost more than zloty a day, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: – or at least zloty for food, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Okay, so somebody who would work his land –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: So the youth, this organization, although was formally disbanded by the government, but they still existed, and they have – they have library, and even [indecipherable] them, because they ask me what kind of book to buy, and they have some eve – may – even some to – correct money for thing.</span> <span id="s267">So they decided to strike.</span> <span id="s268">Well, strike, and here is time of harvest, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: In the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: And he need the people to take care of the – and the priest, previous one, on the – in the church, stated that cris – Christ said muts – pray and work and pray, something like that.</span> <span id="s271">And so, it is cri – it is sin to destroy, to – to do harvest, you know, God’s whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s274">And so – and when he said that from the altar, the young people walk out of the church, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Oh ho.</span> <span id="s276">Oh ho.</span> <span id="s277">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: So that became the story that it is communist, you know.</span> <span id="s279">So, they were not communist, but they just didn’t like it, and when the new priest came, and I – as I said, I just hap – by accident I ran into – to him, about first or second day when we came, before he even has – has a first mass in church.</span> <span id="s280">So we talk, and I tell him all about.</span> <span id="s281">So he change – so he knew how to handle himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: And I was – that was ki – at the end of vacation, when I was – not vacation, but – yeah, in summer, before it’s – the school started.</span> <span id="s284">And so I went to school, to Przemyśl, and by

side, some sneaked through to Poland.</span> <span id="s498">And so we know from them and Polish press, interview them, and so we knew very well what is going on, and that Stalin is not better than Hitler.</span> <span id="s499">But the rest of the Europe, rest of the world didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s500">Especially intellectuals were quite left wing, to the left bent, and they – any those news about gulags, you know, and so on, they consider capitalist propaganda against Soviets, you know, against socialism, which is the future of the mankind, and so on.</span> <span id="s501">But we know quite a bit, and Polish press publish that quite often.</span> <span id="s502">So we had no – we had no –</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Was there – okay.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s518">So this Karszitski(ph), aristocratic family, due to connection with some aristocratic family in Austria – because – the territory was, before the war, part of Austria.</span> <span id="s519">So some of them were even in the Austrian [indecipherable] in parliament.</span> <span id="s520">Polish aristocrat, you know, representing – because Galicia at that time had already [indecipherable] you know, some –</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: You’re talking before the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, be – be – sin-since ni – since ninet – 1868, until

group, you know, how many, some unit.</span> <span id="s529">And they – and they – and the – and the landlord has two villas, one old, and new.</span> <span id="s530">So the Germans took the new villa and family moved to old villa.</span> <span id="s531">And it was old, but little – maybe little – no [indecipherable] from the San River, which was boundary.</span> <span id="s532">From the river you can see the – the other side of the river with the Soviet guards, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Oh really?</span> <span id="s534">You were able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah, well, across the river, boundary.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">So tell me, where were you on September 1st, 1939?</span> <span id="s538">Do you

very quickly, about two, three – three, four days.</span> <span id="s546">About three days before.</span> <span id="s547">The – the government declared mobilization.</span> <span id="s548">So the first civilians, you know, reservists, those who serve two – year or two years ago, start to arrive, but then they started that, because – under pressure from France and England, that there is provocation for Hitler, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: If there – if you mobilize.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: If Poland mobilize.</span> <span id="s551">Because he concentrated army on Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And so that was not provocation, but we mobilize.</span> <span id="s556">That was not provocation.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: So – but couple days later, they declare mobilization again.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: And so I – and we – we – I was in the barrack in t – in town, and we were, all the civilians, we

orders to go somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s564">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: So that was when the war – and September first, early morning, there was alarm in the bar – barracks, because they bomb – they bomb Lwów, which was 98 – about 100 kilometer east, and also some – some – something at the end of the town, some military – this thing, bomb, so, we got alarm.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, the German war planes went – flew as far east as Lwów, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: All Poland.</span> <span id="s568">Q: All Poland, even the parts that were later occupied by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: They had bases already in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s572">They took over before Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s573">Czechs became part of prot-protectorate they call, of Germany, and Slovakia became independent, thanks to Hitler, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: And so, what was the – what were the first days of the war like for you?</span> <span id="s575">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, for me was nothing but we were doing the same thing as before, arming an-and organizing reservists into companies and so on, and send them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s578">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And then was second – third day, finally we get to the train and went west –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: – to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Well, we – that was in the evening.</span> <span id="s584">So we get the warning – well, first thing, that we stop in many places because the tracks were bombed, so they have to wait until they repair tracks.</span> <span id="s585">And we get early morning to Tarnow, so not far from Przemyśl, well, about over a hundred two – about 200 kilometer.</span> <span id="s586">And from there we walk down south, and me – me da – knowing geography for – quite good, we came – I because disturbed because already here, so far away from the west – west, bombing.</span> <span id="s587">But then they got already Slovakia.</span> <span id="s588">So they get off Slovakia northeast, and we –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: So German soldiers –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: – we took – we took the – our regiment – I was that – the division.</span> <span id="s591">We get on Dunajec River, it was de – running from Carpathian mountains north.</span> <span id="s592">So we get down to the river, and it was hilly country, foots of Carpathian mountains.</span> <span id="s593">So down and dig ho-holes, you know holes there, and to defense the river.</span> <span id="s594">So when I get there, I say well, that is – situation was, we back, from we are so far.</span> <span id="s595">And then we hear, very shortly after, artillery, then machine guns south – left from us, not too far.</span> <span id="s596">So well, I know this Slovakia, I had came from Slovakia and – and this is what happened, and that was the first to – we tried to stop them, but we didn’t do much, because further they get from Slovakia, they get on our backs.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Oh, so in other words, you were fighting with German forces that were coming through Slovakia, to Poland, but they were able even to go behind you, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, because Slovakia was reaching further east.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s600">And attack you from the behi – from behind, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah, so it – it – so we were through next day, and I was in – in unit which supposed to slow down the advance of Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: So to help, give time the units to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: To retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: – re-retreat further west – further east.</span> <span id="s606">And at the evening, crossed at the evening [indecipherable] the shooting machine guns, artillery where there was a river, Wisłok river, where our units went.</span> <span id="s607">And so – well, knowing geography so well, there is just Germans get there before we get there, on this.</span> <span id="s608">And the soldiers start to run toward us, you know, back.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Oh, you mean the ones who were retreating are now re – running back towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Coming back to us, you know, we were [phone ringing] – we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Okay, let’s stop.</span> <span id="s612">[break] Okay, so you – before the phone rang, you were telling me that you had some skirmishes, or some fight with the invading German armies, who were coming through Slovakia, but they had circled around and back –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: – and so you’re retreating forces, in – in the end, ended up running back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: And then, I was in the unit which supposed to slow down the main forces, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: C-Coming from west.</span> <span id="s620">And so it wa – er – I was – but my druzyna, means section, 18 soldiers with machine gun.</span> <span id="s621">Then it was one heavy machine gun, and that was one anti-tank gun.</span> <span id="s622">So, altogether those three different units, the sergeant was a commander of that.</span> <span id="s623">So when the soldiers start to come in, he ask what is going on.</span> <span id="s624">So – and they said that, our forces were crossing the bridge, when from the southwest, from Slovakia, the tanks, German tanks, machine guns and artillery, start to bombard this bridge.</span> <span id="s625">So many people were killed on that bridge.</span> <span id="s626">And then panic, on – somewhere on this side, didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s627">Some try looking for some spot where the river is not deep, so they can walk across.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: And this is the San River?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, that was Wisłok.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Wisłok, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Wisłok.</span> <span id="s632">And – Wisłoka.</span> <span id="s633">Wis – Wisłok and Wisłoka, this was Wisłoka.</span> <span id="s634">Wisłok is next one.</span> <span id="s635">And – and so the sergeant, after hearing that, disarm – disbanded the whole thing.</span> <span id="s636">Go anywhere you want, destroy the arms, and go wherever you want.</span> <span id="s637">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: So you didn’t surrender to the Germans, you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Disarm and go wherever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Go home.</span> <span id="s644">And so I asked my soldiers, my 18 soldiers, who came from the villages where we were going, near Rzeszów - Przemyśl so, on the way, if they wanted, I – I am sure the next – next defense line will be on San, and I know the territory, so [indecipherable] go northeast, so we will get there, if night comes, we will get there.</span> <span id="s645">All 18 decided to go with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So you would continue fighting on a different location?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, not fighting, we were just marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Marching, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: To get to – to the la – the defense line.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: And so we stop, we sleep at ti – at – during the day, and walk at night –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: – because the airplanes.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: But before we get there, there was what, three days, the – many civilians from [indecipherable] this was part of Czechoslovakia which was [indecipherable] Poles and Czech in 1918, local, divided this territory according – living as – as many Poles on Czech side and Czechs on Polish side.</span> <span id="s656">So this part, th-they decided this line [indecipherable] river was the boundary, and that was part of west side of the river.</span> <span id="s657">But Beneś the –</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Edward Beneś, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: – Edward Beneś, the prime minister of Czecho – Czechoslovakia –</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: – Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: – after the war, he was with Masaryk in Paris, and he has good contacts, and take him – Poland was – has a problem with Ukrainians, you know, in the east.</span> <span id="s662">Then still Germans were in the west, and the Soviets are coming, approaching from the east.</span> <span id="s663">So the – they has to – in the army, that the army was in the west.</span> <span id="s664">So they decided and they took this t-to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s665">And this became, you know, point of –</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Contention.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: – contention, the hard feeling between Poles and Czechs.</span> <span id="s668">So, in 1938, when Hitler get the Sudetenland, Poland took this part to the line which they were divided bet – b-by Poles and Czechs in 1918.</span> <span id="s669">And they were really good Poles.</span> <span id="s670">They were oh – ma – one interesting thing, they were not Catholic, they were Protestant.</span> <span id="s671">And, on the way when I go there, couple hundreds of those young men from [indecipherable] who serve in Czechs army, they – wh-when the war break out, when that – they wa – went to Polish places to mo – to get mobilized, to get to Polish army.</span> <span id="s672">But they were moving already, because approach mu – Germans were approaching, so they were moving.</span> <span id="s673">And they were walking, trying to get mo –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: To the Polish side.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: – to Polish uniforms, and arms, and fight.</span> <span id="s676">And – but I don’t remember now, 150 to cro – close to 200 of them joined me.</span> <span id="s677">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s680">And I was walking with unit of 18 soldiers with arm, and everything, and here, civilians, you know.</span> <span id="s681">And I – this is – I get them to the San River.</span> <span id="s682">There was a major who take this, my druzyna, my – this 18 soldiers away, uniform, and armed.</span> <span id="s683">And he got couple hundred civilians like that, walking, trying to get mobilized.</span> <span id="s684">And I don’t know how many, four or 500 of them.</span> <span id="s685">He told me to li – get them to the s – railroad station, which was quite a way.</span> <span id="s686">Its took nex – one day and next to railroad station to Lublin, and they’d get – they will be mobilized there –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: – arms, and organize.</span> <span id="s689">So this is the way I lost my soldiers, and I [indecipherable] in uniform, with four or 500 civilians, I walked to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s690">And next day we get to the station, train was waiting for us, and – but it take all day, although there was not far, about a hundred, maybe 120 kilometers, but tracks were bombed, so we have to wait until they – they fixed the tracks, so we can go back.</span> <span id="s691">And we get – but by evening we get to Lublin, and we just get off the – not on this pre – passenger station, because there was not passenger car, but the to – no, cattle cars, you know, those bar –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Oh yeah, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: You know.</span> <span id="s694">Covered, but not – not person.</span> <span id="s695">So it start in the – not in the personal station, but in the station where they unloaded –</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Freight.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: – cargo.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s700">So, and we just get off this station on the streets, when the last le – be – before evening, the last air force at the German air force attack, and they bombed this station completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: But we were lucky –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: You got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: – a few minutes before, we left this.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Amazing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: It was.</span> <span id="s709">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s710">And it was a su – funny observation.</span> <span id="s711">So we fell down, you know [indecipherable] you know, we fell down in the street, and against the fence, wooden fence.</span> <span id="s712">What wooden fence give you protection?</span> <span id="s713">But this is – this, you know, in there, some feeling that you got some protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Well, you know, the – how the human mind works in panic –</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: – you know, it’s – it’s – it’s crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: And so then, after that, I get this old group, and policeman show me the road to – to military barracks.</span> <span id="s718">So get there, it was dark already, and the – I went inside, we – on the yard, we sit down.</span> <span id="s719">And I went inside to report to some – some major in charge.</span> <span id="s720">So I report to him, and he told me sorry, the Germans cr-cross Vistula River, just west of Lublin, and we are evacuating down, so get your people and walked over [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s721">And I said well, we didn’t eat all day, so can we have something to eat?</span> <span id="s722">Well, there is no problem, the kitchen is still working.</span> <span id="s723">So we wait there, we get good.</span> <span id="s724">That was the last military –</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: – dinner –</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: – I get in my life.</span> <span id="s729">And it was good one.</span> <span id="s730">And so after the supper, the – during night, we walk, and by morning we get close to Chełm.</span> <span id="s731">There was some officer, a lieutenant who si – directed us to the forest nearby.</span> <span id="s732">And in this forest, there were mountains of uniforms, guns, machine guns, artillery even, pieces, brand new, not even used.</span> <span id="s733">Still like they were prepar – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Preparing?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: – in their [indecipherable] houses.</span> <span id="s736">And the other people, and other soldiers, and they were organizing, forming.</span> <span id="s737">And so I get to some major; an older fellow.</span> <span id="s738">I still remember he didn’t use [indecipherable] but he had just cap, and his white hairs, you know, he see – he was fighting during 1920 with the war with Soviet Union, Poland and the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s739">And so – and he – he was a really te – very ideal commander.</span> <span id="s740">And he, fast – fast – you know, take this stuff, and put down, and grab – we have to get fast from here.</span> <span id="s741">And lucky that he did this, be – he organize battalion.</span> <span id="s742">I became again, commander of druzyna, 18 soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s744">And so those – those two hun –</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: And we walk not too far away from the forest, and not in column, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: – but we spread already.</span> <span id="s748">When the air – German airplanes start to bomb this forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: So we fell down on fields, and just seeing not too far away, what was going on there.</span> <span id="s751">They hid – you know, there were many ammunition.</span> <span id="s752">So they bomb it, and the ammunition –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Would explode.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: – explode.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: And so it was a hell, completely hell.</span> <span id="s757">And then we look in our major, and see how smart he is that he push us fast, fast, fast, you know, we get out.</span> <span id="s758">And then I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Was it – was this pla – you said this munitions mound of – of – of – of weaponry was in the middle of a forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: They bring from warehouses, you know, before the Germans arrive.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s762">And was it visible, do you think, from the sky?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Well, the forest was – it was in the forest, but they can see it as –</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: – here and there, the ki – the for – the trees don’t cover –</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: – completely –</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: – everything, so they can see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: So it was a great target.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And they see there are many people around, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: So then there we were with th – with this battalion, with this major, I was participating in the very, very si – hard fight.</span> <span id="s774">I lost from my 18 people, I lost six.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Oh, that’s a third, yeah, that’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah, but we were fighting until 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: September 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s781">We were fighting Germans, and on – from the back, we got Soviets.</span> <span id="s782">That was somewhere between Zamosc and Tomaszów Lubelski.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Did you – so, first you we – you had this equipment, and you were fighting the Germans, and then when were you fighting the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well, we were not fighting, because that was – they was in the middle of Poland already.</span> <span id="s785">Matter of fact, this territory, they were – next day they stop and wer – withdrew, because they decide to change the boundary between Germany and Soviet occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Had you any idea, did – you personally, did you have any idea that there had been an agreement between the Nazis and the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No, we didn’t have any idea about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s789">Okay.</span> <span id="s790">So it must have been a surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: We know that they were – between Hitler and Stalin, they were the worst enemies, you know, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: The – this anti [indecipherable] pact with Germany, Italy and Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Against Soviets, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So it must have been a real surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yes, it was a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s799">So you fought until the 27th of September?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: That’s a good long time.</span> <span id="s802">Wasn’t Warsaw already occupied by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Warsaw was – Warsaw surrendered next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Twenty-eighth?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Twenty-eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So, what was the – what was the surrender like for you?</span> <span id="s807">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Well, the surrender was like this, our major – we were marching during the night, fighting during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: As I said, I know geography, and I was quite disturbed that we were practically fighting in some unit, same territory, not too far away.</span> <span id="s811">We on – we get information that we try to – back through German line to help Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Lwów was still fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: And so that we – well, but that was too strong, we cannot break through them.</span> <span id="s816">So we back some up – so then we withdrew, move someplace else, try something someplace else.</span> <span id="s817">So that was the – our situation.</span> <span id="s818">And then finally, one day, to our surprise, at evening, instead of march somewhere, they told us to go to forest and sleep.</span> <span id="s819">Na-Naturally, we – guards and so on.</span> <span id="s820">So, next morning, it was September, you know, a short – day short already.</span> <span id="s821">We get up, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s822">So finally officers get out, and in order to – company, there was three companies in battalion, plus one platoon of machine guns, heavy machine guns.</span> <span id="s823">And we had also one artillery piece assigned to this battalion.</span> <span id="s824">So we get on the – near the fo – out of forest, on the field, organized like in – like in a – peace time.</span> <span id="s825">Company, company, you know?</span> <span id="s826">And then the major get to us, and he said just one not very nice word.</span> <span id="s827">He speak le – to – I speak to you last time, and so he says here, you know, what we went, here are Germans, here are Soviets.</span> <span id="s828">It was completely surprise to us, that was 27.</span> <span id="s829">And then cross the border 17, but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s830">We were in fight – we don’t – we had no radi – radio, we don’t have press, and ja – newspaper, or anything.</span> <span id="s831">We were fighting during the day, and marching at night, from one spot to another spot.</span> <span id="s832">So destroy the arm, and go home.</span> <span id="s833">And at that moment, lieutenant,

and his wife wash my shir-shirts, and so on.</span> <span id="s1128">So – and there was my station, you know.</span> <span id="s1129">And so – so I get to there and I – morning, I – his wife should go to my parents, make arrangements when and where we can meet, and i-in meantime, I decided to go to Przemyśl, it was just about a kilometer, and to say goodbye to my first love, you know.</span> <span

get to ticket, this 30 kilometer, you know, to Przemyśl, and get the ticket, and suddenly I felt some heavy arm on my shir – shoulders here.</span> <span id="s1134">I look; two Ges-Gestapo guys grab my arms, put handcuffs, hit me in the face from one side, from the other side.</span> <span id="s1135">I supposed to keep balance, you know, from both side I get, and kick me, and walk me out.</span> <span id="s1136">And I know ya – I know Jarosław, I was in military, very small town.</span> <span id="s1137">At that time it was not even 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s1138">And they took over apartment building opened just before the war in ’38, I believe.</span> <span id="s1139">And they kick out all the tenants and owners, and took this over, and they have offices there.</span> <span id="s1140">They walk me there to basement, and you know, each tenant had the space in the basement, storage room, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: So, because they got, for winter the coal, there’s some – some fruits for winter.</span> <span id="s1143">They prepare in Poland, you know, for winter.</span> <span id="s1144">So th – each one has a storage room.</span> <span id="s1145">So they change those storage, the – the wooden walls they make concrete walls, concrete floors, steel door, and make cells.</span> <span id="s1146">They walk me into one of those cells.</span> <span id="s1147">There was a hook in the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1148">They took the – took the handcuffs off, and tied my arms in the back with – with rope, and put this over this hook, pulling me up so I was hanging on my arms in the back, not touching floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">It was painful, believe me.</span> <span id="s1152">And they walk f – they went to lunch, because it was the lunchtime.</span> <span id="s1153">So that was – when they ge –</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: So you were hung like a piece of meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1156">Not touching floor.</span> <span id="s1157">It was painful.</span> <span id="s1158">You know, I had the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Your arms like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: – arms like that, yeah, and the time goes on, you know, it was painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Your arm – your sockets – arm sockets and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1163">So when they came back – I don’t know how long time – how long time – how long they were, and took me down, I was half conscious.</span> <span id="s1164">So they put the handcuffs back in my – my arms in handcuffs in the back, and walk me upstairs, and th – we got instruction from the underground, that if you speak – understand Germans, don’t say.</span> <span id="s1165">They have to give you interpreter, so I will have little time to figure out the lie, a good lie, you know.</span> <span id="s1166">And so this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1167">I had German in s – in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So you understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: So I understood.</span> <span id="s1170">I said no, so they give interpreter.</span> <span id="s1171">And besides that, and this guy who – it happened it was deputy chief of the Gestapo who handled my case.</span> <span id="s1172">He got somebody to help him.</span> <span id="s1173">So they all were armed with wooden stick.</span> <span id="s1174">I was sitting on floor, handcuffs in the back, sitting on floor, and they were helping me answer –</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: The questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: – the questions, helping me, you know, beating my back, anyplace that, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: They could find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: – they wanted, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: And that was going on from lunchtime until dark.</span> <span id="s1181">That was May 22nd, so the day is long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Nineteen fo – 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Oh, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Forty-three, yes, because I was on the go, I was sick, I – so I – so that’s 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Okay, so you had been really in the underground for – for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Just about, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Three years, yeah.</span> <span id="s1189">A long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: So finally they change it up for dinner, somebody else came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: They changed shifts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Shifts, you know, but I was just all the time sitting on floor –</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: What were they asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: They asking many questions, and among those questions came one quite often, Sarzyna.</span> <span id="s1195">Sarzyna, I know it is a village, a railroad station for local trains, not far away from this, about three – third or fourth station from this town Jarosław.</span> <span id="s1196">So this is all what I know, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1197">But quite often this Sarzyna came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Did they know your real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: No, I – I have false – I di – they got my I.D., ja – Jan Sobchuk(ph), born in – under Soviet occupation that – well now they occupied this territory, so they can check that.</span> <span id="s1200">So it was – don’t cover me any more.</span> <span id="s1201">So and I don’t know what time it was, but it was dark already, May 22nd, so day is long.</span> <span id="s1202">When he hit me here on the right side, on this right side of the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: [indecipherable] head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: And I faint, first time in my life.</span> <span id="s1205">So they dump some cold water on my face, keep me in – drag me down to the same cell I was hanged before, and threw me into cell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Did they string you up again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: No, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: They just left you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: – took – just threw me in so I fell down floor, was concrete floor, and I don’t know, I sleep, or I was lo-losing consciousness because I was waking up, and down.</span> <span id="s1210">You know, I – I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1211">All day next, I remember just that I was – sometimes I wa – a – awake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: And I feel thirsty, I was thirsty, not hungry, but thirsty.</span> <span id="s1214">And so na – night again, and next day brought – brought me breakfast.</span> <span id="s1215">And after breakfast they walk me upstairs to the same room I was there interrogation, same people.</span> <span id="s1216">And – but they don’t – before, they don’t ask me even to sit down on floor, like this you – you get to the – and some military sergeant from milit – German military walk, and look at me and told no.</span> <span id="s1217">So I don’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1218">And after that, they took me back down to the same cell, and shortly after, four other prisoners, they brought four prisoners.</span> <span id="s1219">And one of them was in much worse shape than I was, you know, beat and wounds, broken.</span> <span id="s1220">Back he had broken like – he had cut across –</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: His back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: – the muscle, you know.</span> <span id="s1223">And that was – that was – he was in pain because that was infected.</span> <span id="s1224">So all the time – fi-fi-finally it broke out, so he got little relief for day or so, and it t-turn over again.</span> <span id="s1225">And so he walk in and he says pardon me [indecipherable] you know, you re – you remind me somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: This man who had been so tortured –</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Beaten and tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: – beaten.</span> <span id="s1229">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: But he says, we cannot – I cannot talk because this guy at the door, he is with them.</span> <span id="s1231">So, when they took this guy to deliver food in – to prisoners, you know, in other cells, he told me, you remind – you look like Polish ranger from Sarzyna who two or three weeks before, shoot and kill the deputy chief of the Gestapo, in Jarowsław, from Jarowsław.</span> <span id="s1232">District of Jarowsław.</span> <span id="s1233">So that was the explanation.</span> <span id="s1234">I just look – happened to look like this guy who shoot this chief of the gest – this is the reason they torture me so badly, because they thought that I am the guy who killed deputy chief of the Gestapo, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: And so this – this man who had been so tortured, thought that y – do you think he has been the one who identified you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1238">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No, no, he don’t even identify me.</span> <span id="s1240">He told me just that I look like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: – like him, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: I understand now.</span> <span id="s1244">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: And now – so I know that, and the – just that they’re saying – next day or so, we were in the cell, and we hear beating somebody – somebody c-crying, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Sc – right, screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: – and screaming, and they dragged somebody – and across our cell, was – was storage, empty storage for coal for winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: So in June it was empty.</span> <span id="s1250">So they drag him there, and they were pounding him there, and he is screaming; his moan, it was weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s1251">So finally they drag him out.</span> <span id="s1252">And shortly after, that was si-six o’clock, or seven o’clock, they bring us something to eat.</span> <span id="s1253">So this guy went to deliver the food, and when the Gestapo guy opened the door, he was sweat, and says this: he was strong Pole.</span> <span id="s1254">He got 300 lashes, and he is still alive.</span> <span id="s1255">So this is all what – how – how they counted, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: But anyway – but next morning this guy went to deliver breakfast, and he said that when he return that he help get the body out, he died during the night, this guy.</span> <span id="s1258">So after that – you know, I got here false identification.</span> <span id="s1259">Now they will check, because they occupy this territory.</span> <span id="s1260">So next problem is [indecipherable] next day they call me up.</span> <span id="s1261">And again, sitting on the floor, pounding.</span> <span id="s1262">He threw this identification card in my face, and he says [indecipherable] who are you?</span> <span id="s1263">And again, we had story with my family and my friends and my relatives, that I dated some girl, and father don’t like that.</span> <span id="s1264">And we quarrel with father on that.</span> <span id="s1265">And one day after quarrel I pick up my things and I walk away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: They don’t know what happened to.</span> <span id="s1268">So I told this story – oh I – they did check later, but probably they didn’t believe it, because they keep me there, and ev – I went through about four interrogation, or five.</span> <span id="s1269">And the new prisoners, they walk in, they ask sa – they got my picture, they took my – they didn’t get my pictures, I was again instruction, if we’ll got pictures, get away.</span> <span id="s1270">And shortly before I – I – I was arrested, I took all the pictures, including the pictures wi-with my diploma, graduation from high school.</span> <span id="s1271">Matura, you know [indecipherable] with the picture.</span> <span id="s1272">I took this away to some relatives far away.</span> <span id="s1273">So they didn’t had any pictures, but they make pictures, and they sh – there’s – new prisoners walk in, and – and I – and they tell me, oh – because [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: – they show me your pictures, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: – I know you.</span> <span id="s1278">Well, nobody there – from them knew me, because I was not working in this territory, I was little further away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: So nobody knew me from the underground in this part of the town – of the county.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1282">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: So this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: I have a – I have a – a question that I want to clear up.</span> <span id="s1285">When you said you already had a story made up, of you – a story made up that you had quarreled with your father because of a girl –</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: – and you said they go to check that story.</span> <span id="s1288">Do they go to check that with your real father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: So then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: I didn’t know about that, I learned that about the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: – when – when we were finding –</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: You learned that much later.</span> <span id="s1295">Much, much –</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Yes, I learned that much later, that when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: So then they knew your – they

the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: This is the reason I have a pseudonym, and this is my real name, and this is – okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: [indecipherable] he throw

try it.</span> <span id="s1316">It is a Polish culture to protect women, especially in situation like sh-she is his lover, not wife or – or – and so you won’t get anything from him, because this is a Polish culture, and he won’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: He won’t – he won’t tell you about the woman, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Tell you about the woman, a-address and and

sup – he thinks that oh, some others, oh, some belong.</span> <span id="s1429">So 10 or 12 people were arrested, and put in jail in this town, small town.</span> <span id="s1430">And the jail – the guards were Ukrainian nationals, working together with Germans.</span> <span id="s1431">And the underground [indecipherable] about it, lived not far away, and they decided in first action to te – tonight get them out.</span> <span id="s1432">If they don’t take them for night, get them out from jail.</span> <span id="s1433">Because if they take – take them to Rzeszów [indecipherable] where is military and the Gestapo, and German police and so on, is impossible.</span> <span id="s1434">But here they can do it, because they got only this Ukrainian guards.</span> <span id="s1435">And so they get this – get those Ukrainians lock in one of the cells, get all these prisoners out.</span> <span id="s1436">And they get death sentence for this guy who give the names of all others.</span> <span id="s1437">So they get him out of the jail, near forest, and shoot him.</span> <span id="s1438">And this moment, alarm from Rzeszów, cars are going.</span> <span id="s1439">That was night.</span> <span id="s1440">So, no Poles have a car – car, so they knew it was Germans.</span> <span id="s1441">So, alarm, and they ran into forest with the prisoners, and this guy was left there.</span> <span id="s1442">And it just happened he was not killed, he was – he lost conscious – consciousness, but was still alive.</span> <span id="s1443">And when the Germ – Gestapo arrived, find out what happened, and find him, they put him in car, rush him to Rzeszów, and to hospital, and get somebody there of their own people to stay with him, and tell doctor to get him par – do everything possible to get him for – back consciousness, you know.</span> <span id="s1444">So they want to ask him who did, because he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1447">So this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1448">And this guy, before he lost – he gained consciousness for a moment, and they ask him who, and he says one word, Miaska(ph).</span> <span id="s1449">Well, they know that the ammunition was losed in this action, was Russian ammunition.</span> <span id="s1450">And this Russian ammunition is this – in this camp, which belonged to Gestapo Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1451">This is Gestapo Rzeszów.</span> <span id="s1452">So they contact Jarosław that from this camp just – was just ammunition here, so you got somebody who carry out this ammunition to Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1453">So – and they got Miaska(ph).</span> <span id="s1454">So get [indecipherable] in Jarosław, get to the camp, to this camp where this

id="s1457">But they get him back, and when the Gestapo raise hands, he grab on knees, and cry and tell them everything what they – what he knew, what he think, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1458">So they came to conclusion that this can’t be this guy, you know, leader of the underground group –</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Cause he talks too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: He was afra – scared, you know.</span> <span id="s1461">I know ye – I was with him in cell for several weeks later.</span> <span id="s1462">So they came to conclusion that it can be

factories, armament factories, so the – many people work before the war, so the Germans naturally used that – worked there.</span> <span id="s1612">So the – and then – well, I was hesitated what to do, I was not sure if my identification card will be good enough, you know.</span> <span id="s1613">So, there were people as – still some people left.</span> <span id="s1614">And there was one Polish

id="s1878">A: – the wife and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Well, that’s what my thought was, that in some ways maybe they were hostages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Well, they were at – hostages, but to some degree, you know.</span> <span id="s1881">No, they would probably be transferred to Siberia, but they stay, and they need to eat, you know, so they have to get some supply.</span> <span id="s1882">So, because of that, they were living pla – practically normal life.</span> <span id="s1883">So what happened after that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: But this is interesting, that the Polish underground was supplying, or at least this general – this general was supplying intelligence to the Soviets on the other side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Well because, as I said, that was the reason, because he tried to help your wife –</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: His wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: – and children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: After all, he has said, even – and we believe that, that after the – during the first World War, the war between countries which partition Poland – Russia, Germany and Austria, the war between them, between Austria, Germany and Russia bring the Poland independence.</span> <span id="s1890">So we felt that if this can happen, so we be – we – we be – we trying to do something to convince Soviets, and you know, so th-they get fight – start to fight among themselves, because we came to conclusion that would be good for Poland.</span> <span id="s1891">So that was – you know, life is very complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: It is complicated.</span> <span id="s1893">So you sta – so they – at some point they let you go back on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Not just go back, they organ – I stayed there two or three days, because they have to check something on me, and check this material.</span> <span id="s1895">And after about three days this guy came and says, it is very – he says, it looked at the German are preparing war against Soviets – not him – don’t say Soviets, but Socialist Republic, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s1896">And I say – I said, wi-wi – from this information we get, it looks like that, because more and more troops is in – practically in the village – in many villages.</span> <span id="s1897">Farmers’ villages are full of military units.</span> <span id="s1898">So they don’t come there for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: – any other reason.</span> <span id="s1901">So – and buy he d – we don’t believe, and Stalin don’t believe that – that will happen.</span> <span id="s1902">And Stalin didn’t believe to the last day.</span> <span id="s1903">But the grou – the military units –</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: The military –</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: – got the information, so they were very not happy with the possession of Stalin, but they cannot do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: So this is the military intelligence units?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: The GRU.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: GRU, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1911">And so they come, and they – they’re then convinced that you are fr –</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Then – and so he come – he says, you fine [indecipherable] I was ba – three days, maybe four days even.</span> <span id="s1913">So one of the fine – I was – start to worry, you know, what will happen, that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1914">Oh, they put me in the house across, on the street [interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Okay, so you’re starting to worry what’s going to happen, will they let you go?</span> <span id="s1916">And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Yes, and the one evening he come, and we drove to the certain spot, and he get off the car and he’s – tell me, lay down here so nobody will see you, as we were close to the river.</span> <span id="s1918">And he says, we have all – look at.</span> <span id="s1919">There were every mut – I don’t know, 10 - 15 meters, Soviet soldier watching the other side.</span> <span id="s1920">And they watched the German, on the other side Germans, where they are.</span> <span id="s1921">And he says, in proper moment, you see – you see, this is boat here.</span> <span id="s1922">There was a guy from the other side with boat on this side, and when the Germans guards were far away, we cross.</span> <span id="s1923">So I crossed the river on boat, to the house, which was – he got some contact with them, because they told me to stay in this house until morning because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: – police hours at night –</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Right, curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: – you know, curfew.</span> <span id="s1928">And so I stay in this house, and the – they got like – well, not in the house itself, but like before that, cover with some walls and so on, entrance to the house, and they got nice soft place, so I just lay down there and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: And you slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: And I slept til morning.</span> <span id="s1931">And in morning – oh, and I get some money from there.</span> <span id="s1932">But the Polish money, this silver 10 dollars – 10 zlotys before the war, which were still good in German occupation.</span> <span id="s1933">And so I was very happy, this is the reason I could not walk, you know, they brought me across with the thing.</span> <span id="s1934">So I left part of this money over there, because I would look –</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: – funny, suspici – when I walk out of place where I stay, to my friends.</span> <span id="s1937">And I leave part of – with them.</span> <span id="s1938">When – I leave for them also for the service I got.</span> <span id="s1939">And then the rest I bring to [indecipherable] to this deputy chief of this unit, and I give him and he is give – give me some, and took, I don’t know for whom he or else he get for himself.</span> <span id="s1940">But anyway – and that was the end of my espionage work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q:

released, and that it didn’t matter that there was no evidence against you, that it was very arbitrary, very often.</span> <span id="s1959">And you were taken from your prison to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Tell me about that journey, and how you got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: Well, journey is very

open already so the trains get to the station and the people walk directly from the – for us we get to Auschwitz and from Auschwitz, like on trucks they dri-drive us to Birkenau, and then unloaded us, and is – is usually everything – we drop everything.</span> <span id="s1970">Well, we were nude, we walk to a shower.</span> <span id="s1971">So, luckily they put a – they took us to shower, not to

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: You know, it depends on the officer SS, who was on duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: How long does it take to get tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: How long does it take to get tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Well, it does not take long time.</span> <span id="s2008">There’s just tattoo, like some others they have nice girls, or – or boys, or something, you know.</span> <span id="s2009">Same thing, just the number, so it does not take too long.</span> <span id="s2010">And –

small?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Too big.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Too big.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: I could – I could probably reach to the back, you know, and pants was – were good, and so – and then in Buchenwald, when they transferred me to Buchenwald, the – we get over there this uniform, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Prisoner uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: – prisoners’ uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2024">So there you are.</span> <span id="s2025">What month of the year did you – were you shipped to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: End of September, or beginning of October, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: So that meant you had already been in captivity about four or five months, since May.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: More – May – May 22nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: So it would be May – June, July –</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: June, July, August

months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2037">And what happened after you put on the clothes and – and the – and the jacket –</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Well, they s – they s – to – brought us to – to barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: And that was their special for – for quarantine, you know.</span> <span id="s2041">So it was in this qu-quarantine field.</span> <span id="s2042">Because Birkenau has the fields, each field divided from each other by regular fence, a wire fence, you know.</span> <span id="s2043">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Did you see other prisoners there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s2046">They were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Not just from the cattle car, but ones who had already been there, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Yes – no, well, dif – as I said, the fields were only fence, so – and there was no guard or anything, so you can go to the fence and talk to the fellow on the other side.</span> <span id="s2049">So – but on one side there were Gypsies, so not much – from all over the Europe whatever – whatever the languages they talk, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2050">On the other side I don’t remember even wa – what field it was.</span> <span id="s2051">So – and I spend there three weeks, and after three weeks, instead of go to different field, or to Auschwitz, they transport me to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Oh, so you were in Auschwitz just for three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Just for three weeks in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: In Birkenau –</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: And that was this extermination camp for Jews and Gypsies.</span> <span id="s2056">There were four crematoriums working 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s2057">Fifth was built, and the gas chamber, and the whole families from trains, from this ghetto cars, were simply drived there to – to gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2058">They told them that they are going to take shower; instead of water, was gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Can you – d – when you were there, do you remember seeing those crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Well, I see them from apart, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Distance, from a distance, but did you know what –</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: From a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: Did you know what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: Well, sure we know, because they were all prisoners who were kapo, you know – na – da – well, not kapo, the kapo was at work, we were not working.</span> <span id="s2065">But block leader, and the stubendienst – well, in Auschwitz they call schreiber in Buchenwald they call stubendienst.</span> <span id="s2066">They were working – they were not working hap – they working in barrack.</span> <span id="s2067">The block leader, he was the head of the block, and his helper, schreiber they called, secretary, or stubendienst in Buchenwald, would take care of cleaning the barrack when we go to work, bring food at the evening for us when we return from work, so we s – the soup was there already, a-and so on.</span> <span id="s2068">And clean the place.</span> <span id="s2069">So they were old prisoners, so they know a – so – and when – when wind blew from crematoriums in our barrack, we had smell – burning, characteristic odor, smell.</span> <span id="s2070">Very characteristic – flesh, burning flesh.</span> <span id="s2071">It was different smell than normal, you know, something burning.</span> <span id="s2072">So we did know at the beginning what – why there is different, so they told us; this is the burning flesh, smell of burning flesh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: And so – so we saw the – I saw from not too far, was maybe not even half a block through the pour – to this ramp where they get these prisoners, this Jewish families, and walked them to – get them to gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2075">So they said –</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: So you saw some of those families being walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: Oh yes, from not – really not too far.</span> <span id="s2078">I said not half a – not even half a block.</span> <span id="s2079">Less than that.</span> <span id="s2080">Women with babies in their arms.</span> <span id="s2081">Some young children, small children hanging to her mother’s shirts or you know, or father pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: And you already knew where they’re going?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Oh yes, we know.</span> <span id="s2084">You know, that is something – so I was very glad when they took me, you know, to – that we are going some – that I am going somewhere.</span> <span id="s2085">Not alone, but with the – hundreds of others.</span> <span id="s2086">We didn’t know where, but w-we – I wa – I was glad that I get out from this, I won’t see any more, you know, those whole families going into gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2087">Especially those other prisoners who work there.</span> <span id="s2088">They got commando called Canada – Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: I don’t know why, because they were very good situation, because when the transport came, they got some bad jo-job.</span> <span id="s2091">Those still alive get out, and they have to – to trans – the train came from far, from Greece or something.</span> <span id="s2092">Was three, four days on the road.</span> <span id="s2093">So they go in and pick up dead bodies, old people and children die in those condition.</span> <span id="s2094">So get those dead bodies.</span> <span id="s2095">And those who get out, sometimes the whole transport go directly to gas chamber, sometimes they make selection, and pick up young women, young men, mor – less often women, more men, to work, you know; young, strong, healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Did you see any of these selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: Well, from afar, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: From afar, from afar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: – close, not close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: So – but they – they si – this – all prisoners, you know, who work over there, they told us what is going on.</span> <span id="s2102">So is – they said that sometimes parents went to gas, and daughter and son, young, strong, stay in the camp, and parents went to gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2103">Well, they didn’t stay in the camp to work long enough, because in the condition and the si – physical and mental – you know, knowing that the parents are dead already, they didn’t stay too long, they – not knowing food, they get weaker, and when they cannot work hard enough, so they follow their parents to gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: The people who – the people who were older prisoners there, were they Polish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: No, they were all different nationalities.</span> <span id="s2106">In Auschwitz majority of them were Poles, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: In Buchenwald, no, but in Auschwitz majority were Poles, because for quite a while Auschwitz was camp for Poles.</span> <span id="s2109">According to history, and I read somewhere, the first transport to Auschwitz, th-they – when they opened the camp – because Auschwitz was, before the war was military barracks.</span> <span id="s2110">They were two floors -- buildings – brick buildings, you know.</span> <span id="s2111">So they just build later crematorium, and some other things they needed, surrounded them with barbed wires, fence and towers with for – with guards with machine guns and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Were you – when you were being transported, did you – did you know that you were being taken to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: No, I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s2116">They get us from Tarnów to train, and this is it.</span> <span id="s2117">I get – when we get close to Auschwitz I knew station, so I thought that maybe we are going to Auschwitz, and we went to – to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2118">Same thing later to Buchenwald, I didn’t know where we go, but I know geography, so on the – on the way, the towns, you know, we pass [indecipherable] I don’t know if I go – we go to Buchenwald, or to Dachau, or some other camp in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Did you know the names of these German camps by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: Yes, we knew some name.</span> <span id="s2121">Dachau we knew.</span> <span id="s2122">We knew Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2123">There was Sachsenhausen near Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: And – no, and – and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2126">So we knew already, especially in underground we know, we got some information.</span> <span id="s2127">We have some prisoners who escape from Auschwitz, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Had you met any of the prisoners who escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: I didn’t met them, but they were in the ungra – underground paper, you know, the condition – this situation over here, what it is there, and so on.</span> <span id="s2130">But when I get there, I still came to conclusion that I – I know very little.</span> <span id="s2131">It is impossible in wars, to describe the ca – the feelings, you know.</span> <span id="s2132">This barbed wires, this guards, those SS men with the dogs, and those prisoners.</span> <span id="s2133">Many they call – they call them – oh gee, remember – the – well they – it will come to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2135">So, what kind of work did they have you do during those three weeks in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Oh, three weeks nothing, we didn’t do anything special.</span> <span id="s2137">That was quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: They wi – we did not left the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: So the block leader, who was German, in this case – in my case, when I was – he was German political communist, they said.</span> <span id="s2142">The stubendienst, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2143">He was, I think, green, because we had triangle.</span> <span id="s2144">Red triangle was political prisoner.</span> <span id="s2145">And there was letter P for Pole, R for Russian, you know.</span> <span id="s2146">And then, on this triangle, below this triangle, was a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: So you – the number that was on your arm was on the triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Yes, also here and here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: On your pants – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Here was also just the number, nothing, no triangle there, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: – but here triangle.</span> <span id="s2153">Then recognize – criminals had green triangles.</span> <span id="s2154">That was – we recognize that is a criminal prisoner.</span> <span id="s2155">Now, the religious, by – those jude – Jehovah Witness, and some other sects who refused to serve in military, so they got purple triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: And was everybody in your barracks with the red triangle with the P?</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: All red – red triangle.</span> <span id="s2158">Well, the first – at the beginning in this tra – in the – in the mar – matter of fact, in Buchenwald too, there were barracks – block, they call it, nationalities.</span> <span id="s2159">There were few blocks in Buchenwald, there were a few blocks Poles only.</span> <span id="s2160">There was also one block for Jews in the – in the camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: In Buchenwald, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: In Buchenwald, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: And they said that there were some engineers, you know, very high, technically educated people, and they need them, so this was the reason they keep them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2166">So after the quarantine – and that was to make sure that you didn’t bring in typhus or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2169">After the quarantine, one day –</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Well, they pick up us again, put in the train, and we went.</span> <span id="s2171">I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2173">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Well, I was lucky that I get to Buchenwald, because many went to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s2177">Which was bad because they got stone quarrel main work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: So the work was very hard.</span> <span id="s2180">They got stone quarrel in Buchenwald too, but this was one of the commanders, not the large one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: So tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: And there were many others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: – tell me, when you got to – did you recognize geographically where you were?</span> <span id="s2184">Could you see through the cattle car?</span> <span id="s2185">Was there a window or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Yes, when we were going – I remember Nysa.</span> <span id="s2187">There’s Nysa now in Poland.</span> <span id="s2188">That is partisan Poland after the war, Nysa, Nysa.</span> <span id="s2189">So, and the po – the train stop there, and some people, Germans, because that was German territory already, some people on the station waiting for train, were talking Polish bandits, Polish bandits are in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Ponish(ph) bandyta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: Ponish(ph) bandytin(ph), yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Ponish(ph) bandyta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Ponish(ph) bandytin(ph), exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: So I hear that from there, through the – and I didn’t feel bad about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: [laughter] Okay, so you knew you were in Nysa, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: Nysa si – well, I didn’t know where we are going, but when we get – we get in Weimar, from the railr – from the station, and we walk, then I came to conclusion that we are probably going to Buchenwald because Buchenwald’s just north or Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: So what train station did you go to, the Weimar central train station, or to a special one that was close to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: No, we – the regular – regular station, that you don’t – don’t have extra trains, other e-extra tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: No extra tracks to the camps themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: No, to the camps they have, but to Buchenwald – and Buchenwald is on – on the slope of a hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: So the train thi – can’t get – can get close to it, but not to the Buchenwald itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2205">And what did it look like as you were going from Weimar to Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s2206">What was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Well, pe – nice territory, this Thuningen(ph), central Germany.</span> <span id="s2208">And Weimar – and – and Buchenwald is sort of – Weimar is just south of Harz mountains, which are very nice – nice range of mountains in Germany.</span> <span id="s2209">And Buchenwald is closer to mountains than Weimar itself.</span> <span id="s2210">Weimar is well known, dred – German [indecipherable] spend a lot of time there, in Weimar.</span> <span id="s2211">And so we walked from Weimar to Buchenwald east, about seven or eight kilometers.</span> <span id="s2212">And at that time Buchenwald was not very bad camp, because that was 1943, at yet the end of September or beginning of October, because they need workers.</span> <span id="s2213">They built – outside of Buchenwald they built 12 factories, 12 holes [indecipherable] each one – in each hole they work – they – they produce something else.</span> <span id="s2214">Majority of this pla – of the holes were producing something for the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: And so, when you got –</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: So, it was th-the holes were – they built barb wires fence same as around Buchenwald, and around the constellation camp, and with everything else.</span> <span id="s2217">And so in the morning when they opened, when we supposed to go to war, the guard took position in those spaces where they supposed to be, and they opened the gates, and we walked to [indecipherable] the holes where we work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: And what ho – wh-what hole were you assigned to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: I didn’t work in this, cause I worked someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Okay, where did –</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: I work for the b – for a while inside the wooden – I split the – the – this part with the roots, you know, of tree, which is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: The trunk of the tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: The end of the tree inside, you know, and cut here.</span> <span id="s2224">So they brought over there, and my job was split them and – in small pieces, so those other guys with saw, they make it wood for burning for whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: Okay, so what you had to do was split the trunks of trees?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2228">And this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: That was light work, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Well, it’s not like lifting stones, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: But it was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Well, sure.</span> <span id="s2234">I learned na – for example, I na – I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s2235">I would think that – that the – the hardwood, you know, it is hard to split.</span> <span id="s2236">And – but the reverse is true.</span> <span id="s2237">Hardwood is easy to split.</span> <span id="s2238">Your make little strength, and they got special steel and wood thing, you know.</span> <span id="s2239">You make in this group, steel – this – I don’t know the na – E-English name for that.</span> <span id="s2240">And you hit with the hammer two or three times, and it wents down, and split little more.</span> <span id="s2241">So make bigger thing, and then you take larger, or even wooden thing, and you hit with heavy –</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: What instrument did you have to use?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: Well, the regular – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: Ax, or hammer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: La – hammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Hammer.</span> <span id="s2247">So you had a hammer to be able to split the wood, but no axes or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: Well, there were axes to help, you know, sometimes, to start, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: To start the process.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: And you say this was inside?</span> <span id="s2252">This work was inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: No, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Outside.</span> <span id="s2255">Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: No, it was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: What did the barracks look like that you were housed in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: Well, the barracks very wooden – they were wooden and they – in – in Buchenwald they – well, Auschwitz was brick, because that was former military barracks.</span> <span id="s2261">But Buchenwald was built, so they have – they have few built brick bil – two floor buildings.</span> <span id="s2262">But majority were bar-barracks, you know, long building, and in the middle – in the middle bi – in the building was entrance, you know, gate, and there was room and across was washroom, you know, toilets and things like that.</span> <span id="s2263">And on both side of – from this all were large rooms, sleeping people.</span> <span id="s2264">There were three – three floors –</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Three levels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: – three levels [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s2267">So – and just narrow spaces between, and again and again, I don’t know, it was 5-600 people in one barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: That’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Did you sleep on a bottom bunk or a top bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: No, I was on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: And which was the better bunk to have?</span> <span id="s2273">Did it matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: It does not matter much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2276">Okay.</span> <span id="s2277">And since there were five or 600 people, were – did – were they of all different nationalities in that one barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: No, usually they have together, as I said, Poles, they have few barracks.</span> <span id="s2279">So I don’t know how many thousands of Poles were in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2280">There were a few thousand Poles in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: And there were Czechs, who were before us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Were there any Soviet prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: No, they were in Auschwitz only.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Well, you see bu – what – I’ve been to Buchenwald –</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: – but of course, in the 80s.</span> <span id="s2290">And yes, in the late 1980s, when it was a memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: And the whole – when I walked into the memorial – I don’t know if you’ve been back –</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: – but when I went into the memorial, the whole place where the barracks had been was all level.</span> <span id="s2295">There was no – no buildings left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2297">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: But there were a few buildings on the side.</span> <span id="s2299">And one of them was a – one of them was supposed to be a doctor’s office, but it was a trick place.</span> <span id="s2300">It was a place where you come to get a medical exam, and you’re standing high to be measured, your height measured, and instead, a little circle opens up at the back of a person’s neck, and a gun is stuck in and then they’re shot.</span> <span id="s2301">And when I went, in the late 1980s, they said this is what was done with Soviet prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2302">So if you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Well, maybe later, when I was not –</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: When you weren’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Because the Buchenwald was bombed in August 1944, and we lost the work there.</span> <span id="s2306">They bomb all those – Americans did very good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Ah, they bombed Buchenwald –</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: They bomb – bomb all the factories, but not the – our barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: So they did very good job.</span> <span id="s2311">And so we lost the wor-work, so they transfer us to different camps.</span> <span id="s2312">So I landed at the end of – again in September ’44, in Bad Gandersheim, about a hundred kilometer further west.</span> <span id="s2313">It was a huge hole, and they supposed to build airplanes.</span> <span id="s2314">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2316">So you were in Buchenwald almost a year.</span> <span id="s2317">Not quite –</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Not quite a year, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Well, that was branch of the bo – Buchenwald, so it – it was part of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: The place that you went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: Bad Gandersheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Bad Gandersheim, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Before we get to there, is – so did you spi – was your work the whole time you were in Buchenwald splitting these trunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2327">No, I – all – all different kind of work.</span> <span id="s2328">We know from underground, you get to Auschwitz, say that you are a gardener, because they got large garden, vegetables and things like that for SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: So that other people work there.</span> <span id="s2331">So I had that.</span> <span id="s2332">Well – but they transfer me from Auschwitz to Buchenwald, and in Buchenwald, garden was very bad place to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Yes, because Buchenwald is in slope over hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: So, it is bad soil.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Yellow clay mixed with sand.</span> <span id="s2339">And now, working in – what I got?</span> <span id="s2340">The whole under shoe, you know, this whole wooden shoe –</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Right.</span></p>

in the – they would have wooden box, quite large, in the middle, and two wooden, big, heavy –</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Handles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: – handles.</span> <span id="s2350">One guy on front, one in the back, and two of us.</span> <span id="s2351">They loaded this box with the foot, and we carry this, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: The manure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: The manure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: The manure, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: On the – on the fields, yeah.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2367">And so I landed in hospital, and that was interesting too, this hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Yeah, tell me, what does a hospital in Buchenwald look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: Well, they – at the beginning they didn’t have much hospital, but as I said, because they sent the workers to mil – they mobilize workers, German workers, so they need to replace them, they replace them with prisoners.</span> <span id="s2370">So that was the situation, that condition were much easier than before.</span> <span id="s2371">So – so finally I got this very – I could not put the shoe – foot in the shoe, so they send me to a hospital.</span> <span id="s2372">There was a barrack like our barracks, large room.</span> <span id="s2373">I don’t remember now how many g – how many beds there were, four, five – 10 – 12 beds in the room.</span> <span id="s2374">And there was head of the room, he was prisoners too, Czech.</span> <span id="s2375">They said that he was male nurse from Czechs’ army, okay.</span> <span id="s2376">So, that evening – so first time I was in bed and sleep good, and although this pain bothering me.</span> <span id="s2377">Next m – next day he walk around and come to me and says, well, what you got here?</span> <span id="s2378">Well, let’s go.</span> <span id="s2379">So we went to next room.</span> <span id="s2380">And next room was operating room.</span> <span id="s2381">There was a table.</span> <span id="s2382">On table was paper like the butcher shops have, you know, white paper.</span> <span id="s2383">There was some prisoners earlier down on this paper, and other prisoners operated – was digging something in his belly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A:

id="s2389">Q: Right, no now – no pain killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: No pain killers, no.</span> <span id="s2391">So we walk by and ne – he put me – he stop and talk to this surgeon for a while, and then he come to me – well, we sit – we sat at the end of the room, and then he come and put me – and he said, you know, he will be with this – digging this belly for a couple of hours, so if you want, I can do this to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: [indecipherable] I was in pain, you know, infection and si – fever.</span> <span id="s2394">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s2395">And so he – he pot – put me – set me on chair like they have in shoe stores, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: You know, it’s – chair.</span> <span id="s2398">And then he walked back and talked to the pri – to this surgeon – to the doctor, and came back and he brought ice pick, jar with some fluid, a scissors and paper bandages, because there was no other bandages during the war, no cotton in Europe because blockade, American and British navy you know, don’t get any – don’t se – don’t – they cannot bring any cotton, or coffee, for example.</span> <span id="s2399">Coffee were – were gold in price in – in – during the war.</span> <span id="s2400">So, he came and he says, are you strong, he asks me.</span> <span id="s2401">I said, oh, I think I am.</span> <span id="s2402">And he look at, I have many marks you know, after beating, the tortures.</span> <span id="s2403">So he says, well, put your hands – and I was sitting on this chair, it’s like shoe store, in the back.</span> <span id="s2404">And he says, don’t touch me.</span> <span id="s2405">Even if it’s very painful, don’t touch me.</span> <span id="s2406">Okay.</span> <span id="s2407">So I gi – I was sitting like that, and he put – and he hit with the ice pick, you know, hit this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Infected area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: – infected area, and stick – and make hole and took scissors in, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2410">I got big marks here after that.</span> <span id="s2411">And it was release you know, because the stuff start to run out, and I feel – felt release.</span> <span id="s2412">The pain was gone, just about.</span> <span id="s2413">And – but when he finally – this – the stuff really run down, he put some dish on the bottom, and when he start and get – this was in this jar, it was alc-alcohol.</span> <span id="s2414">And so when he – this cotton – not cotton, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Paper bandages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: – that pe – pe – piece of paper bandage stuck there, and start to clean, well that was pain.</span> <span id="s2417">It was painful.</span> <span id="s2418">And then, after he cleaned, he just bandaged.</span> <span id="s2419">No sew, nothing, no stitches, nothing.</span> <span id="s2420">No in – nothing, nothing, just – just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Paper bandage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: – cleaned that – cleaned that and paper bandages and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2423">And it – it get together –</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: So how long were you then laying in the hospital for –</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: I got no – I – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2426">Not too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Not too long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2429">And after this, they put me to split those –</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: To split that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: – so that you w –</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: – that was the re-convalescent job, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: [laughter] So that meant that you didn’t have to go in that muck again.</span> <span id="s2437">No more gardening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: No more gardening, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: No more gardening, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: And then what – did you have any other job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: Well, I have – well, if you – they – once in a while they send me to – to here, to there.</span> <span id="s2443">Nothing s – no, ne-neither one was any special.</span> <span id="s2444">Oh, the most important.</span> <span id="s2445">Later, I get as a – as all prisoners already – in Buchenwald there was two lagers, two camps.</span> <span id="s2446">Main camps and small camps.</span> <span id="s2447">Small camps, there was few barracks for quarantine.</span> <span id="s2448">And they were separated by fence.</span> <span id="s2449">By the regular fence, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: – barbed wires, and no ga – ga – guards or anything.</span> <span id="s2452">Only there was a door leading to it in the – in this fence, and there was one prisoner on duty checking permission to – from the camp, to small camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: Why?</span> <span id="s2455">Because the small camp was quarantine camp.</span> <span id="s2456">New prisoners.</span> <span id="s2457">And I, for example, once in four weeks, they re – ke – in Buchenwald, they send postcards to the families.</span> <span id="s2458">It was important to notify family that I am alive.</span> <span id="s2459">Another one they can get – we can get parcels from re – families to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2460">So, not a very important thing with all this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: – not enough food and so on, everybody was getting skin and – bone and skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Sk – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: And – and so it was important.</span> <span id="s2465">So I felt the pa – the – one margarine – before breakfast we got piece of bread, and one margarine, in a regular – regular – you know, one margarine, this thing.</span> <span id="s2466">So it was important to save some piece of bread and piece of the margarine for noon, because at noon you will – we – we were – we were getting half quart of – supposed to be coffee, but there was no coffee.</span> <span id="s2467">Ersatz coffee, that’s terrible.</span> <span id="s2468">So it was important to have piece of bread to work after noon.</span> <span id="s2469">At the beginning we didn’t know that, because everybody – there was not too much, this piece of bread for one –</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2472">For breakfast.</span> <span id="s2473">And so – but [indecipherable] and so this piece of margarine was 25 cents on the black market, and the postcard was four pfennigs – 25 – not cents, but pfennigs, the German – no, German, pfennig –</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: Yeah, pfennigs, pfennig.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: – yeah, pfennig, 25 pfennigs.</span> <span id="s2476">And postcard was four.</span> <span id="s2477">So I give the four margarine for postcard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: This is the way they handle, you know, black market.</span> <span id="s2480">And that was tho-tho-those guards were to protect us from wi – di – from, you know, getting advantage from us, but didn’t work much.</span> <span id="s2481">But anyway, after some – near the end of – before this – when they bombed Buchenwald in August, I was already working in – inside in the ga – in the camp, and I just watched those airplanes bombing with very big smile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: Now, you said there wa – was a Jewish barracks, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: In Buchenwald there was one barrack Jews only.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: And they were privileged – not privileged, but they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Not privileged.</span> <span id="s2486">This way –</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: – but they were kept because they had skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2489">This is what they told us [indecipherable] other prisoners, you know, older.</span> <span id="s2490">They were longer there, so they knew more about, that this is, they are skill workers, and this is the reason they keep them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2492">Did you have any contact with them directly, or were they separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: No, we had no contact, and they warn us other prisoners, don’t get in touch, because if the Germans notice, you can be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2495">Were people dying a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: Well, they were dying.</span> <span id="s2497">They’d get beaten at work by prisoners, other prisoners.</span> <span id="s2498">So there was a system, unhuman system, that human kill other humans.</span> <span id="s2499">Prisoners kill other prisoners just to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: How did – how did killing another prisoner help somebody survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: Well, he was vorarbeiter, or kapo –</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: – you know.</span> <span id="s2504">So he didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2505">So that was great advantage.</span> <span id="s2506">Even if he don’t get more food, or anything, but at least he doesn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s2507">So, he has more chances, you know, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: But he have to do the job.</span> <span id="s2510">Naturally, they were, majority of them trying not just to look when kapo is coming, so work harder, you know, we know that.</span> <span id="s2511">So we did.</span> <span id="s2512">Well, the kapo went and we – you know, again.</span> <span id="s2513">So that sometimes vorarbeiter was watching, not to get in trouble himself, but at the same time he didn’t push us any hard.</span> <span id="s2514">He got this wooden stick, but he didn’t use.</span> <span id="s2515">But there were some who did.</span> <span id="s2516">Same thing was kapos.</span> <span id="s2517">Kapo had three, four groups, and he walk from one group to another, you know, to check on the vorarbeiters and we work.</span> <span id="s2518">And he also was armed with wooden stick, and he used that quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: So you’re talking a four –</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: Majority of them were German criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: So a four arbeiter was like a foreman of that unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: Foreman of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: Of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Twenty-eight – 25 gr – people working, doing same job, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2526">Were there –</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Being s – let’s say, digging ditch for – for s-sewers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: Were there any women in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: They were separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: They were separate, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: No, they were – they were not mixed, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2533">Okay.</span> <span id="s2534">The sewers, were the sewers being built for the camp itself?</span> <span id="s2535">You said there were sewers –</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yes, for – for the camp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: Well, there was – in Buchenwald there were approximately 30,000 prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: Huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: Huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: So they were about thousands SS, the – the brick barracks, two, three floors were the SS guard live.</span> <span id="s2543">There were also several hundreds of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Did you have contact with them directly, or mostly your contact with –</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: No, we have no with this contact.</span> <span id="s2546">The only contact we have with them, when some – when we wer – go to work, and some of them best – beast – work on side, and with the gun, hit us in the – in the – in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: – in the si – on the side here.</span> <span id="s2549">There were some like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: Were you ever hit in the side like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Were you beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: Not beaten, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2555">Were there executions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Yes, there were execution.</span> <span id="s2557">They hang those who try to escape, and there were – and the – and were caught, they were hang publicly so we all see, as don’t do that because this is what will happen to you.</span> <span id="s2558">Matter of fact, in Auschwitz – no, in Birkenau, when we get to Birkenau, the first head count, you know, at [indecipherable] they pick up as two – two SS officer walk in front of the column of the barrack, it was bi – I said 600 or something like that people, and point out raus, raus.</span> <span id="s2559">And there was a to – fellow – friend of my – my father from next village.</span> <span id="s2560">And we were standing together.</span> <span id="s2561">On the other side I have a friend from tar – from high school, you know, on the other side.</span> <span id="s2562">And he pointed over at us, and we both try to get out, and he says älter raus.</span> <span id="s2563">Older –</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: The old one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: – old one raus.</span> <span id="s2566">So he was old –</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: – because my age – he was even probably older than my father.</span> <span id="s2569">They were working together.</span> <span id="s2570">He go – was – he next village.</span> <span id="s2571">He was coming to my father because they were in – in the co-op – cope – cope – milk co –</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: Cooperative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: – cooperative, yeah.</span> <span id="s2574">And so he get out, and they take about 10 of them, and [indecipherable] us to turn out near – they walk them near a fence, and shoot them there.</span> <span id="s2575">And the SS ca – ess man – this officer came to us and says, this will happen to you if you try to escape, you – you disobey our orders, you don’t work hard, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: Charming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2578">Th-This was welcome to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2579">And I wrote about that in – under the title, welcome to Auschwitz, to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: Welcome to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2581">Did you have a similar welcome to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: No, Buchenwald at that time, as I said, it was not as severe, and as bad as Auschwitz still was.</span> <span id="s2585">Because they build those factories, and they need people to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: So the regime was the same, the food and so on not more, but at least they didn’t beat people without reason and then kill them, or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: So remind me again, what were the kinds of things those factories were producing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Well, all different kind of military things.</span> <span id="s2590">One I – I know one was producing the wooden part to a gun, you know.</span> <span id="s2591">It was wooden shop producing this for a gun.</span> <span id="s2592">There was one producing the cases for radio.</span> <span id="s2593">And there were some parts for – some milit – for some other sa – there was one barrack inside the camp, who also only people with high technical education worked there.</span> <span id="s2594">They didn’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2595">Later, we learned that they were producing part to this A1, A2 th-they shoot on London, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Oh, the V2 rockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: V – V2 rocket – rocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: – that, not – not the whole part.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Not the whole rocket, but part to the rocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s2607">Did news – was there a well-developed information network among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">A: In Buchenwald was underground – underground organization, but completely by communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2612">So they – did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: And it was nobody try – if anybody try with – without them, very quick they transfer him to someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: So you found it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: And this happened to me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Tell me how that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Well, I – there was many Poles, you know, in several blocks.</span> <span id="s2620">So we came to conclusion that at least maybe we can some ways get some information and publish weekly bulletin about the information, if anything else.</span> <span id="s2621">So I started that with few other people, and we get one – few copies only, without some information from – thr – through radio, from [indecipherable] we got some people – some fellow who worked in the office.</span> <span id="s2622">They got radio and so on.</span> <span id="s2623">[indecipherable] combination.</span> <span id="s2624">And this first few copies we pu – po – po – get in, and shortly after, I was on the list to be transferred to Bad Gandersheim, to branch of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: So where – how did you distribute this few pieces of – of – few copies –</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Through friends, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: Through friends, okay.</span> <span id="s2628">And so – and so they didn’t really want you there to write up the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A: Well, the communists –</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: – have monopoly.</span> <span id="s2632">They don’t want have competition, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: So you found out where the power was, who had the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: Yeah, well.</span> <span id="s2635">Well, because there were many German communists you know, in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: And even their lager leader, they got so called lager leader – not in Buchenwald, in this Bad Gandersheim where I was.</span> <span id="s2638">And this lager leader, who was a German communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2642">So what did you do in Bad Gandersheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: It – Bad Gandersheim we supposed to build – well, first we built – they have no – there was no camp.</span> <span id="s2644">Now 200 came from Buchenwald first transport, I was in first transport, and then more.</span> <span id="s2645">All together there were about 550 of us.</span> <span id="s2646">Majority of them were fra – Frenchmen, Italian and Russian.</span> <span id="s2647">And then later, from Auschwitz came about 50 Poles and few from Buchenwald, so all together was about 55 - 56 Poles, but were hundreds of Italians, Russians and Frenchmens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: And so first we have to build our barracks, our camp.</span> <span id="s2650">They put us to sleep in old monastery from medieval’s time, which was not used as monastery, because the territory became Protestant, completely hundred percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: So this monastery was practically barn; the landlord, large landlord used this as – for hay, straw, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2653">So we sleep there and build our barracks, and dig ditches to – to get sewers, water and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: So, we get there in September, and I think lend of – end of December, we moved to our barracks already, from this old monastery.</span> <span id="s2656">And so then we supposed to build airplane.</span> <span id="s2657">There a was railroad and on little higher, and on this slope of this – from regular to the land here, there were boxes with machines.</span> <span id="s2658">Milicz air – air – air pl – air factory Milicz –</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Milicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: – in Poland, built just before the war.</span> <span id="s2661">Open, I think, in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: And naturally Germans took over, they use it.</span> <span id="s2664">But when the Soviets army were approaching, they get all these men to all the machines, and send them to Bad Gandersheim, and they built factory to bil – for build airplanes.</span> <span id="s2665">So we supposed to build the airplane, but first we have to build our barracks, our camp, o-our sewers an-and everything else.</span> <span id="s2666">Then one group get those boxes, and install in the hole, the hole was ready.</span> <span id="s2667">Then they were barracks like long and – but brick buildings, not too far away, next to this factory, where the German masters live.</span> <span id="s2668">Civilians, you know, electrician, whatever what they need, professional people to help, you know, in this – to build this factory.</span> <span id="s2669">And so we installed those machines and – and so on, and then we, sometimes in winter we start to build the airplane.</span> <span id="s2670">There was no – someplace else they bra – bring the mortars, you know, for – and we build just this thing, but we didn’t finish it, not even one sa – April first.</span> <span id="s2671">Instead of go to work, they decided that we walk to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: From Bad Gandersheim?</span></p> <p><span

manufacturing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A: Well, what kind of sabotage would – can we –</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q: Okay, just asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A: We mi – we didn’t –

id="s2685">Okay, all right.</span> <span id="s2686">Okay, so then you’re on this walk from Bad Gandersheim to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: To Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2688">Well, when we hear that, that we have to walk, we came to conclusion that most situation must be bad for Germans if they don’t have train or trucks to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: To take us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: – get us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: So, we walk.</span> <span id="s2693">We get – again, more than normal

east, over the mountains, so the place get higher and higher.</span> <span id="s2696">And that was the road, the highest road in the slope of north – north slope of the mountains.</span> <span id="s2697">And so after a couple days, we didn’t have anything to eat, so we’re gonna – well, at the beginning, we just get not too far from this place – nice town, Seesen, I remember, very nice town.</span> <span id="s2698">I was there later, after the war, for a while.</span> <span id="s2699">And they took about 18 or so prisoners, and took – they were – we were in forest, walking through forest – took them on sight, and shoot them there.</span> <span id="s2700">And why?</span> <span id="s2701">Because they were thieves.</span> <span id="s2702">Thieves?</span> <span id="s2703">What kind of thieves?</span> <span id="s2704">When we were digging – working near the field with potatoes, and there was large la – landlord with a large play – a large field of potatoes, and they piling up those potatoes, you know, before they covered them.</span> <span id="s2705">So it was mu – large –</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: Pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: – pile of potatoes.</span> <span id="s2708">So somebody sneak in and steal a couple.</span> <span id="s2709">I did that too couple times.</span> <span id="s2710">And if it – th-the – he was caught.</span> <span

id="s2714">A: On this march.</span> <span id="s2715">And then we start to walk.</span> <span id="s2716">We walked, it was death march.</span> <span id="s2717">And well, the food was going.</span> <span id="s2718">They didn’t give us much more, so we were getting weaker.</span> <span id="s2719">Some people cannot walk, older people especially cannot walk, because they were too weak.</span> <span id="s2720">And they took them one side, shoot them, and we went further.</span> <span id="s2721">That was called death march, and there were many of those death march in Germany at – near the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2722">And so what saved us – me, was dog biscuits.</span> <span id="s2723">I have great respect for dog biscuits [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2725">So how did you get these dog biscuits?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: Well, one night we – we were already in mountains.</span> <span id="s2727">You know, fields, forests, not much any places, were here and there some motels, hotels, you know, on the road.</span> <span id="s2728">Some hotels, specially for tourists you know, and the people who want spend vacation in mountains, you know, so some sanitoriums.</span> <span id="s2729">And one evening we were getting close to night, and we hear dog – dog barks, you know.</span> <span id="s2730">And are many over there.</span> <span id="s2731">So we get to farm where they raised these German Shepherds, those German dogs.</span> <span id="s2732">So they put us – dark was just about approaching, so they put us against barn.</span> <span id="s2733">Was here, and then here was this building with dogs, they’re barking.</span> <span id="s2734">And so they got only here to cover, to have the guard, you know.</span> <span id="s2735">And the evening, or at night, when the – those guys against the wall in this barn, you know, one of them noticed that one of plank, the wall was wooden planks, you know, up and down.</span> <span id="s2736">And on the bottom the plank was rotten and the nail don’t hold the – so he moved this plank to the side, and seeing inside.</span> <span id="s2737">And what he got there?</span> <span id="s2738">Boxes with dog biscuits.</span> <span id="s2739">So he start to pull – get those dog biscuits out.</span> <span id="s2740">Well, the news from m-mouth to mouth spread very fast, and everybody at the b-barn there tried ev – and some – this wall, the nail don’t hold, and he can get in.</span> <span id="s2741">And two others get in.</span> <span id="s2742">So three guys went inside, and they start to pass those dog biscuits.</span> <span id="s2743">There were boxes with dog biscuits.</span> <span id="s2744">So they pass those ba – dog biscuit to us.</span> <span id="s2745">Well, we didn’t had much anything, just pockets here, and there’s just not too much room, you know, in the pockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: So we put against here, on the shirt, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: In the shirt, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: – around, all around, you know, those ba – and they were square, very large, square and thick, and very hard, you cannot chew it.</span> <span id="s2750">But you put corner in the mouth and saliva soften little, and you bite piece by piece.</span> <span id="s2751">So next morning everybody was working and chewing the dog biscuits.</span> <span id="s2752">But the – if not those biscuits, I won’t be here, because this is all what we had for next two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Oh my goodness, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: So if not those dog biscuits, I won’t be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: So this was April first when you started this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: And 13 – April 13, I get – I jump out, I run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q: How many kilometers do you think you’d gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: I don’t know how many, but we were – they put us on field, we – we – oh, we hear already not just artillery, but machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: So this means that British and American forces are closing.</span> <span id="s2765">So they put us one night in large pile of straw and so on, on the field.</span> <span id="s2766">And in the morning, close to morning, we – first time we hear this machine guns, even artillery, and then machine.</span> <span id="s2767">So first thing was we try – in the morning we stay again, we don’t go out.</span> <span id="s2768">Well, early in the morning, just -- just little, not completely daytime, trucks arrive and get out – they get us out.</span> <span id="s2769">And we decided that we will stay here.</span> <span id="s2770">There was about 50 of us Poles, and we got one fellow, he was oldest one among us, and by profession he was engineer from Poland.</span> <span id="s2771">And so we – so the people get out, and we stands there.</span> <span id="s2772">Then trucks arrive, and then in last moment, this guy says, you know what?</span> <span id="s2773">Ma – this is not – no time, let’s go.</span> <span id="s2774">We just jump out.</span> <span id="s2775">Shortly after they start to machine guns in the straw, and those who stay there all were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: Some of them tried to escape, you know, get out, but they were knocked down by the machine gun.</span> <span id="s2778">So we were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: But next day – the same day, the trucks – we went through a town which was no – no any authority in uniform.</span> <span id="s2781">They had civilians – civilians militia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: Civilians with old guns, you know [indecipherable] keep order, you know, the town.</span> <span id="s2784">So we know that there’s no – any police, not even no Gestapo, no army, nobody else.</span> <span id="s2785">So – and they get us through this town, and drop us in the field.</span> <span id="s2786">Near was forest, and so now we start to get to – get – what the hell to do?</span> <span id="s2787">And we came to conclusion, they’re now the guard.</span> <span id="s2788">There was one – one SS officer, I don’t remember his title now, who was from Poland, German from Poland; speak Polish as good as I did.</span> <span id="s2789">And when they start to kill those guys who cannot walk all – all the way, the le – and they were weak, cannot walk, they just take them outside and shoot them, and we go further.</span> <span id="s2790">Was – was 50 of us, we put ourself arms, and we decide – we got some few older people with – among us, that we are not going to allow that.</span> <span id="s2791">In case they try to pick up anyone from us, the closest one un – und – di – di – guard – we jump on the closest guard, and get his gun, we can – they will kill – older guns – older guys will kill few of us, but we will get gun, and then we can be [indecipherable] the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: So – and this guy, he was in charge of this march from SS, this guy from Poland – German from Poland.</span> <span id="s2794">And he saw that we are walking like that, and he came to us in Polish.</span> <span id="s2795">He told us, don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s2796">The – you’re is – you – it is okay, you are okay.</span> <span id="s2797">Don’t be afraid, nothing will happen to you guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2799">And so when did you run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: So, in this field, as I said, they jump – dump us from the trucks, and we came to conclusion that this is the time to – is forest nearby, they won’t – now, the guard change a exce – with exception of two or three younger SS, those Hitler followers, the rest were old men from the first World War, 50 or 60 years old.</span> <span id="s2801">They mobilized them, and they replaced the younger SS, who went to fight.</span> <span id="s2802">They – they put them as a guard in that – and so we know that they won’t shoot us, they will shoot guard in the window is where we were sending, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: And this is right – it – it – it – it would happen.</span> <span id="s2805">Really, that – those guys were – hate those [indecipherable] not as – worse than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: Interesting to know.</span> <span id="s2807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: Interesting to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Really, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: I have one guy who, we were walking in that – near the tracks, he was walking on the tracks, and putting some machine guns to this factory there.</span> <span id="s2812">And he was walking there, and – and so on, he – and so he asked, from where

fortress.</span> <span id="s2817">He was there during the first World War.</span> <span id="s2818">So – and he be – we became acquaintances.</span> <span id="s2819">So, next day, when I was wal – he walked there, and I noticed little s-something felled out fro-from out these – his coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Pants?</span> <span id="s2821">Oh, from his coat, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: This large, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: Because that was fall already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

hit the mountains, and not just the pieces of the steel, but the pieces of stone, with the gra – granite, or whatever it was, get pieces of stone, split, and the pieces [indecipherable] also people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: So there was a certain sympathy that grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">A: Yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: And so you knew that these old guys, who were with the old rifles, would not shoot at you, as much as they would at the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: So you ran

nobody was hurt, and I’ll je – I’ll get to the forest.</span> <span id="s2846">And then later – it was close to evening, shortly after – I know that they went around after us, because o-others who ran away, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2848">There aren’t enough of them to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: So we know – we know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: – that they wouldn’t run after us, because they [indecipherable] 500 – probably is not 500, but 450 maybe, or so.</span> <span id="s2852">But anyway – so we ju – jump and next – and before dark I get into couple fellows in forest, so we were together and we went to sleep in the forest there.</span> <span id="s2853">And next

open.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s2885">Okay.</span> <span id="s2886">And so you – th-the Americans come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: Americans came in.</span> <span id="s2888">But that was evening, and they told us by German translator, that this it the – it was tank, German – American tank.</span> <span id="s2889">That is the first tank ahead – so ahead of us are still Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: So stay overnight here, and tomorrow it depends on the situation, if he will tells you you can go or not.</span> <span id="s2892">You are all free.</span> <span id="s2893">So we stay in the camp overnight, and next morning the tanks – well, the gates were – gate was open, you know.</span> <span id="s2894">So the tanks are on their way, and next – many tanks after the first one.</span> <span id="s2895">So we – then we get out and I went to – in the town, and I ran into Polish camp, several hundreds Poles, after uprising in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: They were sent there, and they were working in – in various places in this little town.</span> <span id="s2898">And it turned out that the town had many food warehouses.</span> <span id="s2899">So they were wor – pardon me – they were working in – in various warehouses, and – and – and some food factories in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">Q: You said food warehouses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: Food warehouses, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: Yeah, mm-hm, okay.</span> <span id="s2903">So those were pretty good jobs to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: Yeah, well sure, they have – after the Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: Did you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: So I joined them and with them, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: Did you know about the uprising?</span> <span id="s2908">Cause you were already arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: I was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2910">We know – we learn about because one day we noticed that the SS toward us became quite rough, you know.</span> <span id="s2911">So what?</span> <span id="s2912">But, as I said, we had, in Buchenwald was strong communist underground organization.</span> <span id="s2913">So, from them we learn that Warsaw uprising, it is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: – uprising in Warsaw, and this is the reason the Germans are so tough to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2917">So you joined this group of people who had been sent to labor camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: – who had been part of this Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s2920">And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2922">Well, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s2923">I told myself I got the – enough German concentration camp, I don’t want try Soviet concentration camps, because I know that they are not better, and on top of that, they are in much colder places.</span> <span id="s2924">Because Siberia is much colder than Germany.</span> <span id="s2925">So I decided to – not to go back.</span> <span id="s2926">And although I’ve got family there, my first love was there.</span> <span id="s2927">But here I was afraid because I was in underground press, and I was on black list among the – with the communists, you know.</span> <span id="s2928">Is anti-communist and anti-Soviet.</span> <span id="s2929">And so, I don’t know, we – I didn’t stay with them too long, then I joined some – they were for – organized displaced person camps.</span> <span id="s2930">And they were to transfer, you know, some camp.</span> <span id="s2931">Oh, we – I stay for a while, and then this place was taken by Soviets.</span> <span id="s2932">They – it was freed by Americans, but this part supposed to be British zone.</span> <span id="s2933">But in last – just before the war ended, they decided in the campgrounds just before the war ended, that this part will be Soviet zone.</span> <span id="s2934">It will be handed to Soviet zone because Soviet get too small part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">A: So it was – the further was – so the British told us about, and they even organized transport for us to get out even, you didn’t want.</span> <span id="s2937">Some who want to go back to Poland, they stayed there and wait until Soviets arrive, and I don’t know what happened to that, but we get out to west, on the British zone, so we stay as – stayed, then I – well, I – we get to this – I mentioned this little town, Seesen, a very nice town and it turned out there were many thousands of Poles from Poland during the war that can do work in German factories in those warehouses and so on.</span> <span id="s2938">And so we get there, and not long, and because they put u – put us in hotel by the railroad, and they will sh – they were o-opening the – a railroad, and they went to open the hotel, too.</span> <span id="s2939">So they transfer us someplace else.</span> <span id="s2940">So I – I was not too far – well, in this town, there were – there was thousands of Poles, and we had no information.</span> <span id="s2941">So I get contact not too far away, was first Polish Panzer division from Great Britain, who occupy northwestern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s2942">So I got contact with them, and I came to conclusion that we need something to [indecipherable] so I will publish – edit again, bill – bulletin, and we’ll – I will get through that, from them, some information.</span> <span id="s2943">And so I started that, and in one of the bulletin, I brought – there was t – Pottsdam conference, between Stalin –</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: The f – yeah,

the par – par [indecipherable] conservative party, lost the power, and Attlee replace him, socialist.</span> <span id="s2951">And I wrote that – but that is this time still Churchill was there.</span> <span id="s2952">I – I was surprised that Truman – then Churchill and Truman talked to some bandit like hit – like Stalin, who is not better than Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: So, I wrote true.</span> <span id="s2955">But couple weeks later, I was preparing next edition, and my room knocked the door.</span> <span id="s2956">I look,

British some – I don’t know what [indecipherable] probably the secret service, or whatever they have – and some Russian – White Russian, who left Russia when the Bolshevik took over the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A: And so he settle in Germany, and in German language he was translating.</span> <span id="s3063">And when I learn that

–</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">A: And I know that they have interpreter –</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: – because in the camp which I was living, and pu-publishing this little bulletin, was family named Grabowska(ph) from Poznan, but they were kicked out in 1939 to Warsaw, so they – after the Warsaw uprising, they were in Germany.</span> <span id="s3078">And the daughter study English before the war at the University of Poznan.</span> <span id="s3079">And she was working in the office of British general, commander of the occupied part of this territory.</span> <span id="s3080">So she was working this – in Polish-English interpreter.</span> <span id="s3081">So I know her because this family, this – her mother practically save my life, because when we get – we get [indecipherable] in this, you know, people get very hungry.</span> <span id="s3082">So I just happened, by accident that I get to them.</span> <span id="s3083">And she told me, no, no, I will s – feed you.</span> <span id="s3084">So she wouldn’t let me eat, you know, any f – meat or any fat stuff, chicken soup or something, but she prepare something, or – or, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: – something else, because she know that – and some prisoners, like myself, get – they eat whatever, they got it and they were hungry, they eat too much, and they went – they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Q: Yeah, they died.</span> <span id="s3088">Their systems couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: The system cannot take it, because system was not prepared for, for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: So – so – so you’re back in this prison, you know they have a Polish interpreter, then what ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">Q: – then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">A: So I didn’t told him.</span> <span id="s3094">He’s the [indecipherable] he’s the power, I am not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: So they want me back to – you know.</span> <span id="s3097">After the Gestapo, after the tortures, and the concentration camp, and this situation was like sanitorium, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: So, they took me back and few hours – couple hours later, they come to pick me up.</span> <span id="s3100">And they walk me to same room, same villa, and here in place of the Russian, is Bouzhayna(ph) Grabowska(ph), this Polish interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3102">Then what were their questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: Well, the question was that I am Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: That you’re Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">Q: And why would you be a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">A: Because I wrote that Stalin is not better than Hitler, and Stalin, Uncle Joe is the best friend, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3109">Okay, and so they ask you – what do they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: Well, they ask me an – so then this tattoo number of my arms, that I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3111">You know, this British, he didn’t know it the beginning, but the Bouzhayna(ph) Grabowska(ph) explained to him that this is tattoo number from Auschwitz, concentration camp Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3112">Well, he know, already hear something about concentration camp Auschwitz, so he was confused, you know.</span> <span id="s3113">And he start, you know, beginning; name, born, and this – parents and all this.</span> <span id="s3114">Form – formal things, and then what was – what I was doing during the war, and so on.</span> <span id="s3115">So I wi – was telling him.</span> <span id="s3116">And then we start talking about this problem of Nazi and – and so Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s3117">So I tell him point blank, maybe these – it – he is your friends, but he is not our friends.</span> <span id="s3118">I was in Polish military 1939.</span> <span id="s3119">We fought Germans, and we were – we were hit in the back by Stalin, by Soviets.</span> <span id="s3120">So for me, Stalin is not better than Hitler.</span> <span id="s3121">And nobody will convince me that this is not so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: And so, what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: So, the things change into discussion about politics, foreign relations in – in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s3124">And because I was good in history, and always interested in politics, so I know quite a bit about it.</span> <span id="s3125">Probably more than him.</span> <span id="s3126">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: And so he start discussion, and that.</span> <span id="s3129">So then finally, I was smoking, you know, so I ask him if I can sm-smoke.</span> <span id="s3130">He says okay.</span> <span id="s3131">So I si – I had Canadian Pall Mall, very good cigarettes, and he got some British, very lousy cigarettes, I know that – them, too.</span> <span id="s3132">So – so he smoked – he pulled his, and I s – so we smoke our cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3133">And then we start talking.</span> <span id="s3134">After a while I again ask him where I can si – fr – smoke, okay.</span> <span id="s3135">So I pull, and I si –</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: Offer him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: – give him – offer him cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3138">He took it, and he says, you got good cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3139">And so we smoked cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3140">So the – then into – you know, friendly conversation.</span> <span id="s3141">Then – and then he said – tell me there’s no – I can’t – I know there’s no mi-mis – misconce – mis – not misconception, misleading, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Misunderstanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: Misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s3144">But I cannot do it, I can only [indecipherable] I just make a report, and they will decide, the highers-up will decide.</span> <span id="s3145">And then, from this Bouzhayna(ph) Grabowska(ph) who was interpreter with the general office, day or two days later, I learn from her that this, what I wrote about, Stalin, Hitler, you know, not better, it went to Polish representative in town – town about 40 kilometers north, where was Polish mission.</span> <span id="s3146">The mission of the Polish communists, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: Oh, of the Polish communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: The Polish communist government, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: – mission.</span> <span id="s3151">About 40 kilometers, and they get this, my bulletin, with this terrible –</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">Q: Comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: – comparison, you know.</span> <span id="s3154">So naturally they send this – rush to their superiors in Warsaw, and they to Moscow.</span> <span id="s3155">So the Bouzhayna(ph) learned that it went from Moscow to London, and from London to – because this guy [indecipherable] told me tho – there was – the commander of the occupied forces, British occupied forces.</span> <span id="s3156">So – so next day or so, they took me again, and he told me that I am free.</span> <span id="s3157">And I said well, how I will get home these 14 kilometer, no trains nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">A: Oh, there’s no problem, we can – and so she told me that – oh, he – he – this was misunderstanding or something like that, and so ga – ga

London back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: And then the – that’s how you had gotten arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3168">So little devil never was angel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: Interesting though.</span> <span id="s3170">Very interesting, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">A: Well, it was interesting that – that –</span></p>

occupation already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">Q: Okay, because when you were reli – when you were freed, the war was still on.</span> <span id="s3177">It was just that you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: Well, yes, but not t-too long.</span> <span id="s3179">Shortly after th-the – it was – the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: Okay.</span>

finally I moved to – well, because after th – I was arrested by the British of this bulletin, they told me I cannot publish any more.</span> <span id="s3185">So I told him, how about freedom of press, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: And he told – he told me, this is in England, not in occupied Germany.</span> <span id="s3188">Here, o – here the law is given by the commander of Rhine army.</span> <span id="s3189">This is – I learned the official name of the army, occupied army, British army.</span> <span id="s3190">So I went to

and so on, but there was no life, no – so he went, and he knew the editor of this ed – ed – so, he says, and they are not in Ludwigsburg, they are in Eppstein town, as he learned, his chief editor is little town north of Frankfurt, and they publish in Ludwigsburg because in Ludwigsburg is [indecipherable] which have Polish accent, you know.</span> <span id="s3196">And so he went to visit with them, and he spent about two or three days.</span> <span id="s3197">He return back and says to me, we both – we are going, they will accept us.</span> <span id="s3198">Me and – and you.</span> <span id="s3199">And okay, I was happy.</span> <span id="s3200">So – but he is going to stay in Eppstein town is where they got – they rented from Germans, little hotel.</span> <span id="s3201">And Eppstein town as – is not large, not all mountains – range of mountains is north of Frankfurt am Main, the largest is – is about 8-900 meters.</span> <span id="s3202">So there’s about 2,700 or so feet.</span> <span id="s3203">But nice territory.</span> <span id="s3204">And they r-r-rented one, this hotel – hotel in those mountains, in this little town, and paid Germans with food, with cigarettes and so on.</span> <span id="s3205">And they call it po – house of Polish journalists.</span> <span id="s3206">There were few of them, couple with wives.</span> <span id="s3207">So he is going to live in this house of Polish journalists, and I am going to Ludwigsburg to help the editor who make the pages, and [indecipherable] news, and print over there, get –</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">A: – and get to print this thing.</span> <span id="s3210">So – and it was very good school, because this guy, he was very good.</span> <span id="s3211">He was consider one of the arts in making pages, you know.</span> <span id="s3212">Make layered of pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">A: He was very good in that.</span> <span id="s3215">And so I got good school with him.</span> <span id="s3216">So I went there.</span> <span id="s3217">Well, not too long, my birthday was June 15, but I’d – in Poland they – we don’t tra – celebrate birthday, but names day.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: And names day is 24, June 24.</span> <span id="s3220">So I – I prepare a birthday party with this – my fellow editor, my mentor.</span> <span id="s3221">And he was married, and was not a guy for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3222">I got dinner in German farmer’s home.</span> <span id="s3223">Germ – from German farmer’s ho – good dinner, you know, in farm.</span> <span id="s3224">And so we were preparing, and we were printing in mo-morning, the weekly.</span> <span id="s3225">And here we got, I don’t know, a few thousand ready, and the ger – the American [indecipherable] stop the press.</span> <span id="s3226">They – whatever was printed, they get the ink, you know, and spread, so we cannot –</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: Pull it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">A: – we cannot use them any more, send them to nobody.</span> <span id="s3229">And not – they don’t know – because we were Nazi – Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: Because you’re Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: Nazi.</span> <span id="s3232">So, well, no other solution.</span> <span id="s3233">So the guy, this editor, my mentor, as I said, very good.</span> <span id="s3234">He was married, so he got already some room in the village there, Germans.</span> <span id="s3235">So he stay, he didn’t want to go back, because they don’t – the place was full, this little hotel was full, and so he stayed over there.</span> <span id="s3236">But I went there, back.</span> <span id="s3237">They told me to come back.</span> <span id="s3238">So I went back, and no, that is it.</span> <span id="s3239">But shortly after, w-we were consider a small camp.</span> <span id="s3240">There were altogether us about 13 - 14 people, because couples, and there were some married, two or three that were –</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Q: All journalists, or families – and families.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: – couple were married.</span> <span id="s3243">They were – one woman, she was – she was not the journalist, but she was very useful because she was drawing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">A: And so she was helpful, very – like the first page, you know, especially some drawing on first page.</span> <span id="s3246">And so 12 - 13 people.</span> <span id="s3247">We were consider a small camp.</span> <span id="s3248">And UNRRA, this international organization which supply food for the displaced person camps, we – supply us with food, with – with clothing, and whatever they have.</span> <span id="s3249">And they notify us because we are Nazi, we are taking – they don’t supply us any more.</span> <span id="s3250">So we went as Germans, thousand calories a day, but we have to buy that food, and we have no money, bu – from where?</span> <span id="s3251">Buy the food from Germans.</span> <span id="s3252">So it was quite –</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: So there was the Americans now – instead of the British, it was the American MP?</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: Americans, because Uncle Joe Stalin, they were Uncle Joe –</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: – you know, Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s3257">And so it was bad situation.</span> <span id="s3258">So we get some money, and we get th-the – in we – they – two, three times a – a week, we got herring, because they went to buy from the barrels, you know.</span> <span id="s3259">They were cheap, and so with potatoes, we have dinner [indecipherable] because we cannot afford to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">Q: And you like herring.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">A: I like, so it was no-not bad for me.</span> <span id="s3262">I – I got nothing against, but these others didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: I want to – I want to summarize this a little bit.</span> <span id="s3264">What you’re saying is that you worked on a weekly Polish newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">Q: And that Polish newspaper was also again critical of the Soviet Union –</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: – and eventually the American MPs come and close it down, accusing you of being Nazis, so you can’t publish the paper any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">Q: And the reason that you’re giving is that the influence of the Soviets – that is, as you put it, Uncle Joe, reached into the American zone.</span> <span id="s3271">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">A: Look –</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">A: – the Americans at that time, American opinion, American press, Mr. Roosevelt were all full of praise to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3275">American soldiers, I hear from American soldiers, Uncle Joe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">A: They do – they didn’t tell – they didn’t talk about Stalin otherwise but Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s3278">Well, you have to admit that Soviet army break – broke – broke the power of Hitler.</span> <span id="s3279">That is not question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">A: But they did not do that because they were against Hitler, or because they love Americans.</span> <span id="s3282">But Hitler attacked them, and they have – Stalin had no choice, surrendered, or fo – fight.</span> <span id="s3283">So he decided to fight.</span> <span id="s3284">And now American and British jump to help him, and a – not just help him, but embrace him.</span> <span id="s3285">And the communist propaganda took over press and everything in England and in brit – Great Britain, and in everywhere else.</span> <span id="s3286">And therefore, Stalin was Uncle Joe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s3288">So, when the Americans closed you down, the American military authorities –</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: – do you believe they were doing it because you were – you were being not only critical, but you were attacking an ally of theirs?</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: Well, this is what they told us, that we are Nazis, because we are working to break the alliance, you know, spread between the – the get –</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Dissension between the a –</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: Dissension between allies.</span> <span id="s3294">This was the – th-th-the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">Q: And they didn’t understand, or they didn’t see a difference that you were coming from Poland, and had your own experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">A: No, they don’t understand that, and as I said, I was in Polish army when we fought Germans, and we were attacked for Soviets.</span> <span id="s3297">So I had on my back proof, and what I believe it is right.</span> <span id="s3298">But they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s3299">Well, as I said, you have to admit that the Soviet army really broke the power of Hitler army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">A: The ar – th – Normandy would be probably two years later, and with il – will cost thousands more of lives, American, British lives, if not the Soviet’s army.</span> <span id="s3304">That is true.</span> <span id="s3305">But as I said, th-they don’t fight, because for – because they were against, or something, but they had no choice –</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: – because Hitler attacked them and –</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: – and they – and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: But what I’m getting at, or what I want to try and clarify is, the first time that your little newspaper, that you published yourself –</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: – then you are arrested in the British zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">Q: The reason why you were arrested is that it went to the Polish communists, it went to Warsaw, it went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">A: No, well they – you know, because the communists took that –</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">A: – you know, th – they were not too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: Yeah, let me finish the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3321">That it went – that – and in – one could make the argument that it was Soviet influence that made your arrest happen, because it went from the Polish communists, to Warsaw, to Moscow, to London, to Germany, and you would be arrested by the Brits, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: Well, the British didn’t know, they don’t read Polish, so they would not know what I am writing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: So, it went, you know, this way, and to embassy – Soviet embassy in London, to the British government, and British government to the commander of Rhine army, and so on.</span> <span id="s3325">That was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">Q: Okay, but one can make the argument that it was Soviet influence, Soviet pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: The second time, when the Americans come and close down this newspaper, would it be Soviet pressure, or would it be that the Americans don’t want to offend the Soviets and do it on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: Well, that was – it was not direct – it was not, you know, through the diplomatic channels, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">A: It was probably some higher-ups in American government in – occupying forces –</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">A: – and this UNRRA, who take the –</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">Q: Rations away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">A: – rations for us.</span> <span id="s3336">We learn later this director of UNRRA, in this American zone, was American communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">A: So, you know, the politics, it – it has various quite interesting angles.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s3342">And so your paper is closed, and you have no rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">A: No rations, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">Q: So what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">A: So what happened?</span> <span id="s3346">As I said, we got herrings.</span> <span id="s3347">I didn’t mind my – I didn’t mind – I like herrings.</span> <span id="s3348">But not – a couple weeks later – well, Polish – there was a large Polish army in the west, in Italy, from those who – Poles who were in Soviet Union, taken to Soviet Union, and when war break out, Stalin release them –</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">A: – and they form this second Polish [indecipherable] what fought at Monte Cassino, and so on, and there was – before that there was Polish [indecipherable], a division which participated in Normandy, and occupy northwestern Germany.</span> <span id="s3351">It was Polish air forces which have great part in this battle of Britain – air battle, and the participation of Polish units, and on British airplanes –</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">A: – naturally.</span> <span id="s3354">But with Polish [indecipherable] and also Polish pilots on British airplane.</span> <span id="s3355">They got – they got more planes than pilots.</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">A: And so they participated and they really – the British now, they also admit that, that the – they aro – they won the battle of Britain with – the air battle with Britain wi – on – for Britain, and the Poles participated greatly in that.</span> <span id="s3358">And so – so this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">Q: So di – so, in other words, what di – what significance did that have on the fact that your paper was closed?</span> <span id="s3360">Did du – did it influence it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">A: Well, you mean th –</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">Q: Yeah, I – okay, here – let me go back.</span> <span id="s3363">I asked you, after the paper was closed, what happened.</span> <span id="s3364">And then you mentioned –</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">A: What happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">A: – well, so they took away – arrest you, and so on – and but couple weeks later, one day there was Polish major from the Polish army in Great Britain, I think he was in intelligence unit, he joined us.</span> <span id="s3368">And some – quite often in civilian clothing, he was going somewhere, and so on.</span>

know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">Q: So what did you do?</span> <span id="s3478">What happened in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">A: Well, in the – shortly after I came to the United States, I get contact with my mother, her sister in chica – in Posen, south of Chicago.</span> <span id="s3480">And so we start to corresponded.</span> <span id="s3481">And matter of fact, one of the cousin came to me in Eppstein in this – when I was in this paper there.</span> <span id="s3482">One day, some American soldiers on Jeep came, and soldiers get out and ask for me in Polish.</span> <span id="s3483">So I get out.</span> <span id="s3484">Roman.</span> <span id="s3485">He was son of my aunt from Posen, serving in the American military.</span> <span id="s3486">And so he get from her mother my address, and so he came to visit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">Q: Isn’t that a ma – your first cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">A: My first cousin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3490">When you came to the United States, how did you support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: Well, I came to my aunt, and – but I don’t want to be supported by anybody, so I tried to do some – anything to work.</span> <span id="s3492">Well, first week or two in the family, there was my uncle here, and so on, so it was a lot of parties going on, drinking and so on.</span> <span id="s3493">But then – so I start first my job, I had – I was unloading tomatoes.</span> <span id="s3494">There was factory producing ketchup.</span> <span id="s3495">And when the season started – so I work at night 12 hours, for night.</span> <span id="s3496">Hour for lunch at no – at midnight, unloading trucks, boxcars from railroad, and so unloading them to the factory, as go.</span> <span id="s3497">That was for the first time.</span> <span id="s3498">Then I work in the – in the outfit which repaired boxcars that – railroad t – railroad cars.</span> <span id="s3499">But then I got – just about lost my eye because the spark from –</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">Q: From one of the wheels, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">A: Not wheels, the – no, how you call it?</span> <span id="s3502">The guy li – I was walking between two boxcar, and he opened the torch, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">A: Torch, and the spark j-jump.</span> <span id="s3505">And so they took me to a doctor, and I get home with bandage my – my eye.</span> <span id="s3506">My aunt said, no more.</span> <span id="s3507">I don’t want you to lose your eye here.</span> <span id="s3508">We got sa – to eat sa – we got enough to eat.</span> <span id="s3509">Well, I cannot sit home, it is not wi-with my nature.</span> <span id="s3510">And so, through my uncle, I get job at Canfield’s(ph) beverage company in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3511">It was – you have to drive – not drive really, didn’t have car, but take buses, you know, two buses to get there.</span> <span id="s3512">And so I was working on the yard, they call it.</span> <span id="s3513">It – from noon.</span> <span id="s3514">So there was various – one of – every day [indecipherable] of time take, it was to sort enough bottles.</span> <span id="s3515">Drivers brought and – gave this wooden bo-boxes, you know, with bottles, and th-they are mixed up, white and green, because in tavern, or in s – in store, if they give to the – he don’t look the white or – or green bottles, he put in the case –</span></p> <p><span id="s3516">Q: Whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">A: – whatever, so there were white and green.</span> <span id="s3518">And we sort them out, because green were ginger ale.</span> <span id="s3519">All other – lemonade – all other drinks were in white –</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Bottles.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: – white bottles.</span> <span id="s3522">And only ginger ale was green, so we sort enough so they can go to production and – and know where.</span> <span id="s3523">And then later we work to load the trucks with full cases of – of those drinks, help drivers to – help to – help – help drivers to load this – his trucks, so he put where he want, according to his schedule, you know, first go first and so on.</span> <span id="s3524">He knows what he got next stop, next day, what he have to deliver, and to who.</span> <span id="s3525">And so that was again interesting American story.</span> <span id="s3526">One day Mr. Canfield junior, who run the factory, his father established that – he came every day for a few – for a few hours to office, and get chauffeur and so on, but A-Art Canfield was running the business.</span> <span id="s3527">And one day he walk, and talk to the workers.</span> <span id="s3528">And he came to me, I know few words in English, so what nationality?</span> <span id="s3529">Polish.</span> <span id="s3530">Oh hey – hey Joe, that was next truck, I know the guy, Joe Horanian(ph), I still remember his name, truck driver, and he was Polish.</span> <span id="s3531">Bo-Born here, but speak Polish and English.</span> <span id="s3532">So he came as interpreter, so Canfield said – a-ask me what I was doing in Germany.</span> <span id="s3533">I said, a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3534">What you – when you came here?</span> <span id="s3535">Forty-nine – that was – that was 1950, or sa – 1950 probably A-April, March, April, something like that.</span> <span id="s3536">So I was – what I was doing from ’45 to ’49.</span> <span id="s3537">So I said, I was in – in newspaper, Polish newspaper.</span> <span id="s3538">Yeah, I was, really –</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3540">A: – in this – in this “Kronika.”</span> <span id="s3541">So, said, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s3542">I says, well, it has the way of make living.</span> <span id="s3543">One work, and next one they had ways to steal.</span> <span id="s3544">I don’t want steal, so I got no other choice but to work.</span> <span id="s3545">So he says, John, you okay.</span> <span id="s3546">Okay.</span> <span id="s3547">Next day, the girl came from the office, they called me to the of – main office.</span> <span id="s3548">So I went there, there was the telephone operator.</span> <span id="s3549">She was of Polish origin, so speak – she speak English and Polish.</span> <span id="s3550">And so he asked me if I drive.</span> <span id="s3551">I di – I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3552">Do you know anything about motors, cars, [indecipherable] trucks?</span> <span id="s3553">No.</span> <span id="s3554">You want to learn?</span> <span id="s3555">I said, I learn many thing, so maybe I can learn that too.</span> <span id="s3556">Okay, tomorrow start in the garage as a mechanic helper.</span> <span id="s3557">This was my career, and I became mechanic helper, and then I became mechanic.</span> <span id="s3558">I have to join the union.</span> <span id="s3559">But when I learn English [indecipherable] I decided to follow my journalist dreams.</span> <span id="s3560">So I register at Loyola University for political science as background for journalist.</span> <span id="s3561">And I went to Mr. Canfield(ph) because I have to, twice a week, quit sooner.</span> <span id="s3562">Four o’clock I have to quit, change, and go to – for six o’clock – six o’clock –</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">Q: Classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">A: – classes at the Loyola Univers – they had main ca – in this downtown campus, across the old water tower in Chicago here.</span> <span id="s3565">So – and Mr. Canfield says, well, it would be hard for us sometimes, because you know, [indecipherable] broke something, so we go to repair on the streets, sometimes far away, even.</span> <span id="s3566">But, that is important to you, so he let me go.</span> <span id="s3567">He let me do that.</span> <span id="s3568">And so, after sometimes, four years or so, I finally get job in Polish – one of the Polish newspaper, as assistant editor, for very little in comparison with what I was making as – as journalist.</span> <span id="s3569">But I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">Q: You mean as a mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">A: As a mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">A: Yeah, and so – but short – after sometimes, I get my Bachelor’s degree from Loyola, and I quit this paper because I don’t like politics of this paper.</span> <span id="s3574">And I get job, very interesting, in Cook county by true friend of mine, was involved in pal – Republican party, and he gave me job in his [indecipherable] he was [indecipherable] at this time Republican elected, and as a bailiff Cook county jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">Q: You were a bailiff in –</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">A: Court, in court.</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">Q: Court.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">A: I mean, in court.</span> <span id="s3579">So the job was to bring prisoner to si – to the court – they – it was no problem because there was tun-tun-tunnel from the jail to – to the court.</span> <span id="s3580">And then sit, keep him in the room there, and walk him out to the court, and sit behind him to make sure that he didn’t jump –</span></p> <p><span id="s3581">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">A: – you know, on – on judge, and so on.</span> <span id="s3583">So it was interesting because we had many cases, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3584">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3585">A: Interesting cases.</span> <span id="s3586">Then they changed swise – switch – cha-changed me to social worker, which was even more in-interesting; social worker in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s3587">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3589">Very interesting job.</span> <span id="s3590">Then they turn me to – switch me to women, because I was oldest of the social workers, so they came to conclusion that I will se – I’ll be more safe – safer than some younger guys.</span> <span id="s3591">And very interesting job, I learn many interesting situation in the life people have, problems and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">Q: And when did you come to work again as a journalist?</span> <span id="s3593">You told me earlier you worked for 17 years –</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3595">Q: – for a major Polish daily.</span> <span id="s3596">Tell me about that –</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">A: As the chief editor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">Q: As chief editor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">A: So I ca – as I said, I came here, I worked for – in the Polish daily paper as assistant editor, but I don’t like that, I quit, I work in jail, then in this –</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">Q: Social work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">A: – social worker in jail, then before that, three years for – in court as a bailiff.</span> <span id="s3602">And then friend of mine, who give me those jobs in the court, became – he was elected – I work with him for several years – he was elected president of Polish National Alliance.</span> <span id="s3603">And when he was elected poli – then president, and the Polish National Alliance owns a newspaper.</span> <span id="s3604">And there was editor for many years, he was old already, he want to retire, but he was friend of the pres – pre-president of the organization, and they s – his friend asked him to keep the job, how long he is president.</span> <span id="s3605">So when he lost the election, so he retired – this guy retired, and my [indecipherable] was elected president, nominated me chief editor of the paper then.</span> <span id="s3606">I was already working some four years before in different paper, so I know Poland – Pol-Polish community already, the – quite good, and the United States, the politics and so on, because I study political science, I participated in some elections, I have some very good friends among politician.</span> <span id="s3607">Yeah, one of them was Congressman Darwinski(ph).</span> <span id="s3608">Republican, very smart fellow, very good, very honest man.</span> <span id="s3609">He was for 24 or 28 years congressman.</span> <span id="s3610">Then I was in campaign of Senator Percy(ph), he wa – he was not senator when he first time ran – ran for – for senate.</span> <span id="s3611">So I was in the – you know, in his campaign staff.</span> <span id="s3612">So – so I was quite prepared for –</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">Q: Active, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">A: – running the paper, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">Q: So tell me, what year did you start, and what year did you finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">A: I – I fin – I worked 17 years.</span> <span id="s3617">I finish the beginning of January, 1985.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">Q: Oh, so you – that’s when you finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">A: Then I finished, and I retire.</span> <span id="s3620">I was already 70 years – 65 – no, 66 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">Q: And now, 30 years later, it sounds to me like you’re still going strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3623">I am still busy, I am still active.</span> <span id="s3624">I was still writing for not too long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3625">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3626">And as I understand, you also – you also participate in the programs of the Holocaust museum in Skokie.</span></p> <p><span id="s3627">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">Q: Tell me what you do there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">A: I am do – I am so-called survivor.</span> <span id="s3630">When – when high school students go through the museum, at the end they met survivor.</span> <span id="s3631">So I am one of those survivors, and I am – I think I am the only one non-Jew.</span> <span id="s3632">Now I learn there’s another Polish fellow.</span> <span id="s3633">But, they came to conclusion that those Jewish survivors sometimes they cannot tell them much, because they were hid – hidden somewhere by Poles, or by –</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">Q: Other people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">A: – Dutch, or whatever nationality the ne – country they were, an attic, or somewhere, and they don’t know much what was going on.</span> <span id="s3636">The only thing that they were there and somebody helped them to survive.</span> <span id="s3637">So in Poland was death sentence for the whole family for helping Jews.</span> <span id="s3638">And I know one case not too far from my village from – through relatives and so on.</span> <span id="s3639">It was really family with six children.</span> <span id="s3640">And they had two co – dra – Jewish cop.</span> <span id="s3641">They got some on attic, you know, some – they stay right there.</span> <span id="s3642">And – and they bring the food, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s3643">And I don’t know how they get – the Germans get –</span></p> <p><span id="s3644">Q: The information.</span></p> <p><span id="s3645">A: – the information, but anyway, one morning they – German – Gestapo plus German police, surrounding their house.</span> <span id="s3646">They get the Jews out, the whole family out on the yard.</span> <span id="s3647">They shoot the Jews, then the children, starting from the oldest, and finishing on – on – on the youngest one, one year old, and then the parents.</span> <span id="s3648">This the way was in Poland for helping Jews.</span> <span id="s3649">And that is true, there’s not – not story.</span> <span id="s3650">It is fact.</span> <span id="s3651">And there were more facts like that, not too many, but – but there were others.</span> <span id="s3652">This I know through family, through – because there was in village not far away from the village where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">Q: Tough.</span> <span id="s3654">Tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">A: Yeah, it was tough.</span> <span id="s3656">And you know, so it is – and only in po – in other countries, for sa – helping Jew, there was concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3657">I don’t know why they got maybe because there was the large – the – in Poland, there were three and a half million Jews in Poland before the war, 10 percent of the population.</span> <span id="s3658">And in addition, they – Poland was consider part of German lebensraum, the territory the Germany needs to create thousand years empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">A: According to Hitler.</span> <span id="s3661">Well, so they exterminate Poles, not as Jews, you know, but because they were born.</span> <span id="s3662">But they use any pre – pretext to kill Poles.</span> <span id="s3663">They – but two millions Poles were taken to Germany to work in factories, and on farms.</span> <span id="s3664">After the war bar – there were about two million Poles in Germany.</span> <span id="s3665">So, in any condition, any pretext they have to kill, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">Q: How do you explain that you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s3667">A: How do I explain?</span> <span id="s3668">Well, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s3669">That is probably the most important part.</span> <span id="s3670">I was young, I – I was strong, and I was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">Q: Like you said in the beginning, there was a bit of a devil.</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">A: Little devil, you know, it was little devil, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">A: Well, it was will to live.</span> <span id="s3675">It was important.</span> <span id="s3676">But not for any price.</span> <span id="s3677">The price we didn’t want pay, it is to cooperate with Germans.</span> <span id="s3678">And those who did, they were sorry, and quite often, ended their life later.</span> <span id="s3679">There was a case – I don’t know personally, but it – he wrote little book or – or something, story, right aft – shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s3680">He was a Jewish fellow, Jewish policeman in Jewish ghetto, in some suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3681">And he escorted his li – his wife and beloved nine, 10 years old daughter to the train going to Treblinka, to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">Q: I know the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">A: Know – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">Q: I know the book, it was “Otwock.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">A: “Otwock,” yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">Q: It was se –

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">Q: So, I think we’ve come to the end of the road, as far as – well, we never could, we could talk for hours.</span> <span id="s3693">I – I have – I have a –</span></p> <p><span id="s3694">A: That is – that is for sure, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3695">Q: I have a feeling that there –</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">A: You know, I lived 95 years –</span></p> <p><span id="s3697">Q: There’s a lot to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">A: – so it is long live – long lifes and lot of things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">A: So I can talk 95 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s3702">But thank you for what you’ve shared with us today.</span> <span id="s3703">I think that it’s amazing, packed in, and – and thank you very much for all those memories and all those experiences, and what you learned from those experiences.</span> <span id="s3704">It is varied, it is not – it is not in one line.</span> <span id="s3705">There’s so many things that you’ve talked about today, that were ironic, that you wouldn’t expect, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">Q: Yeah, but – and yet, they happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3708">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: And it’s important for us to know these things.</span> <span id="s3710">So, do you have any final thoughts before we conclude our interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">A: Well, I don’t know what, what.</span></p> <p><span id="s3712">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3713">Then, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">A: You remember not to do the same thing again, but I don’t believe in very – I – I came to conclusion that humans are beasts, potential beasts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">Q: Yeah, potential.</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">A: Potential beasts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3717">Q: Potential.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3719">So I don’t know if you can avoid that, you know.</span> <span id="s3720">After the Holocaust, it

id="s3730">I have – I met some who don’t believe in Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3731">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3732">Q: Who don’t believe in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s3733">A: Holocaust, yeah.</span> <span id="s3734">There was a book written by a Jewish fellow, I think from – he was in DePaul University, who wrote the book, it is a Holocaust business [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">Q: Ah, I know.</span> <span id="s3736">It’s Finkelstein(ph), I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">A: Something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">Q: Like that, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">A: And so I get –</span></p> <p><span id="s3740">Q: The Holocaust industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">A: He – Holocaust industry, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3742">Q: That’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3743">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3744">And I – before they got this building here in Skokie, they had – they rented.</span> <span id="s3745">So it was a smaller place, and the room was for 60 chairs.</span> <span id="s3746">So quite often we have to go to some schools, you know, large group, and talk to them in school.</span> <span id="s3747">So that has some good part, because we c – it depends on the school how much time I get.</span> <span id="s3748">Here I got half hours, you know.</span> <span id="s3749">And over there, sometimes I get hour, sometimes even more.</span> <span id="s3750">But here they go through museum, so they learn about the many things, you know, ghettos and things like that.</span> <span id="s3751">Well, over there they don’t do that, so I have to mention about that.</span> <span id="s3752">I don’t – I didn’t know exactly what happened in ghetto, because I was not there.</span> <span id="s3753">I know quite a bit, but this is not the same thing.</span> <span id="s3754">And so it – I met some people, as I said, some teachers, who didn’t believe it, and one time, when we were going out, me – sometimes teachers ask students to write their impression.</span> <span id="s3755">So I had several of those letters, I don’t know, maybe close to hundreds of them, and they sent later to me – they sent to Holocaust museum, and the mus – museum to me.</span> <span id="s3756">And there were one or two letters, Jewish money – Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s3757">She mentioned that, that she didn’t believe [indecipherable] at home, they didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s3758">But then, when she saw non-Jew, Polish Catholic, who was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, and he got tattoo numbers, so he was there.</span> <span id="s3759">And he said that what happened to Jews, that they went directly to gas chambers, so he decide – she believe now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">Q: That’s an am – that is an amazing –</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">Q: That is an amazing transformation, and it shows the

know, about.</span> <span id="s3768">And then I ask – go talk to students, how what – they said, well, you know, we learn that from the book, from – teachers told us and so on, but what, 70 years ago?</span> <span id="s3769">For me, what is the difference, 70 or 200 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3770">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3771">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3772">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">A: This is what he – exactly what that student told me.</span> <span id="s3774">And here comes somebody alive, who said that he was beat, that he was afraid, that – you know, what happened to him, and he told us wha – it bring closer this whole history get closer to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3775">Q: Which is also –</span></p> <p><span id="s3776">A: And
