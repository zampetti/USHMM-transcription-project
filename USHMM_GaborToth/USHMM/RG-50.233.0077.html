We’re speaking to Mrs. Elizabeth Lubell of Peekskill, New York.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Lubell, would you like to start by telling us a little bit about your childhood.</span> <span id="s6">Where were you born and the date of birth?</span> <span id="s7">What was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in 1920, December 9th.</span> <span id="s9">I lived in Budapest with my parents.</span> <span id="s10">We, had, I would say, middle class, I would say my father was a hard -working man.</span> <span id="s11">He was a traveling salesman.</span> <span id="s12">He went with his bicycle from store to store, from town to town.</span> <span id="s13">Sometimes he took me with us.</span> <span id="s14">I would say I had a happy childhood, careless, happy life.</span> <span id="s15">Schools were very good.</span> <span id="s16">I went to elementary school, then went to regular gymnasium and then I went to a handelschuler, how do you say this?</span> <span id="s17">Commerce school.</span> <span id="s18">Everything went well until Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Could we jump back a little or -- is that all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Okay, jump back.</span> <span id="s21">Jump back any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What were you like as a child?</span> <span id="s23">Did you have some interests or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: As a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Movie stars.</span> <span id="s27">I had interest as a little child.</span> <span id="s28">I was always theatrically interested.</span> <span id="s29">All the school plays in school,, I was always present and my parents were proudly sitting there listening to me.</span> <span id="s30">As I grew bigger and more serious on that line, I went into more theatrical aspects of school plays and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s31">It was very uneventful but it abruptly changed.</span> <span id="s32">So abruptly that I had a diary, for instance, which I, by coincidence, found it, because not so many documents are found from my life.</span> <span id="s33">As I was reading it, the diary today I was love in this boy, tomorrow with that boy, so I lived really, you know, like any teenager.</span> <span id="s34">All suddenly when Hitler came to power and started to come the news, I personally, immediately took it to my head.</span> <span id="s35">It always was -- the thought always was in my head what will be if something happens to my parents.</span> <span id="s36">I was very much attached to them and I was very much mamma’s and papa’s girl, papa’s little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I had my brother who lives in America right now.</span> <span id="s39">Almost ______.</span> <span id="s40">When Hitler came to power, it abruptly changed my whole lifestyle.</span> <span id="s41">When I was reading in my diaries, from the little girl you can see that there was no ibergan, how do you say that?</span> <span id="s42">It went from one year to another –</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Continuity?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: --it immediately became serious.</span> <span id="s45">There was a childish little girl telling all kind of little stories and all suddenly I heard this one on the radio.</span> <span id="s46">I heard that one on the radio, what will happened.</span> <span id="s47">Because in 1938, it started -- the whole problem.</span> <span id="s48">Then, of course, when my brother left for American, that changed a lot in our lives and our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Why did he leave, did he know?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Because in 1938, it was the first political change in Austria, the Schussnik, you know, there was one --- what was it in Austria, what happened, how do you call that?</span> <span id="s51">The Anschluss, thank you.</span> <span id="s52">With the Anschluss, it was already everybody knew that things will happen.</span> <span id="s53">My brother had the foresight that he asked our relatives, my mother had a brother in America, in Kingston.</span> <span id="s54">He asked for the affidavit; he got married in Poland and they came to Hungary.</span> <span id="s55">As a matter of fact, I remember the last time when she, my sister-in-law called up -- called up her mother and said goodbye because they are leaving tomorrow for America.</span> <span id="s56">At that time, we didn’t, in 1938 you know it was the same story what was with the Germans.</span> <span id="s57">They said it could never happen to us.</span> <span id="s58">It was something entirely new in our life.</span> <span id="s59">Who would think what could happen.</span> <span id="s60">But when that happened in 1938, my brother left.</span> <span id="s61">With that it started, the decline in every way – how we felt.</span> <span id="s62">There was always even so that we still had our normal life.</span> <span id="s63">But as the weeks and months went by, more and more it came, the news from Germany.</span> <span id="s64">A little bit here, a little bit there.</span> <span id="s65">We more and more realizing that we are looking forward for a set time.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Can we stay in the pre-war period for a minute?</span> <span id="s67">Can I ask you about your family, the Jewish aspect of your family?</span> <span id="s68">How were -- were they religious or assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: We were conservative.</span> <span id="s70">We kept every holiday, every significant and insignificant holiday.</span> <span id="s71">We did keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s72">We were very much Jewish oriented.</span> <span id="s73">I had mostly, I would say 90% Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s74">Not -- no gentile boyfriend.</span> <span id="s75">We kept the holidays, we went to shul.</span> <span id="s76">So I would say I had my confirmation in Budapest which I had very nice memories from.</span> <span id="s77">I would say we kept a nice Jewish home.</span> <span id="s78">We were not Orthodox but we were radicals already (?)</span> <span id="s79">What else do you want to know about that aspect?</span> <span id="s80">In that respect we care.</span> <span id="s81">I went to Hebrew, I mean it’s not Hebrew school because that time in Hungary it was not like here.</span> <span id="s82">You had to take separate Jewish lessons if you went to school and that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s83">We had our own group and we had our own hall where we went.</span> <span id="s84">We kept socially and in our artistic field, we kept up with the Jewish place.</span> <span id="s85">As the years went by 1938, 1939, more and more we had our own little Zionist groups, you know, and talked a lot about Palestine.</span> <span id="s86">Young people got together, but we didn’t realize the real tragedy what was facing us that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: In that case, do you care ---?</span> <span id="s88">Where were you at this point then, you were in business?</span> <span id="s89">Studying in business school?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s91">After I finished my business school, I got a job with a lawyer.</span> <span id="s92">The whole year’s, all the way on --.</span> <span id="s93">As a matter of fact, all the way until the Germans came to Budapest, I was secretary with a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: A gentile lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: All gentiles, but the interesting part of it was that towards the end in Budapest we had -- before they made the ghetto, we had to wear the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s96">The lawyer where I worked was not in the Jewish section.</span> <span id="s97">When I went there, I took my star off so I could cross that part to go to work.</span> <span id="s98">That lawyer where I worked was a very, very well known lawyer, not only because he had higher connections; but also he was on in the religious field with nuns and priests.</span> <span id="s99">He was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s100">One day as I was working there and somebody rang the bell and I opened the bell and I saw two so-called Hungarian Nazis who were worse sometimes than the Germans were.</span> <span id="s101">I thought well that’s it.</span> <span id="s102">They will take me.</span> <span id="s103">But they came and they took my boss because he was in the religious.</span> <span id="s104">They did not like very religious people either.</span> <span id="s105">They took him to a concentration camp and I, the secretary, Jewish secretary whom they didn’t know, stayed there.</span> <span id="s106">So that was a rather almost humorous aspect of that case.</span> <span id="s107">So I stayed there for a couple of months without him.</span> <span id="s108">When things got to be very dangerous, then I knew the safe number of that lawyer.</span> <span id="s109">That was right before things got very serious already.</span> <span id="s110">Then I opened up the safe and took out his -- the lawyer’s daughter’s papers, knowing if I have to run away, I will run away with this papers which I did.</span> <span id="s111">Which I used, but that happened later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Do you want to tell me how?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Well, that -- first of all, I have to tell you that we were -- my father and mother were Polish origin.</span> <span id="s114">In 1941, when the Germans were not occupying Hungary yet, they came out -- they give the order to the Hungarians to deport all the non-Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s115">My father in spite of that, that he was as a Hungarian officer in the Hungarian army and he had the Iron Cross and all that things, when the order came out to deport -- you know there was a time in Hungary and when all the non-Hungarian were deported from Hungary and from Budapest.</span> <span id="s116">Unfortunately, we were among them and unfortunately we were among them the very first thing when that deportation started, when we didn’t know yet what’s going on.</span> <span id="s117">They came to our house and they said, pack your bag, we will take you to your own country.</span> <span id="s118">You will work there and you will survive after the war.</span> <span id="s119">That was in June, 1941.</span> <span id="s120">They came to our house and they said well pack your bag and go.</span> <span id="s121">How do you pack your bag when you live there a lifetime?</span> <span id="s122">So we cried and my mother cried and I cried and my fiancé was there.</span> <span id="s123">So the guy, he was new on the job and he had a certain human caring and sympathy to us said, you know what, I will take your father so I’m sure you stay here.</span> <span id="s124">You have one day to pack your bag and do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s125">That’s what he did.</span> <span id="s126">In that one day, I had a choice and some people, some relatives told me, you are young, go and hide before they take you.</span> <span id="s127">But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together.</span> <span id="s128">Please come and whatever will be, we will survive it together.</span> <span id="s129">So we packed our bag and we went outside.</span> <span id="s130">We lived in a house, four floors.</span> <span id="s131">All the tenants were looking and saying goodbye to us.</span> <span id="s132">Some of them cheering, some of them jeering.</span> <span id="s133">That’s how we were deported to Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s134">I say deported to Poland which is again easy to say but how we were and what happened and how we went there and how we walked or whatever happened.</span> <span id="s135">In between a lot of Hungarian, so-called Polish-Hungarian origin got killed in Kamieniec Padolski.</span> <span id="s136">That was a famous town where they -- you heard about Kamieniec Podolski.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: So then most of them who got killed there 40,000, they were all Hungarian origin.</span> <span id="s139">But knowing my parents knew Polish, they all hired a private buggy and we had relatives in Kolomjya.</span> <span id="s140">We stayed -- we hid back from the transport because we knew that the transport is going to Kamieniec Padolski.</span> <span id="s141">A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that buggy to Kolomyja and that’s where we stayed in Kolomjya, that was that time, yes, more or less normal life because the ghetto was not easy.</span> <span id="s142">But of course, after a year being in the ghetto and losing people -- it was over 20,000 people in Kolomyja -- by the time I escaped as a smuggler, there was only a couple of hundred left.</span> <span id="s143">That’s when it was that I said goodbye to my parents and of course, I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s144">I started on the road going back to Hungary which was a bad road to talk about a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Do you ever talk to anyone about the ghetto though, before ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: The ghetto, we lived, it was a whole year.</span> <span id="s147">Before the ghetto, we lived in Kolomyja yet.</span> <span id="s148">When the ghetto came, of course, like everybody else, we had to move in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s149">We also had the -- they said on the tape that three, four families lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s150">Well, where we went, it was rather five, six families living in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: In one room place?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: In a one room place, right.</span> <span id="s153">Then, of course, some of them got killed during the time, so it got less and less.</span> <span id="s154">That’s when I decided after a year being in Kolomyja and about half a year in the ghetto, it’s time to go</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Was there anything while you were there that struck you and made a -- that stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Every day struck me because I was a young person who was rather careful living and all suddenly you are tossed in this situation.</span> <span id="s157">We went to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor.</span> <span id="s158">The other Jews didn’t like him because he was a supervisor.</span> <span id="s159">They didn’t like nobody who supervised over other Jews.</span> <span id="s160">So we worked there for a time.</span> <span id="s161">As a matter of fact, I worked in a kitchen preparing dinner for German officers.</span> <span id="s162">My job was -- with three other girls -- peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s163">At that time, hunger was already a big aspect of ghetto life because you know that people just died of hunger.</span> <span id="s164">So what we did, we got permission for the peels to take home.</span> <span id="s165">We had the peels for whatever meals we made.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: You cooked them?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We cooked the peels, right.</span> <span id="s168">But in order to have something on the peels, we peeled the potatoes in the kitchen thick.</span> <span id="s169">Then we went home and we peeled the pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: We made it so that the peels were thick but then the Germans came to it and they said that whoever will peel like that thick, will have a punishment.</span> <span id="s172">So we couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s173">From then on, we had to eat the peels and not peel the peels.</span> <span id="s174">The other one what I remember from the ghetto, when we went out to work.</span> <span id="s175">Through work, we got to know some other workers.</span> <span id="s176">This was German families who moved into Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s177">They renovated and redecorated a little; we worked on it, to keep it clean until their wife and children came.</span> <span id="s178">We saw the mementoes of a life, you know Jewish life, sometimes we came into a house where we saw the pots and pans yet as they carried them out.</span> <span id="s179">We just had to close our eyes and see what happened there.</span> <span id="s180">We had to clean up and make it ready for the German officers.</span> <span id="s181">I was working there once washing the floors with a pail, you know a big pail of water.</span> <span id="s182">Because you’re asking me to tell you memories from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: So the German --.</span> <span id="s185">Until that time, you know, I knew that I was in danger and everything but I didn’t have any personal contact with any physical punishment.</span> <span id="s186">Cleaning the floor and almost finished it, he came in and he took the pail and he kicked the pail and he said this is not clean enough, clean it again.</span> <span id="s187">So that was my first encounter with a German officer.</span> <span id="s188">As it happened to be, the German officer’s wife came back.</span> <span id="s189">She acted rather humanely to the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s190">It happened to be that, I don’t know whether I should mention it, but everything -- but she had some tendencies for liking girls.</span> <span id="s191">The question was whether to use this situation to your advantage or not to use it to your advantage.</span> <span id="s192">But sometimes, it came to a point, you told me an incident before about bread.</span> <span id="s193">Sometimes you came to a point when the only thing on your mind was, you are twenty years old and somewhere along in the sky when you looked up, there is a life yet for people.</span> <span id="s194">Let’s do whatever is possible but let’s survive.</span> <span id="s195">It happens to be that that woman helped me a lot to get easier job, to get more food until her husband came to the picture.</span> <span id="s196">Then I lost my job.</span> <span id="s197">Then we had to go to a factory where he worked, some kind of, if I remember correctly, I think something with an ironwork or something.</span> <span id="s198">The first day when I went there, we were rather abused that time there.</span> <span id="s199">Then I decided that this is a good place maybe to run away or something or make connections and that’s what I heard the first time, that there is somewhere a small _____________ that it is possible to --.</span> <span id="s200">I stayed in that factory and I worked there.</span> <span id="s201">We went out to ghetto, back to the ghetto and the ghetto was always less and less and less.</span> <span id="s202">My parents were always less and less independent and more and more relied on me.</span> <span id="s203">The roles reversed between parents and children.</span> <span id="s204">Not children because it was only me.</span> <span id="s205">It was me who directed them what to do and how -- like for instance, when I had to go to work, this mother, the Germans looked up and mother got old very suddenly in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">It happened -- it coincided with her menopause too so that was really a hard thing because she acted sometimes very strange.</span> <span id="s207">I was very much afraid -- everything fell on her and she just couldn’t digest the tragedy what fell on her.</span> <span id="s208">I sometimes was the one who had to lead her and say it will be good.</span> <span id="s209">I remember I pinched her cheeks sometimes so she would survive so maybe made a little bit her hair so that the Germans won’t say you are too old to work.</span> <span id="s210">This was a couple of memories from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s211">Then, of course there was also memories.</span> <span id="s212">I met a young man who worked in a soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s213">You know when you are twenty years old, no matter what the situation you are thrust into, you always have a little bit romantic state in you.</span> <span id="s214">Because that keeps you alive.</span> <span id="s215">I met a young man who was very kind to me and he gave me always thick soups and things like that.</span> <span id="s216">I sometimes met him but he had somebody else, I had somebody else but it developed some kind of rapport between us.</span> <span id="s217">I remembered him long after that.</span> <span id="s218">That was, of course my present husband.</span> <span id="s219">But I didn’t know at that time yet.</span> <span id="s220">But when it came to the time that the ghetto got from 20,000 to a couple of hundred, I said that’s it.</span> <span id="s221">I discussed it with my mother the last day.</span> <span id="s222">The last night when I knew that I’m leaving in the morning --.</span> <span id="s223">You know we rather stayed away from kissing or touching or something because you changed.</span> <span id="s224">In order to survive you have to lose your -- certain feelings disappear from you.</span> <span id="s225">But that was the last night and mother just touched me so because she had her own thoughts and I had my own thoughts.</span> <span id="s226">The only thing what I remember that I just wanted to -- that nobody should touch me and nobody should kiss me.</span> <span id="s227">Just to push it away because one more touch and one more kiss, I’m not going to leave.</span> <span id="s228">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s229">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it because one more touch and one more kiss, I’m not going to leave.</span> <span id="s230">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s231">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it.</span> <span id="s232">Because when she wanted to touch me, I just like -- I pushed it away.</span> <span id="s233">I did it in order that I should be able to leave.</span> <span id="s234">The next -- before I left my father gave me that talisman which I carry with me.</span> <span id="s235">I never, never leave it.</span> <span id="s236">Wherever I go, that talisman goes with me.</span> <span id="s237">Somehow, I don’t -- I’m not superstitious otherwise, but I truly believed that talisman saved me from a lot of situations.</span> <span id="s238">When the time will be that I have to go, then I have to decide which of my children will have it.</span> <span id="s239">That was the ghetto and I went away.</span> <span id="s240">I went back to Budapest where that time even so that Hitler was far and advancing all over; it was still not the ghetto.</span> <span id="s241">Only a couple of months later ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I was there a whole year in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s244">From 1941 to 1942.</span> <span id="s245">I have tell you one incident there because that is an -- I try not to go into little details but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: No, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: But this detail was so remarkable that I have to mention it.</span> <span id="s248">After about 25 or 26 days -- the 20th day they caught us.</span> <span id="s249">I think -- did I mention it or didn’t I mention it?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: We were -- oh, I told you that before.</span> <span id="s252">We were walking at night to reach Hungary from Poland.</span> <span id="s253">I mean it was a long road but I cannot go into every aspect of it.</span> <span id="s254">But in any case, we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime.</span> <span id="s255">That was just about the last day before we saw already, the Hungarian border when somebody probably who noticed us, told it to the German guards.</span> <span id="s256">They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the ghetto -- they came up, the German guards and they shot everybody on sight.</span> <span id="s257">I ran away that time and it was laying there a big tree eaten up from the moss.</span> <span id="s258">You know, hollow inside.</span> <span id="s259">There is a lot of fate was in my life what I have to strongly believe that there must be something, somebody, somewhere who prepared that tree for me there, where I went in that tree, in that hollow tree.</span> <span id="s260">Was laying and I was laying; I was in the tree.</span> <span id="s261">I just heard the shooting and the crying and saying no, no; until everything got quiet.</span> <span id="s262">I walked out from the tree and what I saw only dead people.</span> <span id="s263">I started to walk because I think that time; from that day on I was not quite right.</span> <span id="s264">I think I was singing or something.</span> <span id="s265">I said, I’m going back to mamma and how wonderful it is.</span> <span id="s266">I stumbled, by accident, over the smuggler who was also escaping, but not only that he was getting -- he was getting shot and escaping and I found him but everybody had a little knapsack, you know, little knapsack where we had things.</span> <span id="s267">He, in a big hurry, instead of taking his knapsack, took my knapsack, took my knapsack and I am the one who survived.</span> <span id="s268">So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that worked out.</span> <span id="s269">So I found him but he was injured and he said he cannot do nothing.</span> <span id="s270">He gave me his pocketknife and in his tie, he was --.</span> <span id="s271">The trouble as they shot, they shot at my back and it went into his tie, near the genital areas.</span> <span id="s272">He gave me that little knife and he said that I have to take that bullet out which I did.</span> <span id="s273">He was there for the night and then he said, write me that letter that you are here so that I can get my money.</span> <span id="s274">I won’t get too much in any case because from the ten of you, you are the only one survived.</span> <span id="s275">So that’s what the paper what I showed you that I wrote him and that was from the woods.</span> <span id="s276">This was the Hungarian woods in Korosmezo.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Could you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Korosmezo.</span> <span id="s279">Here I write it down.</span> <span id="s280">Kirsh -- this is a border town.</span> <span id="s281">Korosmezo.</span> <span id="s282">This is a border town.</span> <span id="s283">From there, when I am in Korosmezo, I am already in Hungary.</span> <span id="s284">So he said that, he covered me over with leaves and he said I don’t feel good.</span> <span id="s285">So he left me with my knapsack what I had a little sweater on.</span> <span id="s286">It was cold in the woods already.</span> <span id="s287">He said -- he gave me an onion, by the way, which was very good.</span> <span id="s288">He went away and he said he will come for me.</span> <span id="s289">He will whistle a certain way so I know because that was, even so it was in the woods, but people could still go there.</span> <span id="s290">He said when you hear that whistle, then tell that this is you.</span> <span id="s291">So he went away and he left me there four and a half -- four days and one night.</span> <span id="s292">I was in the woods by myself so I was really -- can you imagine that, a twenty- year old girl in the woods, you know, rain or not rain or anything.</span> <span id="s293">There was one incident that something moved, I probably moved and the peasant came there who was taking lambs to eat, to raise or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s294">He heard and he comes straight -- he came straight where I am.</span> <span id="s295">I was just huddling there covered with certain leaves there and I heard the steps closer and closer.</span> <span id="s296">The only thing what he did, he peed and peed on me.</span> <span id="s297">I was just standing there and that was one of the incidents.</span> <span id="s298">Then people asked me what did you eat for four days?</span> <span id="s299">You have to eat for four days, which is not necessarily so.</span> <span id="s300">But I had that one onion and then blueberries grew that time in the --.</span> <span id="s301">When I felt safe enough in the night.</span> <span id="s302">I went around me and I ate some blueberries.</span> <span id="s303">But the fourth night, I dreamed about my fiancé in Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s304">It was a beautiful wedding and everything.</span> <span id="s305">When I got up and I was in the situation, you know, whatever I was in there; I looked up, I said this is sh_____.</span> <span id="s306">I can’t.</span> <span id="s307">There was a limit what I could endure.</span> <span id="s308">And I said, I just don’t care anymore, nothing, when I heard the whistle.</span> <span id="s309">So little coincidences and he did come.</span> <span id="s310">I told him where were you?</span> <span id="s311">I couldn’t talk so good to him because he didn’t talk Hungarian and I didn’t talk so good Polish.</span> <span id="s312">But he said, he was sick.</span> <span id="s313">I mean, I believe it, I’m not such a good surgeon.</span> <span id="s314">He came for me the fifth day and he took me to a place where I had to walk up on the top.</span> <span id="s315">Because I was -- even so I was in Hungary -- I think my husband explained it.</span> <span id="s316">When they catch you there, then they immediately send you back to Germany.</span> <span id="s317">So everybody was afraid to give -- to hide you.</span> <span id="s318">So I was up there in the -- in some kind of an attic waiting for further instruction to go deeper into Hungary.</span> <span id="s319">The deeper you got into Hungary, the safer you were that the Germans -- that they won’t give you over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s320">This was in 1942.</span> <span id="s321">As I was walking down the steps because he told me to come down now we are ready, we have a car and we will go to the next town which is Mag__________.</span> <span id="s322">As I walked down, I saw a figure in the bottom of the steps and I didn’t recognize quite and he probably didn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s323">But when I wrote that letter, you know, what I gave; my fiance, he himself came all the way to the border town, to bring the car and that was him standing downstairs.</span> <span id="s324">I don’t go into the feelings and sentimental aspects with you.</span> <span id="s325">I leave that to your imagination.</span> <span id="s326">.</span> <span id="s327">But it was something to behold.</span> <span id="s328">His life was, of course, at that time in danger because if they would catch him, he would also be -- so he was a Hungarian citizen.</span> <span id="s329">But what I wanted to tell you, what I don’t want to leave out.</span> <span id="s330">As we wanted to go to Mar____ to get with the car and from Mar____ again, you’re already out.</span> <span id="s331">In Hungary you can go with the trains, cars, buses, whatever you want to.</span> <span id="s332">Until that time, you were in danger.</span> <span id="s333">It was a long row of car before the bridge.</span> <span id="s334">When you passed the bridge, you were already in -- on my destination.</span> <span id="s335">There was a long line of cars.</span> <span id="s336">At the beginning of the car, the chauffeur looked out, the one that was paid.</span> <span id="s337">He said, we are in trouble because they re checking the cars, my first instinct was to jump out because if they see me, the way I look from this life.</span> <span id="s338">I was full with lice by the way.</span> <span id="s339">My head was full with lice.</span> <span id="s340">I was dirty ,I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s341">I had wounds, I had all kind of things there from the woods.</span> <span id="s342">If they catch him, he will pay with his life for it.</span> <span id="s343">So I wanted to jump out from the car and if that’s the way, it has to be .</span> <span id="s344">He was holding me back and all suddenly a soldier comes to our car.</span> <span id="s345">Mind you, there was a long line of cars there before us, crossing the bridge.</span> <span id="s346">He doesn’t even look in the back.</span> <span id="s347">It was such a remarkable incident that I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s348">He doesn’t look in the back.</span> <span id="s349">He just goes to the chauffeur and he says, you know, I lost my key.</span> <span id="s350">I can’t even remember what he said -- license or my key or if he said something to the chauffeur -- would you please drive me to Korosmezo.</span> <span id="s351">The chauffeur said, of course.</span> <span id="s352">He came in and sat next to the chauffeur.</span> <span id="s353">As we walked by, you know the cars, and as we reached the point where the guy checked everybody’s card, they just looked in and saw a Hungarian officer.</span> <span id="s354">They just saluted and we went by.</span> <span id="s355">To this day, number one, I don’t forget the incident.</span> <span id="s356">Number two, I don’t believe in supernatural, I cannot quite believe it but there is a tiny little doubt in my mind whether this was not some kind of an angel set down.</span> <span id="s357">Because why would -- I mean it is a coincidence to be mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Oh, yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s359">You had mentioned earlier when we were talking that you had some type of an encounter with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes, that was -- that came later.</span> <span id="s361">Because when -- then I came back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s362">In Hungary as I said at that time was, I was from 1941 to 1942 in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s363">At that time Germany still didn’t occupy Hungary.</span> <span id="s364">It wasn’t ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s365">It was my aunt there and she asked me what it was like and what she didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s366">I ate potato peels and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s367">But as we closed into the year, more and more Germans came to Hungary until finally on the main street of Hungary, the Germans marched in and that was the end.</span> <span id="s368">Hungary was occupied by Germany.</span> <span id="s369">You know Horthy, Horthy was the ---.</span> <span id="s370">So he went away with his white horse and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s371">He tried, as a matter of fact, to save the Jews but he was too weak to do anything in that respect.</span> <span id="s372">Then the Germans came in and then, of course, the Germans took over like they took over the other countries.</span> <span id="s373">Then came the ghetto.</span> <span id="s374">Knowing what the ghetto is because I had a little bit of experience before, so I said I am not going to go in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s375">As I said, I worked with a lawyer and I had this papers from this lawyer’s daughter what I stole from the safe.</span> <span id="s376">I said I’m not and my aunt said, well come with us and everything.</span> <span id="s377">She said, by the way, that time she said, now I know what you told me, what went on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s378">I can believe it now more.</span> <span id="s379">As the year went by, she believed me unfortunately more and more.</span> <span id="s380">She was a very lovely lady, very nice aunt what I had.</span> <span id="s381">They all went to ghetto and I went with the Catholic papers, you know where the Balaton is?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That’s a lake, Balaton Lake.</span> <span id="s384">I was working with my friend, with a Hungarian friend of mine as a maid and a nurse.</span> <span id="s385">One week I was the maid and she was the nurse.</span> <span id="s386">One week I was the nurse and she was the maid.</span> <span id="s387">We worked there a month with my papers what I had and she had other papers.</span> <span id="s388">Catholic, we went to church and I learned to pray and all stuff with the children.</span> <span id="s389">One day a policeman comes to our house and checks our papers.</span> <span id="s390">He checked her paper, he checked my paper and said okay, we will check it out and we’ll come for you in the morning.</span> <span id="s391">.</span> <span id="s392">I knew that they will check out my papers, this was an aristocrat what I worked.</span> <span id="s393">He had a von you know, that lawyer’s.</span> <span id="s394">So I knew that they will know it at the staff that I am not the daughter from that aristocratic man.</span> <span id="s395">So I said to my friend, Monica, I said, you know what.</span> <span id="s396">They will know that we have papers, let’s run away.</span> <span id="s397">We went out to the railroad in the night.</span> <span id="s398">I had four children there.</span> <span id="s399">Parents were somewhere else so I tucked them in and I hoped nothing ill happen to the children.</span> <span id="s400">We went through the window and we went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s401">At the railroad station we met the same guy who came that day for us, for our papers.</span> <span id="s402">That was the end of our freedom.</span> <span id="s403">They caught both of us and that’s how we went from camp to camp to camp to camp.</span> <span id="s404">.</span> <span id="s405">I was that time, that was in 1943, so two years ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: These were all Hungarian workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: These were all Hungarian workers only that one________________ which was the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s408">I ran away from most of them, by the way, because I had the experience already.</span> <span id="s409">I cannot go every aspect of camp life, it would take too long but if you want something to know, I can tell you that I had many, many incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Which one or two stands out?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: The one with Wallenberg, the one what stands out.</span> <span id="s412">We were in -- that was I think, it was at Sarvar, you see my memory is failing me too.</span> <span id="s413">What Wallenberg did, he had a truck.</span> <span id="s414">He had a list of names.</span> <span id="s415">He went to this camps because from this camps, because like for instance at the Sarvar where we were, there was the camp where the war was full-written, goodbye, goodbye because from Sarvar they went to the German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s416">This was a collective camp – where they collected people when they had enough.</span> <span id="s417">Because they didn’t take just a hundred people, they didn’t take.</span> <span id="s418">When there were more, then they took them away.</span> <span id="s419">So this was a camp where from on, there was only one way.</span> <span id="s420">So Wallenberg with his truck, and his men went to this camps with a list.</span> <span id="s421">At that time, they still acknowledged Wallenberg’s authority.</span> <span id="s422">So he came to the camp and we were all standing there and the German guard -- not the German, the Hungarian guard came with him.</span> <span id="s423">He said, this list what I’m reading, all stand forward.</span> <span id="s424">Because this is under the Swiss protection.</span> <span id="s425">He had that list.</span> <span id="s426">I was in that Swiss house.</span> <span id="s427">That’s how he knew me by name.</span> <span id="s428">I think I mentioned it to you that I was there.</span> <span id="s429">So he comes near me and I remember his face and everything.</span> <span id="s430">They called him the Angel of the Jews because he saved so many Jews.</span> <span id="s431">He stand before me and he says are you Margit so- and- so.</span> <span id="s432">I was a little, I guess I was stupid because I didn’t want to say nothing because I went after the rules.</span> <span id="s433">I am not that.</span> <span id="s434">The girl next kicked me and said so why don’t you say that this is you -- that you are Margit so- and -so.</span> <span id="s435">I said yes, yes, I am Margit so-and-so.</span> <span id="s436">He said well, why don’t you step forward, he tells me, Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s437">What does it take so long to recognize your name?</span> <span id="s438">I stepped forward and he took us in the bus.</span> <span id="s439">They took us back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s440">That was one encounter what I had with Wallenberg in person.</span> <span id="s441">I went back to Budapest and now I didn’t have again papers.</span> <span id="s442">The other things what I had from my father.</span> <span id="s443">You know, they wore this gold watches.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Pocket watches.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: It was a chain and --.</span> <span id="s446">I had that chain.</span> <span id="s447">I had that gold chain.</span> <span id="s448">I sewed it in -- not my girdle, I didn’t wear a girdle -- but what holds the stockings, how do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: The______.</span> <span id="s450">garter belt.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Garter belt.</span> <span id="s452">I sewed that up the garter belt around it and for that garter belt, I bought the papers what I still have home.</span> <span id="s453">This is the papers what I showed you.</span> <span id="s454">With that papers, I left in one of the Christian -- I never went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s455">I went to the house.</span> <span id="s456">Budapest was very, very hard bombed.</span> <span id="s457">Of course, between the bombing and the Germans coming to the -- where we went in the basement, how do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: The bomb shelter?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: The bomb shelters, we were.</span> <span id="s460">Between that and that.</span> <span id="s461">I sometimes walked on the streets.</span> <span id="s462">The bombs were falling, the dead people were around me but I felt safer there than in the bomb shelter because the more it bombed, the more and more Germans came -- they had nothing better to do.</span> <span id="s463">The more and more came to the shelter and took out people and took them out to the Danube.</span> <span id="s464">The Danube was floating with thousands of people.</span> <span id="s465">As a matter of fact , I will tell you, remind me if I forget it, because I have to tell you a very important incident after the war, after the ___________, remind me from that.</span> <span id="s466">So, now what did I tell you before?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: The Danube was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s469">So January 18, we were liberated by the Russians and January 16, they still came, the Germans looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s470">One of them when they came in and I was there in the shelter.</span> <span id="s471">I couldn’t walk any more on the street because it was just really 100 % because the bombs were falling like anything.</span> <span id="s472">There I made an acquaintance -- you see -- I must also tell you one other aspect what I don’t like to go into that -- it maybe sometimes embarrassing.</span> <span id="s473">But I said after the ghetto, that I came back.</span> <span id="s474">I said I have to survive.</span> <span id="s475">Standing or laying but I will survive.</span> <span id="s476">Was no morality left in me.</span> <span id="s477">Even so I was brought up in a house where, if I wasn’t home by eight o’clock my father was walking before the house, you know.</span> <span id="s478">There was one guy who said well, I think, I am almost sure that he knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s479">But he somehow got a liking to me and he said that if I’m nice, he will be nice.</span> <span id="s480">I said, I will be as nice as you want me to be.</span> <span id="s481">When the guy came to check the -- because they checked the papers, who is Jewish, who is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s482">There was another family there, a woman and her husband and a son.</span> <span id="s483">A nice, fat, beautiful looking Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s484">She was with papers and I was with papers.</span> <span id="s485">Somehow one Jew recognized the other one.</span> <span id="s486">Somehow be feeling or by look or by eyes.</span> <span id="s487">There was some kind of rapport that one Jew knew what the other Jew.</span> <span id="s488">But one aspect of this which is maybe nobody told you, or maybe they did; there was one aspect to it, when one Jew was caught, then they had the tendency unfortunately, if I was caught, then you should be caught too.</span> <span id="s489">I don’t go into psychological reasoning but maybe there is a reasoning what there is an answer to it.</span> <span id="s490">When the German guy, when that Nazi came to check the papers, this other boy was standing beside me.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">(End of Side A) Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s492">In any case, as I said they came this Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis what they call this the Millerkaras, that was the Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s493">They were sometimes more brutal and more perverse than the Germans, if you can be more.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Linkas______?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Milaschok, No Linka was in Romania.</span> <span id="s496">This was the Milashoke.</span> <span id="s497">So when he came to this couple what I told you that mother and father and son, and take their papers.</span> <span id="s498">They did not accept their papers and they took them out.</span> <span id="s499">Of course, as I told you that time, it was such a big bombardment that they didn’t have time to take them to the Danube so they shot them all too.</span> <span id="s500">Mother, father and son.</span> <span id="s501">I found that out later.</span> <span id="s502">I didn’t know that they were shot right before the house.</span> <span id="s503">But that was not the end of the story.</span> <span id="s504">As they walked out, they looked at me.</span> <span id="s505">I knew that in that moment, in that -- how do you say that in English, there comes a moment of --?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Moment of truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Moment of truth.</span> <span id="s508">In that moment of truth, I didn’t know, will they tell me if they take me, she’s Jewish too.</span> <span id="s509">Or they will say or they will not say that, but in order to save that moment of truth --.</span> <span id="s510">.</span> <span id="s511">You see everybody had a blanket or a quilt or we called it different from a quilt --.</span> <span id="s512">In that moment when they took them out, I thought -- you see at that time I escaped from so many things already that I had a little bit of experience.</span> <span id="s513">I was far from that naïve already what I was before.</span> <span id="s514">I said to the guy who was standing beside me, I said, look, this people, these Jews.</span> <span id="s515">I used the word -- they had a very nice blanket and I don’t have one, can I have it?</span> <span id="s516">It startled the guy who checked my papers.</span> <span id="s517">Before I even gave him my papers, the other guy said, you don’t have to check her out.</span> <span id="s518">She will have the new blanket from the Jew and I will check her out.</span> <span id="s519">He didn’t even have my papers in his hand.</span> <span id="s520">Because my papers was even so I had it with me and they were not.</span> <span id="s521">I was a prostitute according to my papers, that kind of papers I had.</span> <span id="s522">I certainly acted sometimes accordingly.</span> <span id="s523">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s524">In any case, they went away and they took them out and they shot them.</span> <span id="s525">Now I have to interject here now, a scene.</span> <span id="s526">This people whom they shot before the house, she had a brother.</span> <span id="s527">After the war, when we were still in that house, the brother came to pick up whatever they had.</span> <span id="s528">Then they said, I heard that there was somebody here, some shiksa here, who took away my dead brother’s room.</span> <span id="s529">They shot before the house, the _______________.</span> <span id="s530">I want to confront that woman.</span> <span id="s531">I was still, because at that time was still, you know not safe to go out but even so that the Russians took already over, the Germans sometimes came back and forth.</span> <span id="s532">So it was not safe yet to give yourself away.</span> <span id="s533">I never did it.</span> <span id="s534">Some people did it.</span> <span id="s535">They gave themselves away and then the Germans came back, that was the end of them.</span> <span id="s536">I never -- I still didn’t because I knew that they come -- Budapest is two part, Buda and Pest -- in Buda was the Germans, in Pest was the Russians.</span> <span id="s537">They went back and forth.</span> <span id="s538">It took two, three weeks until finally the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s539">So he wanted to confront me that who is that who took her -- and to tell me certain things.</span> <span id="s540">When he came there and was confronted me, it was even so that time that the Russians were there already, I was still afraid.</span> <span id="s541">I said just don’t make too much commotion.</span> <span id="s542">I did that to save my life, I’m Jewish too.</span> <span id="s543">We talked there sometimes and he said well, in that case, I understand it.</span> <span id="s544">That was the after effect of that case.</span> <span id="s545">In any case, we were there in that shelter all the way until January 18.</span> <span id="s546">In the night, one Russian but comes down.</span> <span id="s547">You see, I talk about the Russians so much because the Russians are the ones who liberated us.</span> <span id="s548">Not the Russians, I’m not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: This is 1945 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: This is 1945, January 18.</span> <span id="s551">So my war lasted from 1941 to 1945.</span> <span id="s552">So I was 4 ½ years younger wherever.</span> <span id="s553">When the first Russians came in and mind you, I was still with Catholic papers there.</span> <span id="s554">When the first Russians came in somehow, you know, in any case that day’s already with the bombardment, is catching these parents and everything.</span> <span id="s555">I am quite sure that I was mentally really not right and understandably so.</span> <span id="s556">I was really, really on the end of my line.</span> <span id="s557">I couldn’t take too much more anymore.</span> <span id="s558">When I saw the first Russian, I just -- I said there is other people around.</span> <span id="s559">Wherever we were living in the shelter, that was in the basement, of course.</span> <span id="s560">Half of it was bombed and everything.</span> <span id="s561">I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe.</span> <span id="s562">I’m free, I’m free -- you know, the movies.</span> <span id="s563">They were holding me back.</span> <span id="s564">They said don’t you know what the Russians are doing?</span> <span id="s565">They did a lot of raping, you know that.</span> <span id="s566">They didn’t care whether they rape 18 year old or 88 years old, they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s567">But the difference it was, that the first fighting group who fights for a city is always the elite of the military.</span> <span id="s568">They do not do any raping.</span> <span id="s569">They are not the ones who does it.</span> <span id="s570">The occupying troops are the ones who does it.</span> <span id="s571">When all kind when it was free, free robbery, free raping, free --.</span> <span id="s572">You could do anything.</span> <span id="s573">But the first elite group didn’t do too much raping.</span> <span id="s574">But I wanted to go out and then the girl next to me, she said, what are you so happy about?</span> <span id="s575">To see the Russians, what you know, she started because she didn’t really know who I am.</span> <span id="s576">She just knew how my name is just Komaria.</span> <span id="s577">He was holding me back and I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s578">But the second day, because then they came more and more Russians in the basement looking for men, you know, who was hiding also.</span> <span id="s579">That young man who stood beside me and he said, he told, that was, you know up on the floor it was a department store.</span> <span id="s580">They had in the department store, they had honey left.</span> <span id="s581">Food was a big thing that time.</span> <span id="s582">He comes to me and he says before yet, the Russians came, you know what; there’s big, big container of honey there.</span> <span id="s583">We will go up there and I will give you a lot of honey.</span> <span id="s584">Honey was gold at that time.</span> <span id="s585">That was already after that incident with the Germans so I said now I don’t need him any more.</span> <span id="s586">He said, you know what, I will give you the honey, I saved your life but --- he knew already that the Russians are in the corner but when it comes to it, will you save mine?</span> <span id="s587">How can I save you?</span> <span id="s588">, I said.</span> <span id="s589">You know how you can save it.</span> <span id="s590">So he knew who I was.</span> <span id="s591">Because he wouldn’t ask me that question then whether I can save your life or not.</span> <span id="s592">When the Russians came in, when they were already looking for Hungarian soldiers, or non-Jews, you know, he came to me and he said, help me to get out of here.</span> <span id="s593">I helped you, you help me.</span> <span id="s594">And I did help him to escape.</span> <span id="s595">Whether I did it right or wrong, but I did it and he did escape.</span> <span id="s596">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s597">Well, in any case, then the Russians came in and then of course, it started.</span> <span id="s598">I don’t know whether you know about the aspects of how the Russians behaved.</span> <span id="s599">It was soup kitchens again and it was again standing in the line.</span> <span id="s600">It was all the ruins and I had nobody.</span> <span id="s601">I just walked on the streets, you know.</span> <span id="s602">Sawing people coming out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s603">Everybody says, oh Yaneka,_________, _________, __________, and I went there and I had nobody.</span> <span id="s604">Because everybody died.</span> <span id="s605">I said well, I will look for my aunt.</span> <span id="s606">You know that aunt who didn’t believe me?</span> <span id="s607">They were in the ghetto and they were the rich aunts in the family because they had a house in Hungary.</span> <span id="s608">That was like having a house in New York at that time.</span> <span id="s609">They had some six, seven rooms.</span> <span id="s610">That was an awful lot of room in Hungary.</span> <span id="s611">Here, you know people who works can have four rooms too, it’s nothing.</span> <span id="s612">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them.</span> <span id="s613">It’s nothing.</span> <span id="s614">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them.</span> <span id="s615">It was a big beautiful reunion.</span> <span id="s616">Of course they took away their house, they took away their apartment and they gave them the room where the maid used to live.</span> <span id="s617">There, where the maid used to live, there I was living for them, for a while until they got another room attached to it.</span> <span id="s618">They took back their old room, not the house, just a room, because the Russians of course wouldn’t give them back the house.</span> <span id="s619">What was life, you will ask me after the bombardment?</span> <span id="s620">After the Russians came in?</span> <span id="s621">it was a tough life.</span> <span id="s622">It was first of all, the first days were -- the first week rather after the war.</span> <span id="s623">It was also interesting -- you know we lived on the fourth floor when we didn’t go to the shelter.</span> <span id="s624">After the so-called fighting, I went up on the fourth floor and looked out the window because I was more or less like free then.</span> <span id="s625">Because after five years, you felt that Mommy I survived!</span> <span id="s626">I was rather careless that time.</span> <span id="s627">I went and I looked out the window because I wanted to see what is a war.</span> <span id="s628">You see this is not a war like here.</span> <span id="s629">They drop an atomic bomb and everybody’s boom!</span> <span id="s630">Finished.</span> <span id="s631">There they are fighting corner to corner.</span> <span id="s632">I went up on the window and I looked down and I saw this one is Germans and this one is Russians, they’re shooting.</span> <span id="s633">I look out of the window so they shot up.</span> <span id="s634">They almost shot my head off.</span> <span id="s635">So I got -- well because I didn’t know better.</span> <span id="s636">So I went back to there until things subsided.</span> <span id="s637">At that time, houses were closed yet and Russians were standing all over.</span> <span id="s638">Slowly, slowly life got back to it.</span> <span id="s639">Everything, you couldn’t buy nothing.</span> <span id="s640">As I said, I was secretary for a lawyer.</span> <span id="s641">I had to make something, money didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s642">I had nothing anymore to sell.</span> <span id="s643">The only thing it is to work and get food for it.</span> <span id="s644">The lawyer where I worked, whom I worked before once, he took me back.</span> <span id="s645">Some people came to him, advise us and they gave him eggs and bread or pork fat or whatever they gave him, he gave me part of it as payment to the secretary.</span> <span id="s646">Until things didn’t get back to more or less, I couldn’t call it normal because it was far from normal.</span> <span id="s647">I met one day a friend of our father and mother who did survive.</span> <span id="s648">Her family didn’t survive but her house, her room was bombed.</span> <span id="s649">She lived in a small room and her living room got a full hit from the bomb and it had a hole in the middle.</span> <span id="s650">So I lived in the little room but in that house.</span> <span id="s651">She was very attached to me because I was young and I walked -- you see the Budapest has many, many beautiful bridges which were all bombed, all the bridges.</span> <span id="s652">People went through the Danube back to Buda to get potatoes, flowers or--.</span> <span id="s653">Sometimes I brought it back so she was attached to me because she knew that being young, I will bring something else.</span> <span id="s654">By the way, that time, there was another incident what maybe I will tell you, certain main, main aspects of it.</span> <span id="s655">It was a couple of days after the -- after things settled down -- there was a so-called free, free looting.</span> <span id="s656">People went with big bags in this big department stores and whatever they found they put it in the bag and they took it home.</span> <span id="s657">It was free loot.</span> <span id="s658">The Russians stood there and told you so take it, take it.</span> <span id="s659">If you went out empty handed, they send you back to take something.</span> <span id="s660">So I’m living there in that house where above it was a department store.</span> <span id="s661">In this department store, I thought I will go looting too.</span> <span id="s662">Why not, the other people go, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s663">I didn’t prepare myself with the proper thing.</span> <span id="s664">I didn’t have a bag, I didn’t have a knife, I didn’t have the scissors so I was not quite made for this looting business.</span> <span id="s665">There was big giant men there carting materials and everything.</span> <span id="s666">I was just there.</span> <span id="s667">If they make me , I was some 85 or 90 pounds, if they gave me a push, I would just fall down.</span> <span id="s668">They said if you want to live, you better go away.</span> <span id="s669">I want to loot so I went down where the food was.</span> <span id="s670">There in the food, people went also and took the silverware and whatever it is.</span> <span id="s671">Finally, one guy lifted me up and put me on a bag of flour.</span> <span id="s672">He said you stay here if you want to be alive.</span> <span id="s673">Because they were strong people and I was just a -- the wind could blow me away that time.</span> <span id="s674">I was still there, people took everything and I stood there with -- on the bag of flour until everything was looted out.</span> <span id="s675">I stood there with the bag of flour.</span> <span id="s676">Of course,, I couldn’t take the bag of flour and that was full with pickles and jams and everything.</span> <span id="s677">On me, but I still was sitting on a bag of flour.</span> <span id="s678">What did I do?</span> <span id="s679">I had one and only dress and I took the flour and I put it in my -- here like this, in there.</span> <span id="s680">I went all the way walked that way to my landlady and I said, here we have flour, we make bread from it.</span> <span id="s681">Which we took out the glass and we did make bread from it.</span> <span id="s682">But after a while, it was got to -- I lived that time, I went away from my aunt and I lived in a friend’s of mine, the same friend who was together with me in the camp.</span> <span id="s683">I went to that house and I lived.</span> <span id="s684">You know there was, they call it, belated reaction.</span> <span id="s685">When you know you survived, when you know well, five years went away, you survived alone but you survived.</span> <span id="s686">Then after that when you know that it comes, that psychological for what?</span> <span id="s687">And for whom?</span> <span id="s688">And for why?</span> <span id="s689">That was on fourth floor where I lived that time.</span> <span id="s690">It was in December.</span> <span id="s691">I was just alone, just --.</span> <span id="s692">I said, I --I came to the point that I needed help which I personally didn’t get -- psychological help.</span> <span id="s693">So I opened the window and I went to the windowsill.</span> <span id="s694">I thought, well, many people did that by the way, I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s695">I said well, let’s finish it up.</span> <span id="s696">My landlady, who was a very nice lady, she came into the room and she says Elizabeth, you must be crazy.</span> <span id="s697">You are opening the window and the whole heat what I put up here, it goes away.</span> <span id="s698">I mean I don’t heat here that you open here the windows.</span> <span id="s699">I am standing on the window ledge jumping.</span> <span id="s700">I got very mad and I went then.</span> <span id="s701">I got so mad that I went to her and I start to hit her.</span> <span id="s702">I hit her and I hit her and she kneeled down beside me and she said, oh, Elizabeth don’t do that, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s703">She did that and she said that just to bring me back from the ledge.</span> <span id="s704">Was a nice lady.</span> <span id="s705">After that, I said well, okay, let’s start living.</span> <span id="s706">I went to the soup kitchen and I asked for a job in the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s707">In there, there are so many incidents, so many incidents happened there during the war, after the war, during the bombing, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s708">It is interesting but as I told it to Henry, you cannot go into every aspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Well, okay, you can tell any ones you want, that you would like to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: But that is what is really standing out, I told you.</span> <span id="s711">One day when I went home to my landlady, I met --.</span> <span id="s712">You see, I was working with the lawyer.</span> <span id="s713">In that law office, I met a young Jewish man who also survived the war and who met me in that soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s714">He went not for soups because he was at that time in the black market business.</span> <span id="s715">He started to me -- at that time people only made money because there was no business, nothing, it was only black market He started the black market business very successfully.</span> <span id="s716">He always had an eye on me but I was not too interested.</span> <span id="s717">But after the war, when he gave me a proposition, he said you know what, I mean what is that, you work in the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s718">I have money, you will come and live with me and we will see what we will do.</span> <span id="s719">I probably would have become what papers I had before.</span> <span id="s720">I said okay and I went to my landlady and I had, as I said, one dress which I washed was full with flours.</span> <span id="s721">I said to her, I have a date with that man and he was standing down with the car.</span> <span id="s722">I lived on the second floor at that time.</span> <span id="s723">I told it to my landlady, he’s waiting and my landlady said okay because she wanted something from him too.</span> <span id="s724">I opened the window and I said I coming down five minutes.</span> <span id="s725">Ad I said, I had one dress and I went down to go on a road what could end like Madame X or who knows what.</span> <span id="s726">I don’t know what would have become.</span> <span id="s727">But as I walked down the steps going to the guy who’s waiting for me in the house before the car, a Russian soldier comes up the steps.</span> <span id="s728">I see a Russian soldier, I run because I had incidents with a Russian soldier which I didn’t tell you, which I wrote if you are interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: A jar of pickles where the -- you know the Russians did their -- plenty.</span> <span id="s731">So when I saw a Russian, I run.</span> <span id="s732">This was my experience.</span> <span id="s733">The Russian guy tells me, well Elizabeth, don’t you recognize me?</span> <span id="s734">I didn’t recognize him because he wore the party’s uniform, the red star, that was Russian.</span> <span id="s735">So then I looked at him and then I saw.</span> <span id="s736">I went back with him to my landlady.</span> <span id="s737">My landlady opened the door and said are you crazy bringing a Russian here?</span> <span id="s738">I said, he’s not a Russian, he’s not a Russian, he’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s739">I know him from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s740">Then she said, but he’s waiting downstairs with the car and I said -- but you know it’s interesting and I don’t want to be sentimental about it and we are old enough not to be.</span> <span id="s741">But five years I fought for my life.</span> <span id="s742">In a minute, he came into my life.</span> <span id="s743">I said well, that’s it for me.</span> <span id="s744">Now take over -- and he did.</span> <span id="s745">That was how we met.</span> <span id="s746">Now what do you ask me now?</span> <span id="s747">What do you want to know more?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: I think that should possibly do it.</span> <span id="s749">I think I’ve --.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: And then of course we waited and we went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s751">From Vienna, we went to the consulate.</span> <span id="s752">The consulate said the quota is closed.</span> <span id="s753">Then all suddenly my brother kept sending me affidavits and everything.</span> <span id="s754">Meanwhile I got pregnant too.</span> <span id="s755">We thought we settle down in Vienna like many other Jews.</span> <span id="s756">But then one day there comes -- he writes me a letter, the Polish quota is open.</span> <span id="s757">Let’s go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You mentioned something about a trip to Israel.</span> <span id="s759">That was just to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: The trip to Israel was before when we knew already that we come to America and we had brothers that time in Israel, so we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s761">As a matter of fact, Barbara, our daughter, the first move what she made was in Israel.</span> <span id="s762">That was the trip before we go.</span> <span id="s763">One thing, I want to tell you more.</span> <span id="s764">As a -- in the tape -- because that was also a nice incident.</span> <span id="s765">On what we came is the Mauretania.</span> <span id="s766">When you are nearing the Statue of Liberty, the captain, especially at that time --.</span> <span id="s767">By the way, we were one of the last who didn’t go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s768">Before us they still went to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s769">When we came, it was not Ellis Island anymore.</span> <span id="s770">So there was two incidents what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s771">So then we were on the boat and we were nearing the Statue of Liberty and the captain of the boat was reading there, you know, Give me your tired, your poor, and we were standing, Henry and I and he had his story to tell and I had my story.</span> <span id="s772">I was pregnant and we went to America and we were holding hands and we were looking at the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s773">And I said, well, we made it.</span> <span id="s774">That’s the end of the story.</span></p></body></html>
