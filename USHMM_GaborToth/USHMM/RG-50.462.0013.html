interviewing Mina Kalter.</span> <span id="s3">Mina, can you tell me where you were born, and when, and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">MK: I was born in Przeworsk, Poland, on March 15, 1921, and was the oldest of four children.</span> <span id="s5">I had three younger brothers, and I had a family of close to sixty-five people, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">ER: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">MK: My father was a partner to a business that dealt with countries surrounding Poland, which took him out of the country for three months, generally, during the year, countries like Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Germany.</span> <span id="s8">My mother had a retail business in textiles, silk, and woolens.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">ER: What was your life like before the war, or before your life was changed by the Nazi victories in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">MK: Well, I generally was quite innocent and quite beautiful.</span> <span id="s11">I think a Jewish child in Poland had learned at a very early age what is important to life, the application of morals and ethics that were taught to Jewish children; we lived them, literally, to the law, no questions asked.</span> <span id="s12">The most important thing was God, our religion, and our family.</span> <span id="s13">My parents, at a very early age, taught us what it means to help the less fortunate, the dispersed.</span> <span id="s14">They were very heavily involved in charitable institutions, and I can remember every winter, where the house was packed to the gills with shoes and coats, with moneys that were collected from people who could afford it for children of poor families, whose children had nothing to wear especially in the city of Polish winters.</span> <span id="s15">The life of a religious, very close-knit family was very meaningful and very beautiful, and as I said, very innocent.</span> <span id="s16">And, since there was no television—these were the times before X-rated movies and such—mostly our leisure time was spent at the library or in a Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">ER: Did your family experience any anti-Semitism before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">MK: Not per se.</span> <span id="s19">In all honesty, I can tell that we lived on very good terms with our Christian neighbors and friends.</span> <span id="s20">I had very close friends, Christian girls, who used to come on Saturday in the afternoon and bring me the homework, because in Poland Saturday is also a school day, and homework had to be made up.</span> <span id="s21">So, generally, around 12:00 or 1:00 in the afternoon, when school was over, the girls used to come into our house; they generally used to share our dinner table and Shabbat meal of the afternoon.</span> <span id="s22">There was a lot of friendship and we shared times of joy and times of sorrow; we attended each other’s weddings and, God forbid, if something happens in a family, like a funeral.</span> <span id="s23">And, our neighbors and friends were considered as such.</span> <span id="s24">This was until 1939.</span> <span id="s25">But, unfortunately, when the war broke out, this whole situation had taken a different turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">ER: Now, you said that you, yourself, did not attend school on Saturdays because of Shabbat, and you didn’t suffer any penalties.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">MK: Well, we did not suffer any penalties because the school work had to be made up, as I said.</span> <span id="s28">All the Jewish students were exempt on Saturdays from school.</span> <span id="s29">We were not forced to go on Saturdays.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">ER: You mentioned that your family belonged to some Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s31">Can you tell me about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">MK: Yes.</span> <span id="s33">My father, although a very religious person, belonged to the Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s34">This is a Zionist organization, but with a religious background.</span> <span id="s35">My mother was more religious than my father.</span> <span id="s36">She wore a wig, didn’t have one hair underneath, her head was totally shaved.</span> <span id="s37">A very progressive, very intelligent woman, she read.</span> <span id="s38">We had a very extensive library at home with all the German classics, Schiller, Heine, Goethe, and the children had learned to play the violin.</span> <span id="s39">And she belonged to the Agudat Israel, which was even more religious than the Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s40">But, they were, as I said, their life was just helping other people, always ready with a loan, with a good word, with advice to anybody who needed it.</span> <span id="s41">And this is what they inculcated in their children, and this is something that is following us all our lives.</span> <span id="s42">And, hopefully, we can follow up on it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">ER: Did any of the men in your family serve in the National Army in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">MK: Yes, my uncle did, mother’s brother did.</span> <span id="s45">My father did in 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">ER: Can you tell me a little bit about your life in Poland in the early part of 1939, before the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MK: Well, in 1939, in the beginning of 1939, I was not at home.</span> <span id="s48">I have attended, I have commuted every day to business college in the city of Jaroslaw, which was only 30 miles from my home town.</span> <span id="s49">I commuted by bus every day.</span> <span id="s50">And, my parents, as I said, my mother attended to her business, and the younger brothers went to school, and before 1939, before the Nazis invaded Poland there was a feeling in the air, actually, from 1936.</span> <span id="s51">I remember, 1936, my mother suggested to my father that we should either enlarge the home, or sell it and move into a larger house, because the home, we only had three bedrooms, and one of the bedrooms was small, and with four children, it’s, not by American, by Polish standards, by American standards it would be considered a small house.</span> <span id="s52">It was a single home, very beautiful, with three bedrooms, a typical white picket fence and gorgeous plants and shrubs and fruit trees, lilac trees.</span> <span id="s53">But, my father said that, knowing what is going on just across the western border with Germany, we had to, we should wait and see what the situation is going to bring, because we, the way the situation is now, we can only hope that it’s not going to happen.</span> <span id="s54">But, unfortunately, in 1933, once Hitler took over Germany, he began expelling Jews who were not born in Poland [she probably means Germany], and we had quite a few who came back to Poland because they were not born in Germany.</span> <span id="s55">But, unfortunately, 1938, all the borders were closed and Jews could not leave Germany, couldn’t go any place.</span> <span id="s56">So this was the situation.</span> <span id="s57">We were just sitting and waiting for something to happen.</span> <span id="s58">We didn’t know what, but everybody had...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">ER: Did anybody try to leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">ER: Even after Hitler took Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">MK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">ER: You were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MK: We were sitting and waiting what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s65">As we see the situation now, nobody would have been able to go any place, because there was not one country that was willing to accept anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">ER: About how many Jews lived in your city or your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">MK: Seven thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">ER: Was it a highly organized Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">MK: Very, was a very well-organized Jewish community, was a Jewish kehilla, which was a Jewish Council, that had a representation in city government.</span> <span id="s70">My great uncle, my grandmother’s brother-in-law, was one of the councilmen, the only Jewish councilman in the city hall.</span> <span id="s71">But, the problem was such that the Polish government had no, there was no system like it is here in the United States, of Social Security, or welfare, that helped the poor people.</span> <span id="s72">It was the responsibility of the Jewish Council to take care of the poverty-stricken people, of the ill, and extend to them any kind of help that they, the Jews, needed.</span> <span id="s73">So, we organized an organization called in Polish Towarzystwo Ochrony Zdrowia, which means it was an association for prevention [defense] of health.</span> <span id="s74">These, they were a few ladies who organized this association, and the young people, the people my age, and some of them even younger, there were groups of boys and girls who were canvassing the city every Thursday evening.</span> <span id="s75">And everybody in the businesses and homes wrote down in the beginning of the year how much they would be able to contribute every week, and we went out every Thursday evening, spent three or four hours every Thursday evening, walking from home to home and business to business, collecting these moneys for which, as I explained to you previously, clothing was bought for these poor children, and shoes, medication, and extended help to women in labor from poor families, or ill if they needed somebody to come help them with taking care of their house and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">ER: So you feel that the kehilla really did represent the best interest of [the] Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">MK: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">ER: Can you tell me what happened to you and your family during the weeks following the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">MK: Well, the Germans marched in on Poland, as you know, on September 1, and on September 12 the first units, German units, started marching into the highway leading into my home town.</span> <span id="s80">This was on Sunday.</span> <span id="s81">On Sunday night, we heard on bullhorns that were right in the streets and trucks, announcing that everybody should open the businesses, because the businesses were closed from the time that the air raids began.</span> <span id="s82">It was a small town, only 65,000 population, but it was a very important industrial and railroad center.</span> <span id="s83">The bombs were dropped on the railroad, also on the sugar factory and refinery.</span> <span id="s84">We had oil tanks that distributed the oil into the fuel refineries and gas stations that needed them.</span> <span id="s85">We had quite a few factories on the other side of the tracks, and all this was bombed.</span> <span id="s86">So since the air raids started, the businesses were closed.</span> <span id="s87">Nobody opened the stores.</span> <span id="s88">But they announced on Sunday that everybody should go back to their respective shops and businesses, that life is going to go on as normal, as it was before the war.</span> <span id="s89">And all the citizens, regardless of what we may have heard, are going to be treated equally.</span> <span id="s90">On Monday, in the afternoon, of course, the schools had opened on Monday, and I remember at 1:00 in the afternoon, I was standing on the steps of my mother’s store, and we saw a plane swooping down very low over the crowded Jewish section of the city, where ninety per cent of the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s91">The plane dropped a bomb on the synagogue; that was the second oldest synagogue in Poland, over 600 years old.</span> <span id="s92">When the synagogue was caught on fire, of course, the first impulse of the Jewish population was to run to the synagogue and try to retrieve the Torah scrolls, or the books, the holy objects, take them out of the ark, but the soldiers standing in front of the synagogue [were] not letting anybody in.</span> <span id="s93">They themselves took out of the ark whatever they could, tore the Torah scrolls in half, made a bonfire in front of the synagogue and laughed, and said to the Jews, “Well, here is your Jewish God burning, and if you think he can still help you, start praying to him.”</span> <span id="s94">My father’s two sisters lived in that same neighborhood, nor far from the synagogue, about a block and a half.</span> <span id="s95">And they have, their homes were burnt down, and they couldn’t retrieve anything out of their homes, only a few things that they could carry out in their hands, and we took them into our little house.</span> <span id="s96">We also had taken in a family of strangers from the city of Cracow, who ran away from the Nazis thinking that somehow the Polish Army would be able to stop the onslaught of the Nazi Army.</span> <span id="s97">But they caught up with them in our home town and they had no where to go.</span> <span id="s98">They were standing on the corner of our street and crying—a father, mother, and six small children.</span> <span id="s99">So we wound up with twenty-eight people in our small house.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">ER: At this time, did you receive any help of any kind from non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MK: In the beginning, we had some food stashed away, because, when already, I remember, by the end of August, my father, as a matter of fact, on August 31, he had, he went to the post office and mailed a note, a business note, to our wholesaler in Cracow.</span> <span id="s102">And the officer at the post office said to him, “Mr. Basseches, why are you sending him a check now?</span> <span id="s103">Don’t you know that the war, we are just waiting for this to happen.”</span> <span id="s104">So my father said to him, “I owe the money.</span> <span id="s105">It’s payable today, and I’m paying it today.”</span> <span id="s106">But we had accumulated some food which lasted us for about four weeks.</span> <span id="s107">But when you have twenty-eight people in your house, no matter how much you have, no matter how much you try to economize, it doesn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s108">I remember, in the meantime, the High Holidays happened, the Rosh Hashana, and you were not allowed to pray in the synagogue, which was only across the street.</span> <span id="s109">We had almost a minyan in our house of males, and only one person from across the street came in, and I stood guard outside at the gate, watching that nobody is coming and make sure that services are done very quietly, because they had to be done very early in the morning, because everybody had to go to work.</span> <span id="s110">They took out all the men from fifteen to seventy and the women from fifteen to sixty-five to work.</span> <span id="s111">So, at dawn, we performed the services in the house.</span> <span id="s112">But, almost four weeks into our being under the Nazis, I remember my mother taking out a silver candelabra out of the china closet.</span> <span id="s113">My mother was tall and blond and did not look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s114">She had a very light complexion and spoke perfectly German, because during the First World War, her parents sent her out to Czechoslovakia, and she was like adopted to the family of these German-speaking people and spoke German very fluently.</span> <span id="s115">So she walked to the back streets, put on a black shawl, and hid this candelabra, the candlesticks, the candelabra, under this shawl, then knocked on the door of our very good customer and friend, a Mr. Pretorious, a baker, and asked him to trade it, this candelabra, for a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s116">She said, “I have twenty-eight people in my house.</span> <span id="s117">Would you please just trade me this candelabra?</span> <span id="s118">I don’t ask much for it.</span> <span id="s119">Just give me a loaf of bread.”</span> <span id="s120">And the man looked at her and burst out in laughter and said to her, “Why should I trade you anything?</span> <span id="s121">Whatever you Jews have is going to be ours anyway.”</span></p> <p><span id="s122">ER: And this man was a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">MK: And this man was considered a friend.</span> <span id="s124">Whenever they used to come into the store, we never asked them whether they have money to pay for the merchandise, generally, on the first, because the first was the day when teachers, and government officials had gotten their pay.</span> <span id="s125">So, generally, on the first, or right after the first, people had more money than during the month.</span> <span id="s126">So, whenever they had the money, it was written down, whenever they had any money, that’s when they brought it, on account, or paid in full.</span> <span id="s127">It was never a question of that.</span> <span id="s128">So, this was our friend, on whom we thought that we can count in our very sorrowful times.</span> <span id="s129">But that was what the situation looked like.</span> <span id="s130">What the conditions were, of course, very severe, everybody came home generally beaten.</span> <span id="s131">My brothers came in, first ten days, right after the Germans came in, they came with swastikas carved out in their foreheads, both kids.</span> <span id="s132">The only one who wasn’t taken out to work was my youngest brother, Benny.</span> <span id="s133">My other brother was not even quite fourteen years old, but he was very tall and they didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s134">They thought that we were lying, that they had taken him also.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">ER: Where did they make him work?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">MK: They made him work at the factories, at which I explained to you, that were bombed.</span> <span id="s137">We had to clear the tracks, clean the German latrines, their horses, their headquarters, wash the floors, carry the water, because there was no system of sewage; water from the wells, whatever they needed, wherever they needed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">ER: Now, were they making just the Jews do this, or were they making all the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">MK: No, just the Jews, just the Jews, just the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">ER: When were you ordered to go to a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">MK: By the end of October.</span> <span id="s142">Only two months, two months later.</span> <span id="s143">They had gathered all the male population the day before, and told them that at 6:00 in the morning, the keys to homes and businesses, all the valuables, and the money should be taken to city hall.</span> <span id="s144">What is going to happen next morning, we did not know.</span> <span id="s145">But we knew that at 6:00 in the morning, we had to be assembled in front of each, everybody’s home, wherever they lived, and we didn’t know where we were going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Talking about jewelry, my mother just refused to take off her wedding band.</span> <span id="s147">She said this is something she does not, she’s not giving up.</span> <span id="s148">She said regardless of what the Nazis are, whatever they think, this is something she is not giving up.</span> <span id="s149">This is the bond that God created, not man, and regardless of what’s going to happen to her, she just refused to part with this wedding band.</span> <span id="s150">And we had in the back of our home a family with whom we, I mean the kids, would run back and forth from our garden to theirs.</span> <span id="s151">The gentleman [unclear], I would still call him that, was a retired Polish officer, and when he stood in front and watched us, standing in front of the house, with a little bundle of nothing, whatever we could carry on our hands, they would not allow us to take anything else except everybody had permission to take as much as they could carry.</span> <span id="s152">So, what do you take out in the fall?</span> <span id="s153">You take a coat, you take a pair of boots, take maybe a pillow or blanket, a few changes of underwear, how much can you carry, especially children?</span> <span id="s154">When he was standing, watching my mother, supposedly he came over to say good-bye, he tried to console her, said, “Well, this is not going to last forever.</span> <span id="s155">Don’t worry, you’ll come back.</span> <span id="s156">And you know what, why should you risk your life with this wedding band?</span> <span id="s157">It’s just a plain, gold wedding band, nothing ostentatious.</span> <span id="s158">Give it to me, I’ll hide it for you.</span> <span id="s159">When you’ll come back, I’ll give it back to you.”</span> <span id="s160">So, these were our very good friends and neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">And when we left the house, there was already a truck standing in front of the home to get everything out, whatever they could lay their hands on.</span> <span id="s162">It just so happened that whatever we had in our home was very beautiful and very expensive, and my parents could afford it.</span> <span id="s163">And they had terrific taste in furniture, and silver, everything.</span> <span id="s164">So we knew that the minute we leave, all this is going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">We were taken to the pastures behind a cloister, a monastery of the Order of the Bernardines.</span> <span id="s166">It was a day, I don’t, I think as long as I’ll live, I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s167">It was teeming, it was a cold, soaking to the bone rain with tiny, tiny, little hails, and we were being led to this monastery, where we were waiting for about an hour-and-a-half in the soaking rain.</span> <span id="s168">The water on the pasture reached almost to our knees.</span> <span id="s169">There were standing the Jews from the whole town, with their bundles of possessions, with their small children, with their elderly people, and the rabbi and his two sons were taken out of the line, and the members of the Jewish Council, of the kehilla, were ordered, “Dig a grave!”</span> <span id="s170">And to this grave, the rabbi and the two sons were thrown.</span> <span id="s171">And when we left, they were still alive, because we could see the earth moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">From there, we were taken to the burnt out section of the city, which I explained to you before, that was totally burned; the homes were only, the walls were halfway standing; they were, almost more than half of the homes had no roofs.</span> <span id="s173">There was no heat, there was no electricity, there was no running water, there were no sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s174">In the first few weeks, which was then called the ghetto, it was open.</span> <span id="s175">We were taken out to work every day, but small children could still sneak out and steal from the fields, if they could find a beet or a potato, or go to the railroad tracks, bring a piece of wood or a few pieces of coal.</span> <span id="s176">Only a couple of weeks later, the ghetto was encircled by barbed wire, by four watch towers that were manned twenty-four hours a day, and nobody could get out any more, except to and from work.</span> <span id="s177">There were gates through which the people taken out to work were counted, and, of course, on the way to work, everybody generally was beaten and insulted, and called subhumans and... They tried, of course, to dehumanize us and believed that we are not worth to be alive any more, that Jews were the downfall of Germany.</span> <span id="s178">Jews were blamed for all the ills that Germany went through economically and otherwise.</span> <span id="s179">And, due to lack of sanitary facilities and no medical help, all kinds of diseases began spreading, especially typhus and dysentery.</span> <span id="s180">And these are diseases that are very contagious.</span> <span id="s181">So, since the Germans felt that they wanted to have as much use as they can out of the Jewish body, they have built a barrack at one end of the ghetto where there was no doctor.</span> <span id="s182">There were only a few attendants that took care of the people as long as they lasted.</span> <span id="s183">And, those who were ill for a long time were either shot or just left to die.</span> <span id="s184">It was a common sight.</span> <span id="s185">It began to be a very common sight to see on your way to work all the people in the streets dying and dead.</span> <span id="s186">I think that I would consider those who died then as in some ways worthy by God because we still could bury them according to Jewish tradition, according to Jewish custom.</span> <span id="s187">At least they didn’t go to the chimneys.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">ER: I just want to interrupt for one second.</span> <span id="s189">About two months after the Germans invaded, they already had the Jews in the ghetto and with these very poor conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">MK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">ER: So it was almost immediate?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">MK: Almost immediate.</span> <span id="s193">As a matter of fact, we did not know whether there are any other ghettos, whether there would be any other ghettos.</span> <span id="s194">The reason we thought that we are there is because my home town was only fifteen miles from the border that was established then between Germany and the Soviet Union, because the Germans marched in on Poland from the west.</span> <span id="s195">The Soviet Union marched in from the east, and we were fifteen miles from the River San, which was then the temporarily established border dividing the forces of Germany and the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s196">So we thought maybe the reason is that the Germans did not have enough confidence in us, knowing that the Russians are only a few miles away; therefore, they separated us from the mainstream of society and maybe from the Soviets.</span> <span id="s197">They had no confidence, because that’s all we heard is Jews are Communists, and that’s maybe the reason we are there.</span> <span id="s198">We had absolutely no idea, but as time went on, when we were at the railroad station, and we began seeing trains, cattle trains with small gratings in them, and we noticed that the faces are Jewish.</span> <span id="s199">We had no access to these trains, but we had a sinking feeling in our heart that things are happening.</span> <span id="s200">Seeing what’s going here, the situation is going from bad to worse, that some things are happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">And while, especially in the beginning, in 1939, in the winter, I’ll never forget that winter of 1939, Christmas especially, when you could hear the church bells calling and you looked out through the barbed wire seeing Christians going to churches with their children, with their families, throwing snowballs, in all their finery, dressed up.</span> <span id="s202">And here these kids, our kids, were laying in the streets and crying for a little bit of water, and their father and mother couldn’t even give them that.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">ER: Were there any other refugees from other cities in your ghetto, or was it just people from your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">MK: No.</span> <span id="s205">As a matter of fact, later on when the ghetto was dismantled, the people from our ghetto were sent out to the ghetto of Sedziszow, a larger one.</span> <span id="s206">They generally, later, controlled the Jewish population in one place, gathered them from smaller places into a larger place where they can control them with the same amount of guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">ER: After the ghetto was closed and you were just taken out to work, how did you and your family support yourselves?</span> <span id="s208">How did you eat?</span> <span id="s209">Where did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MK: We had been given, in the evenings after work, a small bread ration and a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s211">That was all we could get.</span> <span id="s212">This was for people who did work.</span> <span id="s213">For those who didn’t work, especially the small children and the older people, didn’t get anything to eat at all.</span> <span id="s214">So as far as our situation was concerned, we did get, in the beginning, five bread rations for the five of us, except for Benny, except for my youngest brother who was only eight years old.</span> <span id="s215">Later on, as time went on, my mother developed a very severe, a heart condition and very high blood pressure, and, of course, not having any medication, not having any medical help.</span> <span id="s216">There was a nurse in the ghetto with us, who worked for the physician whom we used to use, and she suggested that in the beginning anyway, that what we could do for Mom is open a vein in her arm and release the blood, which would probably control the flow of blood to her brain, which would mean, would control blood pressure that way.</span> <span id="s217">But how much blood did she have?</span> <span id="s218">In the beginning of 1941 she was so ill that she couldn’t work any more.</span> <span id="s219">Her body swelled, and her legs swelled, and she couldn’t walk, and she couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s220">So, occasionally, we used to have...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">ER: And she was a young woman at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">MK: Yes, she was forty-five.</span> <span id="s223">They selected people to be sent out of the ghetto, would be excused.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s225">ER: This is Ellen Rofman interviewing Mina Kalter, side two.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">MK: Where she would be able to get the help that she needs.</span> <span id="s227">Not more that she believed it than we did, because she was not the first one to be taken out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s228">We never heard of these people who did leave.</span> <span id="s229">Before that, about four or five weeks before this, my Mom’s predominant worry was what will happen to Benny if something should happen either to her or my father, because they were still together.</span> <span id="s230">In the beginning, families were all together.</span> <span id="s231">Later on, we were separated.</span> <span id="s232">Only small children were left with the parents, and the girls were in one end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s233">The females and the males were in other make-shift barracks, and she was terribly worried what is going to happen to Benny if, God forbid, something should happen to her.</span> <span id="s234">And that’s all she was worrying about, day and night, day and night.</span> <span id="s235">I knew that this is not good for her condition.</span> <span id="s236">So, I shared a bunk, a hard—if you can call it a bunk.</span> <span id="s237">It was a slab of wood on which we slept five of us, five girls together.</span> <span id="s238">One of them was Paula, my best friend since practically, since Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s239">And, with the help of the girls, we planned, we came up with a plan that we’ll try to sneak Benny out of the ghetto if we can.</span> <span id="s240">Not only did I risk my life, which, under these conditions, it was not important; he was my brother.</span> <span id="s241">I had to do for him whatever I could.</span> <span id="s242">But the other girls risked their lives just the same as I did, for their complicity in this whole thing.</span> <span id="s243">Well, Benny was very skinny and very thin, almost emaciated.</span> <span id="s244">I had no problem hiding him under my coat.</span> <span id="s245">I had tied his legs up to about his knees.</span> <span id="s246">I tied him very close to my body, and we went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s247">He was unnoticed.</span> <span id="s248">We stood very close to one another in the lineup, two of the girls in front of me, I in the middle, two the others in the back, and they had not noticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">I have taken Benny to Nellie which was the housekeeper for my grandparents.</span> <span id="s250">She worked for them for close to forty-five years practically, since the day that they got married.</span> <span id="s251">Nellie was like a member of our family.</span> <span id="s252">She knew all the Jewish customs, all the Jewish traditions; she spoke perfectly Yiddish.</span> <span id="s253">She even knew the prayers; she sang at my grandparents’ home.</span> <span id="s254">On Shabbat, she sang the z’mirot [traditional Sabbath songs] with the children and the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s255">Plus, her husband was a semi-invalid, and my grandparents were really very good to her.</span> <span id="s256">When her children were small, and they were hanging out all the time with her mother; they ate there, and they sometimes slept there.</span> <span id="s257">It was like one big happy family.</span> <span id="s258">In those days, Nellie’s children were already married.</span> <span id="s259">She was in a small, little hut at the edge of town just with her invalid husband.</span> <span id="s260">When I knocked on the door and Nellie looked at me, she didn’t recognize us, but she recognized me by my voice.</span> <span id="s261">So, when she heard what I want from her, there was no hesitation on her part whatsoever.</span> <span id="s262">I said to her, “I’m going to leave Benny here, and I know you would do for him whatever you can.</span> <span id="s263">And if you can save him, I know that you will do it.</span> <span id="s264">And I have nothing to give you.”</span> <span id="s265">A lot of Christians did hide Jews in the beginning, but it wasn’t for free.</span> <span id="s266">They took their jewelry, they took whatever they had, and at the end when they have nothing left, then they denounced them to the Germans.</span> <span id="s267">But I had nothing to give her, and Nellie, out of the goodness of her heart, did take him in.</span> <span id="s268">And when I said good-bye to my brother, I didn’t know whether this is the last time I see you, or whether I will ever see him again.</span> <span id="s269">But, I was at ease to the degree that I knew that if she can do something for him, if anybody can save him, she will.</span> <span id="s270">And, this was a load off my mother’s shoulders, because she was also satisfied knowing that he is with Nellie, and God is going to be good to us, and he will survive somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Well, the day before she was supposed to leave the ghetto, that’s what she did with her wedding band.</span> <span id="s272">She gave it up for an apple.</span> <span id="s273">Somebody traded an apple for, with her; I don’t know where the apple came from.</span> <span id="s274">Maybe there were smuggling something small for a price into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s275">I’m not familiar with the situation, but I only know that she got hold of an apple.</span> <span id="s276">She took the apple and baked it on a piece of wood on the floor, and when, God only knows how, to this day I can not understand why she took the endurance and the strength.</span> <span id="s277">She had no shoes; she had a pair of torn slippers.</span> <span id="s278">She had only a cotton dress on and that black shawl.</span> <span id="s279">And she walked in the snow in late February to that makeshift infirmary at the other end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s280">There was a man by the name of Mr. Turner who wasn’t even from our home town.</span> <span id="s281">He was a total stranger with whom the Nazis caught up in our home town.</span> <span id="s282">She only met him a couple of times on the lineup on the way to work.</span> <span id="s283">He worked in the same detail as my brother.</span> <span id="s284">Mr. Turner was laying in a coma with typhus.</span> <span id="s285">She came to that infirmary and she begged the attendants to feed Mr. Turner that apple.</span> <span id="s286">He didn’t see her; he didn’t know; he was unaware that he’s being fed the apple.</span> <span id="s287">But she stood up behind the window and watched this girl feed the apple to Mr. Turner.</span> <span id="s288">These were the conditions that one inmate still tried to do for somebody else.</span> <span id="s289">We all tried to help one another with what we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">I remember that one day, which was about three months before this happened, Paula’s sister, one of her sisters, she was, Paula was the fifth of nine children, one of her sisters was ill.</span> <span id="s291">She was running a very high fever, and she stood in lineup on the way out to work, and her knees were buckling under her.</span> <span id="s292">All the guards had to do was to just see that somebody’s ill, and, of course, her sister Ruthie, who was in front of her, tried to help her be propped up.</span> <span id="s293">And the guard noticed that; he took them both out of lineup.</span> <span id="s294">And not very far from there, there was a line with a young man and her brother Sam, Shmuel in Yiddish, notices, and, of course, his first impulse was to run out of the lineup and see what’s happening to these two sisters.</span> <span id="s295">Well, they all three were shot within our sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">When my mother left, and my father, my father volunteered to go with her.</span> <span id="s297">He didn’t have to go, but he said he’s not going to let her go by herself.</span> <span id="s298">It was very early, late winter, the end of February, and we had heard rumors from the beginning of January that the ghetto is going to be dismantled, that it is a small ghetto and it’s not worthwhile for them to keep guard over a few amount of people when they can resettle them deeper, farther away, into another ghetto [unclear], which was one of the major industrial cities within our area.</span> <span id="s299">It was thirty-five miles from us.</span> <span id="s300">And, I said not just to myself, but I said to Paula, “You know what, what do we have to lose?</span> <span id="s301">Let’s try to escape.</span> <span id="s302">Now, since this ghetto is going to be dismantled, maybe there’s not going to be such exact accounting of people.</span> <span id="s303">Trucks are going to be in and out.</span> <span id="s304">Let’s try to find out; maybe we can escape.</span> <span id="s305">The way the situation is now, we probably have nothing to lose, and maybe something to gain.”</span> <span id="s306">It just so happened that Paula had, both her parents were gone, and these two sisters and a brother about which I explained to you before.</span> <span id="s307">She was very depressed, and it took me a long time to convince her to try to escape.</span> <span id="s308">We’d go, the two of us together.</span> <span id="s309">The last five nights before my planned escape, well, it just so happened that we generally went to work on foot.</span> <span id="s310">Having no shoes, we had rags on our feet, and since there was a lot of ice on the road—it was a secondary highway—the rags used to stick to the ice.</span> <span id="s311">So the German administration felt that maybe it would be better if they put us on trucks to work.</span> <span id="s312">It would be faster, and we would be able to accomplish a little more.</span> <span id="s313">So from the beginning of March, they took us on these flatbed trucks to work.</span> <span id="s314">I said to Paula, “I have everything planned out.</span> <span id="s315">I know where we’ll sit, and you just follow my directions.</span> <span id="s316">Don’t worry about anything else,” because she was very depressed, and at certain times I felt that I don’t get completely through to her.</span> <span id="s317">I tried to explain it to her that I’m saving my bread rations for the last five days; that’s what I’d done.</span> <span id="s318">I had five pieces of bread which I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s319">And I said, “Paula, in a few days, we’ll do it!”</span> <span id="s320">She said, “We’ll do what?”</span> <span id="s321">I said, “Don’t you remember any more?”</span> <span id="s322">She said, “Oh, yes, we’re trying to escape.</span> <span id="s323">O.K. Everything is fine.”</span> <span id="s324">The night before, I talked to her almost half of the night, quietly.</span> <span id="s325">“Paula, you know what’s going to happen tomorrow?”</span> <span id="s326">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s327">“Paula, you know we’re going to try to escape tomorrow?”</span> <span id="s328">“Yes, I know everything.</span> <span id="s329">I just do whatever you want me to,” she said.</span> <span id="s330">And I was very happy that I will have her because she was like a sister; all our lives, I mean, we were so close because her family were poor.</span> <span id="s331">But the situation in Poland wasn’t like it is here.</span> <span id="s332">If you’re wealthy, poor friends don’t mean much.</span> <span id="s333">It wasn’t like that.</span> <span id="s334">Everything was just heart and soul.</span> <span id="s335">A friend is a friend, regardless what they are.</span> <span id="s336">All you consider is just the humaneness in them.</span> <span id="s337">What they are as human beings; it wasn’t important what dress she had or what kind of home they had, whether they had beautiful furniture or not.</span> <span id="s338">That was unimportant.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">On March 10, when we were being taken out to work, I had all my earthly possessions with me, which was a dress, three spools of cotton, those five pieces of dry bread, and the shawl that my mother practically forced on me the last night that we said our good-byes, saying to me, “You may need it more than I do because I’m going to a warm place.</span> <span id="s340">I wouldn’t need it.</span> <span id="s341">You keep it.</span> <span id="s342">Maybe it may save your life when it’s going to be cold.”</span> <span id="s343">So I had this little bundle with me, and I set it in the edge of the truck, holding Paula very tight to me, very close to me, and the whole time on this highway, I said to her, “Do you remember what we are going to do?”</span> <span id="s344">And in the last two miles we kept very quiet, because the guards were not sitting with us; they were sitting in the front, under a cover.</span> <span id="s345">I pulled her by the arm and I said to her, “Paula, this is where we are going to be,” because I mapped out my strategy.</span> <span id="s346">I knew there was a small ravine; the secondary highways were not frequented very well then, because it was late winter, and the farmers didn’t work their fields.</span> <span id="s347">It was an agricultural area mainly.</span> <span id="s348">And I said to her, “Now, let’s go, let’s jump!”</span> <span id="s349">She said, “Where are we going to jump?”</span> <span id="s350">She was completely irrational.</span> <span id="s351">She said, “I am not going to go anywhere with you, because the way I see it, you may be killed, and you want me to get killed, too.”</span> <span id="s352">So I said to her, “Paula, don’t you remember what we planned yesterday, what we talked the last five, six days?”</span> <span id="s353">She said, “I don’t remember anything; I don’t want to know anything; and if you are going to pull me once more by the arm and you’re going to make me go with you, I’ll scream so loud that the guards will hear me.”</span> <span id="s354">I looked in her eyes, and I have seen that she is not even looking at me; she’s looking somewhere in the distance.</span> <span id="s355">Her eyes did not look like they belonged to a rational person.</span> <span id="s356">And out of the five pieces of bread that I had, I gave two to my lifetime friend.</span> <span id="s357">This was all I could share with her at this time.</span> <span id="s358">And I kissed her for the last time, and I jumped off by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Well, this ravine was deep enough for me to completely fall into it.</span> <span id="s360">I had injured my back very severely, and my hip was dislocated, and I was, I must have been unconscious, I don’t know for how many hours, because when I opened my eyes it was almost dark.</span> <span id="s361">I was completely frozen.</span> <span id="s362">I couldn’t crawl out because the blood was streaming from my knees, but I did crawl out of this place, and I have seen some trees, like a clearing, and I practically crawled towards this clearing, and I sat down.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">ER: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">MK: I was almost eighteen.</span> <span id="s365">No, almost twenty, nineteen-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s366">I was eighteen when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s367">I have seen some lights in some homes of farmers, and I was so tempted to try to knock on somebody’s door and see if there would be anybody who’d be willing to help me.</span> <span id="s368">But, you know, you realize that, who is going to help you?</span> <span id="s369">Any Jew that the Poles could bring to the Nazis was worth two pounds of sugar.</span> <span id="s370">And I sure as hell was not going to give them the chance to get two pounds of sugar for my head.</span> <span id="s371">I said, “If I would die, it’s going to be God’s will, and it’s going to be done on my own, not with anybody’s help.”</span> <span id="s372">So, for five nights I knew that there was a chance that someone would be somewhere nearby, but I didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s373">During the day, of course, I didn’t go any place.</span> <span id="s374">I was sitting behind these trees, wherever I could find, dug in the snow.</span> <span id="s375">I had nothing to eat for five days, and at night I tried to find the river San.</span> <span id="s376">Finally, on the fifth night, I did find the river.</span> <span id="s377">Then I came to the realization that I can’t swim.</span> <span id="s378">So I walked around for a long time and tried to find a spot where I maybe would see some reeds or something sticking out of the water, where the water may not be that deep.</span> <span id="s379">I did finally find a spot like that, and I lifted my bundle with my earthly possessions overhead, and I walked into this river, and came on the other side, and I plopped down.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">ER: What did you think would be waiting for you on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">MK: I didn’t know what would be waiting for me, but I know that there is the Soviet Union, and whatever will happen under the Soviets can not be as bad as what I’m going through here.</span> <span id="s382">Maybe I would be able to be a free person at least until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s383">When I came down on the other side, I lay down for a while, because my legs were so heavy, because the rags got a lot of mud and water in them.</span> <span id="s384">I almost couldn’t lift them.</span> <span id="s385">I lay down there, and I was curled up like a little hump.</span> <span id="s386">And then I heard some steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">I was afraid to lift my head, but then I heard, in Russian, which I couldn’t understand then.</span> <span id="s388">It was a Russian border guard, and I heard him speaking Russian, although I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s389">First of all, I felt that I must make him believe that I, that this is a human being, it’s not an animal or whatever.</span> <span id="s390">And I have to wipe the mud out of my eyes.</span> <span id="s391">I saw him with the outstretched rifle, so I just lifted my arms.</span> <span id="s392">He came by and he started talking to me in Russian, and I couldn’t understand a word.</span> <span id="s393">Then he took me to a little hut where the border police were there, and since I couldn’t speak Russian, he went into town, which was only on the outskirts, maybe only four or five blocks from there.</span> <span id="s394">He brought a little boy of may[be] not more than eight or nine years old, who spoke to me in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s395">He was translating between me and the Russians.</span> <span id="s396">They kept me there for twenty-four hours, not wanting to believe me, who I am.</span> <span id="s397">“Show us documents!</span> <span id="s398">Show us documents!”</span></p> <p><span id="s399">ER: Who did you tell them that you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">MK: I told them I’m an escapee from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s401">I had no documents on me.</span> <span id="s402">The Germans didn’t allow us to take any documents or any photographs or anything.</span> <span id="s403">“What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s404">, and drilled me for twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s405">“What is your name?</span> <span id="s406">Where are your parents?</span> <span id="s407">Where are you coming from?</span> <span id="s408">I know you are a spy for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s409">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s410">What do you want to find out?”</span></p> <p><span id="s411">ER: But, at this time they were still Allies with...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">MK: Yes, but they still didn’t like somebody to come and spy on them.</span> <span id="s413">Finally, after twenty-four hours they didn’t believe me, that who I am.</span> <span id="s414">And this little boy took me to the house of his parents, and this is for the first time in a year-and-a-half that I have seen electricity, that I saw, that I have some warm water to wash up myself with.</span> <span id="s415">You know, I walked in, and I didn’t even want to walk into the house, because I felt, who am I to deserve to walk in.</span> <span id="s416">They gave me a bed with a clean sheet and a pillow and then I..</span> <span id="s417">.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">ER: It was not a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">MK: It was a Jewish family, yes.</span> <span id="s420">For two weeks they kept me there, trying to nurse me, took me to the doctor with my back, tried to help me.</span> <span id="s421">They gave me a dress, they gave me a pair of shoes, but, unfortunately, I wasn’t allowed to live there because it was a border zone.</span> <span id="s422">It was considered a border zone, and I was considered an undesirable, since I had no documents.</span> <span id="s423">In Russia, you have to have documentation on you twenty-four hours a day.</span> <span id="s424">That’s all they want from you.</span> <span id="s425">“Who are you?</span> <span id="s426">Where do you live and where do you work?”</span> <span id="s427">These are the first two sentences when you are accosted by a Russian officer or policeman.</span> <span id="s428">“Give me your name; where do you live; where do you work?”</span> <span id="s429">So, two weeks afterwards, I had to leave there, and since I was not allowed to establish residence in a city of a major, over 100,000 population, I established residence in a very small town; before the war, it was a very beautiful resort [unclear], near a very big industrial center, the city of L’vov.</span> <span id="s430">It was a city with a lot of hustle and bustle, lot of colleges and universities.</span> <span id="s431">And I have enrolled in business college.</span> <span id="s432">I wanted to continue with my education, to go to college at night, and found a job as a waitress in a small restaurant.</span> <span id="s433">I established residence in a small room with a kitchenette, with another young girl.</span> <span id="s434">She also had nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">ER: O.K. Now, I just want to interrupt you for a minute.</span> <span id="s436">What you’re actually saying is that the conditions on the Russian Zone, sector, of Poland were, they were the same as they had been.</span> <span id="s437">In other words, there hadn’t been ghettos established yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MK: No, there were no ghettos under the Russians.</span> <span id="s439">Life was as normal, with the only difference that there was no people who had businesses.</span> <span id="s440">The businesses were taken away from them because in Russia, there is no private ownership of any kind of business or shop.</span> <span id="s441">Everything belongs to the government.</span> <span id="s442">So, I remember when I came in, people still had some small stores.</span> <span id="s443">But the large centers, wholesale places, and large factories were already taken over by the government.</span> <span id="s444">And I remember looking, well, you couldn’t find anything to buy from money.</span> <span id="s445">Money wasn’t worth anything, because nobody wanted to sell in money, because the Russian ruble wasn’t worth anything.</span> <span id="s446">The only thing you could do is trade something for something.</span> <span id="s447">So, you had to get one thing and try to exchange on the bazaar.</span> <span id="s448">They already had their bazaars, the markets, where you could exchange a sheet for a bar of soap or your bread rations, which was really under a severe punishment.</span> <span id="s449">Bread was not allowed to trade.</span> <span id="s450">You were not allowed to trade the bread.</span> <span id="s451">Because bread was your own ration.</span> <span id="s452">Although, with your own ration, they still tried to accuse you of black marketing.</span> <span id="s453">It was a seven-year jail sentence for selling bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">ER: Although you could trade anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">MK: Anything else, yes.</span> <span id="s456">But you could not trade bread.</span> <span id="s457">If you could show that this is your own, I mean, you traded only used things, nothing new.</span> <span id="s458">I remember walking once into a store which used to sell different houseware, dishes, and things like that.</span> <span id="s459">I have seen two ladies, Russian officers’ wives, they came in in nightgowns which they wore in the street, as street clothes, and they bought potties, which they were going to use for dish, for cookware.</span> <span id="s460">And I have noticed Russian officers standing in the middle of the street, smoking a cigarette.</span> <span id="s461">The paper, in those days there were no ready-made cigarettes; you had to roll them.</span> <span

smoke it.</span> <span id="s463">And I have seen sometimes officers taking a piece of herring out of their boot, and a piece of black, dry bread, and their army coats were never finished at the end.</span> <span id="s464">And I said, “Dear Lord, this is a country where they are trying to make believe that 450 million people live in heaven.</span> <span id="s465">This is going to be the country where I’m going to have my future?</span> <span id="s466">That’s the privacy that you have here?</span> <span id="s467">This is the freedom that people have under this country?”</span> <span id="s468">In this country, all you hear over loud speakers, “Russia is your country; Russia is your mother, and Stalin is your father!”</span> <span id="s469">And all I could see is you’re really not your own person.</span> <span id="s470">You’re really a ward of the State.</span> <span id="s471">You could not move without the permission of the government.</span> <span id="s472">You could not change your place of work without the permission of the government.</span> <span id="s473">And twenty-four hours a day, you had to have a paper testifying who you are and where you work.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">ER: But it was a better choice than...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">MK: It was a better choice, certainly.</span> <span id="s476">But only ten days after I have settled in this small, little town of [unclear], I was called to the police station.</span> <span id="s477">And I was offered to accept Soviet citizenship.</span> <span id="s478">They were very magnanimous.</span> <span id="s479">“Yes, I know you are not a Soviet citizen now; you weren’t born here, but you live here now, and we would be willing to give you Soviet citizenship.”</span> <span id="s480">To which I answered, “I can not accept Soviet citizenship because my whole family is there, and eventually, after the end of war, I want to return back to my home town.</span> <span id="s481">I want to be reunited with my parents and with my brothers and sisters, with my whole family.”</span> <span id="s482">And they said, “Well, your family is under the Nazis, so don’t you know what is going on there?”</span> <span id="s483">I said, “Of course I do, but with God’s help, if not all of them survive, some of them will,” and, of course, on the mere mention of “God”, it’s a godless country.</span> <span id="s484">God is something nonexistent there, just something to be made fun of.</span> <span id="s485">I was let go, and ten days later I was called to the police station already in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s486">And when you’re called there in the middle of the night, it’s pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Well, the commanding officer, sitting there asking me again, “Well, we have it written down that you did not accept Soviet citizenship, but we give you another chance.</span> <span id="s488">Do you want to become a Soviet citizen?”</span> <span id="s489">Didn’t ask me much, one question, to which I replied, “No.”</span> <span id="s490">He didn’t ask why.</span> <span id="s491">I said, “Can I explain to you?”</span> <span id="s492">He said to me, “I don’t want to hear anything.</span> <span id="s493">You just said, “No.”</span> <span id="s494">I said, “Yes, the answer is no.”</span> <span id="s495">“You can go.”</span> <span id="s496">I went home.</span> <span id="s497">A few nights later, on a Friday night at 2:00 in the morning, there was a knock on my door.</span> <span id="s498">When I opened the door, there was a Soviet, a Russian soldier with a rifle, outstretched in his hand.</span> <span id="s499">He said to me in Russian, “[Russian] Get your belongings.”</span> <span id="s500">He gave me fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s501">I said, “I don’t need fifteen minutes to get my belongings.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t have anything.”</span> <span id="s503">Whatever I had I put together in a pillowcase, and I walked out with him.</span> <span id="s504">When I walked out on the lawn, there was already a truck, packed with people—men, women, and children—and hopped up on the truck, and I went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s505">And when I came there, the train was packed with people, because I lived almost at the very edge of town.</span> <span id="s506">And I was put in the last, the 69th car, cattle car.</span> <span id="s507">We were there for about twenty-two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">And again, in the middle of the night, on Sunday, on a secondary rail, in the middle of night, after midnight, the train began moving.</span> <span id="s509">We didn’t know where we are going, what our fate is going to be, what is going to happen with us.</span> <span id="s510">But, as long as there are multiple rails, we thought that maybe they are just resettling us somewhere else.</span> <span id="s511">But, twelve or thirteen days into the journey, it all amounted to only one rail, and we came the very sad realization that we are probably being taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s512">We have traveled for about twenty-five or twenty-six days.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">ER: Did they feed you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">MK: Yes, they fed us, sometimes once a day, sometimes once in two days.</span> <span id="s515">So it was only a few loaves of bread for each cattle car, between sixty-five and seventy people.</span> <span id="s516">Everybody was piled up on the floor—men, women, pregnant women, small children, sick people.</span> <span id="s517">There were no toilet facilities in the car.</span> <span id="s518">You can imagine the conditions after twenty-six days.</span> <span id="s519">No change of clothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s520">For the last five days before the end of the journey, they were unhooking ten cars each day, left them on the tracks.</span> <span id="s521">What was going to happen to these people, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s522">But we knew every day we have ten less cars.</span> <span id="s523">And there were nine left where I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">We have wound up on a small, in a very small railroad station.</span> <span id="s525">There was only one man there, and there were eight trucks waiting there for us.</span> <span id="s526">The trucks took us 125 kilometers, which is 90 miles, deeper into the forest.</span> <span id="s527">Then, when we came there, there weren’t any people there who lived there for six months.</span> <span id="s528">These were Poles and Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s529">They were taken there for being wealthy land owners, who took advantage of the working, of the masses.</span> <span id="s530">Therefore, everything was taken away from them and they were brought here to this haven.</span> <span id="s531">So, when we came we saw the conditions that these people are living in.</span> <span id="s532">Of course, they were crying; some of them were ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">ER: Were these all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">MK: No.</span> <span id="s535">Poles and Ukrainians—non-Jews.</span> <span id="s536">The only Jews were people who came with us.</span> <span id="s537">And we were dispersed to different villages.</span> <span id="s538">And this place where I was, we probably had maybe 100 or 110 Jews, 110 people.</span> <span id="s539">The others were seven miles away, twelve miles away, in different places, to work in different parts of the forest.</span> <span id="s540">We lived twelve girls together in one big, it looked like a barrack, one room.</span> <span id="s541">Of course there was no heat; there was no electricity there.</span> <span id="s542">We had to chop wood to heat.</span> <span id="s543">There was only an oven, where you could cook something, if you had something to cook, that is.</span> <span id="s544">And, of course, the oven was fed, not an oven, but a stove, was fed during the day, but at night when you go to sleep, you can’t.</span> <span id="s545">There’s nobody to feed it.</span> <span id="s546">And sometimes the wood was so wet; it didn’t have a chance to dry, because nine months out of the year it’s winter there.</span> <span id="s547">Temperatures reach 45 degrees below zero.</span> <span id="s548">And in three months in the summer temperatures do go up to between 70 and 75.</span> <span id="s549">They go up to degrees where you can if you have some seeds, you can plant carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">ER: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">MK: I was there until May, 1945.</span> <span id="s552">In March I was given a piece of paper testifying that I am a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s553">We had absolutely no contact with the outside world.</span> <span id="s554">As a matter of fact, we didn’t even know, the first couple of years, that there’s a war going on between the Soviet Union and Germany.</span> <span id="s555">Because I was taken out of this territory very shortly before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">ER: You were taken out in March, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">MK: 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">ER: You were taken out of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">MK: No.</span> <span id="s560">Out of the Polish side into the Soviet Union in March, 1941.</span> <span id="s561">And the war between Germany and Russia broke out in May, 1941.</span> <span id="s562">So in the beginning, we didn’t know that there’s a war going on between Germany and Russia.</span> <span id="s563">I would like to tell you something what means, how comes that I still believe in destiny and in fate.</span> <span id="s564">Because, would I have accepted Soviet citizenship...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s566">ER: This is Ellen Rofman interviewing Mina Kalter.</span> <span id="s567">This is tape two, side one.</span> <span id="s568">Mina, you were telling us about your life in Siberia and the labor camps.</span> <span id="s569">Would you please continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">MK: As I said, somewhere it lasted three months from the end of May until the beginning of September.</span> <span id="s571">And the three months of the summer we worked in the forest getting sap out of the evergreen trees.</span> <span id="s572">The males that worked there used to cut in the tree, make incisions, to which the sap ran into a small pot that was centered in the middle of the tree.</span> <span id="s573">And we used to scrape out with metal scrapers the sap and put into wooden buckets which we carried on a yoke on our back to an assembled point, where we put them into wooden barrels which were taken out sometime in the middle of the night, because we never had any contact with civilian people, except those guards who were guarding the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Nine months of the winter are being spent mostly on cutting down the trees that stopped giving the sap.</span> <span id="s575">After three years, the tree begins drying up, and the tree is of no use any more.</span> <span id="s576">So the trees had to be cut down.</span> <span id="s577">We used to cut them down with hand saws.</span> <span id="s578">And, to give you just an idea what a Siberian tree is like, is, if you have three people put together and you join hands, you go around a circle the circumference of this tree.</span> <span id="s579">These trees had to be cut by girls with a hand saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">I think I explained to you previously how much trouble I had with my back, which I injured on my fall from the truck.</span> <span id="s581">And, in the winter time especially, I was in agonizing pain.</span> <span id="s582">I just couldn’t bend that low and sit in the snow.</span> <span id="s583">So my bread rations, my shoes, and my winter clothes were taken away.</span> <span id="s584">So, as you see, the prophecy of my mother did come true because she said, “Take this shawl, because maybe some time it will save your life.”</span> <span id="s585">Because when I had to go to chop the ice in order to get a bucket of water out of the creek in the early morning, all I had was the black shawl to cover myself.</span> <span id="s586">Well, in 1943, I realized that if I wouldn’t try to get some food, to trade something for food, I will not be able to withstand the winter, because I really had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s587">All right, you live; it’s true.</span> <span id="s588">We were twelve girls in the room, and when one eats and the other is absolutely hungry, you must share a crumb with somebody else.</span> <span id="s589">But I felt that this is not a way to do it.</span> <span id="s590">Since I had this dress and these few spools of cotton, I said to myself, “There must be people living somewhere, Russians; if it’s not ten miles from here it’s fifteen miles from here.</span> <span id="s591">There must be some villages.</span> <span id="s592">There must be a highway somewhere, because I knew that these barrels are taken out of here on horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s593">There must be a highway where they go.”</span> <span id="s594">We were, our heads were counted every night.</span> <span id="s595">Well, the people there, the commanders and all the guards, are very lonesome there.</span> <span id="s596">They are there without their families; they have nothing else to do there except to be very bored, or listen to a radio, or get drunk.</span> <span id="s597">So when they found it important to get drunk, real good, especially on the weekend, we were counted every evening.</span> <span id="s598">But during the working days, they used to come at like 9:00, 10:00 at night.</span> <span id="s599">Since there was no electricity anyway, we used to have like a small bottle and some kerosene in it.</span> <span id="s600">We used to make a wick out of either a piece of old rag or if we had a piece of cotton, make a wick.</span> <span id="s601">And that’s how we, that’s what was the lighting in the whole barrack.</span> <span id="s602">So, they used to come in sometimes at 10:00 at night and count us.</span> <span id="s603">Saturday, Sunday was the only day except from work.</span> <span id="s604">We worked six days a week, not Sunday.</span> <span id="s605">So I made up my mind that I’ll try to walk out on Saturday evening.</span> <span id="s606">I’ll still be counted and will be back on Sunday evening for head count again.</span> <span id="s607">I didn’t know where I’m going to go or what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s608">I had no idea, but I had this dress with which I really didn’t want to part, because I, somehow, I don’t know, I felt that this is still my tie to my past.</span> <span id="s609">I didn’t want to give it up in the worst possible way.</span> <span id="s610">But I knew that I had to.</span> <span id="s611">I reached a point where I must give it up if I want to save my body, if I want to live through these severe winters.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">ER: Did they give you...</span></p> <p><span id="s613">MK: I didn’t know; I had no indication how long I’ll last here, how long I’ll be here.</span> <span id="s614">All I was told is that I am a counter-revolutionary; I’m an enemy of the Soviet regime; therefore, I deserve to be here.</span> <span id="s615">And I’ll never leave here, and I’ll be buried under one of these Siberian trees, and this is going to be the end of me because this is all I deserve.</span> <span id="s616">All right.</span> <span id="s617">The situation was bad enough to begin believing in it, but I still believed there is a God somewhere and that He’ll guard us, that regardless of what they tell me I still had enough faith in me and enough love for my family that I said, “If they survive, they would expect me to do the same,” that I had responsibilities to survive, not just for my own sake, but even for their own sake, because I am sure that whatever they are going to try to do is going to try to do the same thing for me, for my sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">ER: When you were in this barracks, this camp in the Soviet Union, did they give you blankets?</span> <span id="s619">Did they give you clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">MK: No.</span> <span id="s621">You only had what you brought with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">ER: And when they took your coat away, you never got it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">MK: I had nothing.</span> <span id="s624">They gave me the shoes, the winter boots; they gave me the winter coat; they gave me a bread ration.</span> <span id="s625">But, as I said, no work, no eat.</span> <span id="s626">So they took this away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">ER: Were there any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">MK: Yes.</span> <span id="s629">There were families with children.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">ER: Was there any kind of schooling for these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">MK: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">ER: Did they make the children work?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">MK: No.</span> <span id="s634">Not small children.</span> <span id="s635">They were supposed to give us bread every day, once a day.</span> <span id="s636">But they found it more profitable to sell the flour on the black market and the other ingredients that went into the bread.</span> <span id="s637">So, they used to bring bread like once in two days and sometimes once in three days.</span> <span id="s638">To whom can you complain?</span> <span id="s639">There’s nobody to complain to.</span> <span id="s640">You can only cry to God.</span> <span id="s641">So we used to go out, well, of course in the summer time, in the spring, in the fall; there used to be some wild berries in the woods, and we used to break out of the, this ground.</span> <span id="s642">We had here these weeds on our lawn.</span> <span id="s643">They look like garlic.</span> <span id="s644">We used to dig this out of the ground, chop it up and cook it, boil it in hot water.</span> <span id="s645">That used to be the soup that we ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">ER: During this time, you had no idea what was going on in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">MK: I had no idea, but in 1943, there were, we heard rumors.</span> <span id="s648">Sometimes you heard the guards talking that people are coming back wounded from the war.</span> <span id="s649">So, we knew already there’s a war going on.</span> <span id="s650">That was in 1943.</span> <span id="s651">We had no access to radio, newspapers, nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s652">We lived like just the animal in the field.</span> <span id="s653">Nothing.</span> <span id="s654">We used to say our prayers early in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">ER: This whole time, really, your faith in God is what sustained you.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">MK: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">ER: You didn’t lose your faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">MK: Never.</span> <span id="s659">Under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s660">I never lost my faith in God.</span> <span id="s661">In 1943, as I explained to you, in winter, I felt that I must give up what I had.</span> <span id="s662">I took these two spools of cotton that I have left and this dress, and put on this shawl.</span> <span id="s663">I had no shoes, so my neighbor loaned me a pair of shoes that belonged to her ten-year-old little boy.</span> <span id="s664">I didn’t realize it, the shoes are a little tight.</span> <span id="s665">I did realize they’re tight, but I didn’t feel that it would be that bad.</span> <span id="s666">So I put on the shoes and I walked out.</span> <span id="s667">It just so happened that on this particular night, he came in at 1:30, woke us at 1:30.</span> <span id="s668">The snow was deep—this high.</span> <span id="s669">He knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s670">And we had to push the door from the inside because he couldn’t open it by himself form the outside.</span> <span id="s671">So we pushed it from the inside, and he pulled it from the outside.</span> <span id="s672">Finally, he came in, dead drunk.</span> <span id="s673">With a flashlight he counted us what everybody’s in.</span> <span id="s674">I already was in bed in my clothes just waiting to get out as soon as he leaves.</span> <span id="s675">The minute he left, I walked out of the barracks, and I walked out into the snow.</span> <span id="s676">There’s no path; there’s no highway.</span> <span id="s677">Which direction should you take?</span> <span id="s678">You can not see anything except this white snow and the tops of the trees.</span> <span id="s679">And you say to yourself, “Dear God, where should I go; which direction should I take?”</span> <span id="s680">And somehow, something told me: “Go here.”</span> <span id="s681">I walked for about seven or eight kilometers, which is five miles, and I have reached a secondary highway.</span> <span id="s682">I came over there and my feet were hurting terribly.</span> <span id="s683">I said to myself: “Something is happening with those shoes.</span> <span id="s684">Let me take them off.</span> <span id="s685">What is going on?”</span> <span id="s686">When I wiped the snow off my feet and my shoes, I realized that the stockings are stuck to my foot, and I have put my finger as much as I could, and there was blood all around me inside; all my skin was rubbed off.</span> <span id="s687">I was in such agonizing pain that I didn’t proceed walking any farther.</span> <span id="s688">I said, “Let me just sit down for a few seconds and try to rest.</span> <span id="s689">And then I’ll proceed going.</span> <span id="s690">If there is a highway, there must be some villages here; maybe there is somewhere a school where I can trade this dress for some food or something, a teacher or doctor.”</span> <span id="s691">I sat down on a stump of a tree.</span> <span id="s692">I sat down and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s693">I fell asleep in 45 degrees below zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">ER: How did you withstand the cold?</span> <span id="s695">You didn’t freeze to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">MK: I didn’t freeze to death.</span> <span id="s697">No.</span> <span id="s698">A human being can endure an awful lot.</span> <span id="s699">We don’t know our strength, really, until we are faced with a crisis.</span> <span id="s700">And then I feel that there is still this hidden resource in a person, that he uses in a time of trial when he really needs it, especially when he believes in God, and when your faith is still with you, you find the source of strength to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">I sat down on top of this tree, and I fell asleep, and then finally I heard some bells.</span> <span id="s702">I couldn’t understand where are they, how come I hear bells?</span> <span id="s703">Is it possible that I’m dead?</span> <span id="s704">You know, when you are a child, you read all kinds of general stories that you go to heaven, and there are angels with bells, and you hear all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Somebody pulled me by my arm.</span> <span id="s706">When I opened my eyes there was a young Russian, a young man with a horse, and the horse had bells on its neck.</span> <span id="s707">These were the bells I heard.</span> <span id="s708">He had passed me, but he came back.</span> <span id="s709">He came back because he was very intrigued —everything was very white, but there was like a circle of black around, in the middle.</span> <span id="s710">He said, “Let me take a look, what this is?”</span> <span id="s711">When he came over, he saw me sitting there, asleep.</span> <span id="s712">He took me by my arm and asked me, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s713">Don’t you know that this is a death sentence to fall asleep in this snow, this cold?”</span> <span id="s714">I said to myself, “Well, here, I am finished.</span> <span id="s715">What is a Russian, what is he going to do with me?</span> <span id="s716">He knows who I am.”</span> <span id="s717">Although I spoke Russian pretty well by then, but still the accent was still there.</span> <span id="s718">He knew right away, looking at my clothes.</span> <span id="s719">He knew I wasn’t Russian.</span> <span id="s720">I didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s721">I was shivering.</span> <span id="s722">He said to me, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s723">I’m not going to do anything bad to you.”</span> <span id="s724">First of all, I was a young girl in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s725">He was a young guy.</span> <span id="s726">I didn’t know what he was going to do there with me; if he would kill me nobody would even know.</span> <span id="s727">He said, “What do you want to do?</span> <span id="s728">Where are you trying to go?”</span> <span id="s729">I said, “I have a dress I would like to trade you for some food.”</span> <span id="s730">He said, “O.K., I’ll take you; there is, 18 miles from here, there is a small hospital; there is a school.</span> <span id="s731">I’ll put you up on the horse.</span> <span

heaven.”</span> <span id="s735">I mean, I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s736">It was just like a miracle.</span> <span id="s737">He said to me the only reason he stopped is because from my breathing, you know the snow melted here on this black shawl; and that’s how he noticed the black circle around me.</span> <span id="s738">By that he was intrigued.</span> <span id="s739">There

id="s745">But they helped people with different small problems.</span> <span id="s746">There was a young lady, maybe 21 or 22 years old, a gorgeous young woman.</span> <span id="s747">I said to myself, “My God, what did she do to deserve this fate, to be in a place like that?</span> <span id="s748">She probably wasn’t a very good Communist or something.</span> <span id="s749">She must have done something to be sent there.”</span> <span id="s750">They could not take the shoes off because they were frozen to my feet.</span> <span id="s751">In order to save my skin, not to lose my legs, they had taken a knife, and cut the shoes off with my skin, together.</span> <span id="s752">They had no bandages.</span> <span id="s753">She took an old sheet, ripped it in strips; she put on some salve.</span> <span id="s754">She said to this young man, “Don’t worry, you can leave, and I will put her on a sled and take her back,” because she thought it would be too traumatic for me to ride a horse 35 miles.</span> <span id="s755">“I’ll put her on a sled, and I’ll take her back where she belongs.”</span> <span id="s756">He left.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">She gave me for this dress three sacks with planting potatoes, tiny ones, little ones, to be planted.</span> <span id="s758">She gave me some seeds to plant cucumbers and carrots.</span> <span id="s759">She said, “Keep this and in spring when the weather will get warmer, you can plant it right in front of your barrack,” and then bandaged my legs, my feet, and put me in a sled, and in the evening around 6:00 I was back in my barracks.</span> <span id="s760">I would never have been able to be back.</span> <span id="s761">Never.</span> <span id="s762">She brought me back.</span> <span id="s763">I left.</span> <span

girls came out and helped me carry these sacks.</span> <span id="s766">Some of the potatoes, those that were larger, we ate.</span> <span id="s767">Look, you’re hungry, regardless of how much you want to keep it, you know, to plant.</span> <span id="s768">Still, you can not resist all that temptation.</span> <span id="s769">We ate the larger ones.</span> <span id="s770">The little ones, we planted in the spring.</span> <span id="s771">Each one of us had a special place where they work, a special part of the forest.</span> <span id="s772">We planted our potatoes there.</span> <span id="s773">I don’t know whether you believe or not.</span> <span id="s774">Never, ever would anybody dare to steal anything which was really the most remarkable thing.</span> <span id="s775">Nobody stole something that belonged to somebody else.</span> <span id="s776">Under all these circumstances, all the hunger, all these horrible conditions, people were still human enough to know that what is not yours you can not have.</span> <span id="s777">Of course we shared everything with the other girls.</span> <span id="s778">But thank God, God was good to us that we could, you know, from spring to spring, plant these potatoes every year, and each potato must have weighed three pounds.</span> <span id="s779">I have never seen potatoes like this in my life, because the soil is black and very

no private property.</span> <span id="s788">People don’t work for themselves, and when a farmer doesn’t work his own fields and he can’t get anything out of it, why should he work when everything goes to the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">In March 1945, I was given the only piece of mail I received in four years there, that I am a Polish citizen and at the end of the war I can leave and

we came to Berlin; there were my two brothers.</span> <span id="s857">Thank God they did survive.</span> <span id="s858">My husband is the only survivor in his family.</span> <span id="s859">He has absolutely nobody except one cousin, one cousin in Israel.</span> <span id="s860">We were in Berlin from August 1945 to the middle of 1948 when the Russians closed the border in Berlin.</span> <span id="s861">Whenever they had any problems with the United States or with the Allies, they used to close the borders from Berlin, and nothing could be delivered to us, no fuel, no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s862">Everything had to be air-lifted.</span> <span id="s863">The barracks that we lived in in Berlin were just absolutely, the conditions we lived in in Berlin were just absolutely inhumane.</span> <span id="s864">They were summer barracks for S.S. troops.</span> <span id="s865">They were training there, and they were not equipped for the winter.</span> <span id="s866">Before we came in, apparently, they put some radiators in, but the hall, the openings between the boards were so big that the snow used to drift into the rooms.</span> <span id="s867">We had only electricity and heat two hours a day.</span> <span id="s868">And, generally, survivors married and created families, because each of us wanted to have something to hold on, something of our own, something to make us believe that we can still continue, that we can go on, not to give Hitler a posthumous victory, to show him that the few Jews that did survive are going to die out and there are going to be no Jews any more.</span> <span id="s869">[meaning: they wanted to show him that the few Jews that did survive are not going to die out, and that there would still be Jews.</span> <span id="s870">-ed.]</span> <span id="s871">We wanted to be needed; we wanted to be loved; we wanted to have something and somebody, regardless of the conditions we lived in.</span> <span id="s872">So, the two hours of heat a day had to be [unclear].</span> <span id="s873">What could you do in the two hours?</span> <span id="s874">Should you warm up, make some formula for the baby?</span> <span id="s875">Should you warm up some water to wash some diapers?</span> <span id="s876">I had six diapers, as God is my witness, when my baby was born.</span> <span id="s877">I bought an old sheet, which I ripped up in six pieces, and these were the diapers that I had for a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">When the baby was three months old, he developed double pneumonia since there was no heat.</span> <span id="s879">I was told that I must place him in a German hospital, because there was no hospital in the camp.</span> <span id="s880">There was only an infirmary.</span> <span id="s881">I must place him in the care of Germans.</span> <span id="s882">I went to the hospital; I saw the chief of pediatrics section which was a woman.</span> <span id="s883">I looked at her and I said, “My God, I am not going to leave my baby in her care,” because when you heard what the guards and the doctors were, in the women’s camp, that’s exactly what she looked like to me, very straight, up, erect, blond-reddish hair, pulled straight, with a bun here in the back, tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">She said to me, “Well, you have to leave the baby here.</span> <span id="s885">It’s going to be your responsibility if the baby dies.</span> <span id="s886">You have no medication.</span> <span id="s887">You have no conditions.</span> <span id="s888">Here he’ll be able to have a crib; he’ll be able to have heat.”</span> <span id="s889">I said, “I’ll think it over.”</span> <span id="s890">I came back and we sat and talked over what should we do?</span> <span id="s891">We decided we will keep the baby with us.</span> <span id="s892">Whatever happens, it’s going to be God’s will; if God wants him to survive, at least I’ll know that I didn’t put him in their care, God forbid, and they did something to him.</span> <span id="s893">As the case was, before 1948, before we left Berlin, this woman was tried for crimes in the camp that she served.</span> <span id="s894">My intuition was right.</span> <span id="s895">We had to keep him up for five weeks, erect, in erect position, day and night, so his lungs wouldn’t become water-logged.</span> <span id="s896">There was no medication.</span> <span id="s897">There was nothing except maybe a..</span> <span id="s898">.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">ER: Did you have any supplies from the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">MK: No.</span> <span

when they decided to ship us out of Berlin due to the fact that we couldn’t, they couldn’t supply us by air with all the necessities, because there was a kitchen where they gave us soup once a day; they gave us bread, in the morning, coffee, bread, and in the evening, soup and again a piece of bread and some vegetables.</span> <span id="s905">This was the first time we saw cans, canned vegetables, canned potatoes, canned peas; couldn’t get used to eating that, but when you’re hungry, you improvise, you eat.</span></p> <p><span

Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s907">ER: It’s important you tell the whole story; it really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">MK: We came here in 1950, as I said before, and it was very hard in those days to find an apartment, especially, because nobody wanted to rent an apartment to refugees.</span> <span id="s909">That’s what we were called, refugees, and especially when you had a child, you had another strike against you.</span> <span id="s910">Not only did I have a child, but I was pregnant with my second child.</span> <span id="s911">My boy was four, and I was pregnant; I was seven months pregnant with my younger son when we came to this country.</span> <span id="s912">So, finally, it took us six or seven weeks to find an apartment.</span> <span id="s913">I knew I had to find something because when the baby comes, I had to have a place of my own.</span> <span id="s914">I didn’t want to burden my uncle and my aunt with staying there with a small baby, because my aunt was a very ill woman, very sick.</span> <span id="s915">And, we did finally find this apartment on the third floor in Strawberry Mansion, the area that was called Strawberry Mansion.</span> <span id="s916">Thank God, my husband did find a job.</span> <span id="s917">He used to make $40 a week, but we were very happy that we came finally to a country where we were not afraid to live as Jews, and be Jews, and not to worry to say that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s918">And, I was faced very early into our coming here to the United States, it was a question, to having to answer the question to my son, what is a grandfather and what is a grandmother, because he was invited to a birthday party of another little boy in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s919">When he came back, he said to me, “Mommy,”—he couldn’t speak English then; it was only three months after we came here—he spoke to me in German, and he said to me, “Was ist ein grandma, und was ist ein grandpa?”</span> <span id="s920">— “What is a grandmother and what is a grandfather?”</span> <span id="s921">I’m sitting and thinking, what should I tell this child?</span> <span id="s922">Should I come out with the truth, or should I just beat around the bush?</span> <span id="s923">But I decided right there and then that I want my children to know, I want them to know where they are coming from; I want them to remember what they are, who they are, and not to be afraid or ashamed to be Jews, because we certainly have nothing to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s924">Let those who discriminated and killed our six million people, and the world who didn’t do anything about it, let the world feel, in their own hearts, their complicity, and where their priorities should have been in those years of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">So, it was in the beginning very hard for my child to understand, but gradually they began growing up.</span> <span id="s926">They did understand, and I took them the first time to Israel in 1963 for my younger son’s Bar Mitzvah because all the family I have was there, and I could not afford it before.</span> <span id="s927">For thirteen years we scraped the penny to a penny, even from the $40 a week, I still saved a couple of dollars, put a stone on it, and saved a penny to a penny because eventually, we planned to make the Bar Mitzvah of my son in Israel.</span> <span id="s928">And we went in 1963.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">This was the first time that I took my children to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s930">My little one was only four years old.</span> <span id="s931">When she came in there, she had a little bit an idea what it’s all about, because I did explain to her before she came in.</span> <span id="s932">She was four; a child of four doesn’t understand fully, but the background, and we were talking about it at home very freely.</span> <span id="s933">The children heard it.</span> <span id="s934">We were associating with other survivors and belong to the survivor’s groups, so we had lots to share.</span> <span id="s935">It was common knowledge to my children.</span> <span id="s936">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s937">When we went to the park with mothers of other children, we talked about it.</span> <span id="s938">We talked about common experiences, about our past.</span> <span id="s939">The children knew.</span> <span id="s940">And I felt, especially now, I feel that it was very beneficial that we didn’t hide the truth from our children, that at a very early age, I made them understand what the whole thing was all about.</span> <span id="s941">And, thank God, they didn’t have any psychological problems.</span> <span id="s942">It didn’t affect them adversely in any way.</span> <span id="s943">We taught them self-reliance, but never hate or bigotry.</span> <span id="s944">They have to make up their mind on their own, where their future is going to take them, how they feel, and how they want to treat other people, which, I know that they are beautiful.</span> <span id="s945">All three are very beautiful human beings, thank God.</span> <span id="s946">I am very proud of my children.</span> <span id="s947">The Lord was really very good to us.</span> <span id="s948">I have three very educated, wonderful children, terrific human beings, good kids.</span> <span id="s949">They get along with one another, they get along with us.</span> <span id="s950">We never had any psychological problems, thank God, to contend with.</span> <span id="s951">We never had any problems with them when the world was going on, through the trauma of drugs, and colds, or things like that.</span> <span id="s952">So I’m very grateful to God that we were spared all this.</span> <span id="s953">And I hope that the background that we gave them, that’s going to extend for their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">ER: Are they active in the second generation groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">MK: No, they are not.</span> <span id="s956">My oldest son doesn’t live in Philadelphia; he lives in New York.</span> <span id="s957">My youngest son, unfortunately, is not active.</span> <span id="s958">I tried, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s959">ER: Well, I guess it fulfills needs for some, and perhaps he just doesn’t need that.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">MK: True.</span> <span id="s961">As far as my daughter is concerned, she is not home now.</span> <span id="s962">She’s in medical school in Kansas City, and I’m finding out about things about which I was very worried when she left.</span> <span id="s963">I could hear at home, she sees what has happened here, how we celebrate Passover and other Jewish holidays, the tradition that is upheld in our home.</span> <span id="s964">She called me after Selichot [midnight service the Saturday evening preceding Rosh Hashanah] this year on Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s965">We generally talk at least twice or three times a week.</span> <span id="s966">But she called me on Sunday morning, and she had tears in her eyes.</span> <span id="s967">I said, “Honey, what happened?”</span> <span id="s968">Right away, you feel, God forbid, maybe a car accident, maybe something happened.</span> <span id="s969">Maybe she’s sick.</span> <span id="s970">She said, “Mom, did you watch Selichot services from this-and-this synagogue in New York?”</span> <span id="s971">I said, “Yes, I did.”</span> <span id="s972">She said, “You know, I watched it, too.</span> <span id="s973">I cried; it made me feel so good.”</span> <span id="s974">They were not overly religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">ER: I think, as they get older...</span></p> <p><span id="s976">MK: She came to school, Kansas City, the Midwest, there are not too many Jews.</span> <span id="s977">And most of the Jews that did live in Kansas City moved to the Kansas side of town, the line between Missouri and Kansas.</span> <span id="s978">They most of them live in Overland Park.</span> <span id="s979">So, when she came to school, there were not too many Jewish students.</span> <span id="s980">She found out later there are three Jewish girls in her class.</span> <span id="s981">But, she is wearing a tiny little gold Star of David that my brothers gave her when we came to Israel in 1963, when she was four years old.</span> <span id="s982">She has never taken it off her neck.</span> <span id="s983">I remember once, she was taking a shower, and the chain broke, and it fell into the bathtub.</span> <span id="s984">When she came to her room, she realized she doesn’t have this chain with the little Magen David, tiny, it’s as big as half a penny; it means an awful lot to her.</span> <span id="s985">She cried.</span> <span id="s986">I said, “Look, honey, let’s run over, maybe it’s still there.”</span> <span id="s987">It was in the tub, before the water had a chance to flush down the drain.</span> <span id="s988">It was like an omen to her.</span> <span id="s989">She has never taken it off.</span> <span id="s990">And once she wore a blouse open, and this girl saw the chain on her neck and she said to her, “Rachel, are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s991">She said, “Yes, I am Jewish.”</span> <span id="s992">You’d be surprised how many ‘Rachels’ are non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s993">It became a very popular name.</span> <span id="s994">Little by little, they started talking.</span> <span id="s995">She said, “My parents are Holocaust survivors,” and she started telling them about the past of our people, what our Jewish people went through.</span> <span id="s996">They had never heard of it.</span> <span id="s997">They never knew what the Holocaust was all about.</span> <span id="s998">They never knew what Jews, what six million Jews went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">She asked me once to send her a list.</span> <span id="s1000">So, I took a list of JCRC, with books that the kids can read.</span> <span id="s1001">So, I feel that she is fulfilling some kind of a function in [unclear].</span> <span id="s1002">Last year, she went, they had a Holocaust memorial service.</span> <span id="s1003">She went to the memorial service at the Jewish Federation there.</span> <span id="s1004">It was very meaningful.</span> <span id="s1005">She said to me, “Mom, it gave me a perspective.</span> <span id="s1006">It really made me think a lot, and I’m very happy that you gave me this background as a child.”</span> <span id="s1007">If you have the time, of course she is very busy, in medical school, so overworked.</span> <span id="s1008">So I feel that with her, I wouldn’t have any problems.</span> <span id="s1009">She will continue, she knows her place, she knows where she’s coming from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">It just reached a point, I don’t know whether it’s fortunate or unfortunate, my children want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1011">They have been bugging me for the last two years especially since I had my open-heart surgery.</span> <span id="s1012">They said, “Mom, I think it’s time that, you know you’re not well, and we would like to go.”</span> <span id="s1013">I said, “How about if you’ll go by yourselves?”</span> <span id="s1014">They said, “No, it’s not going to have the same meaning.</span> <span id="s1015">It’s not going to be the same if you’re not there.</span> <span id="s1016">We want you to show us the home, even if the house isn’t there, even if somebody else lives there, where it is.</span> <span id="s1017">We want to [see] the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1018">We want to see the synagogue that was burned down, even if the ground is only there, even if they built a church there.”</span> <span id="s1019">I don’t know what is there.</span> <span id="s1020">I don’t know what to expect, even if the cemetery is there.</span> <span id="s1021">I have absolutely no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">ER: Will you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">MK: Well, I’m thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1025">Sometimes I have second thoughts, sometimes, that maybe I shouldn’t go, because I really don’t want to go with my heart.</span> <span id="s1026">If I do go, it’s only because they want to go.</span> <span id="s1027">I feel so much in my heart that I don’t know how I can face the Poles there, how I can face the neighbors there.</span> <span id="s1028">But, maybe we will have to make up our minds and go, because I see that it means an awful lot to them, and they want it.</span> <span id="s1029">They want to go to Auschwitz; they want to go to Warsaw to see where the Warsaw Ghetto uprising was; they want to see the big synagogue in Krakow, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1030">We are thinking.</span> <span id="s1031">We haven’t made any plans.</span> <span id="s1032">We are thinking about it, especially my husband’s hometown, there is a rabbi buried, a sage, and an awful lot of very religious people from New York; the Hasidim, go only for three days to pray on the grave of this particular rabbi.</span> <span id="s1033">It’s in his hometown.</span> <span id="s1034">So, that’s why he wants to go.</span> <span id="s1035">So, maybe we will.</span> <span id="s1036">Maybe we’ll think about it some more, and maybe we will go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">ER: I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1038">This was very painful and difficult, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">MK: Well, painful as it may be, I feel that, hopefully, it will serve a purpose.</span> <span id="s1040">I feel that it has to be done, because as long as the survivors are here, they can tell their own stories which, God knows, are true and must be believed.</span> <span id="s1041">We can remind a future generation what this unfortunate era between 1933 and 1945 was for Jews in Germany, and in Poland, and the countries surrounding Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and Hungary, and in what manner six million Jews were eliminated from the face of the earth.</span> <span id="s1042">I know Hitler also destroyed millions of other people but for totally different reasons.</span> <span id="s1043">Six million Jews died the death that they did just because their misfortune was to be born to Jewish parents; that was their only crime they have committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">ER: Thank you, Mina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">MK: You’re welcome.</span></p></body></html>
