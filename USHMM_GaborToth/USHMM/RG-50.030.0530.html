businessman in Freiburg, he was a horse dealer, which would be the equivalent of today’s automobile dealer.</span> <span id="s21">He sold horses to the city of Freiburg, and he was a World War I veteran, and he was a well-known businessman, my mother was a stay at home mom.</span> <span id="s22">And I had many friends in Freiburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s23">I remember my father taking me sled riding in the – in the wintertime, and I played in the spring and summertime with the neighbors on the streets.</span> <span id="s24">I had many toys.</span> <span id="s25">I was of a well – middle class family, and we had the cars that you – pedal cars that you could ride along on the streets and – and – and which we shared with each other.</span> <span id="s26">And we had played pranks, my friends and I played pranks, we put pistol caps in the trolley tracks, and the trolley came along and it made noises, it cracked them, and so, that type of thing.</span> <span id="s27">So w-we had – had a good childhood in Freiburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I had an older brother, nine years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: His name was Irving Joseph Judas.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did anyone else live with you in the house, or the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, we had the guests from time to time, but it was just our family of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Do you remember when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No, I do not remember when the war started, I only remember when the Gestapo knocked on our door, and said get out, at gunpoint.</span> <span id="s36">And they gave us time to pack a suitcase per person, and I was five years old, and my mother ha – packed for me a child’s rucksack, which I carried with me to this central staging point, a railroad station, where they took us to at gunpoint, where we met several hundred other German Jewish people like us, who huddled in fear, not knowing what to expect, and ate what little food we thought to bring along, and then there was none.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: When the Gestapo arrived, was it the morning, the evening?</span> <span id="s38">Was it summer, winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Best of my relect – recollection it was in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Was it cold out?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I – I don’t remember the temperature, or anything like that, that – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Before you left the house, what happened besides everyone packing a suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, I remember my grandmother flushing paper money down the toilet, and it – it took me 40 years to find out why she did that.</span> <span id="s44">It was because they had told us that we could only take the equivalent of 10 dollars per person by order of death if we f-found out to have more.</span> <span id="s45">So sh-she flushed down – decided to flush down whatever money she had in the house so they wouldn’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I n – I wasn’t really afraid at that point.</span> <span id="s48">I really didn’t know what was going on yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So you went to the central – central holding place, and did you wait outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, they brought us inside, and with several hundred other people that were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Didn’t tell us anything.</span> <span id="s53">That’s when we started to become afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: They – there was a long space of time, I guess, that appears at – at – at such occasion, and then sometime that evening, they loaded us into cattle train cars and shipped us to southern France, near the Pyrenees mountains, to a concentration camp called Gurs, g-u-r-s, Gurs.</span> <span id="s56">It was at the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains, a range of mountains that separates France and Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: When you left – [interruption]</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s83">Q: I mean, I’m not that great to look at, but if – if you need to look off just because, you know, you’re – you’re trying to rememb –</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Well, if it’s a contest between you and me, you win.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: No, it’s not a question of that, it’s that yo – sometimes I have that trouble too, if I’m trying to remember something, I can’t look at the person in the eye, I look somewhere else.</span> <span id="s86">But if you can come back to me, okay, I’d appreciate that, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, indeed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Can we start again Steve, is that okay?</span> <span id="s89">Okay.</span> <span id="s90">This is an interview with Mr. Fred Jarvis, conducted by Peggy Frankston

Yes indeed, because I remember them taking me to synagogue, and playing with my neighbors and taking me sled riding, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What are your first memories of the

id="s124">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s125">So, that’s what I was trying to lead you into.</span> <span id="s126">You told me that your first memory of the war was when the Gestapo came to your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah, but I didn’t know there was a war then, I just saw these people –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: – with guns in their hands and –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: – telling us to get out.</span> <span id="s132">I didn’t know – I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: That it was a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: – didn’t know that it was a war already.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Okay, then I phrased my – my question in – incorrectly.</span> <span id="s136">How can I lead into this?</span> <span id="s137">How can we make –</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Any way that you want, because I know what you’re looking for now.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s140">Okay … what was the first memories that you have that something was different than usual?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: When the Gestapo knocked on our door and came in with guns and told us to get out, at gunpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did they tell you where they were sending you?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: They didn’t tell us anything, they just told us to pack a bag, and my mother packed a child’s rucksack for me, which I carried on my back, and the adults each carried a suitcase.</span> <span id="s144">And we took just a little bit of food that we thought of.</span> <span id="s145">And they escorted us at gunpoint to a central meeting point, a railroad station in town, where we were thrown together with several hundred other Jews like us, who were huddled in fear – fear and not knowing what to expect.</span> <span id="s146">And we ate what little food we brought, and then there was none.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Before you left the house, what did – did you do?</span> <span id="s148">Did you say goodbye to somebody, did you hide something?</span> <span id="s149">What – do you remember what happened before you left the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: There – there was nobody left to say goodbye to.</span> <span id="s151">I do remember my grandmother flushing paper money down the toilet, and it took me 40 years to realize what she was doing when I was just five years old.</span> <span id="s152">And that was because we had been told by the Gestapo that we’re only allowed to take the equivalent of about 10 dollars of money per person by order of death, if we were caught with more.</span> <span id="s153">So my mo – grandmother decided to flush the paper money that she had in the house so the Nazis wouldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s154">They got everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So you were taken, with other families, to a central holding point, and how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We stayed there the rest of the day, and that evening they forced us into cattle train cars and shipped us to southern France, near the Pyrenees, a range of mountains separating France and Spain, to a concentration camp called Gurs, g-u-r-s.</span> <span id="s157">Camp Gurs was a very primitive and diseased.</span> <span id="s158">Hard labor and starvation killed many people, including my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: When you arrived, how long did it – first of all, how long did – do you remember the train trip from Freiburg to Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Not very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Do you remember being cold, being hungry?</span> <span id="s162">When you got there, what happened?</span> <span id="s163">You got out of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: We got out of the train, and it was like – they had like a train depot or something like that there.</span> <span id="s165">And people got out and they were assigned barracks, wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s166">And mud, boy, probably 12 inches of mud, and when you stepped into that mud, the mud sucked the shoes off your feet and more often than not people couldn’t find their shoe any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were you separated from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, I was with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And your father was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: My – my father was in a – in a nearby camp, also Gurs, separated by barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Could you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I could visit him, yes, I could go through the barbed wire and visit him, and negotiate or communicate between my father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Were there other children with you, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes, there were many other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: They were in the barracks with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And other women?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Were they all German?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I imagine so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Do you remember playing with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, we – we had nothing to play with.</span> <span id="s183">We had no games, no – the – the game was survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Do you remember what the barracks looked like inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, they – they were wooden barracks with windows and we had – there were bunks to sleep on, and was no-not anything comfortable, everything was very primitive.</span> <span id="s186">But – but we had bunks in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Do you remember what season it was when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What was a typical day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Wa – I found it to be a very lonesome day, a very aggravating day.</span> <span id="s193">There was no happiness, there was always hunger and thirst.</span> <span id="s194">We had very little access to water, we had no change of clothes.</span> <span id="s195">We lost our shoes in the mud, and there was nothing for a child to do, but hang onto their mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Did the other internees set up impromptu classes for you, or tried to t – organize activities for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Eventually, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you remember what some of these things were?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s200">I was just five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you learn songs, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Not in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How did a day go by, when did you go see your father?</span> <span id="s204">You said you slipped through the barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: At various times, vary – various times of the day.</span> <span id="s206">I ca – I can’t give you an hour by hour description.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Do you know whether your parents were trying to get visas to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, they desperately tried to get visas to emigrate, desperately, but to no avail.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Your father had a sister in United States, were –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Was it through her they were trying to get –</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: That was one of the venues that they tried to get, they were not able to help.</span> <span id="s213">The United States would not admit Jews at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So, you were at Gurs for a certain amount of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Probably about a year, or thereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, Marshal Pétain decided to show us the sunny side of France and shipped us to another concentration camp, closer to the medit – Mediterranean Ocean, called sunny Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s218">Rivesaltes was not always sunny, but it was windy, and it was close to the ocean, but we could not see the ocean, but we could feel the torrential wind that was forever blowing to almost hurricane forces, coming off the ocean, and which lifted and – and rattled our barracks roofs, which was made out of corrugated tin, and made very eerie sounds that I remember to this very day, very eerie sounds.</span> <span id="s219">[interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Do you remember how you were transported from Gurs to Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: You don’t remember if it’s a train or a bus or a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Were you together with both parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And was your – was someone else in your family with you?</span></p> <p><span

grandmother died in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: And I remember she died of disease, and old age at Gurs, she was 90 years old, and probably starvation as well.</span> <span id="s233">And I remember her funeral.</span> <span id="s234">I remember her casket being carried to the cemetery and I followed it, and I remember that to this day.</span> <span id="s235">And I had the opportunity a couple years ago to visit her grave, and I found it with no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Her name –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: She was your mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Sussman?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Sussman, Sussman.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s243">What was it like arriving at Rivesaltes, apart from the wind?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I really do not remember the arrival of Rivesaltes, I just remember the life at Rivesaltes –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Were –</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: – which was absolutely horrible, and th-the wind was just a part of it.</span> <span id="s247">The starvation diet that we were on and the – it was much like Gurs, it was starvation, disease and hard labor killed many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Let’s go back to Gurs for a moment.</span> <span id="s251">Could you tell me a little about how the day went by?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: The day went by very slowly.</span> <span id="s253">We’re always looking for mealtime, which was very little food.</span> <span id="s254">And we – several times during the day we had to fall out for appell, which was a head count to see if everyone was present.</span> <span id="s255">And that was a very dramatic time every time.</span> <span id="s256">Everybody got very excited, and lot of hullaballoo and you fall out in front of your barracks and get counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Do you remember being ill at any moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No, I was a healthy five year old at that time, when I arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Is there something that happened, that you remember particularly?</span> <span id="s260">A: Yes, my grandmother passed away of a combination of disease and malnourishment.</span> <span id="s261">And she was 90 years old, and her name was Bernadine(ph) Sussman.</span> <span id="s262">And I remember her funeral very well.</span> <span id="s263">It was probably half dozen people that attended her funeral, and I followed behind her coffin, and remember the internment.</span> <span id="s264">I was privileged to go back a couple of years ago and visit her grave.</span> <span id="s265">And the only thing left of Gurs at that time was they planted a forest where the camp was, and it was a full grown forest by now.</span> <span id="s266">But the cemetery was taken care of and well cared for and I found my grandmother’s grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: So, when they decided that you would go from Gurs to Rivesaltes, did they give you any warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No warning at all, just get on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: And what happened when you arrived?</span> <span id="s270">You and your mother were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I – my mother and my father were separated into two adjoining camps separated by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s272">I remained with my mother, I was only about six years old when we arrived at Rivesaltes, and I learned to negotiate the barbed wire, being a small child I could squeeze through the barbed wire without getting cut, and I could communicate between my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s273">And other children my age were able to do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: At that point were you speaking German with your mother and speaking French with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I do not recall the separation between German and French, but I – at that point, I spoke German with my parents.</span> <span id="s276">At a later time I forgot German altogether and spoke only French.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did your father have an assigned activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: My father was in charge of horses in the concentration camp Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s279">And one of his jobs was to take a team of horses into the neighboring town of Perpignan, a ca – several times a week, to pick up the – the mail for the camp at the Perpignan railroad station.</span> <span id="s280">So that gave him an opportunity to get out of the camp, and it gave him an opportunity if he had any money, or if anybody else gave him a little money, to buy a little food along the way.</span> <span id="s281">Morsels of food, and a morsel of food was better than none.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: How long do you think you stayed in Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: About two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: And was a point where you left Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes, I had a cousin named Erik Forst(ph), who was born in Germany, but he moved to France in 1939, so he was not a prisoner in any of the French concentration camps like his family was.</span> <span id="s286">So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in France, I do not know where.</span> <span id="s287">But all of a sudden he started showing up in Rivesaltes, and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something.</span> <span id="s288">Now what do I mean by that?</span> <span id="s289">He was dressed in – in boots, high thigh boots.</span> <span id="s290">He was dir – dressed in – in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants.</span> <span id="s291">He was dressed in a shirt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret.</span> <span id="s292">And people in concentration camps were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing.</span> <span id="s293">So over the years as I got older, I-I’ve always want – I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years later.</span> <span id="s294">And I wondered over the years, you know, what was this all about?</span> <span id="s295">But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the camp, and he could have sa – he had safe passage in and out of the main gate and no one stopped him or challenged him.</span> <span id="s296">So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him.</span> <span id="s297">But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the camp, and his plan was to plan an escape for us.</span> <span id="s298">So one dark night, my parents and I and my father’s brother Leopold, and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the camp, and my father gave the French – the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back.</span> <span id="s299">And we went through the barbed wife, down a short ravine and to a dirt road where my cousin Erik had an automobile and a driver waiting, and we piled into that car.</span> <span id="s300">My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the door.</span> <span id="s301">So that was eight people in – in a car, I’m sure we were a tight fit.</span> <span id="s302">And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumières, fermer les lumières, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him.</span> <span id="s303">And we drove for two nights, in the daytime we hid.</span> <span id="s304">And eventually we reached a small town by the name of Caussade, where cousin Erik had picked out a small farm for us to hide in and live.</span> <span id="s305">And we had, on this small farm we had, which was on top of a hill, we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner.</span> <span id="s306">And we grew food, we grew – grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we su-subsisted on that farm.</span> <span id="s307">And we were on that farm about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of different French police types started to show up.</span> <span id="s308">And my parents, seeing them come up the hill from below, ordered me to go lay in the corn field and hide, they shouldn’t count all – be able to count all of us.</span> <span id="s309">And one day there was so many of them that came, that – and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the cornfield, and when they had left, my parents couldn’t find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the – finally I woke up.</span> <span id="s310">But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea – rearrested all of us and sent us back to Camp Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s311">The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this concentration camp they had another jail.</span> <span id="s312">Within the jail they had another jail, and they put the men in my family in that jail.</span> <span id="s313">And it was extraordinary and I remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Let’s go back to Caussade for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s315">You lived on the farm and you – and your parents farmed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes, my parents and my – Kurt’s parents, we farmed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Did you have any duties, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: No I did not, really.</span> <span id="s319">But I – I – I did small things or whatnot, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Were you in contact with the local population?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: We went into town on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s322">My parents and Kurt’s parents lived on the farm.</span> <span id="s323">My cousin Erik, his mother and his sister lived in town and they rented the apartment type thing.</span> <span id="s324">So cousin Kurt and I, we had to do the ob – driving him into town with our horse and wagon, and picking him up in the morning on the daily basis.</span> <span id="s325">So that was our contact in the town.</span> <span id="s326">We also wa-wandered into town occasionally, and sat along the general park area where men had outdoor restaurants or – or tables.</span> <span id="s327">And we sat among them, we didn’t buy anything to eat, we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s328">But, we really didn’t talk to them.</span> <span id="s329">The only one that talked to any of the local people was cousin Erik.</span> <span id="s330">He was very friendly with the local police.</span> <span id="s331">And over the years, after they rearrested us and send us back to Camp Rivesaltes, I was always wondering, you know, would cousin Erik have anything to do with getting us rearrested, because he was so friendly with the local police there.</span> <span id="s332">I mean, you mind wanders, and you think – but no, that was not the case, they – they just tracked us down.</span> <span id="s333">And cousin Erik, apparently, I learned many years later, got warning from his friend in the police that the Gestapo was coming to pick us up.</span> <span id="s334">And in those days there were no telephones to call the farm, or any communications, so cousin Erik hightailed it and – and they – we got caught.</span> <span id="s335">So – and as I re-revisited Caussade 60 years later, the chief of police told me that Erik had been told that they were coming for us, and that he escaped and – over the Spanish border, and came back after the war.</span> <span id="s336">How true that is, I – I can’t vouch for, but that’s what the local chief of police told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Do you remember what it was like when the local police and the Gestapo came to get you from the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I-It was just desperate – des-desperate situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Did they give you a minute to pack a bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s341">They just grabbed us and put us in a wagon or something, and send us off, back to the train station, and back to Rivesaltes, just that fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And when you got there, you heard that they sent your father to the prison, you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I saw him.</span> <span id="s344">I saw him.</span> <span id="s345">The prison had a – a yard and – and they – covered by barbed wire, and I saw him in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What were the conditions inside the prison inside the camp?</span> <span id="s347">Were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Very desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: They were worse than regular conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: In what way?</span> <span id="s352">They had less to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I have no idea what they gave them to eat.</span> <span id="s354">We got precious little, I would suppose they got even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And how long did they stay there in –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: They stayed there until they sent them to Auschwitz via Drancy, in June, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: After you came back from Caussade, how – I know it’s hard to remember lengths of time, but you – you s – remained in Rivesaltes for – for a certain amount of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: It was actually a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: A week, or two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, it was probably a month or two.</span> <span id="s361">[interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: I’d like to talk a little about life at Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s363">Do you remember playing with other children, do you remember Spanish children, or children from the Roma?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: The only thing I remember about Spanish children is I got sick in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s365">I had some kind of a chest disease, where I was being treated, where they put bottles, heated with cans, and put them on – on my back.</span> <span id="s366">I have no idea what it was, but it must have been pretty bad at the time.</span> <span id="s367">And in that hospital they gave me a little bit of milk, which was very difficult to get in – in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s368">And I was somewhat weak, so I didn’t finish my milk, and I put it at the head of my bed on the floor.</span> <span id="s369">And had this Spanish boy who was also in the hospital, and he made his way on my bed, and tried to s-steal that milk.</span> <span id="s370">And that was the very first fight that I ever remember being in as a boy.</span> <span id="s371">I smacked that boy in the lip, and I said, get out of here, that’s mine.</span> <span id="s372">And that’s what I remember of any Spanish boys in there.</span> <span id="s373">The Spanish mainly were people who hung around the perimeter of the barbed wire around the outside of the camp, who at times provided food for us, if we had a little money to purchase it, such as perhaps a can of beans, or if you were lucky, one egg.</span> <span id="s374">And – and nobody had a lot of money so the-they – but there were a lot of people there, so they had a ni – a – a chance to sell small pieces of fruit to people, a piece of fruit.</span> <span id="s375">And people were able to cook it like a boy scout over la – over a fire made over rocks, and we can put a tin can on the rocks and – and boil whatever it was.</span> <span id="s376">I remember my mother was cooking a can of beans one time over such a rock system, which a – rather a lot of people were able to do.</span> <span id="s377">And I was playing around that, and I knocked that can of beans over, and that was a disaster.</span> <span id="s378">And it was – it was just – just – just a disaster.</span> <span id="s379">That can of bean would have been a feast for us.</span> <span id="s380">Also, these combination of French and Spanish people, since we had no beds to sleep on, we slept on the concrete floor with a little bit of straw under us, if we could find some.</span> <span id="s381">They built a primitive wooden beds for someone who had a – a few cents, I-I have no idea what they sold it for, but they were – sold quite a few of them, so – and they were nothing that you would want to sleep on, but for an inmate to sleep off the floor, you know, like 10 inches off the floor rather than on the floor was a – was a – just awesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: It was made out of wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Out of wood, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And what was inside, was there a mattress?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Oh no, there win – there’s no such thing, there were just wooden slots, and I guess you could put a blanket or something over it, it just kept you off the floor.</span> <span id="s386">No one had a mattress.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q2: Oh, we’re fine, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Oh, we can keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q2: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s391">What were some of the things you ate in Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh, we had quite a wonderful menu.</span> <span id="s393">We had probably, I would estimate about two ounces of bread twice a week – I mean, no, twice a day.</span> <span id="s394">And then, in the middle of the day they brought you dishwater soup, which was nothing more than dishwater with one or two carrots sliced into the soup.</span> <span id="s395">My mother would fish out the carrots that she got and feed them to me because that was the only nourishment that was available.</span> <span id="s396">And to show you how much I liked those carrots, when I was grown, later on in life, for the next 40 years I could not eat a cooked carrot.</span> <span id="s397">I could eat raw carrots, but I could not eat cooked carrots, although I’m able to do that now.</span> <span id="s398">It – it shows the power of negative thinking, I think.</span> <span id="s399">But it wa – it was just awesome, 40 years I couldn’t eat a carrot.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Do you remember any of the different organizations that came into the camps to help people?</span> <span id="s401">The Secours Swiss, or the OSE?</span> <span id="s402">Do you remember any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I remember the Red Cross coming, and I remember OSE coming.</span> <span id="s404">OSE and the Red Cross managed to provide for us young children, what I seem to remember to be about a cup of milk every other week, and that was a lifesaver.</span> <span id="s405">We would hoard our br – two ounces of bread, and break them into this cup of milk, and this would be mush, and that was like a feast.</span> <span id="s406">And so that was – that was quite an event.</span> <span id="s407">We would have to queue up and line up to get into this barrack where they would feed that to young children.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Do you remember if they had any activities planned for you, games?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: OSE and organizations like that had some planned activities, but I was too young to participate in those things, so I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Do you remember any official visits by German or French officials coming to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: We had constant traffic, or – I didn’t know who specifically came by, but we were constantly called out on appell in Rivesaltes also, whereby we had to fall out of our barracks and they had to have a head count of everybody several times a day.</span> <span id="s412">And this was very annoying because it disrupted our activities of doing nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did you stay with your mother most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I stayed with my mother all of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Were you – were – what was her – her general mood?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Displeasure, and despair.</span> <span id="s417">This was a very non-comporting existence, and there was no – no bright shining star ahead.</span> <span id="s418">There was no hope.</span> <span id="s419">It was a hopeless situation.</span> <span id="s420">It was – it was just very tragic, and we just carried on a-as best we could.</span> <span id="s421">We just hung onto dear life.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Do you remember some of the conditions of life in the camp that you remember especially, that were especially difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, the bathroom facilities for one were extremely difficult and extremely negative.</span> <span id="s424">We – we had a bathroom which was maybe 30 - 40 feet long with several stalls for people to use, which was nothing but a hole in a piece of wood and they had some great facility below which would catch the waste.</span> <span id="s425">Which my father and his horses and his team of people would have to empty every so often, which was a disgusting thing in itself.</span> <span id="s426">But the bathroom facilities you had to go – were made out of concrete, but you had to go up a s – a set of wooden stairs to a certain level, and there you had a – a bathroom facility and there were maybe 20 of them in a row, such – and it even had a door for privacy, which was very surprising.</span> <span id="s427">But you really didn’t want to close that door, although you had to, because the smell and the odor was just inescapable, and the – there was no such thing as toilet paper, and you would have to wipe your tail with your finger and then wipe it on the wall.</span> <span id="s428">And there were many people ahead of you who had already decorated the wall.</span> <span id="s429">And so it was like finger-painting.</span> <span id="s430">And – and it – it was – the smell and the stench stayed with me for many years afterwards.</span> <span id="s431">And it – it – it was a very crude situation, but there it was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was it far from your barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, it wa – that wasn’t the issue, it wasn’t that far from the barracks.</span> <span id="s434">They had several of those at several given points, but they had a lot of people there, so all these facilities were overused.</span> <span id="s435">And especially since most of us had diarrhea from what we had – the he – these were conditions, so it was very, very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What happened in August – Q2: I’m sorry, we need to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: – point when your mother was contacted by somebody concerning your fate, whether you might be able to be taken away from her and put somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No, I do not remember any of that, but I do remember my mother speaking to me.</span> <span id="s441">She had taken me aside on a corner of one of the barracks and told me to escape, and she told me a-about my beha – what my behavior should be, and how I should behave.</span> <span id="s442">And I do not remember specifically – she charged me with a number of things that I should do, and I had no clue that anything else.</span> <span id="s443">I was later contacted by a 17 year old girl to – who helped me to escape from concentration camp Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s444">And I ran away from this girl, and they chased me all over the camp, as a – as a seven year old boy, they’re kind of fast on their feet, and I had several people chasing me.</span> <span id="s445">So I was finally caught, and this girl took me to a barrack, along with my cousin Kurt and locked me up for the night in that barrack.</span> <span id="s446">And then, early in the morning sometime, she helped us to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Did you know when your mother took you aside, that you were going to be separated from her?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I didn’t accept it as such, but that’s – that was the case.</span> <span id="s449">In later life I looked at it as, in the loving manner that my mother dumped me for this 17 year old girl, because she had an indication where she was going.</span> <span id="s450">Where she was going was not going to be good, and that she did this in order to save my life, in which the – she succeeded.</span> <span id="s451">My mother had two boys, one nine years older than me, and myself, and through all this deprivation or everything, she managed to save both her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What happened to your brother Joseph?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: My brother Joseph was sent – who was older than I, was sent on the last kinder train to England, which was a refugee train to save children in Germany, and he spent the rest of the war in England without his parents.</span> <span id="s454">And he survived to – to this very day.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So there was never a moment when you said goodbye to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No, I wa – would take that as the time that my mother spoke to me in telling me to escape.</span> <span id="s457">That was the long goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Do you remember any of the other things she said, to – to only speak French, or something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: No, I – I – I remember the gist of what she said, I don’t remember the exact words.</span> <span id="s460">It’s been 65 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: When you and Kurt were hiding in the barrack overnight, what were your feelings at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Our feelings were very wet, because we both cried all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You were afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, indeed, we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Did you have an idea of where you would be going?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I had no idea where we were going, or what – what – what our future was.</span> <span id="s467">We were in the hands of this 17 year old girl who worked for the OSE [indecipherable] the Secours Enfant, who managed to save 10,000 children out of the concen – various concentration camps, 5,000 of which were recaptured, and 5,000 of us who managed to survive the war because of their help.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: The next morning, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: We were on our way to a orphanage by OSE in the mountains, and this young, 17 year old French German Jewish girl, working for the OSE took us to this huge castle, which probably had between two and 500 boys, all of Spanish origin, from – survivors from the Spanish civil war.</span> <span id="s470">And we were deposited there in this orphanage, and since they all spoke Spanish, I learned to speak Spanish from them.</span> <span id="s471">I learned to go to s – s – mathematics in Spanish, table – multiplication in Spanish, and when I left there several months later, I was speaking fluent Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Where did you go a few months later?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: To another OSE home in the Alps, which was in a mountain area.</span> <span id="s474">It was a closed orphanage where we were given food and health care, and – and loving care from other children like us, only older.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: They were German refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: They were German refugees and refugees from various countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And did you end up going to another OSE home?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes, after that they took us to an OSE home called Montantan(ph), which again was a castle in the Limoges(ph) region.</span> <span id="s479">And they probably had five - 600 children there before we arrived, my cousin Kurt and I arrived there.</span> <span id="s480">And they gave us loving care.</span> <span id="s481">They gave us food and health care and li – as much love as an older child could give you.</span> <span id="s482">And they were older children, mostly girls that looked after us until we got comfortable in there.</span> <span id="s483">And it was a very good – probably spent my coldest winter there.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Did you go to classes?</span> <span id="s485">Did you go to the local school, or were there classes in the chateau?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No, no, no, there were religious occasions and things in the chateau, and we learned Hebrew songs in French.</span> <span id="s487">And it was a – for the time and the situation, I would say a happy go lucky a – place, where they tried to make you feel at home as much as possible under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s488">And there were some very interesting people, OSE people in charge of that home, who really took good care of us.</span> <span id="s489">When this OSE home became untenable because of Nazi designs upon it, then they took us out of there and dispersed us among the countryside, either in singles or in pairs.</span> <span id="s490">And my cousin Kurt and I were paired off, and we were taken under the OSE – we were sent to the countryside, we were given new names.</span> <span id="s491">Mine name was Maurice Julia and Kurt was [indecipherable] Julia.</span> <span id="s492">And we were given a whole repertoire of where we were born and why we c-come to this area.</span> <span id="s493">And they sent us to a small town called Neyron in Ain, about 10 miles outside of Lyon, France’s second largest city.</span> <span id="s494">We were hidden on a small farm in a rural area, with – this was a very small farm amid homes.</span> <span id="s495">We had Madame – the woman, the ca – the Christian woman who took care of Kurt and me at the risk of her own life was named Madame Burra.</span> <span id="s496">She had five goats, a small farm area where we planted various assorted food, and grapes, and we had the – the fruit trees.</span> <span id="s497">I had to climb the cherry tree to pick cherries for market.</span> <span id="s498">And I was very good cherry picker, I put one in my mouth and one in the basket.</span> <span id="s499">And it was delicious.</span> <span id="s500">And she fed us well.</span> <span id="s501">She made – she sent me out in the forest after a rain to collect escargot, and she made wonderful escargot if I brought her a basketful.</span> <span id="s502">And Madame Burra provided food and shelter for us from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s503">We went to church with her on Sundays and she even sent us to school.</span> <span id="s504">So we spoke well enough French not to be able to be found out as Jews, and when – in the French school system.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Do you remember some of the things you were told that you were supposed to do, or what you were supposed to say about why you ended up in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes, yes, our cover story was that Kurt and I were born in the north, near Dunkirk where fight – a lot of fighting had occurred, and that my supposed parents had sent me to Madame Burra, my aunt in central France, for safety.</span> <span id="s507">And that was our cover story and – and we went to school with that, and the n-neighbors accepted us with that, so Madame Burra protected us at the risk of her own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Apart from going to church, did you go to catechism?</span> <span id="s509">Did you go to get any religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And were there other Jewish children hiding in that same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Most probably, but not known to me, although about 21 – 20 miles away, there were about 40 children that the OSE could not find any homes for, and they were called the children of Egieu.</span> <span id="s513">And a nice Nazi fellow by the name of Klaus Barbie was informed by a local farmer that these 40 children were in this house, and they had about three or four OSE workers with them to look over them.</span> <span id="s514">And Klaus Barbie took two trucks full of gendarme with him, and raided this – this home, and arrested all 43 children and sent them within two days to Auschwitz, where they were killed on arrival.</span> <span id="s515">And on my return to France, I had the opportunity to visit this home, since it was so near to Ma-Madame Burra that I went and took photographs of – of – of this – this home had been turned into a museum 60 years later.</span> <span id="s516">And it wa – it was just earth shaking, and so close to where we lived during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: During your time with Madame Burra, you were – were you and your cousin following the progress of the war?</span> <span id="s518">Were you aware of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: We – we had a radio in our attic.</span> <span id="s520">Radios were forbidden by order of death.</span> <span id="s521">If they caught you with it, they’d shoot you right on the spot.</span> <span id="s522">But we listened to that periodically, and we had some semblance.</span> <span id="s523">And we listened to the invasion in Normandy when the allies arrived, and we were all full of joy and tears at that time.</span> <span id="s524">So, we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Do you remember if there were any resistance networks operating?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s527">France was full of FFI, Forces Françaises de l’intérieur, Maquis.</span> <span id="s528">They were all the same thing, they were underground fighters of various religions and including many Jews, and a lot of communists, and – but they fought the Germans bravely, and mostly were massacred by – by the Germans when they tried to fight in – in groups, in massive groups, because they had no artillery but small weapons.</span> <span id="s529">But the Maquis was very much around us and dear to us, because often they protected us.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: You told me about a song.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes [sings in French].</span> <span id="s532">And that’s 65 years later, I still remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: You and other schoolchildren sang that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes indeed, yes indeed.</span> <span id="s535">We were very careful where we sang it, but – but we did, among other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Madame Burra was a widower – a widow?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Madame Burra had a husband.</span> <span id="s538">He was sick when we arrived, and died while we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did she have any other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: She had a son who worked and lived in Lyon.</span> <span id="s541">But I only met him once, and did not know his first name, and I knew he worked in some kind of a plastic factory, whatnot, but know very little about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Tell me of your memories of the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Liberation came in Neyron in September 1944.</span> <span id="s544">It was probably the most joyous day in my life.</span> <span id="s545">The G.I.s gave us everything that we had never seen before.</span> <span id="s546">Canned food, chocolate, chewing gum, and one great phenomenon, peanut butter.</span> <span id="s547">Chunks of it.</span> <span id="s548">And they were very good to us, and they – the Maquis at that time quickly arrested collaborators, mostly women that slept with the Germans, and clipped their hair and as outcasts, and whatever else they did to them afterwards, and some lived and some died.</span> <span id="s549">So it was a time of revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: When liberation occurred, what happened?</span> <span id="s551">Did your life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, th-the thing that I loved most about liberation is seeing the Germans flee.</span> <span id="s553">They fled ahead of the – they didn’t stand and fight.</span> <span id="s554">They fled ahead of the Americans coming in, and they grabbed anything that had wheels.</span> <span id="s555">Bicycles, if you had a bicycle, they took it from you, and they just wheeled out of town.</span> <span id="s556">And life changed tremendously because OSE came back and reclaimed their children, their hidden children, and my c-cousin Kurt and I were split up for the first time in the war.</span> <span id="s557">My cousin Kurt was taken back by OSE to Lyrondell(ph), an orphanage in Lyon, and I was sent to the Hotesowa(ph) in La Chaumiere, another orphanage, because I had a respiratory ailment still, ailing from Rivesaltes, and they sent me in the – high in the mountains with the clean air and tried to cure me there.</span> <span id="s558">And then my cousin Kurt was Bar Mitzvahed at Lyrondell(ph), and then eventually they had me join him there at Lyrondell(ph), and I got my first lessons in Hebrew and the Bible and Judaism, and they educated me in the Jewish way there.</span> <span id="s559">And they – and – and then I was found by my Aunt Hannah Ramsfelder(ph) and my brother Joe, from England, and they both want – want – my brother Joe wanted to bring me to England, my aunt, sister of my father – my father had 12 brothers and sisters and she was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s560">So she wanted to bring me to America, so I had a choice between England and America.</span> <span id="s561">I said, give me Uncle Sam.</span> <span id="s562">And so, in November 1946, we boarded the Ile de France, France’s largest luxury liner and headed to New York City.</span> <span id="s563">We took about six days to cross the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s564">The Ile de France was France’s largest luxury liner.</span> <span id="s565">The only problem was, it was outfitted as a troop ship during the war.</span> <span id="s566">So on its first maiden voyage, it was still so outfitted.</span> <span id="s567">So we slept in G.I. racks and ate G.I. food, but who cared?</span> <span id="s568">We were safe, and free and on our way to America, the land where the streets were paved with gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Did you try to find out what happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: More than anything else.</span> <span id="s571">My parents did not surface, nor Kurt’s parents did not surface after the war.</span> <span id="s572">And so we had not – no choice but to presume that they were dead.</span> <span id="s573">Where did they die and how did they die, we did not know.</span> <span id="s574">It took me 40 years to find out that they had gone to Auschwitz via Drancy, and that they were gassed and burned in the crematorium the same day that they arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s575">And the fact of not knowing what happened to them was the most excruciating pain of all, which in – I endured for over 40 years.</span> <span id="s576">It was not until 1983, that at a survivors’ meeting I found a book by the French lawyer – by a French lawyer who had found German records and reconstituted them and wrote a book, and this book was in French.</span> <span id="s577">And since I had not spoken French for 30 years, I had lost the fluency of it, so I waited another year, I was told there would be a – book would be translated into English, and purchased it.</span> <span id="s578">And found my father and my mother in that book, into which transport they arrived to, and what happened to them from these records from this French lawyer.</span> <span id="s579">And – and that gave me some sort of closure about my parents, if there is such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Tell me about your arrival in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I arrived aboard the Ile de France in New York City in May 26th, 1946.</span> <span id="s582">I was met at the pier by my aunt, Hannah Ramsfelder(ph), who brought me – who, she and her husband brought me to America, and my first cousin Inga(ph) Furlish(ph).</span> <span id="s583">Inga(ph) had survived the war in nearby Switzerland.</span> <span id="s584">She had come to the United States briefly before me, and she spoke fluent French and fluent English.</span> <span id="s585">Therefore she became my translator and close friend, as well as first cousin.</span> <span id="s586">When I came to America, I spoke only French, I came to a household that spoke mainly German, and I went to a school that spoke only English.</span> <span id="s587">You talk about being screwed up?</span> <span id="s588">I was it.</span> <span id="s589">I started school in America in the elementary school level, had no help from anyone in the languages.</span> <span id="s590">I then went to junior high school and after that I went to high school, to a – a school named [indecipherable] Vocation High School.</span> <span id="s591">Every morning session we studied baking and baking technology.</span> <span id="s592">In the afternoon sessions we would get our – our other lessons.</span> <span id="s593">And after four years I graduated as a pastry chef.</span> <span id="s594">I worked as a baker and cake decorator for 40 years, 18 hours a day, standing on my feet, no lunch breaks, nothing.</span> <span id="s595">But I was a talented baker and – and well in demand.</span> <span id="s596">I ran into trouble with the unions, because I never got a raise, never got a Christmas bonus, so I quit the union, and I started as a baby photographer.</span> <span id="s597">After about a year I opened my own photography store, and I managed to be a photographer in New York City for 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: You were taking – you were specializing in pictures of babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Babies.</span> <span id="s600">I answered an ad from an organization that did – gave free baby pictures by the diaper service.</span> <span id="s601">And the – the managing manager of this came and met me one morning, and I went around with him and I watched him work one morning, what kind of equipment he used, you know, and see what you use, and how you do it.</span> <span id="s602">And we went to lunch.</span> <span id="s603">At lunch I excused myself, I said I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s604">I went through the bathroom window and left.</span> <span id="s605">I had just learned the photography business.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Let’s go back a little to your time when you first got here.</span> <span id="s607">Did you have any religious training with your – with your aunt’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: The synagogue that I belonged to in – in New York City was – provided free Hebrew lessons for me and Kurt because we were Holocaust survivors and my aunt didn’t have the money to pay them.</span> <span id="s609">So you get what – whatever you get for free is – is free, so I didn’t learn anything.</span> <span id="s610">So all the learning that I have goes back to OSE in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: How much more do we have on this tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: This is a good time to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: We were talking about your religious education with your aunt in New York.</span> <span id="s616">Were you Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes, I was Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s618">I was Bar Mitzvah in 1948 in Shaare Hatikvah synagogue, an Orthodox synagogue apart from where we lived in Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s619">I was specially tutored by one of the Orthodox gentleman in the synagogue who – who – who prepared Bar Mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s620">He didn’t char-charge my aunt for it because she couldn’t afford it, and – and we had a wonderful Bar Mitzvah with a synagogue full of people, and they made a small party for me afterwards.</span> <span id="s621">It was very, very rewarding and very exciting.</span> <span id="s622">And here I was a man, after I’d been a man for 12 years before that, cause I always considered that I was a man in a boy’s body, throughout the war.</span> <span id="s623">That –</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: What was your feeling about Judaism and – and believing in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Well, OSE indoctrinated me for that, first in France and I have a firm belief in God.</span> <span id="s626">I’ve not given up my – my belief in God because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s627">It has strengthened and reaffirmed my belief, and I feel that the – the – the Holocaust was the cost for the Jewish people to reclaim Israel.</span> <span id="s628">It’s my justification.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: So you graduated from your vocational school with honors, and you were going to become a pastry chef, but you were 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: And I joined the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s631">The Korean war was on in full blast, and I wanted to serve my country, my adopted country, and I joined the Marine Corps, United States Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s632">I came to Paris Island when I was yay – eight – 18 years old, and went through boot camp over there, which was another hell, but I survived that and became a full pledged United States Marine.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: What was your specialty?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I was artillery, 105s and 155 Howitzers.</span> <span id="s635">Boom, boom.</span> <span id="s636">It made – it made a lot of noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Did you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I was also a rifleman, an expert rifleman.</span> <span id="s639">Every Marine is an expert rifleman.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Were you sent to Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: It was a picnic because they sent me there after the armistice, so I was not involved in any of the fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: What were some of your duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I became a chaplain’s aide, because I was always attending synagogue on Friday nights and whatnot, chaplain picked me out to be his aide.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: For the Jewish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: For the Jewish Marines.</span> <span id="s648">When I returned to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and I became acting Jewish chaplain, by order of the commanding general, and I had 2,000 Marines in my congregation.</span> <span id="s649">So I had to lead services, had to conduct Passover services, had to conduct Passover services, I had to make arrangements, I had great responsibilities.</span> <span id="s650">I wore sergeant stripes on my shirt, chaplain’s bars o-on – chaplain’s tablets on my collar, and a – as I walked back and forth around the camp, they didn’t know if I was fish or fowl.</span> <span id="s651">I had officers’ plates on my car, I slept in the officers’ quarters, ate in the officers’ mess, and people saluted me as I passed me.</span> <span id="s652">So it was a – I had a great deal of authority on that base.</span> <span id="s653">So it was very interesting and very challenging and I had to do everything on the camp for Jewish people except marriage or burial.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Tell me, when you came to the States, your name was Manfred Judas?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And when did you become Fred Jarvis?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I became Fred Jarvis when my u-uncle sent me to school, which was probably a week after I arrived here.</span> <span id="s658">And I was very upset that he changed my name, because I very much wanted to have my father’s name.</span> <span id="s659">I didn’t know the meaning of Judas, I didn’t understand it at the time.</span> <span id="s660">And I fought vehemently to get my – my name Judas back, and when I went into the Marine Corps, I reclaimed my name, Fred Judas, and I served as that in the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s661">When I came out, I was sent to the south.</span> <span id="s662">When I went in the Marines I first saw black don’t drink from this water fountain, you have to drink from here.</span> <span id="s663">Discrimination, all that.</span> <span id="s664">And I was taunted by a lot of people in the Marine Corps because of my name and being a Jew.</span> <span id="s665">So when I came out of the Marine Corps, I legally changed my name, when I got married and raised my family to – back to Jarvis.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: How long did you spend in the Marine Corps?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: 14 years.</span> <span id="s668">Four years in – in active duty and 10 years in the reserve.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And then you became a pastry cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No, I – I – I was a pastry chef when I went into the Marine Corps, right, but I came back into civilian life, I had to make a living for my family, I went back to being a baker, pastry chef, and I was a good one.</span> <span id="s671">I made cakes for the Ed Sullivan Show, I made ca – birthday cakes for Ed Sullivan’s family.</span> <span id="s672">I made cakes from scratch that tasted wonderfully and decorated them into brilliant cakes.</span> <span id="s673">I was taught by one of the leading artists in New York City, and became very proficient at my trade, and worked at it for 40 years.</span> <span id="s674">I made cakes for stage, screen and television.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: All this time you were in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: All this time I was in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You met your wife where?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I met my wife in my local synagogue in New York City, and I raised two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: I know that you went back to Rivesaltes recently.</span> <span id="s680">Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well, I – Rivesaltes had been a very deep part of my life.</span> <span id="s682">It’s where I escaped twice, with my parents and without them, and where I spent a very desperate time of my life.</span> <span id="s683">And I never had the money to go back, but I understood no one could go there because the French army had built a rifle range and they – if you tried to get in there, they’d lock you up.</span> <span id="s684">So later on in life, as I was able to accumulate money, I decided I wanted to go back, I want to see first Gurs.</span> <span id="s685">Gurs is only – Gurs – my grandmother’s grave is in Gurs.</span> <span id="s686">The only thing standing of the concentration camp in Gurs at this time is the cemetery.</span> <span id="s687">Everything else was planted into a forest.</span> <span id="s688">So I went there to see my grandmother’s grave, and as we Jews do, we don’t leave flowers, we leave a stone on the grave.</span> <span id="s689">And so I paid my respect there.</span> <span id="s690">I wanted to go to Rivesaltes, which it was only a hundred miles away, but couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s691">So instead, I went to Caussade, where we were – where we were headed on – hidden on that farm.</span> <span id="s692">Came back to the United States and in 19 – in 2008, I found an article on the internet by the New York Times, that the French government had purchased something like 40 acres of the Rivesaltes concentration camp, and was planning to build, in conjunction with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a 40 million dollar memorial to the people who went through there.</span> <span id="s693">And I wanted to see what this camp looked like today before they built a memorial.</span> <span id="s694">So I booked passage over there, and not having spoken French for over 30 years, I was no longer fluent in it, so I hired a driver with an automobile who would speak French and spoke fluent English.</span> <span id="s695">And my travel agent was fortunate to hire such a person for me.</span> <span id="s696">I flew to Perpignan, and took a hotel there, and I decided to stay there for eight days, because I didn’t want to spend two days there and not achieve what I came to do, and I brought my – being a professional photographer, I brought my camera along, and this gentleman knew just the way to the camp, and I was able to get in to the camp, and I took between 1500 and 2000 photographs over a period of eight days, I photographed everything that I could find in this concentration camp, so that I could show myself and my children and my family where I actually was in 1942.</span> <span id="s697">That’s why I wanted to go back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: When you arrived at the camp and saw it now, did some of the memories come back, or did it –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: The memories co – did not come back, they were always with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Did you see the barrack where you had lived with your mother, or were hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: There was nothing recognizable in Rivesaltes after 65 years.</span> <span id="s702">Several generations of people besides Jews had been put through this camp, including the ar – Harkis and Gypsies and – and German war – World War II prisoners after the war.</span> <span id="s703">And there was no street recognizable, everything was in decay, barracks were falling apart, in various stages, which is why I photographed it so intensely.</span> <span id="s704">And there was really – I mean, the camp itself was recognizable as a camp, but there were no actual locations recognizable, no streets, no areas.</span> <span id="s705">The ilos(ph) themselves were barely recog – there was no markings for ilo(ph) E, ilo(ph) B, ilo(ph) A.</span> <span id="s706">You couldn’t recognize anything.</span> <span id="s707">But I had such a vivid memory of our bathroom system, that I looked for the bathroom, this – this very – it was – had made such a negative impression on me, I’ve – the smell, the sight, everything.</span> <span id="s708">Now I remember it exactly, I could make a drawing of it.</span> <span id="s709">And – and – but the bathrooms were of different modification and design, so I could only believe that they were – the old bathrooms were torn down over the years, and new ones rebuilt.</span> <span id="s710">I couldn’t even find the area where we escaped from, and I looked very – very hardly for that.</span> <span id="s711">So – but I’m very happy that I went back, that I was able to see what there was, and so I can visualize it and discuss it with my children and family.</span> <span id="s712">I’m – they – I – I barely speak of this, but speaking and seeing in a photograph are two different things.</span> <span id="s713">A photograph will speak a thousand words to you.</span> <span id="s714">So, i-it was – it was something that I felt I had to do.</span> <span id="s715">I also went into Poland, to Auschwitz, to see Auschwitz where my parents were murdered, and photographed everything I could there.</span> <span id="s716">And I stood there when it’s – I saw the sign that – Arbeit macht frei, and I cried like a baby.</span> <span id="s717">Sixty year – a 70 year old man at that time, crying like a baby.</span> <span id="s718">But that’s the emotion that’s tied to all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: You now live in Tennessee.</span> <span id="s720">How did you get to Tennessee from New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well, from New York City, I moved to a – they – they pi – my photography business was mainly in the Bronx, and they burned the Bronx down, which means they burned down my business.</span> <span id="s722">I tried to start businesses in other boroughs, the competition was too steep.</span> <span id="s723">I mean, if you can’t make it in New York, you can’t make it anyp – if you can make it in New York, you can make it anyplace.</span> <span id="s724">But, y-you know, if you have a hundred photographers in one place, in New York you got a thousand, you know, and you know how hard it is to get business, right?</span> <span id="s725">So I moved to North Carolina, and I bought a bakery in North Carolina, and a restaurant, and I worked that for 10 years, and then my wife decided to leave me.</span> <span id="s726">And so I moved from North Carolina to meril – Rockville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s727">I met my present wife there, a nice goysha(ph) lady, and eventually we got married.</span> <span id="s728">She had six children, I had two.</span> <span id="s729">Their – Mary’s children started a house – had a business in Tennessee, and they spent 10 years trying to talk their mother and me to come down to Tennessee.</span> <span id="s730">After 10 years we said fine, we’ll retire there.</span> <span id="s731">We built a big house in Withville(ph), Tennessee.</span> <span id="s732">And after we moved in, about two weeks, they came and said, Mom, we’re moving.</span> <span id="s733">We bought a business in Bristol.</span> <span id="s734">And she said no, I’m not moving.</span> <span id="s735">So I worked in – in Withville(ph) until I lost the business there.</span> <span id="s736">And then John told me working for King pharmaceuticals.</span> <span id="s737">So I traveled 200 miles round trip every day to come to work in Bristol, Tennessee, and one day I had an accident in a – on a winter day on ice, on the interstate, a rather dramatic accident.</span> <span id="s738">I was not injured, because God was looking out for me, and my wife said, we’re moving.</span> <span id="s739">The very next day she said, we’re moving.</span> <span id="s740">I rented an apartment here in Bristol, and I never went back to – to – a hundred miles up the road to Withville(ph).</span> <span id="s741">My wife came down, lived with me in the apartment, we sold the house in Withville(ph), and built a new house right here that you’re sitting in.</span> <span id="s742">And I worked for King pharmaceuticals for a total of about 20 years.</span> <span id="s743">And I was very well rewarded, and it was a very exciting, I was a – I saw that the photography and media department for a Wall Street business, which was very rewarding to me.</span> <span id="s744">I managed to travel the world in that capacity, managed to do world class photography, and it was a very war – worthwhile work experience for me.</span> <span id="s745">And that’s how we came to Bristol.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: There’s a Jewish community locally?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: There’s a small Jewish community locally.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Are you connected to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I am connected to it.</span> <span id="s750">I was the – this community just five years ago celebrated its centennial, and it was my privilege, as chairman of the centennial committee to bring Elie Wiesel to Bristol, Tennessee to speak, along with a Holocaust valet, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s751">And a Holocaust opera singer, and Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s752">And all three acts, so to speak, got standing ovations in our biggest local theater.</span> <span id="s753">And I was able to present the – a Holocaust performance, Oskar Schindler’s, Oskar’s List, in my son’s newly renovated post office downtown, which hundreds of local people first saw Holocaust exhibits.</span> <span id="s754">And so we had a very worthwhile centennial, and we exposed our congregation, people telling me, oh, we never even knew that you had a synagogue down here.</span> <span id="s755">And so it was very worthwhile, and very rewarding.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: And have you been active in testifying locally?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, in the – within the last five years I’ve been asked to speak at local schools and churches about my Holocaust experience, and I – experiences, and I have done so.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Who, or what encouraged you to speak out after so long a time when you were silent?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s760">He said, it is your duty and your obligation as a survivor to be a witness, and to testify what happened to you, and – because there are many people who do not believe that the hoskel – Holocaust happened, and you know only too well that it did.</span> <span id="s761">So I’m taking his challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Thank you, Mr. Jarvis for letting us interview today.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: You’re very welcome.</span> <span id="s764">[break] That is a photograph of my family.</span> <span id="s765">On the right is my father, Leo Judas, on
