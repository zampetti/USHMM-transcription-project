March 29, 1992.</span> <span id="s4">We’re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her father, Dr. Gerson Reif.</span> <span id="s5">What can you tell us about your father?</span> <span id="s6">What do you know?</span> <span id="s7">Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I don’t really know anything about his family.</span> <span id="s9">The only things I can say about my father is that -- first of all, apparently he was a pretty good daddy.</span> <span id="s10">Apparently he really wanted very much to have a daughter and so he was apparently very happy when I was born, as a girl.</span> <span id="s11">I think he was probably a fairly serious person but I think he was probably less way out than either of his children -- in the sense that I think he was serious about his professional pursuits but he also apparently enjoyed going to the opera and so on.</span> <span id="s12">I guess he and my mother bought sort of popular music records of the day and so I don’t think -- I have a feeling that he was not like an ultra intellectual type but very serious about his work.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Do you know where he went to school or anything about his education?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: He went to school in Vienna, that’s all I really know.</span> <span id="s15">Then he actually was in the war during World War I and he was wounded.</span> <span id="s16">He was in the Austrian army and he was wounded at the Russian front.</span> <span id="s17">Actually I’ll take you on a three -minute tour to show you a certificate that he got for that.</span> <span id="s18">That happened during his medical training apparently and then he went back and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Had his parents -- you said he was born in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Grew up in Poland basically</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes and apparently he was the only one of the children who did anything professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Do you know anything about any of the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, I know about the two who are in New York and my Aunt Lena came here I think in the 1920’s; got married and she and her husband owned a hardware store.</span> <span id="s25">The other, the Uncle Max brother owned what was called a luncheonette in New York which was a place with a fountain.</span> <span id="s26">You could get sandwiches or a sundae or something like that.</span> <span id="s27">I think he probably was different within his own family, different from all the others.</span> <span id="s28">My brother felt that he had -- my brother liked him because he was serious and he would bring him books to read and things like that.</span> <span id="s29">I think he also took my brother ice -skating, for example, which my brother apparently hated.</span> <span id="s30">I think he had a variety of things that he liked to do and he did go dancing with my mother.</span> <span id="s31">As a matter of fact, I grew up with this funny thing.</span> <span id="s32">I thought that all people in Vienna ever did was to go ballroom dancing in white gowns and tails for the men.</span> <span id="s33">Actually I love to do that; my husband and I do a lot of ballroom dancing in evening gowns and tails.</span> <span id="s34">I don’t know whether there’s a connection there but I think he was quite a serious person.</span> <span id="s35">I think he really liked his work.</span> <span id="s36">I think he was a good dentist.</span> <span id="s37">I think he was serious and interested in his patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did he always run the practice out of his home or did he ever work for someone else, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: As far as I know, he always ran the practice out of our house.</span> <span id="s40">There was something else I was going to say, but it just eluded me.</span> <span id="s41">No, it wasn’t because you interrupted it’s just because I’m so forgetful.</span> <span id="s42">Well, I don’t remember what I was going to say but I don’t really know very much else about my father.</span> <span id="s43">I think he was probably a gentle, kindly sort of person.</span> <span id="s44">I think he was rather good-looking.</span> <span id="s45">He looks good-looking when he was young.</span> <span id="s46">I have a picture of him around a cadaver on a dissecting table and he was rather good-looking then.</span> <span id="s47">But then later on he got kind of stocky and I don’t know, to my mind, that didn’t look too great on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you have any memories of any outings or anything that you ever took with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No.</span> <span id="s50">I don’t have any particular memories of my own.</span> <span id="s51">I know that in the summers we used to go to the country and he would come on weekends.</span> <span id="s52">I know my brother, to this day, still talks about those things in a somewhat mocking way, about how many suitcases and porters my mother needed to go on those trips.</span> <span id="s53">I guess that’s really about all I can say.</span> <span id="s54">I know it seems weird to me how circumstances shape people’s lives and about the fact that my father was in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s55">If he had been sensible to come to the United States earlier, that he would have been probably in the American army because you know he would have been in that age group where he still would have gotten drafted.</span> <span id="s56">You’re sort of a pawn of the country that you’re born in, in a funny kind of way.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: But on the other hand, if they had remained in Austria, they probably would have been deported very early because they were Polish born?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s59">That’s -- I guess that’s about all I know.</span> <span id="s60">I think he was a rather serious person although I don’t think he’s as serious a person as my brother has turned out to be, maybe.</span> <span id="s61">I guess that’s about all I can say unless I think of something later.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s63">Is it all right with you if we are able to use what we have about your father to represent his story as being a victim of the Holocaust to a large extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s65">I think not to a large extent, I think entirely.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So that we represent the suicide as a direct result?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Oh, absolutely, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: All right, well thank you very much.</span> <span id="s69">It’s been very useful and I appreciate your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Okay, this is a test.</span> <span id="s73">Do you want me to do more?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992.</span> <span id="s76">We’re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her parents.</span> <span id="s77">What can you tell us, let’s start with your mother, is that all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know about her childhood, anything at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s81">My mother’s name was Klara Gottfried Reif.</span> <span id="s82">G-o-t-t-f-r-i-e-d,.</span> <span id="s83">She was born in a small town in Poland, not far from Lemberg which is now called Lvov.</span> <span id="s84">She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady.</span> <span id="s85">She often said that she -- I guess she didn’t get along with her father as well as with her mother.</span> <span id="s86">She liked to run around and travel and do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s87">She spoke several languages because when she was a child, the borders kept changing and so at one point, where she was born, was part o Austria.</span> <span id="s88">I think both she and my father were actually Austrian citizens because when they were born, Poland was a part of Austria, then the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s89">She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages.</span> <span id="s90">She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I never remember whether it’s five or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you know what they spoke at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I think at home, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s93">Yeah, I think that was correct.</span> <span id="s94">My mother did a lot of traveling around.</span> <span id="s95">She used to go to Lemberg to have clothes made and so on.</span> <span id="s96">I think she went off to school at some point also.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you know what kind of school?</span> <span id="s98">Was it a Jewish school or a private school or a technical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s100">No, it was definitely not a technical school and I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s101">I have a feeling it might have been more like a finishing school or just some kind of general school.</span> <span id="s102">She definitely finished gymnasium but did not go to college but she was pretty clever.</span> <span id="s103">She was very, very good with numbers and she did a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s104">Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was young in fashion and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s105">At some point she went off to Vienna either for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s106">Somehow and I don’t know how, but she met my father.</span> <span id="s107">Ultimately they got engaged and then they got married, I think in 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: They got married in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: They got married in Vienna, well, I’m not sure about that.</span> <span id="s110">I’m not sure about that, they might have gone back to Poland to get married.</span> <span id="s111">But anyway, they lived in Vienna after they got married.</span> <span id="s112">Then in 1927, my brother was born.</span> <span id="s113">Now my mother tells me about her life in Vienna.</span> <span id="s114">She said in the beginning it was kind of hard.</span> <span id="s115">My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and retrained as a dentist and he opened his practice.</span> <span id="s116">Now one of the things my mother always told me is that we lived in Este ______, that’s the first district in Vienna.</span> <span id="s117">I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of Vienna.</span> <span id="s118">_________ Excuse me, the Este _______ is where she would have liked to live She said that the reason they lived there was because my father’s office was in our house and that’s where he saw patients.</span> <span id="s119">It was for reasons of the business that we lived there.</span> <span id="s120">We lived actually, I guess, right overlooking the Danube.</span> <span id="s121">So in the early years, she said things were difficult and she helped my father.</span> <span id="s122">She would do things like answer the phone and maybe help prep patients and various other things.</span> <span id="s123">I guess my father did pretty well fairly quickly and so things kind of perked up.</span> <span id="s124">I think things were quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s125">We had -- I know there were about six people who used to come and go in terms of “servants.”</span> <span id="s126">There was a cook who did our meals.</span> <span id="s127">My brother and I each had a governess when we were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Each?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn’t concurrent.</span> <span id="s130">There were one or two women who came in to do laundry.</span> <span id="s131">You know in those days everything was a big deal.</span> <span id="s132">I mean coming in to do the laundry was taking the sheets and boiling them up with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s133">It was kind of a big thing and then even --.</span> <span id="s134">We did actually have a vacuum cleaner and I personally remember that these two cleaning women used to come and they would roll up the rugs and take them up to the roof with these bamboo, oddly shaped paddles and beat the hell out of the rugs.</span> <span id="s135">There were these servants around and at that point I think my mother sort of became a lady of leisure.</span> <span id="s136">Again I don’t know which of these stories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the servants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well.</span> <span id="s137">I think she went and I think they did a fair amount of socializing.</span> <span id="s138">I think they went to the opera and they would go dancing and go to the theater.</span> <span id="s139">I know they went -- apparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually -- the daughter lives in New York now.</span> <span id="s140">They must have done a lot of things like that.</span> <span id="s141">I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a more -- I don’t know, a more frivolous person.</span> <span id="s142">Actually my brother apparently didn’t do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he really liked my father.</span> <span id="s143">But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he was very little.</span> <span id="s144">Then --.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Can we back up just a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A Yeah go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Do you know about her life in Poland before she moved to Vienna?</span> <span id="s148">Do you know about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life?</span> <span id="s149">Were they religious, were they orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I think her parents were orthodox.</span> <span id="s151">I don’t know that my mother really -- I mean my mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I’m not sure she really believed in any of that.</span> <span id="s152">I don’t know, she certainly had some sorts of superstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she probably went along with the things.</span> <span id="s153">I don’t think she and my father had -- we didn’t have a kosher house and we --.</span> <span id="s154">I think they did go to services on the high holidays and things like that.</span> <span id="s155">I’d be curious to know whether we -- I’m sure we ate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread?</span> <span id="s156">I don’t know what the answer is.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Was it ham on matzo?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s159">Well, I’m sure we ate ham.</span> <span id="s160">I’m absolutely sure we ate ham.</span> <span id="s161">We probably didn’t eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don’t think it was terribly compulsive.</span> <span id="s162">I think it was fairly casual.</span> <span id="s163">I have a feeling that her father was probably not very casual and I don’t know about her mother.</span> <span id="s164">I have a feeling that the mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort of retiring religious kind of person.</span> <span id="s165">I think that my mother always felt that she was considered the black sheep.</span> <span id="s166">Not by her mother, but by her father, that her father didn’t like her as well as he liked the other two kids.</span> <span id="s167">I think she thought that was because she was sort of rebellious and didn’t do the things that the other kids did.</span> <span id="s168">Definitely, my mother’s brother and sister sound like more traditional kids.</span> <span id="s169">They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same town, or nearby.</span> <span id="s170">Here was this young chick going off to Vienna and marrying strange people.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very dramatically.</span> <span id="s173">There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her relatives.</span> <span id="s174">I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went to live in Israel and whose son is in Israel and is a physician, I think.</span> <span id="s175">Of course, I lost contact after my mother died.</span> <span id="s176">I think the letter was from this guy Moshe Weinhaub.</span> <span id="s177">It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives.</span> <span id="s178">Well, they all perished in one form or another.</span> <span id="s179">Now my mother’s sister, that was the most dramatic thing.</span> <span id="s180">Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her kids into an oven and then they shot her.</span> <span id="s181">That was really a horror story.</span> <span id="s182">I think my mother’s brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a lot of people in the camp had typhoid.</span> <span id="s183">They purposely tried to contract typhoid and they did so they died of the typhoid.</span> <span id="s184">They purposely did that because they didn’t want to die in what they knew was awaiting them.</span> <span id="s185">There were just descriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know whatever happened to that letter.</span> <span id="s187">As a matter of fact, it’s really weird.</span> <span id="s188">This is my mother’s -- those two pieces of furniture are my mother’s.</span> <span id="s189">Since my mother died.</span> <span id="s190">I have not been able to find the key to this.</span> <span id="s191">Every once in a while, I try to get it open because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in there.</span> <span id="s192">I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s193">Part of me wants to know what’s behind those little doors and part of me probably doesn’t.</span> <span id="s194">But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a very, very different person after the war from what she was before.</span> <span id="s195">Although I can’t really judge that, that’s kind of a guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I made you jump.</span> <span id="s197">Now why don’t we come back to the time that she had given birth to your brother, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927.</span> <span id="s199">My brother was apparently a very serious little boy even at age two.</span> <span id="s200">My mother always told stories about how when she would go for a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want to have her read the street signs.</span> <span id="s201">What does that say, how do you spell that, what are the letters?</span> <span id="s202">And so on.</span> <span id="s203">That’s her perception.</span> <span id="s204">My brother -- I have a picture of my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox with his rear end up -- sort of off the sand so he wouldn’t get himself dirty.</span> <span id="s205">My brother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn’t allowed to be a little boy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn’t get dirty.</span> <span id="s206">I think there were a lot of interesting dynamics there.</span> <span id="s207">Then at age three, they started him on violin lessons.</span> <span id="s208">Somehow it didn’t work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher, I guess.</span> <span id="s209">Then he started again at the age five.</span> <span id="s210">Then it really took hold very well and he really did play the violin.</span> <span id="s211">If you ask him, he’ll say, well you know, I’m not -- I can’t really play very well.</span> <span id="s212">But he really plays.</span> <span id="s213">I mean for an amateur, he plays extremely well.</span> <span id="s214">Then when my father died -- well first my father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking very bad in Europe.</span> <span id="s215">I really should back up.</span> <span id="s216">Starting in 1933.</span> <span id="s217">I think things started being politically very hairy.</span> <span id="s218">People had just come out of a Depression.</span> <span id="s219">As an aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an accident because I’m seven and a half years younger than my brother.</span> <span id="s220">Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody which in retrospect seems silly.</span> <span id="s221">But actually I was over forty once when I asked my brother, was I an accident?</span> <span id="s222">My brother said, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s223">Why did they wait so long?</span> <span id="s224">Because of the Depression.</span> <span id="s225">I was born in 1934, in November and so things were --.</span> <span id="s226">Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a kid because things were not looking good.</span> <span id="s227">Did I send you the article I wrote for Boston Magazine?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: You sent me one about your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I didn’t send you one from Boston Magazine?</span> <span id="s230">I should give that to you because that’s sort of about this subject.</span> <span id="s231">Anyway, so then I was born, and then things started getting bad.</span> <span id="s232">They got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s233">My father and mother started talking about the possibility of going to America.</span> <span id="s234">Apparently my father just felt -- in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right?</span> <span id="s235">So his feeling was, how can I go to America?</span> <span id="s236">I don’t know the language; I would have to retrain.</span> <span id="s237">We would get there and we would have nothing so it just didn’t seem like a reasonable thing to do.</span> <span id="s238">But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like everybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more.</span> <span id="s239">My father got really, really, very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s240">My brother, I think my brother really still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my mother not handling that right.</span> <span id="s241">I’ve asked him about that and he says well, she used to say well you know you got to come out of this.</span> <span id="s242">You can’t walk around like this.</span> <span id="s243">She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done.</span> <span id="s244">I said to my brother, well what did you do?</span> <span id="s245">He said, well I remember standing in a dark room holding his hand, just quietly.</span> <span id="s246">Now that I’m at my present age and our kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my mother.</span> <span id="s247">How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really don’t know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it’s kind of a survival thing.</span> <span id="s248">That you’ve got to just keep doing what are your daily things because otherwise you’re going to go insane also.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know what was going on there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were happening to Jews.</span> <span id="s250">I’m sure that my father must have been extremely frightened.</span> <span id="s251">There’s a woman who actually went to medical and then dental school with my father.</span> <span id="s252">We were always friendly with that family.</span> <span id="s253">For example, that woman was forced to go out and scrub the streets and things like that.</span> <span id="s254">All sorts of demeaning things happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time psychologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A Yes, I think he did work regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever?</span> <span id="s258">He didn’t --?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s260">I think he got very depressed after he had to close his practice.</span> <span id="s261">Now I don’t know that for sure, I just know that from things that I’ve gathered.</span> <span id="s262">Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business.</span> <span id="s263">Somewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave.</span> <span id="s264">So they went and applied for visas and passports and so on.</span> <span id="s265">On the morning of September 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the house together to go pick up those passports.</span> <span id="s266">They picked up the passports and at about noontime, they parted to do separate chores.</span> <span id="s267">They were supposed to meet, I think, at the home of this cousin where they used to play cards.</span> <span id="s268">Apparently my father never got there.</span> <span id="s269">I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody telling me, there was a phone call.</span> <span id="s270">My father had been found at the bottom of a staircase.</span> <span id="s271">I’m not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on the way to the hospital or right after he got to the hospital.</span> <span id="s272">But the death certificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of fractured ribs.</span> <span id="s273">All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the top floor, the fourth floor of this -- down the stairwell.</span> <span id="s274">There was a lot of trauma around that.</span> <span id="s275">My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s276">My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s277">You know, it’s funny, children don’t ask the right questions all the time.</span> <span id="s278">I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently about that.</span> <span id="s279">I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to.</span> <span id="s280">When I was discussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I’ve never kept this a secret.</span> <span id="s281">Then a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking, well, now how do we know he committed suicide?</span> <span id="s282">People say you’re just trying to protect yourself from this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s283">First of all, I don’t have anything against this, I just don’t.</span> <span id="s284">It wouldn’t -- in general it wouldn’t bother me now.</span> <span id="s285">I keep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide.</span> <span id="s286">I suppose in one way it doesn’t bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a shirking of your responsibility.</span> <span id="s287">You know you had two kids and this was not the appropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids.</span> <span id="s288">My brother’s idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the reasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people were committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a woman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there was no husband around.</span> <span id="s289">At that time, mostly it was the men who were being really harassed, initially.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I think, well there was nobody there to see this.</span> <span id="s291">All sorts of horrible things were happening to Jews, how do we know what really happened?</span> <span id="s292">Could he have been pushed?</span> <span id="s293">I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide.</span> <span id="s294">The other thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession who has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself off a stairwell.</span> <span id="s295">That’s another reason why I think that maybe he didn’t do it himself.</span> <span id="s296">On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they’re not necessarily being totally rational.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Right, the way some people plan it out.</span> <span id="s298">This sounds like it perhaps hadn’t been contemplated f or long, this specific act if it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I don’t know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was also a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide apparently also jumped off something or other.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: But anyway, the answer is I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s302">When this happened, my mother was just totally devastated, just --.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Before we -- I hate to break your train of thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, go ahead.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Do you remember anything about her personality before this time?</span> <span id="s307">When you were very, very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No, I don’t remember very much about her except --.</span> <span id="s309">I remember a few silly things like I used to like to go into the kitchen and dry the dishes for the cook.</span> <span id="s310">The cook would stand me up on a little stool and hand me one dish at a time and I would dry it.</span> <span id="s311">I also liked to iron.</span> <span id="s312">You know in those days there was no electric iron so they had those irons that you kind of had to keep putting on the stove until they get hot.</span> <span id="s313">I used to like to iron and my mother really didn’t like me to do those things.</span> <span id="s314">I loved to do those things.</span> <span id="s315">Maybe she was already overly protective before the war, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Do you still like to iron?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, I don’t like to iron.</span> <span id="s318">I don’t mind but I don’t like to iron and I hate to dry dishes.</span> <span id="s319">As a matter of fact, I think my mother used to kid me about because then --.</span> <span id="s320">When we came to New York and she wanted to help with those things she would tease me and say you used to love to do it when I didn’t want you to.</span> <span id="s321">Now when I want you to, you don’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s322">Well, it seems to me that it’s fairly self evident that it would be that way.</span> <span id="s323">Do I remember anything else about her?</span> <span id="s324">You know, I actually remember more about my interactions with the governess and the servants.</span> <span id="s325">For example, the things I remember about the servants is that they were fun for me.</span> <span id="s326">The reasons they were fun was that they would come in and do all these routine things.</span> <span id="s327">Like we had a very long hallway because the apartment was two 7- room apartments with the wall broken down between them so there were 14 rooms.</span> <span id="s328">They all went off this long hallway.</span> <span id="s329">We had this rug, runner-rug, so they would roll that up every time they came.</span> <span id="s330">I don’t know whether it was every day or every other day or whatever.</span> <span id="s331">They would let me sit on the end of the runner.</span> <span id="s332">Then they would start rolling it, pull, roll, pull, so I’d get a ride.</span> <span id="s333">Or if they were sweeping the floor, they’d let me put my feet on the broom and sweep with me.</span> <span id="s334">Or swing me back and forth and things like that.</span> <span id="s335">Those were kind of exciting things for me and I think my governess had a cot in my room.</span> <span id="s336">I remember her being there; I remember it was kind of a probably consoling feeling that -- I don’t know whether she was there all the time or what.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t ever remember the kind of thing of being left alone.</span> <span id="s338">But then early on, I think I did get left alone at night to sleep because my brother tells me I was an absolute royal pain, that I used to scream through the nights.</span> <span id="s339">The governess would not let my mother come to me.</span> <span id="s340">I don’t really remember a lot about my mother in those days and I certainly do not remember my father.</span> <span id="s341">The funny thing is I remember my father but then one day, when I must have been about ten or something, looking at this picture of my father that my mother always had on her night table and suddenly realizing that the real memory of my father had been taken over by the memory of the picture.</span> <span id="s342">I no longer had that real memory that I had originally.</span> <span id="s343">I remember my room in Vienna and I think I remember the dining room and I certainly remember the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Do you want to describe them at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well the dining room, I seem to remember, it was kind of very formal and dark.</span> <span id="s346">It seemed dark in there.</span> <span id="s347">I don’t know whether because there were curtains drawn or something.</span> <span id="s348">We did have in New York the table that was in that dining room.</span> <span id="s349">It was a dark, probably mahogany or something, massive.</span> <span id="s350">The furniture we had in Vienna was the sort of massive thing that was popular in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s351">I just remember the big table in the middle and looking in there and it was -- just remember a sort of formal feeling.</span> <span id="s352">The kitchen was sort of light and airy; there was this white --.</span> <span id="s353">In Vienna there were no built in closets and so people had -- they were called wardrobes.</span> <span id="s354">In the kitchen there was a white lacquered big wardrobe with two doors that opened with keys, these kinds if old fashioned keys.</span> <span id="s355">I think the cook had like dish towels in there.</span> <span id="s356">One memory that became very important for Kristallnacht -- she had -- and actually I have one upstairs.</span> <span id="s357">There were these little things you could buy, pasteels they were called.</span> <span id="s358">They were sort of awful tasting things, minty or something.</span> <span id="s359">They came in either single boxes or triple boxes.</span> <span id="s360">I don’t know if they were double sized ones but they were sort of green and gold cans.</span> <span id="s361">The cook had a triple sized one of those in that white closet.</span> <span id="s362">Whenever she had extra goshen which are the equivalent of pennies she would put them into that can.</span> <span id="s363">There must have been some connection to me about that can.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t know what it could have been, maybe she bought me things with those occasionally or something.</span> <span id="s365">But anyway, there was this long hallway and I remember my room quite well.</span> <span id="s366">.</span> <span id="s367">My room had a nice window which I think overlooked the river.</span> <span id="s368">Then there was a dresser over there with a stuffed animal on it and then my crib which was not like an American crib but had -- the part that goes up and down had a mesh of sort of ropes going both ways.</span> <span id="s369">That was the way cribs were made in that time, I think.</span> <span id="s370">Then there was this cot that the governess used to maybe nap on or whatever.</span> <span id="s371">I don’t think it was a very big room but I sort of liked that room.</span> <span id="s372">Then I remember my father’s office, my father’s examining room.</span> <span id="s373">I remember the linoleum on the floor and that becomes important for later when we back to Vienna in 1963 and I recognized that.</span> <span id="s374">But anyway so then the next -- my big memory is the night of Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s375">My mother was holding me up in her arms and my brother was holding -- of course my father was dead by now -- my brother was holding on to my mother’s skirt.</span> <span id="s376">There was this loud knock on the door and my mother said who’s there and the superintendent was there.</span> <span id="s377">Now I only remember the superintendent and one other man.</span> <span id="s378">But my brother says there were actually five or six men who came.</span> <span id="s379">My mother went to open the little metal thing on the glass peephole and this guy smashed the glass with the back of a revolver.</span> <span id="s380">The superintendent said, let us in Mrs. Reif, we won’t hurt you.</span> <span id="s381">They came in and I remember being in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s382">The only really strong memory I have is of them taking that can full of coins.</span> <span id="s383">They took, they helped themselves to everything, all the radios, anything that was of any value, they took.</span> <span id="s384">Although before that, interestingly, apparently either my mother or some relative -- my father as a dentist had hunks of gold because in those days a lot of fillings were made with gold.</span> <span id="s385">Somebody went and dumped those in the bottom of the Danube.</span> <span id="s386">Whatever else was valuable in the house, these people helped themselves to.</span> <span id="s387">I do think I remember one of the guys having a radio or something in his hand.</span> <span id="s388">But the thing that I, as a little girl, felt most resentful about was that they took away this box of coins.</span> <span id="s389">They left and then I don’t remember anything else about Vienna, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s390">I think I may remember the little suit that I wore when we got on to the ship, the San Luee but I’m not sure whether I remember that or I remember a picture that we have.</span> <span id="s391">I actually have that outfit still.</span> <span id="s392">I remember one other thing.</span> <span id="s393">After Kristallnacht, somehow, I don’t know how it happened, but my mother managed to get these tickets to get on the San Luee.</span> <span id="s394">The reason we got first class passage was because you were only allowed to take, I think it was like four dollars a person, out of the country .</span> <span id="s395">My mother figured, what the hell, we might as well go first class.</span> <span id="s396">We had to pack up stuff.</span> <span id="s397">You were allowed to send things away.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Send abroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes, but there regulations and I have a feeling that some things got smuggled in.</span> <span id="s400">For example, a bunch of sterling silver flatware was in that van and I think that was strictly forbidden if I have read my history correctly.</span> <span id="s401">But anyway my mother was not very -- my mother was really devastated -- I was going to say she wasn’t very functional but she obviously managed all right.</span> <span id="s402">I think other people came and kind of had to help her do things.</span> <span id="s403">There was a -- my brother had met another boy called Irwin Kleinfeld who’s now a mathematician at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.</span> <span id="s404">Through that friendship, our parents kind of got to know his parents.</span> <span id="s405">The father was a lawyer and somehow he came and helped my mother out with various things.</span> <span id="s406">The day this enormous van pulled up in front of our building, he was there helping my mother get stuff packed into this van.</span> <span id="s407">I think my mother was not doing very well and he kind of said, take this, take that.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know who made the final decisions, I have a feeling that he made a lot of them.</span> <span id="s409">There were some really weird things in this van, just really weird.</span> <span id="s410">For example, we had one room in Vienna that was totally covered apparently in mirrors.</span> <span id="s411">It was made out of these tiles that were about eight inches wide by about fourteen inches high.</span> <span id="s412">One of the things that came out of this van, when we got it in New York three years later, was all these mirrors.</span> <span id="s413">Now what did anybody think we were going to do with these mirrors!</span> <span id="s414">So that was in there.</span> <span id="s415">Weird things, on my second birthday, I had been bought a very special doll.</span> <span id="s416">That doll arrived in New York, speaking of traumatizing kids, it was hung by the neck from the bar inside one of the wardrobes with all the clothes and so on.</span> <span id="s417">This guy, I remember that day, I remember this guy coming and I remember these things going out into this van.</span> <span id="s418">That van went to New York and it sat in a warehouse which I think was paid for by my aunt Lena or maybe we sent -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s419">Then I don’t remember that trip except for being seasick.</span> <span id="s420">Then we were sent back to Europe and we went to France.</span> <span id="s421">That’s where my memories start again.</span> <span id="s422">The first thing that happened was -- am I on track?</span> <span id="s423">-- is this the kind of stuff you want to hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Yeah, since I already have a lot of this, of the facts, do you know any of your mother’s responses to these things?</span> <span id="s425">Or her feelings -- how did she respond being in France when you --?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: The thing that I remember is that my mother -- my remembrance of my mother was that she was, to a large extent for years and years, in a state of -- I don’t know what to call it -- in a state of somebody who’s just been through a catastrophe which she had been.</span> <span id="s427">It’s just that most people seem to recover more rapidly and she just did not recover.</span> <span id="s428">She recovered effectively in that she always seemed to do the right thing to get to the next step but emotionally she never recovered.</span> <span id="s429">So my recollection of my mother through most of these years is that she was often a very sad person, it was like a lot of sighing and just this unhappy demeanor on her face, for years.</span> <span id="s430">She also, in later years, some of that lifted and she could be a real fun person sometimes.</span> <span id="s431">It was almost weird and I couldn’t even begin to go through this until very recently.</span> <span id="s432">But now I have a feeling that if somebody had somehow just let her or encouraged her, she could have been a really vibrant dazzling lady.</span> <span id="s433">Occasionally she would dance with me, not very often but occasionally.</span> <span id="s434">She was very good in later years like after I met Sam and we got married and everything.</span> <span id="s435">She was always game for anything, fly on a jet; yeah, I’ll fly on a jet.</span> <span id="s436">She didn’t have any of these hang-ups like other parents of my contemporaries.</span> <span id="s437">You know, they wouldn’t ride an escalator.</span> <span id="s438">She came, even when she was sixty, she climbed with us in Yosemite but there was always this real sadness.</span> <span id="s439">I remember once when she was already starting to get Alzheimer’s disease, she said this to me very often but this particular time I remember it very dramatically.</span> <span id="s440">She said, I’ve only had thirteen good years in my whole life and those were the first thirteen years with my father is what she was referring to.</span> <span id="s441">We were not very nice children to her.</span> <span id="s442">We were extremely hard on her for many reasons.</span> <span id="s443">First of all, my brother thought she was frivolous, I probably thought she was a little frivolous also although she was very sad and serious.</span> <span id="s444">She always seemed to be concerned about things that -- I don’t know how we got to be so lofty thinking but she always seemed to be concerned with things that we felt were not terribly important.</span> <span id="s445">One would say that there was friction because we just totally lorded it over her.</span> <span id="s446">It was really, as I think back on it now, was a very strange situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Let me flip it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">END OF SIDE A, TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Is it going now?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Now we’re on.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s452">She was very, very encouraging of our studying and doing well for ourselves but she didn’t demand enough for herself.</span> <span id="s453">I can say this in retrospect.</span> <span id="s454">For example, my brother had a room to himself in New York -- I’m skipping ahead now but -- and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s455">I shared a room with her and I did my homework in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s456">She’d come home tired from work, she would make dinner, she would clean up and then I had the audacity to tell her that she couldn’t run the water to wash the dishes while I was doing my homework.</span> <span id="s457">She went along with that!</span> <span id="s458">That was really -- in retrospect that was sort of amazing.</span> <span id="s459">She should have told me where to get off.</span> <span id="s460">She did get after me to help often and I sometimes tried to help a little but I -- it’s funny you know now, do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: You see this thing reflected in your children.</span> <span id="s463">I mean she would say, would you dry the dishes?</span> <span id="s464">I would say yes I’ll dry the dishes as soon as I finish my homework.</span> <span id="s465">Then she would say -- she couldn’t wait till I finished because she was very methodical about all the household things.</span> <span id="s466">So she would dry the dishes, so most of the time I never got to do it.</span> <span id="s467">I would have done it if she had waited but she couldn’t wait.</span> <span id="s468">Now as a parent I can sense that irritation of I want it done now and the kid wants to do it later.</span> <span id="s469">It’s just that I sort of know enough to know that if I really don’t want to do it and I want the kid to do it, you just leave it and let the kid do it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did she have any interests?</span> <span id="s471">You said she enjoyed dancing and things like that?</span> <span id="s472">You mentioned that there was opera -- did she follow anything closely?</span> <span id="s473">Have hobbies or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s475">She actually, she was fantastic with her hands.</span> <span id="s476">In Europe when she was a lady of leisure she did embroidery, that’s what ladies did.</span> <span id="s477">She did that whole thing, that’s all silk petite point.</span> <span id="s478">It took her two years to do that.</span> <span id="s479">We were such terrible kids.</span> <span id="s480">We both used to tease her about why did you spend all this time doing this really disgusting-looking scene?</span> <span id="s481">Why didn’t you at least pick some --?</span> <span id="s482">First of all, now it’s still looks like --.</span> <span id="s483">I still think why did she spend all this time doing this scene but it doesn’t look as bad as it used to look.</span> <span id="s484">Now I really appreciate the time and the energy and the devotion and the workmanship.</span> <span id="s485">There are lots of things around the house that she did.</span> <span id="s486">Later on it became things that we tried to get her to do to keep her busy.</span> <span id="s487">She didn’t know, I don’t know how she did this in Vienna.</span> <span id="s488">I think in Vienna she probably picked this up whenever she had time and then put it down and so on.</span> <span id="s489">In the time that I really knew her, she didn’t know how to relax except to read.</span> <span id="s490">She did a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s491">I’m not always sure that -- she read in a funny way.</span> <span id="s492">She did not read like an educated person.</span> <span id="s493">She read in a way that was non-analytical.</span> <span id="s494">We, the children, who both turned out to be Ph.D. scientists found this really weird.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: How do you mean non-analytical?</span> <span id="s496">Reading fiction in a non-analytical way?</span> <span id="s497">I have to defend the humanities.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Well the best way and this may even be an unfair way to say but one of the things that I remember and this had nothing to do with reading but rather with a movie, she was here baby sitting for us.</span> <span id="s499">She had seen a movie called ‘I Never Sang For My Father’.</span> <span id="s500">My husband and I were going out to see it that night.</span> <span id="s501">When we came home, almost simultaneously my husband and I said boy, what a miserable father.</span> <span id="s502">At the same moment she said, wasn’t that a miserable son?</span> <span id="s503">I’m sure it could be interpreted both ways but I think any -- if you looked at the critics which I don’t think I ever did of that movie -- I think the whole point of that movie is that here is a parent who is manipulating the son in such a way that the son’s life becomes ruined.</span> <span id="s504">My mother totally missed that, all she could see was the bad son, not being nice to the daddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: I see what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Or for example, after our kids were born, I would keep giving her books to read about child rearing.</span> <span id="s507">Every time she finished one, she’d say, ah, this is really interesting.</span> <span id="s508">This is great.</span> <span id="s509">I wish I had known about this when you were small.</span> <span id="s510">But then ten minutes later she would go and totally interact by her gut reaction rather than by what she had just read about.</span> <span id="s511">We would get into some really ridiculous arguments, she and I. Later on, after I got my Ph.D. and got a job, because she worked like a mad dog in the factories -- she had incredible pride in her work.</span> <span id="s512">She not only did what she had to do but she worked harder because she wanted everything to be just right.</span> <span id="s513">We pretty much had to insist that she retire and my brother and I each gave her money.</span> <span id="s514">Well, she never could feel comfortable with getting money from us.</span> <span id="s515">We would say look, you struggled like mad to support us.</span> <span id="s516">Did we ever complain about that?</span> <span id="s517">No, we just took the money and we lived happily ever after.</span> <span id="s518">Now it’s your turn to have a good time and retire.</span> <span id="s519">We are doing quite well, we are in no way being hurt by giving you this money.</span> <span id="s520">Why don’t you just take the money and enjoy it.</span> <span id="s521">You’ve had a really hard life, now’s the time to have a good time.</span> <span id="s522">She could never cope with that.</span> <span id="s523">Every month when the checks came, there was a struggle about whether she was going to keep these checks.</span> <span id="s524">But then also when she did retire, she was lonesome, what was she going to do with her time?</span> <span id="s525">Sam and I used to devise these projects for her to do.</span> <span id="s526">One time she said she really needed a bookcase.</span> <span id="s527">We bought her an unfinished bookcase and some varnish and shellac and the rest of it.</span> <span id="s528">We said well this ought to keep her busy for a week or two.</span> <span id="s529">We told her how to do this and so on.</span> <span id="s530">Two days later or three days later, she calls up, I finished the bookcase.</span> <span id="s531">What do you mean, you finished the bookcase.</span> <span id="s532">You have to wait at least so many hours in between.</span> <span id="s533">She said, oh I did.</span> <span id="s534">It said wait five hours so I set the alarm clock when I went to sleep and at five hours I got up and I put on the next coat and so on.</span> <span id="s535">Everything was like something she had to do.</span> <span id="s536">All right, I’ll give her something better to do so I gave her this enormous piece of rug mesh, to hook a rug which is now hanging on our wall.</span> <span id="s537">I thought well this has got to keep her busy for a while.</span> <span id="s538">After a few weeks, she came back.</span> <span id="s539">It was all finished.</span> <span id="s540">She said, you know this was really very hard.</span> <span id="s541">My hands were bleeding along the sides from working on this.</span> <span id="s542">Everything we tried to do to occupy her time in a nice way -- but on the other hand she also did very well.</span> <span id="s543">She must have gone to every free concert in New York and free plays and so on.</span> <span id="s544">She would start talking to younger people, other people found her very delightful because they didn’t have to grow up with her.</span> <span id="s545">So none of those irritations were there but it was very hard for her to make friends.</span> <span id="s546">The only people that she made friends with were other ladies like her from Vienna.</span> <span id="s547">It was hard to find those as the years went on.</span> <span id="s548">Even with those people, she was very critical and so if they did something wrong, she would get very annoyed or insulted or --.</span> <span id="s549">You were going to ask something?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Did she speak German with you and your brother or with these other people?</span> <span id="s551">Did she prefer to speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: She did speak German with them, yeah.</span> <span id="s553">She did speak German with us for a long time.</span> <span id="s554">I think in the later years, after our kids were born, she probably spoke more English.</span> <span id="s555">When we first came here, she had all these books and every night she’d come home from work, she’d be exhausted.</span> <span id="s556">She would make dinner, she would clean up, she would get into bed, she would study her English.</span> <span id="s557">She was very thorough; she had these little notebooks about this size that she would keep.</span> <span id="s558">Every night she would write down everything she spent that day in that notebook.</span> <span id="s559">She would add it up and then she would count what was in her change purse and her wallet.</span> <span id="s560">If it was off by even one cent, even if it was late at night, she would go through the whole thing as many times as it took, to balance that perfectly.</span> <span id="s561">It could not be off by one penny.</span> <span id="s562">Then funny things happened.</span> <span id="s563">One time I remember -- you know how you get into silly discussions about -- she had bought me this dress and I said it cost so much and she said no, it was so much.</span> <span id="s564">She just went and got her little thing of little books and looked it up and there it was with the date and how much it was.</span> <span id="s565">Gray dress with white stripes.</span> <span id="s566">She was really, she was almost compulsive about keeping the records.</span> <span id="s567">Every Saturday was cleaning day.</span> <span id="s568">Come heaven, hell or high water, the house got cleaned on Saturday from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s569">I got involved in that and sometimes I felt resentful about that.</span> <span id="s570">It was a gorgeous Saturday and from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon, we cleaned house -- washed the floors, everything.</span> <span id="s571">I want to go back to France, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: In France, my mother was not doing very well.</span> <span id="s574">With all the languages she could speak, she never learned to speak French because she was just so emotionally devastated and in France, when we first got to Ludern we lived in this hotel.</span> <span id="s575">There were a whole bunch of about twenty refugees who were put up at this hotel.</span> <span id="s576">She was really -- in addition to things being bad, she was upset about all sorts of minor things.</span> <span id="s577">Like in the kitchen of the hotel, there were cats and the cats were allowed to walk on the food table.</span> <span id="s578">Well, I get bothered about that also but under those circumstances --.</span> <span id="s579">She went to ask the woman who ran the hotel where is there a public bath.</span> <span id="s580">There was no bathroom, there were toilets but no bathroom in this hotel.</span> <span id="s581">The woman didn’t know.</span> <span id="s582">This blew my mother’s mind, how could she not know!</span> <span id="s583">This woman, like a lot of other French women, would put on a lot of perfume.</span> <span id="s584">My mother was always -- g-d, she must be filthy.</span> <span id="s585">I’m sure she sponged -bathed and so on but anyway -- so my mother was really bothered by things like that.</span> <span id="s586">I remember that hotel very well.</span> <span id="s587">Then after we had been there -- I had a little boyfriend whose name was Jacques Paul Berg and I just --.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: He was in the picture you sent me.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Right, and he apparently perished.</span> <span id="s590">I don’t know what that meant having a little boyfriend but I think he was just my friend.</span> <span id="s591">We played together.</span> <span id="s592">Then the other thing I remember from that time, this was really weird stuff.</span> <span id="s593">I remember there were these two girls who forced me to watch the hotel cooks kill a chicken in the back of the hotel.</span> <span id="s594">I just cried and cried, I was really upset.</span> <span id="s595">Just around the time of the San Luee reunion in 1989, I coincidentally met these two women who were the two girls.</span> <span id="s596">They said well there weren’t any other children so it must have been us.</span> <span id="s597">Yes, it sounds like the kind of thing we would have done.</span> <span id="s598">They actually, those people if you could get to interview them, it would be very interesting, because those two sisters have diametrically opposite stories about what happened in France.</span> <span id="s599">Not the facts, but the attitudes are just diametrically opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Do you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s602">First of all their unmarried last name was Isner.</span> <span id="s603">I-s-n-e-r.</span> <span id="s604">The younger one is Ruth Isner Kissinger and her husband is actually a first cousin of Henry Kissinger.</span> <span id="s605">The other is Bella and she remarried.</span> <span id="s606">I don’t remember what happened to her husband.</span> <span id="s607">She’s now Bella Isner Uhlfelder U-h-l-f-e-l-d-e-r.</span> <span id="s608">Ruth Isner is, I found her very easy to talk to.</span> <span id="s609">Actually Bella was originally easier to talk to.</span> <span id="s610">Ruth is a more reticent person but Ruth has been much more cooperative with me about collecting stuff for my book.</span> <span id="s611">Bella got mad at me for some really dodo thing at the reunion.</span> <span id="s612">Because I got up and announced that I was doing this book and she accused me of making this very emotional thing into a commercial affair.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t know but anyway I have not gotten a story from Bella but I have one from Ruth Isner.</span> <span id="s614">I think it will be very interesting to interview both of these sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Where do they live, in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah, they both live in --.</span> <span id="s617">No, she lives in New Jersey, Bella lives in, I think, the Bronx or uptown Manhattan but somewhere in the 100’s.</span> <span id="s618">Anyway, so we spend almost a year there, just short of a year.</span> <span id="s619">Then one morning the Germans came in and took the town.</span> <span id="s620">I remember that because we woke up and they were parading around.</span> <span id="s621">Shooting into the air and just being generally very noisy.</span> <span id="s622">The thing that I remember was I was a very goody-goody little girl.</span> <span id="s623">I’d always been taught, you don’t lie, you don’t this, you don’t that.</span> <span id="s624">I was told that no way was I allowed to let on that I could speak German.</span> <span id="s625">The generals, I guess, actually came and lived in the hotel so for about two weeks, we were together.</span> <span id="s626">I remember being totally -- I thought that this was really weird -- that you’re not supposed to lie but here I am and I can understand everything all these guys say.</span> <span id="s627">Every time they talk to me I’m standing there saying _________.</span> <span id="s628">My brother now tells me that one day my brother just had his heart in his mouth because one of these guys came up to me, started to talk to me and my brother saw me start to answer in German.</span> <span id="s629">He became petrified and he said at the last minute, I suddenly must have remembered, and I said _________.</span> <span id="s630">But that was a very important time in my life because there was a young German soldier there.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t really remember his face except it was a very nice face.</span> <span id="s632">He had sandy colored hair; I don’t know if I could have judged but as I think back he must have been 18 or 19.</span> <span id="s633">There was something very pleasing about this kid.</span> <span id="s634">Every morning they did these stupid maneuvers around this hotel and we would watch from our window which looked out over the side.</span> <span id="s635">This guy would throw me candies and things; my mother was always sure they were poisoned and didn’t want me to eat them but you know I didn’t get stuff like that.</span> <span id="s636">So I ate it and here I am.</span> <span id="s637">Then he ultimately gave me a little doll which I treasured for a long time.</span> <span id="s638">Now I don’t know whether this is true or not but in my mind, that soldier was unbelievably important.</span> <span id="s639">Because when I came to the United States, the kids -- well first of all kids are brutal.</span> <span id="s640">The kids were really brutal.</span> <span id="s641">First of all everybody was making fun of me because I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s642">Even some of the parents in the neighborhood in Brooklyn were not really very kindly which I find kind of shocking.</span> <span id="s643">The kids would come over t me and even the adults and say, do you hate the Germans?</span> <span id="s644">Even as a kid, I was seven, I would say no, I don’t hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s645">There are good Germans and there are bad Germans.</span> <span id="s646">The reason I was able to say that must have had to do -- probably also had to do with discussions with my brother -- but I think it had a lot to do with this soldier.</span> <span id="s647">It really wasn’t until very recently that I started thinking.</span> <span id="s648">Well was this soldier -- well I always somehow, in my life, assumed that that soldier knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s649">But recently I thought,, well, did he know?</span> <span id="s650">Maybe he didn’t know, maybe he was just being nice to me because he thought I was a cute little Catholic kid.</span> <span id="s651">But the point is, it’s irrelevant it’s what that guy represented to me, throughout my life whether it was real or not real.</span> <span id="s652">That I think was incredibly important about that particular stage.</span> <span id="s653">Then there was a lot of talk between my mother and my brother about what’s to be done.</span> <span id="s654">You can’t stay here because I don’t know how my mother managed to -- I mean my mother couldn’t even talk one word in French.</span> <span id="s655">How could she carry this ruse on for two weeks of us making believe that we couldn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s656">I don’t know how we managed to get through that.</span> <span id="s657">Apparently, according to my mother, my mother says that my brother said to her one day, I’m leaving here whether you leave or not.</span> <span id="s658">Now my brother doesn’t quite remember saying anything quite so dramatic but in the meantime apparently my brother tells me that there are meetings amongst these twenty refugees.</span> <span id="s659">As a group, they decided to get out.</span> <span id="s660">Now there was only one family, I heard about this for years, there was one family who decided not to leave.</span> <span id="s661">I never knew who that was until 1989; it was this family, these sisters.</span> <span id="s662">That was obviously the wrong move because they didn’t get out until ’46 or ’47.</span> <span id="s663">We left all our stuff in this hotel except for a couple of pairs of underwear and my brother’s violin.</span> <span id="s664">We went very late at night, I remember walking to the train station.</span> <span id="s665">It was dark and I think it was midnight.</span> <span id="s666">We went to the train station and I didn’t remember that there were 20 of us or 18 of us or whatever it was; I only remember my mother and my brother and me walking to the train station.</span> <span id="s667">We took the train.</span> <span id="s668">My brother has filled me in on the funny things that happened along the way and how we actually got across the border by -- it was just luck and a ruse.</span> <span id="s669">The next thing I remember is being in Limoges which is the town in southern France which is famous for it’s china.</span> <span id="s670">I think that first night we actually must have slept in the railroad station and I slept on a scale.</span> <span id="s671">There was a scale in the railroad station.</span> <span id="s672">Then we got put up and I thought it was just for one night but my brother says we were there for six weeks.</span> <span id="s673">You can see that my memory is distorted compared to his.</span> <span id="s674">But we got put up in the concrete bleachers of a stadium for the circus.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Yeah, you told me this, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Then ultimately some people got together and rented these two rooms.</span> <span id="s677">The rooms were each maybe about two or three times as big as this room.</span> <span id="s678">There were 30 women in the room downstairs and I think I was the only child.</span> <span id="s679">We live in there for several months and all the guys lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s680">I think my brother was the only child upstairs, the only one of the men who was a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: What did your mother do there, when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Nobody could do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: You just hung around --?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I seem to remember them being pretty busy cleaning up.</span> <span id="s685">They were always cleaning up.</span> <span id="s686">In the nighttime we had these straw sacks that we put down on the floor and we slept on.</span> <span id="s687">In the morning, we piled them up against the wall and there were these crates, like orange crates and we’d put those down as tables and chairs.</span> <span id="s688">People were always sweeping and cleaning and walking down, every morning we walked down --.</span> <span id="s689">I was allowed to get about three inches worth of milk in a coke-sized bottle.</span> <span id="s690">My mother made me share that with my brother.</span> <span id="s691">You had to walk to the store and they measured this out, walk back.</span> <span id="s692">There were always walks begging for bread in the bakery.</span> <span id="s693">That was my job, I think I told you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Right, it was cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Just last year, when I was interviewing my brother, I said to him, did anybody think how demeaning this was to me?</span> <span id="s696">My brother looked at me and he said it wasn’t demeaning, it was bread.</span> <span id="s697">I have a sign in my office that says that because it reminds me of something.</span> <span id="s698">Anyway that’s where I went to school for the first year.</span> <span id="s699">I think it was a very lonesome time for me.</span> <span id="s700">There weren’t, somehow, I don’t think I played with the other kids after school.</span> <span id="s701">They lived some place else, we were refugees which was probably not a nice thing to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Do you know about your mother?</span> <span id="s703">Did she interact with the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well she interacted with the other women.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: You know how you said, she basically began to change or whatever.</span> <span id="s706">Do you think she was in this --?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: She definitely interacted with the other women but I have a feeling that she may not have been terribly popular.</span> <span id="s708">She was emotionally a downer a lot of the time, she was always sad.</span> <span id="s709">A lot of other people -- I think that’s true of my brother also.</span> <span id="s710">When we got on the San Luee, apparently mot people -- when the ship sailed away, and the captain said all right, these people are going to be treated like all people who are on a tour, people were rejoicing and dancing and doing all these other things which my mother was not participating in.</span> <span id="s711">Which my brother, even though he was about 11 or 12 at the time, said he was really bothered that these people were being so insensitive.</span> <span id="s712">That they had left people behind in dire straits, that they had just come from being in dire straits and it was not a time to dance or sing.</span> <span id="s713">Well my adult me can see it both ways; yeah, it’s not a time to dance and sing.</span> <span id="s714">On the other hand, I can see where, if you’ve been really hurting for so long, and there’s an opportunity to do something different, then maybe it makes good mental health sense to try to take advantage of this.</span> <span id="s715">I think we spent our time on the ship rather quietly.</span> <span id="s716">I must have played with the other kids and there’s a picture that I sent you a copy of and there seemed to be quite a lot of kids though most of them, I think, were older and there were a few babies.</span> <span id="s717">In Limoges I went to school and I have a feeling that I was kind of lonesome but there was some -- I remember some really nice things.</span> <span id="s718">Like there was a carpenter who couldn’t work most of the time and he made me this wonderful little set of red and blue furniture, tables and chairs and he made upholstery things with little pieces of wallpaper and so on.</span> <span id="s719">That was a really nice thought.</span> <span id="s720">Then after a few months, two rooms next door to the two rooms we had, became available.</span> <span id="s721">I don’t know why but somehow my mother was chosen or somehow got to have the smaller of the two rooms with us.</span> <span id="s722">We didn’t have to sleep on the floor, we could put our -- they were like orange crate beds that somebody had put together.</span> <span id="s723">We could put our straw bags on those.</span> <span id="s724">That’s where I had real measles in that room and I remember that very dramatically.</span> <span id="s725">I remember for two weeks lying on my back in this room with a dark curtain drawn because I was do photophobic and watching the mold grow on the ceiling and the drips come and drip down.</span> <span id="s726">For two weeks I was lying there like that.</span> <span id="s727">The two couples who got the outer room, were two sisters married to two brothers.</span> <span id="s728">One of those brothers was almost blind and he somehow, even though I think this was illegal, he managed to find some leather.</span> <span id="s729">He would punch out those pieces of leather that you make the belts that hook onto each other.</span> <span id="s730">My brother and I would sometimes help him and I liked doing that especially because I think he used to tell us stories while we sat and work.</span> <span id="s731">We would sit at this little window and we would make these belts.</span> <span id="s732">That was kind of a pleasant thing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Is there anything else you can think of about your mother?</span> <span id="s734">Because I know, basically when we write this ID, we will stop when you get o America because that’s the Holocaust --.</span> <span id="s735">Is there anything else you can think of to fill in?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I think my mother was extremely somber in those days.</span> <span id="s737">I remember going for some long walks to try to get food and I remember those as being somber occasions.</span> <span id="s738">I may be totally wrong but I don’t remember any laughter or --.</span> <span id="s739">The only way I can present her personality really is to tell you about after we came to America because I think it must have been worse in France.</span> <span id="s740">My mother imagined herself a really aristocratic lady -- that’s the way she thought of herself.</span> <span id="s741">When my aunt Lena and -- actually it was her kids who came with her -- brought us from the boat to her house --.</span> <span id="s742">She lived in the lower East Side and I was sitting next to my mother in the back seat and my brother was sitting next to me.</span> <span id="s743">As we drove into the lower East Side with the push- carts and this sort of mass of humanity, my mother whispered, for this I’ve struggled all these years.</span> <span id="s744">I thought oh my G-d, what a terrible thing to say.</span> <span id="s745">Even though maybe I was also feeling part of that, maybe I was worried that someone was going to hear or what but she just --.</span> <span id="s746">We lived with my aunt for three months.</span> <span id="s747">My aunt got sick at one point and in retrospect we should have been really grateful for being put up.</span> <span id="s748">I think my mother really was very grateful but at the same time, when my aunt got sick and needed somebody to make her a cup of tea, my mother had no idea how to make a cup of tea because she’d been so --.</span> <span id="s749">Part of that had to be a put-up job because in France, in those two years, everybody was struggling making meals and so on.</span> <span id="s750">I think it was more maybe when she was asked to make cereal or something, she had never done that, she hadn’t a clue and so on.</span> <span id="s751">But she was a very giving person and so when we finally got an apartment after three months and I think she was earning $35 or $45 a month, something like that -- no wait a minute -- what was she earning?</span> <span id="s752">She was earning $15 a week, that’s what it was and the rent was $45 a month.</span> <span id="s753">She would buy things for us.</span> <span id="s754">Sometimes she’d even come home with a little treat for us and she was living on toast and tomatoes.</span> <span id="s755">It was all for us.</span> <span id="s756">She wore black for years and years and years; it wasn’t until -- I don’t know when it happened that she would occasionally put on something red; but for years --.</span> <span id="s757">Then there was that whole struggle of when I tried to put on something black.</span> <span id="s758">She would say there will be time enough for that, don’t wear -- if you have to wear black, put on a flower or something like that.</span> <span id="s759">She often complained about her state in life and I don’t blame her but she didn’t have any guidance.</span> <span id="s760">She could have had a fantastically better life, she could have been a fantastic bookkeeper but nobody guided her so she ended up leading her life in the factories which she hated.</span> <span id="s761">It wasn’t so much the work as it was the demeaning atmosphere.</span> <span id="s762">She felt that she was with these uneducated, boorish people who -- I think occasionally even people made passes at her which she found --.</span> <span id="s763">She was so Victorian that even when she was in the nursing home -- no it wasn’t the nursing home.</span> <span id="s764">It was when she was living in a senior citizens’ thing, when we moved her up to Brookline and she belonged to some golden age club.</span> <span id="s765">I think she was 80 by then.</span> <span id="s766">One day she called me up and it was raining and she said, some 80 -year- old man offered her a ride back to her apartment.</span> <span id="s767">I said good, did you take it?</span> <span id="s768">Who do you think I am?</span> <span id="s769">Would I take a ride with a strange man?</span> <span id="s770">So she had this image of herself, she never would have thought of getting remarried.</span> <span id="s771">She wouldn’t, the idea of, no man was allowed to touch her except my father.</span> <span id="s772">She had a terrible time getting used to America because one time she came in for a job interview or something and the boss was sitting on his chair with his feet up on the desk.</span> <span id="s773">Well, she thought that that was treating her in a terrible way or for example, when people would call her by her first name without being invited.</span> <span id="s774">In Vienna she was Frau Doctor Reif and the least she expected was to be Mrs. Reif.</span> <span id="s775">She had a lot of those -- she was just very European.</span> <span id="s776">But she also -- she adapted very well in other ways.</span> <span id="s777">She got to be really good at shopping and knowing where to get bargains.</span> <span id="s778">She was very, she was always very energetic.</span> <span id="s779">It’s just that she didn’t always channel her energy.</span> <span id="s780">Like when she went to work in New York in the morning, she would get up I think at six in the morning in order to be able to leave the house at a quarter to eight.</span> <span id="s781">During that time, she must have expended, I mean you could have built a house
