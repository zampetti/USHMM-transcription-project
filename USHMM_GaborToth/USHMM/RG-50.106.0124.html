A</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My name is George Pisik.</span> <span id="s13">I was born May 25th, 1925 in New York City.</span> <span id="s14">I was going to City College, Brooklyn College actually, in New York City when I enlisted in the army.</span> <span id="s15">Took the ASTP test, was accepted into engineering school in the army, but I had to perform 13 weeks of basic training and then I was sent to Cal Tech for engineering school.</span> <span id="s16">After the first term was over, which was December, I guess of ’44, the Battle of the Bulge occurred.</span> <span id="s17">We were closed down and we were sent to Europe as replacements.</span> <span id="s18">I was in this 13th armored division, 16th infantry battalion, assigned to half-tracks and tanks.</span> <span id="s19">And after three major campaigns, the war was winding down.</span> <span id="s20">And May 1945 we entered the place called Dachau, right outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s21">We were never told about Dachau, we were never told about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s22">We had no idea that we were getting into something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Question: Nothing in “The Stars and Stripes” or no briefings of any kind?</span> <span id="s24">A: Nothing of any kind.</span> <span id="s25">We had liberated some Canadian and U.S. Army or U.S. Air Force prisoner of war camps previous to this and we thought this was another prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s26">And when the troops and the tanks and our half-tracks entered Dachau, we couldn’t believe what we saw.</span> <span id="s27">I was a kid, I really was a naïve kid and when I saw the bodies lying around, it – it really got to me.</span> <span id="s28">Some were just thrown in the corner and some were piled in blocks of five, five going one way, five going another way, and – like cordwood.</span> <span id="s29">And they had tags attached to their toes.</span> <span id="s30">We were there – as it was getting dark that evening, we were wandering around.</span> <span id="s31">We were warned, do not feed the prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had K rations and C rations, which were almost indigestible to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s32">And these people were starving and we gave them frankfurters and beans and we almost killed them.</span> <span id="s33">We really did, their stomach couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s34">Then a young lady came up to me, who I thought was in her 30’s.</span> <span id="s35">It turned out she was 19, and through an interpreter – she kept pointing to a mezuzah that I was wearing around my neck, a little silver cylinder given to me by my grandmother … [tape break] – young lady said that she was 19 years old and that the German guards had ka – had kept her alive as she was a plaything for them.</span> <span id="s36">And they gave in – in return they kept her out of the ovens and they gave her food.</span> <span id="s37">She kept pointing to the mezuzah and I took it off and I gave it to her and I showed her and with her hairpins he pulled the shi – my – I didn't even know there was a paper in the mezuzah, it was a very small cylinder.</span> <span id="s38">She started to cry and said it was the first Hebrew that she had seen in years and years, because they had burnt everything.</span> <span id="s39">I took off the mezuzah and I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s40">She started to cry and she grabbed me around the legs and she was hysterical and – anyway, we – that was the last I saw of her.</span> <span id="s41">The army –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Was she the only woman or –</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The only woman –</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: – wa – were there large numbers –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: – the only woman I had spoken to, that I had any contact with.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: And she took me by the arm and she took me for a re – very long walk, and there were ovens, and there were some bodies in the ovens.</span> <span id="s48">And I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s49">I – I just – I mean, we weren’t prepared for this.</span> <span id="s50">Then we were called, we had to mount up, get back on our tanks and we would continue further on.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: How long do you think you were there [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Oh, I was only there maybe four or five hours –</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Four or five hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: – in Dachau, we had to keep going.</span> <span id="s55">I wrote my mother that night to tell her mother to forgive me, but I gave away the mezuzah in a concen – in a place called the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s56">And I forgot about it, I mean it took several weeks for the letter to go over and it took several more weeks for an answer to come back.</span> <span id="s57">She told me that she had told a neighbor what had occurred and that neighbor told another neighbor and before I knew it I began to receive shoeboxes full of mezuzahs.</span> <span id="s58">I must have received 50 to a hundred mezuzahs from all over New York City.</span> <span id="s59">What do you do with a hundred mezuzahs?</span> <span id="s60">We were now past the concentration camps and we – there was nobody to give them to.</span> <span id="s61">So I gave them to the chaplains and they said, some of them, they would distribute them.</span> <span id="s62">And now I still had a – a whole bunch of mezuzahs left.</span> <span id="s63">So I went to my southern soldiers, the people in my company, who were mostly from Alabama and Mississippi and Georgia – not too bright, but they were very good soldiers.</span> <span id="s64">And I gave them the mezuzahs and I told them that these were good luck charms and that if they wore these mezuzahs when th – but they were not to put them on til they got home, because then they would have endless erections.</span> <span id="s65">And they believed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: They did, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: All Jews are rich and all Jews are smart and I wouldn’t lie to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: And th-that’s how –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: I bet those were their very prized possessions, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: And not only that, but I said, if you have – if you take more than one, you should put it on the door to the entrance to your house, it will bring you very good luck.</span> <span id="s72">And to – for all I know there is still in the backwoods of Mississippi and Georgia and Alabama, there may be some mezuzahs up on the doorways.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Some good old Protestant boys that have mezuzahs on the doorways.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: And I’m sure they did have endless erections when they did get home, and that’s my story with Dachau.</span> <span id="s75">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: – had some wonderful detail about the road into Dachau and how it was towards the end of the war and they were moving so fast that the food drops couldn’t keep up with you and sta – moto – motor oil was a priority, that – that you were without [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No – oh – wi – oh no, it – w-we were with the third army and we were moving so rapidly that we had no time to have food.</span> <span id="s78">We couldn’t – we were running out of food.</span> <span id="s79">Patton says find the food wherever you can get it in the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Don’t armored units?</span> <span id="s81">I mean, they always –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, armored units.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: – prepare [indecipherable] thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Either get off the road, or get out – anyway, airplanes were dropping supplies.</span> <span id="s85">The first thing that they dropped was fuel for the tanks and ammunition.</span> <span id="s86">Then they dropped medical supplies and by this time, when we were supposed to get the food, we were running out of gas again, so they came back and they kept dropping diesel fuel or gasoline, whatever they burned.</span> <span id="s87">And we never did get th-the food that we needed, so we had to live off the countryside, which wasn’t very interesting.</span> <span id="s88">But we found food.</span> <span id="s89">We did find enough to keep going, and we went through Munich and we passed the Munich stadium with a huge swastika up on the – on the roof.</span> <span id="s90">And I remember that the company – well, the battalion commander had the tanks fire their tank guns and blow it away, which was very exciting.</span> <span id="s91">And that afternoon, late that afternoon we got into Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you go through this town Dachau, or did you approach [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, I don’t remember that, I remember going through Munich and that took awhile to get through Munich.</span> <span id="s94">And then – I don’t remember the town of Dachau at all, all I remember is going through the gates, the wooden gates that were busted open and going into the camp itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Were there other American soldiers there before you, or were you all the [indecipherable] the first tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I – there must have been, coming – cause they were coming from all directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Several directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: And I do remember that another person – it’s coming back to me, gave me a cat of nine tai – no, this girl that I gave the mezuzah to gave me a – an object wrapped in a towel, which was about eight inches long, a wooden handle, it had nine leather thongs, and stuck in the leather thongs were carpet tacks.</span> <span id="s99">And they were beaten with these things and the flesh was ripped off and some of the tacks still had pieces of flesh on the tacks.</span> <span id="s100">And I had kept that for awhile, and then I just threw it away.</span> <span id="s101">I – what the hell did I need it for?</span> <span id="s102">And that was one of the souvenirs.</span> <span id="s103">We had a German flag, which I think I still have, and it was a very sad time in my life, and ya – being 19 – 19 or 20 years old at the time, it made a very strong impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Was there any sort of counseling offered –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: – either the chaplains, was there any attempt –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: – to deal with the fact that –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: – this was a very traumatic experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: We just kept going until we – they stopped us, we were in a small town in Austria for a couple of weeks, and then they – slowly they pulled us back to – the lucky – what we called the cigarette camps, luck – Camp Lucky Strike, Camp Old Gold, and from these camps, which were right near the harbor, we waited for the ship to come to take us to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s112">Our division was scheduled to be the assault division on Honshu Island, the Japanese invasion.</span> <span id="s113">We got back to the United States, I spent that – oh, a week or so on the boat in the hospital for a leg injury.</span> <span id="s114">I was home on a recuperative leave and during the recuperative leave, they dropped the atomic bong – bomb on Hiroshima.</span> <span id="s115">That was the end of the war, and Harry Truman saved my life.</span> <span id="s116">I did not have to go to Japan, and according to the army officers when we did get to California, the life expectancy of our division was 20 minutes, and then the next wave would come in, then the following wave, and I was supposed to be in the assault wave.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: He did save your life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: So it saved – it saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And quite a few others, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Many thousands of us.</span> <span id="s123">So we were always grateful for Harry Truman for that.</span> <span id="s124">However, after going through the museum and seeing what Roosevelt didn’t do, it was very upsetting to me.</span> <span id="s125">I never really knew that he really laid back like that.</span> <span id="s126">I was not aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: There was a great, great deal known in the political and military highest circles, and very little done.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: And when I was in Israel, my daughter and I went to Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: And you take Yad Vashem added with this and it’s an unbelievable experience.</span> <span id="s131">And I wrote in the memo book downstairs that if for any reason they built concentration camps in the United States to put the Jews in it, there would be no shortage of guards and no shortage of anything, there would be many volunteers.</span> <span id="s132">And it’s unfortunate.</span> <span id="s133">So I don’t think we have learned a thing from history.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Human nature has not changed substantially, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: All you have to do is look around the world today at – almost every conflict has something to do with religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Whether it’s Arab and Muslim or Protestant and Catholic, I mean i-it – it’s all there.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Do you think that you would have been – one of the things that we ask people about is how politically cognizant they are.</span> <span id="s139">Do you think that you would be as aware of the conflicts around the world now if you had not gone through this experience, or if you did not have Jewish background upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, I am –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Has it sensitized you?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I am more sensitive to what’s going on around the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: You must remember in 1943 - 1944, there was no communications like they had today.</span> <span id="s145">I mean, you have CNN showing you what’s happening as it happens.</span> <span id="s146">We had nothing like that.</span> <span id="s147">We had a newspaper that came out days and weeks later and it was controlled by the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: So what they told us, or what we read was strictly what they wanted us to hear.</span> <span id="s150">And that’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s152">Couple – couple more questions.</span> <span id="s153">Do you remember, when you were inside Dachau, obviously there were other people from your team, your battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Do you remember any of their reactions?</span> <span id="s156">Did anybody get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s158">Many of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: The doctor, who was the battalion doctor, his name was Dr. Rosenberg, he himself became sick.</span> <span id="s161">And he tried, with what limited medical facilities he had, he tried to help these people, but there was malnutrition, there was starvation, it was sores, it was beatings, it wa – whatever.</span> <span id="s162">And he really wasn’t prepared for this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s163">He – his stuff was for gunshot wounds and things like that, it wasn’t for starving and malnutrition.</span> <span id="s164">But he was trying to come around and tell us, don’t give them franks and beans, you’ll kill them.</span> <span id="s165">But these people were starving, so we gave them biscuits and whatever canned goods we had, we had to open it for them.</span> <span id="s166">And then – it’s coming back to me, two of the, or three of the men pointed out to somebody that looked like one of them, and he was younger and healthy looking, he was one of the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: And they wanted him.</span> <span id="s169">And we –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: – we gave him the – we searched him and he was screaming, no, no, I’m – but they all claimed he was one of the brutal guards, and we – they took him into one of the barracks and they killed him with their bare hands.</span> <span id="s172">And I never went into –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: We have had – we have had other reports of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: We have had other reports of that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, I didn’t go in to check on it, but I heard the scream.</span> <span id="s177">They did it with their bare hands, they killed this guy.</span> <span id="s178">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Did you find or see other German guards laying around the premises that you think perhaps the inmates had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Many of them had changed into – from what we had heard, they changed into civilian clothes and many of them got away.</span> <span id="s181">But others that were pointed out were taken by the MPs, and what happened to them, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s182">Also, when we liberated the camp there were many, many bicycles lying around.</span> <span id="s183">And they wanted – prisoners of the – they wanted to go back to Poland, Austria, wherever they came from.</span> <span id="s184">What did we know?</span> <span id="s185">Here, take a bicycle, go home.</span> <span id="s186">And they got on their bicycles, they got as far as the gate and then they were stopped.</span> <span id="s187">They had to be interviewed, they had to be examined, you know, so they never got more than a couple of hundred yards, but we gave them all the bicycles they wanted.</span> <span id="s188">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Did you and your – the soldiers who were with you, did you discuss this in the following days?</span> <span id="s190">Did you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: First of all, many of them wore the yellow Star of David [indecipherable] Jude.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I did not see that patch downstairs.</span> <span id="s194">I mean, I saw patches but I did not see the yellow Star of David that said j-u-d – or j-u-d-e, I don’t really remember at this point.</span> <span id="s195">And they really – I told them that these were all Jewish people and that they were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s196">And these Southerners really, they were sorry to see that, you know, anybody was put – but they didn’t seem to care that they were Jewish or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Hm, so they did not understand the significance of the whole [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, yi – I’ll tell you all – I did, but they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s200">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: They did not, and again you were dealing with people who were farmers.</span> <span id="s202">Some of them could not write, barely.</span> <span id="s203">They could barely read.</span> <span id="s204">I had to tie their shoelaces for them, I had to make their necktie for them.</span> <span id="s205">But if you said to them, walk through that wall, they would walk through that wall.</span> <span id="s206">I mean, that’s what the army wanted.</span> <span id="s207">They didn’t want you to think too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So they would have been very, either historically or politically ignorant.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, we all –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: They just simply weren’t exposed.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, I was ignorant of what I was getting into and I was a hell of a lot brighter than they were.</span> <span id="s212">I mean, I had – I had one year of college, and I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s213">I was Bar Mitzvahed, I knew something about my religion.</span> <span id="s214">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Before you went overseas, I would think that you would have been at least clearly aware that Hitler’s main focus was against the Jews.</span> <span id="s216">Were you aware of that from newspapers back home, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yeah, we knew about the anti-Semitism, we knew about Crystal Night and things like that, but we had no idea there were concentration camps.</span> <span id="s218">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did you still have family, close family in Germany or Austria at the time of the war?</span> <span id="s220">A: No, I had no family in Europe whatsoever, none.</span> <span id="s221">So I had no contact over there, and … [tape break] when I came home, August of 1945, I had mezuzahs waiting for me in the house from my grandmother and from everybody else.</span> <span id="s222">It had made a big impression on a large part of the Bronx.</span> <span id="s223">And one of the souvenir – it had nothing to do with the camps, one of the souvenirs that I brought home was a swastika flag.</span> <span id="s224">And on V-E Day – no, V-J Day, when I was home on leave, my mother made a party for whoever wanted to drop in.</span> <span id="s225">And next door to us were two refugees who had left Germany, and when they saw – they came to the party and they saw the swastika and they wiped their feet on it and they spit on it.</span> <span id="s226">The next morning –</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: It was used as a doormat for the party [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yeah, it was a doormat.</span> <span id="s229">The next morning my mother didn’t know what to do with this filthy swastika, so she took it to the basement of an apartment house in the Bronx, washed in the community washing machine.</span> <span id="s230">There was no dryer.</span> <span id="s231">Not thinking, my mother put it out on the fire escape to dry and you could see it all over the Bronx, which was on Jerome Avenue and 165th Street.</span> <span id="s232">Within a half hour the police were up there knocking on the door, who’s flying the German flag?</span> <span id="s233">Thank God I was wearing my uniform with the medals, with the whole bit.</span> <span id="s234">And I said, oh my God, we had this party last night, and there was still liquor on the table and cookies out.</span> <span id="s235">At 10 o’clock in the morning I was drinking with these two Irish cops from the Bronx, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: It’s [indecipherable] everyone’s attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: – it was – was a very excite – it was a very exciting time.</span> <span id="s238">And I still have the flag.</span> <span id="s239">[tape break] I had brought home as souvenirs a Luger and a Mauser pistol, absolutely worthless to me, but they were in working condition and they were great souvenirs.</span> <span id="s240">And my mother, this nice, little, old Jewish lady who was absolutely petrified of firearms, took the pistols to an army depot where they had advertised, bring your souvenirs to us and we will deactivate them so you don’t get killed, or you don’t blow yourself up with ha – people were bringing home hand grenades.</span> <span id="s241">My mother took these pistols and had them pour hot lead into the barrel, which absolutely wiped out the pistols.</span> <span id="s242">And I had them for many years and I finally gave them to my nephew also.</span> <span id="s243">And I never really forgave her for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Lead in your pistols.</span> <span id="s245">Oh no, no, no, don’t turn off yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: When you came back to the States, you know, there’s a – a period of reentry.</span> <span id="s248">You know, you’re getting back into the – I assume you did not stay in the – in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So there’s a kind of a reentry to civilian life.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: When I came out of the service, I spent – let’s see, I came out in February and I think the next week, I went back to college.</span> <span id="s252">And from then on it was school – back to Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s253">I met my wife there and got married a few years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did you in those first four or five years feel any need to discuss your experiences in Dachau with – say with friends, with family?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Not so much with the family, but other friends of mine and relatives who were in the army, we discussed it among ourselves over and over again.</span> <span id="s256">But as far as I knew, I was the only one of my group that was actually in a working concentration camp.</span> <span id="s257">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Were people receptive?</span> <span id="s259">Did you run into people who didn’t want to hear about this because it was too terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No, they – they had heard, of course – by that time they had all heard stories, they had all seen pictures.</span> <span id="s261">They had asked me about it and I told them my side of the story, you know, what I had seen, which seemed to coincide with what they had seen, and after awhile, you know, it’s another war story and you forget about it.</span> <span id="s262">You had your life to lead and these were just war stories that we had been telling each other over and over again over the years, and pretty soon that was history.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: You kind of leave it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And then when I trying to tell my children about the Holocaust, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: – which I did over the years.</span> <span id="s267">And maybe not Hugh so much, but Susan and Sandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Was there a point in time when you became more interested in telling your children?</span> <span id="s269">For example in 1978 they did the Holocaust mini-series, which started a lot of people talking, for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I couldn’t watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I absolutely could not watch it.</span> <span id="s273">Yet, I had no problem going to the movies and watching all those crazy stories, you know, where three guys wiped out 500 tanks you know, with peanuts.</span> <span id="s274">That was okay, but the mini-series on the Holocaust, I couldn’t look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: It was real.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: It was re –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: [indecipherable] away.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: – I knew it was real, I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s280">Do you feel like that programs like that are important, though, to educate people who don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes, if people will believe it.</span> <span id="s282">You have people in politics today who are – who say to you, hey, the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s283">How can you – how can they reconcile that with the facts?</span> <span id="s284">And I’m thinking of – what’s his name, bu – Buchanan?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I mean here is a man who is an intelligent guy, he is a writer, he was an assistant to the president, and yet he said the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s287">So that’s frightening because if he says it there are tens of thousands of other people believe it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s289">There is a resurgence of Holocaust deniers right now, and I think in particular that’s why your testimony’s important.</span> <span id="s290">A lot of people will ignore testimony from survivors, but a lot of people will listen to someone that they consider trustworthy, an American and a liberator.</span> <span id="s291">And I think that’s one reason there’s been such an emphasis on getting the testimonies from liberators such as yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: In 1950 – probably 1952 or 1953, I had made a business trip that I – down south where my clients were and I went to a town, Crowley, Louisiana.</span> <span id="s293">And there is a Catholic priest there who was invited to my client’s house for lunch, and I was there and in the course of the conversation he found out that I was Jewish, he said to me, well, you know, I have to tell you that the Holocaust never happened and I’m telling my parishioners that the Holocaust never occurred.</span> <span id="s294">I said, trying to be as polite as I could, I said you’re wrong.</span> <span id="s295">I was there and I saw it.</span> <span id="s296">He said oh no, the Catholic church would never allow something like that, and therefore it never happened.</span> <span id="s297">And the Catholic church, as it did – collaborated with them in many instances.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: In many ways, in many ways [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: And who is it, Pope Pius?</span> <span id="s300">He didn’t do much to save the Jews, although he claims he opened up the Vatican to them.</span> <span id="s301">I was there and they had some little thing that they had saved X amount of Jews in the Vatican, which is probably true, but he could have done a lot more, which he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Because the story was he was afraid that if he fought Hitler they would come into the Vatican and just take it over, which they didn’t.</span> <span id="s304">They left the Vatican alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Yeah, the church as a whole collaborated, I believe.</span> <span id="s306">Did your experiences change your religious values or your religious beliefs in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I was never a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s308">I lived by the, you know, like by the 10 Commandments.</span> <span id="s309">But I was not religious.</span> <span id="s310">Two of my children were Bats Mitzvahed, one wasn’t.</span> <span id="s311">And – well, I wasn’t too upset about that.</span> <span id="s312">And I was happy that my daughter that did get married, married a Jewish guy, and it turned out to be a – a marital disaster.</span> <span id="s313">But I am now more active in federation, raising money for federation.</span> <span id="s314">I’ve been to Israel with my children, but I can’t say that it’s because of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I mean, that was over in history 48 years ago.</span> <span id="s317">And I go to services, you know, the high holidays primarily and I’m active in Jewish Federation in my community, and that’s about the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s319">Do you, either at that time in 1945, or even today, have you come up with, in your mind, some sort of understanding or explanation of how Hitler and the Nazis became so powerful, how they were so persuasive?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I guess because there was the depression and things were very difficult.</span> <span id="s321">And like today, whenever things get tough, they need a scapegoat and the scapegoat throughout history has always been the Jews.</span> <span id="s322">And they were willing to listen to him, and hey here – look at these, they have stores, and they were lawyers and they were bankers.</span> <span id="s323">Not all of them, but enough of them that were very visible, and they were very easy to go after them.</span> <span id="s324">Tha-That’s my reasoning, I don’t know if history supports my contention.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: That’s a large factor that’s usually cited in most historical analysis.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: And it will happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: What can we do?</span> <span id="s328">What can – what can be done different?</span> <span id="s329">How can we re-educate people or how can we change people?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, it has to start in school.</span> <span id="s331">They have to be educated and told what the Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s332">They have to be told what brought it on and what the outcome was.</span> <span id="s333">And I’m sorry to say that in Boca Raton, Florida, which is a rather affluent society, I have spoken to some friends – children of friends of mine, grandchildren, I should say, who go to school, Jewish kids, half of them never heard of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s334">They have no idea what the Holocaust is.</span> <span id="s335">And the non-Jewish kids have no idea what the Holocaust is.</span> <span id="s336">They don’t teach it in school that I know of.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t even think it’s in the history books.</span> <span id="s338">If it is, it’s just a paragraph.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s340">Very briefly.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And it’s nothing and it has to start at the root level, it has to start at the s – with the school system and work its way up.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What about churches and synagogues?</span> <span id="s343">Do you feel like that’s a appropriate place to address this?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Excuse me?</span> <span id="s345">Q: What about churches and synagogues, was that an appropriate forum?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I think tha – particularly the churches because the – the Jews [indecipherable] you know, are sympathetic to the Jews, and the parents should tell the children what the Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s347">But you’re going two generations now.</span> <span id="s348">My grandchildren, who live in Boston, I don’t see them that much, one is 10 and one is eight, I’m sure they have no idea what the Holocaust is.</span> <span id="s349">But when I see them in a couple of weeks, I think I will tell them again what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Good, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I don’t know if my daughter has ever told them or explained it to them, but I think she should.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Perhaps there would be some way for you to speak in the public schools in your area.</span> <span id="s353">I mean [indecipherable] –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Well, I haven’t thought of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: – consider that?</span> <span id="s356">I mean, I think that children respond to – to someone who was there in a way that they don’t respond to a textbook, you know, or to a lecture.</span> <span id="s357">And that can be a very powerful teaching tool sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I think if we could get some of the actual survivors with the tattoos on their arm, but I have seen nothing in the local papers even suggesting anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s360">To have survivors and liberators come and share together would be wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Be a terrific experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Maybe I’ll bring it up when I get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I hope so.</span> <span id="s365">That would be –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: But they have to start with the school system.</span> <span id="s367">Now, many blacks do not, as a group feel that this never happened.</span> <span id="s368">When you bring blacks through here, what is their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: I’ve only been here three days, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: I’m from Atlanta and I’m just up here on a research trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: But that would be something to ask Dr. Diorio(ph).</span> <span id="s374">It – it would be interesting to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: But I wonder if their opinions have changed, or if they believe – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Was it really hot there, or was it temperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No, it wasn’t that warm.</span> <span id="s378">It was early May, and I was wearing – no, we were wearing cotton uniforms, so it – I don’t remember the weather being any factor.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s380">Were there – were there a lot of people in your – how many people were in your unit, roughly.</span> <span id="s381">Were you 50, were you a hundred?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: In the – in the – the army, in my outfit?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: In your – in your – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Several thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And all of you liberated the camps –</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: I don’t know how many battalions came in.</span> <span id="s387">I know my battalion came in.</span> <span id="s388">Don’t forget, a – a division had like 12,000 men, and we were shooting all over the place.</span> <span id="s389">And my battalion, which was probably a thousand men, wa – I know that battalion was there and spread out throughout the whole area.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: These camps were big.</span> <span id="s392">So what I saw, other people saw in other are – in other areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: But – so your unit had a thousand men in it?</span> <span id="s394">Company D [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, Company B only had 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Okay, that – that seems like a far more manageable number.</span> <span id="s397">And in that final assault, when you were moving fast and you knew that something was going on and mail wasn’t catching up and you weren’t being dropped food, and – I mean, did you know that you were heading into something?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Oh, we – combat was pretty much over by this time because as we were squeezing the Germans, we were coming from one side and the Russians were coming from the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: And they knew it was over, so what they did was, they were giving up, they were surrendering by the hundreds, by the thousands.</span> <span id="s401">And we knew they were surrendering because the Germans had a – a unique way of surrendering.</span> <span id="s402">They threw their steel helmets away.</span> <span id="s403">If you saw a German soldier without his steel helmet, he was surrendering.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And that’s how you knew not to shoot him?</span> <span id="s405">That’s how you knew not to shoot him?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Well, they wen – they threw – the first thing they did were throw their guns away.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Because when they came out, wherever they came out like this without their steel helmet on, it wa – it was – here they were coming out by the thousands, and we didn’t know what to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And they were in bad condition themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, not bad, though –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: They – they’d been eating, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yeah, they weren’t in bad shape.</span> <span id="s413">But by this time what we were running into were kids maybe 15 - 16 - 17 years old and 60 and 70 year old older men.</span> <span id="s414">The younger ones were – were gone already, pretty much.</span> <span id="s415">And if we found SS troopers, which we did, now they were very cute.</span> <span id="s416">The SS troopers tattooed the SS insignia on their shoulder, and they were very proud of it.</span> <span id="s417">It had like a lightning bolt with the SS, and our Intelligence people said, if they’re young and they’re healthy and they got blue eyes, they got blonde hair and they look like – go look – rip their shirts off and look at the – and we found them, after Dachau.</span> <span id="s418">And we had a German company commander who asked Sergeant Goldstein and myself to take these SS troopers back to the prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s419">He said probably eight or 10 miles in the back and I want you back here in 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s420">And he said, make sure you have your side-arms with you when you take them back.</span> <span id="s421">But 20 minutes later I want you back here.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did you accept?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah, they – we were back in less than 20 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What happened to the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: They tried to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Oh, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Let them go?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Oh yeah, they’ll never – but they didn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s430">You can’t do that, that’s not – that’s against all the rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s431">You can’t shoot prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s432">But they never got to the prisoner of war camp and we were back in 20 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Do you think that your treatment of German civilians changed, or your feelings even toward German civilians changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: When we were going through some of the towns, little ole – the truth, little old ladies would aim hunting rifles out of a window and shoot.</span> <span id="s435">Fortunately they were lousy shots.</span> <span id="s436">Our orders were, do not go in after them.</span> <span id="s437">We had something called thermite grenades.</span> <span id="s438">Thermite grenades would burn through six steel helmets in 30 seconds.</span> <span id="s439">So we would take a thermite grenade and throw it into the window and just keep going.</span> <span id="s440">And within minutes that building was completely engulfed in flames.</span> <span id="s441">We never – he said, don’t get yourself involved, you’ll only – you can get hurt.</span> <span id="s442">Just burn the building down, let them take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s443">Yeah, thermite grenades, I haven’t said that word in a long time.</span> <span id="s444">Any other question?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Were you and Goldstein the only Jews in your battalion, your division?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: There weren't many more.</span> <span id="s447">There were about – in my company there were probably three Jews.</span> <span id="s448">Epstein –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: [indecipherable] in the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Epstein, Goldberg and Pisik.</span> <span id="s451">How I ended up in the infantry, I’ll never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Right, you know, Grandma raised a smarter guy, because the ASTP program was cancelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, well I know, that’s how I ended up, I figure even then the – you know, guys li – I figured I’d be in quartermaster, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Oh yeah, it just seems –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: – they dumped everybody, it seems like, in the front lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I was in – I – right out to the front lines, riding in the back of a tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How long had you been serving?</span> <span id="s459">How long had you been overseas when you got to the camp?</span> <span id="s460">It – it had been years, hadn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I was overseas February and March –</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: [indecipherable] would say?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I was overseas about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: I remember you telling me when the – the Persian Gulf parades were going on, and you said, oh, these guys sat in a desert for five months, look what we did, you know?</span> <span id="s465">So you – that was all active duty, too, it wasn’t just –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well, when we came back on this ship, we were told that our division was going to land in New York City and there’s going to be parade up Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s467">Oh, I – I mean, from a kid from New York City, we knew what a ticker tape parade was.</span> <span id="s468">And two days out they said, oh, the orders have changed, we’re going to Newport News, Virginia, no parade.</span> <span id="s469">Very upsetting.</span> <span id="s470">But there were German prisoners of war who were working the commissary at the army camp, Camp Patrick Henry in Newport News, Virginia.</span> <span id="s471">And we were told, said look fellas, be – they been here for awhile and they’re the cooks and they’re the clean up and they’re whatever, they do all the dirty work.</span> <span id="s472">So if you start anything with them, you’re going to go into the kitchen and do the dirty work.</span> <span id="s473">And we found that the German prisoners of war were doing the grass cutting, sitting on tractors with umbrellas over their head.</span> <span id="s474">Or they were working in the laundries with the American women, and we were out there busting our backsides out in the hot sun.</span> <span id="s475">And th – I’m just trying to correlate how they were treated over here and how the prisoners were treated over there.</span> <span id="s476">So you – as you know, I have no – no love for the Germans, or the German people.</span> <span id="s477">You know when I told you about Uncle Ben’s Mercedes?</span> <span id="s478">He got a new Mercedes years ago and I said, Ben, what is that little door over there, you know?</span> <span id="s479">He said, well that’s the glove compartment.</span> <span id="s480">I said, no it isn’t, that’s a microwave oven for Jewish babies.</span> <span id="s481">He got very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Didn’t you say when you were touring the camps, or when you were first going through there, what – didn’t – didn't you see, what was it, the Mercedes emblem or other – other s –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I believe and I – people told me I’m wrong, but I believe that on one of the ovens I saw the Mercedes-Benz emblem on the oven door.</span> <span id="s484">Other – have you heard that?</span> <span id="s485">Q: I haven’t heard that, but there were a number of major businesses and industries that were in that immediate area and they contracted for the slave labor force.</span> <span id="s486">So, it’s certainly possible.</span> <span id="s487">I had not heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Well, people tell me that I – I didn’t see it, because they didn’t see it, but don’t forget, in 1945, I wasn’t even sure what the – the emblem was, but I – I thought I saw the Mercedes emblem on the – on the oven doors.</span> <span id="s489">Th-They could have been, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Were the – there were no guards, just the trustees?</span> <span id="s491">I mean, there were no –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: No, many of the guards had left, but we did get a bunch of them.</span> <span id="s493">And this one group that asked for a guard, a particular guard, we gave it to them.</span> <span id="s494">We – we s – made sure he had no weapons and we threw him into the barracks with the men.</span> <span id="s495">And they – they tore him limb from limb.</span> <span id="s496">And they hardly had the strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Were there other souvenirs, so to speak, or any kind of looting going on in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Well, I told you, I had that cat o’nine tails, which I carried around with me for several weeks and then one day I looked at it and said what am I gonna do with a whip with the leather thongs with thumbtacks in it, and I just threw it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: But, if I hadn’t seen it, in my mind I still see it, with the thumbtacks with a little bit of flesh on it, on one of the tacks.</span> <span id="s501">And the handle was only about that big, and strips of leather about that big and they would just whip the prisoners with it.</span> <span id="s502">And I had the flag and I had the, you know, the bayonet I brought home, I don’t know what happened to that.</span> <span id="s503">Remember the bayonet?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Mom managed to lose it in the move, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yeah, probably.</span> <span id="s506">Any other questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You said you had a leg injury?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I had no time to bathe or change my shoes or whatever, and by the time the war was over, I had developed a very, very bad case of impetigo and oh I forgot the word that they use for the feet with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Trenchfeet?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Trenchfoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Mm-hm, trenchfoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: And when we went back to the United States, I was on sick call and they put me in the hospital, the – and they put hot compresses on my feet for a week and they painted my feet with potassium permanganate.</span> <span id="s513">Violet gentian?</span> <span id="s514">Something like that.</span> <span id="s515">And it cured it.</span> <span id="s516">And even though I really wasn’t cured, they told me that I could go home on leave, 30 day leave.</span> <span id="s517">But I could barely walk when I got on that ship.</span> <span id="s518">It was four weeks before I – I hadn’t taken my shoes off.</span> <span id="s519">Didn’t have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So you were moving that fast or that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yeah, I was scratching with the rifle butt, I was scratching my toes through the leather shoe, trying to get some relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: I would assume, too, you mentioned earlier that supplies were having a real hard ta – time keeping up with you because you were moving so fast, so that you were not necessarily getting fresh socks –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Ti – we weren’t getting nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: – when you were supposed to, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: We were getting nothing, we were living – when we came to a farmyard, my Southerners were wonderful.</span> <span id="s526">They’d run out and grab a chicken and they’d wring its neck, you know, and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s527">And then they said to me, Sarge, it’s your term – your turn to kill a chicken.</span> <span id="s528">So I took a machine gun out of the half-track, a 45 caliber machine gun and I couldn’t hit the chicken – thank God I didn’t hit the chicken with it.</span> <span id="s529">They were laughing so hard they – th-they fell down crying they were laughing so hard.</span> <span id="s530">So they killed the chicken and I did all the rest of the dirty work for them.</span> <span id="s531">I wrote their letters for them and I – I had to mother them, they couldn’t do it themselves.</span> <span id="s532">But they were great soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And the army made no effort to explain or debrief that you had – what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: No, nobody cared.</span> <span id="s535">There were millions of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Had you seen things up to that point that were incrementally as awful, and that this was just another –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Well, d-don’t forget, there is artillery shells, there was bombing.</span> <span id="s538">We saw many dead bodies –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So it’s like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: – but most of the dead bodies we saw were – were Germans, or civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: It really didn’t bother me too much.</span> <span id="s543">Hey, they were the enemy.</span> <span id="s544">That’s the idea, we were there to kill them.</span> <span id="s545">But th-the helpless families, with the children, with – I really didn't see – come to think of it, I don’t think I saw children in Dachau.</span> <span id="s546">I mean, I saw adults.</span> <span id="s547">Now, the children I know were there, I didn’t see any.</span> <span id="s548">At that stage of time they may have been all killed already.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: That’s what it most people mention, is that either they saw very, very few children or none at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I don’t remember seeing any.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Cause by that time they had already been disposed of, yeah.</span> <span id="s552">So it was clear to you coming in, having seen other battle dead, that this was something different.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: This was not like a regular war zone, this was something –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: A war zone didn’t bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: This bothered me, cause we realized what it was, we – we could see what it was, these people told us what it was.</span> <span id="s558">And it was such a complete shock.</span> <span id="s559">Nothing in my background ever could prepare me.</span> <span id="s560">It couldn’t prepare anybody for something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Could you speak Yiddish at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah, I probably spoke a little Yiddish, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: So did the prisoners try to talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: – but it wasn’t enough, it really wasn’t enough to communicate with this woman who spoke German.</span> <span id="s565">And we have, a lot of guys in the outfit could speak German, so we were able to communicate very easily.</span> <span id="s566">But – but that mezuzah business, that was the funniest thing, i-if you could call it funny, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: It’s an amazing story.</span> <span id="s568">Wasn’t – didn’t Grandma say something to the Brooklyn News, or something, and you’re even getting [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, it was – I think it got into the Bronx Home News, and that also with the – with the mezuzahs.</span> <span id="s570">Th-They’re probably still following me, trying to find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Make sure that you have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: I came back pretty quickly after.</span> <span id="s573">I was back in the United States in August.</span> <span id="s574">I got back in July.</span> <span id="s575">From May –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: From May eighth to August, were you part of military government?</span> <span id="s577">What did you do until you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: We – yeah, we were cleaning up areas, searching for soldiers, searching for arms and ammunition.</span> <span id="s579">And almost immediately we were ordered to go back to the United States and prepare to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s580">Some people went by way of India.</span> <span id="s581">We were lucky, we went back toward America and then we were supposed to go to California.</span> <span id="s582">After the bomb was dropped, I still had to report to Camp Roberts – not Camp Rob, one of the camps in California.</span> <span id="s583">And we were waiting for orders to go overseas and they never came and we were told, okay fellas, you’re going home.</span> <span id="s584">And February 14th, I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Up until you left in August, did you have opportunities to talk with German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yes, but it was strictly as a do this, and do that and you know, clean this up and it was not the man to man friendly – this was still right after the war.</span> <span id="s587">We weren't allowed to fraternize with them.</span> <span id="s588">All the hanky panky with the women and all that, that came later, I guess, after we left.</span> <span id="s589">But we were in a town with a big sawmill and we had told the Germans to start cutting two by fours, they needed it for something.</span> <span id="s590">And the guy deliberately, the foreman burnt out the motor by jamming the throttle forward instead of doing it gradually.</span> <span id="s591">And one of the boys who n – from the southern boys said, he’s doing that deliberately, because he knows he’s burning out the motor.</span> <span id="s592">So this southern boy put a pistol up to his head and said – and they got – he got the point, you do it now and you do it right or we put a bullet into you.</span> <span id="s593">Within an hour they had it changed and everything ran very smoothly.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Smoothly.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: But they could have done it all day and all night, I wouldn’t have known what they were doing wrong.</span> <span id="s596">So this is my very limited exposure with the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s598">The reason I had wondered was because a lot of liberators report that they got blanket denial from all German civilians that they had any knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Oh, I never – I never met a Nazi.</span> <span id="s600">I never met a –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: The – the German soldiers, at first they said, you know, me?</span> <span id="s603">N-Ni – Nazi, no, not me.</span> <span id="s604">Maybe him, not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you go into their homes very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yeah, we t – we went into their homes to take them over for – for barracks for ourselves.</span> <span id="s607">And one of the expressions I remember was raus(ph) the house.</span> <span id="s608">Out of the house, leave.</span> <span id="s609">And one of them said in English, where am I gonna go?</span> <span id="s610">I said after – after Dachau, I didn’t give a damn, out.</span> <span id="s611">We threw out little old ladies, we threw out grandmas, it was raining, out.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t care where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So there definitely was a change in the feeling after [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh, no problem with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">End of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s618">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s619">PAGE 35
