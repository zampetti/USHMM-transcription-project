see, we had the radio what you could rent and pay every month, four stations or something.</span> <span id="s611">And then they brought an regular one, a nice one.</span> <span id="s612">Well, that we could not keep, you know.</span> <span id="s613">We have to turn that in.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: You had to turn that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s616">Not

do -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: That’s why they took it from everybody, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: But that was true for Jews and people who were not Jewish as

id="s643">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did it have a J on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: It did.</span> <span id="s647">Is that your choice, to have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah, that was my choice, for me yeah, cause I didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s651">Because when I worked in the office still, the lawyer went through the German embassy and got a paper for me that they could not do anything to me because I was not supposed to have a J, but they didn't take it off.</span> <span id="s652">And I always had to carry that with me, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: And so that was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Uh --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: The I.D. cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah, it could be ’42, something around there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Do you remember when the

Jewish, so when they left, you know.</span> <span id="s663">And Joe and I, we went sometimes someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: But did people know that your parents were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So wouldn’t they then assume that you were Jewish, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No, I don’t know if they thought about.</span> <span id="s668">Maybe I took it off later.</span> <span id="s669">I got --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: -- don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Were you scared when the Nazis were there, when they took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: No, no I’m not the scary type, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You’re not -- you’re not the scary type?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Joe was more than I was.</span></p> <p><span

who had come into Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yeah, they did.</span> <span id="s684">Yeah, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s686">But then when the Nazis take over, something else happens, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: And where -- what’s -- what’s happening to your father?</span> <span id="s689">He -- he -- there’s no business?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: No, I mean, bef-before he’s ta --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A:

<span id="s699">Til one time, after maybe about three, four weeks, they didn’t come home, and they were sent to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And they were sent to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: And then the next day -- that was Fridays, and on Saturdays they came to pick up the wives and the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And did you know he was in Westerbork, or you didn’t know where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, we -- oh, we knew that, we heard that, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And that’s up north, and you were at Amsterdam so it’s a bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yeah, that is one of the northern --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: -- it’s a bit of a trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: -- provinces, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: So the next day they come to pick up you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: We went through someplace where everybody went, and somebody asked -- my mother said that I was a minor.</span> <span id="s712">I was

yeah.</span> <span id="s720">I don’t know if it was a Dutch guy or a German.</span> <span id="s721">And you know, they say too, if I don’t pick you up now, then somebody else will pick you up later, you know, so they let us go.</span> <span id="s722">So my mother stayed in the [indecipherable] about almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Before you -- there was another arrest.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yeah, for half a year, something, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Did you go back to your old apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p>

<span id="s745">Do you think she got money from her sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, they were already in

when your father was taken and then you were arrested, and then you were left free that you -- you ought to put your mother in hiding, or you should go in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Well, yeah, but she -- I had [indecipherable] at home, she was all ready if they came upstair -- they came up, sometimes by the people to see if the no -- people were living.</span> <span id="s753">And there’s one time for my mother, said, she is not here, and I told her, go in that closet.</span> <span id="s754">And said, no, she’s gone already, long time.</span> <span id="s755">And they were talking and talking, and she got -- later she told me she was nervous because she was afraid something would happen when sh -- they left luckily, and then she came out.</span> <span id="s756">And we told her, you know?</span> <span id="s757">But -- and she went outside sometimes too, what she shouldn’t have done, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did she look

<span id="s770">She didn’t care?</span> <span id="s771">Or it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah, well she couldn’t stay in the house all the time, she always liked to have people around and stuff like that there.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And was she wearing a Jewish star, or had she taken it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, no, she had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: So it was clear that she was Jewish if she’d go outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: But she was okay for about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: That was in October, maybe a half a year or something like that, yeah,

id="s784">Somebody must have told on us, and we both were, yeah.</span> <span id="s785">We had to go to a theater, and there were a lot of people, family too, and other people, and usually people, they were mixed marriage, we had friends, she was not Jewish, he was, they came out.</span> <span id="s786">On -- that time, nobody came out.</span> <span id="s787">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s788">So they asked, anybody here that thinks they can get free?</span> <span id="s789">[indecipherable] I said, I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s790">And my mother says, go up front.</span> <span id="s791">And she push me and then she says, yes.</span> <span id="s792">So I told him.</span> <span id="s793">I says, yeah, I said, I am born in Germany, and my parents didn’t care if I was German or not, there, and they took care of me and all that, and I have an I.D. [indecipherable] So he said okay.</span> <span id="s794">He says, you can go.</span> <span id="s795">So it was night already.</span> <span id="s796">I had to go across the street, was in a -- in a -- for children that went with people in the -- well, they went there, for children, so I had to go there.</span> <span id="s797">And somebody working in that theater, and I knew he lived across the street from Joe.</span> <span id="s798">So I told him, says, tell Joe that I come out tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s799">So next morning I came out and I walked a little and there he came with a friend.</span> <span id="s800">His mother had my dog, and you should hear that doggie.</span> <span id="s801">Everybody was looking.</span> <span id="s802">He was so happy he screamed and screamed when he saw me.</span> <span id="s803">And -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s804">But what I did, was a good thing I did get the key from the apartment.</span> <span id="s805">Found after people were taken out, the Germans came and took all the furniture out.</span> <span id="s806">Everything.</span> <span id="s807">So I told Joe, said, what are we gonna do?</span> <span id="s808">And he said, you know, I told my other neighbor, he was Jewish, his wife was not, so he -- he had no trouble and he lived on the fourth floor, but he slept in veranda [indecipherable] porch-like, in the back.</span> <span id="s809">And what they did, they took all the nice furniture, put that down with the cable, I don’t know how they did it, and up to that guy’s house.</span> <span id="s810">He helped us.</span> <span id="s811">So, and what we -- was no good, we put in the front and they picked that up.</span> <span id="s812">So lucky that I have the key.</span> <span id="s813">And then somebody find out, his mother told [indecipherable] and somebody that the neighbors downstairs has a sister and she likes to live in that house.</span> <span id="s814">Was a beautiful apartment, was all new.</span> <span id="s815">Had bathroom, now nobody had an bathroom in Holland, except if you was rich.</span> <span id="s816">And -- and she told him, and Joe said to me, listen, we have to go someplace else.</span> <span id="s817">So we found an ap --</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Let -- le-let -- let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s819">When did you actually meet Joe the first

changed.</span> <span id="s837">She said, you have to come.</span> <span id="s838">So they both came, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: And that was it.</span> <span id="s840">And how

id="s850">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: So it’s rather late that you become very close --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: -- but it -- it’s rather immediate, once that happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s856">So he’s somebody you want to lean on and call when

someone that Joe should come and pick you up, that you would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No, that was in the theater, where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Right.</span></p>

me up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Now, how --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: And we were going [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Did you feel funny leaving your mother in the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Of course, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s873">I had s -- s -- I still thought maybe, you know, that they would come home.</span> <span id="s874">I didn’t know what they were doing that time.</span> <span id="s875">They never made that public.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s879">But your mother was very clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Oh, she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: She knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A:

parents had already dogs, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s892">She -- they took care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s894">So, it’s clear that you shouldn’t stay in the apartment where you were staying, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And Joe thinks you should have --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Now, but
