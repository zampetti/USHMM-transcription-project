<span id="s24">Were they born in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I don’t know too much about my grandparents.</span> <span id="s26">They were gone before I could know too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What languages were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Was your family secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well we were religious, but not too fanatic religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Were they Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Zionist, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s35">I went to the Mizrachi for quite a number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What was the Mizrachi?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Mizrachi was like a Hebrew school, not so much a religious school, just a Hebrew school, but they practiced religion there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What events were you aware of from the mid-1930s to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, 1930, I gotta go back a little.</span> <span id="s40">Our little town was not too much recreation.</span> <span id="s41">The only things that we had was the newspaper, the radio.</span> <span id="s42">When at home and between friends, we just talked a lot of politics.</span> <span id="s43">Between ’31 and ’41 we saw coming up, the Hitlerism, and we saw coming up the Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: How’d you get your information?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Through the radio, through the newspaper.</span> <span id="s46">And then, in 1938, we saw the German Jews coming to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did you have any contact with gentiles during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Not friendly contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: If it was unfriendly, can you describe what it was like?</span> <span id="s50">In what kind of settings did you come in contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, I tell you, yesterday I talked with my daughter about it -- about those religious prayers in school.</span> <span id="s52">When I was six years old in Poland, if a gentile was dying, they want to see the priest, to bring him over to the house.</span> <span id="s53">So he rings the bell, and everybody would kneel down, on the streets.</span> <span id="s54">But I did not.</span> <span id="s55">The Jews did not.</span> <span id="s56">And this was by the school, when the priest went by.</span> <span id="s57">So since I didn’t kneel down, my good friends, the gentiles, they caught me.</span> <span id="s58">And the priest, which teached religion in the school, took a scissors and made a cross on my head.</span> <span id="s59">This hurt me so much.</span> <span id="s60">As a Jew there, you was right away the enemy of them.</span> <span id="s61">You was not a friend of them.</span> <span id="s62">He went out there, he said, “Jews!”</span> <span id="s63">And he didn’t bother if he doesn’t know you at all, or he knows you, but right away he stamped you, “You’re a Jew.’</span> <span id="s64">Whatever he could do, he done it.</span> <span id="s65">And such a thing happened.</span> <span id="s66">A lot of things.</span> <span id="s67">I went out with my wife.</span> <span id="s68">She was then my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s69">She was born in the same city.</span> <span id="s70">So this guy went by, and just kicked me a few times.</span> <span id="s71">You could do nothing, because other guys were watching you.</span> <span id="s72">I, for example, never went to a Christian house!</span> <span id="s73">Never went with them together.</span> <span id="s74">I just went to school, which was not friendly too.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Were there any other encounters with anti-Semitism besides this incident with the priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s77">For example, one instance was in the war already.</span> <span id="s78">This was 1942, they took us down where the train was waiting, to take us to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Who was “they?”</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s81">There was over there a girl with the name of Weinblatt.</span> <span id="s82">She was younger than me, she was my sister’s age, probably 15 years old.</span> <span id="s83">She saw what’s going on and she said to me, “David, what should I do?’</span> <span id="s84">She’s got a brother and a sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s85">I said, “Only one thing.</span> <span id="s86">If you could, run away.’</span> <span id="s87">There was a little -- not a mountain -- but just to cross it over, and they wouldn’t see you.</span> <span id="s88">She escaped.</span> <span id="s89">Christian guys which were watching start yelling to the Germans that the Jewish girl ran away and they went after her.</span> <span id="s90">They shot her.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Kind of shifting gears here, did you have any relatives that lived outside of your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s93">I had an uncle which lived in Berlin, Germany.</span> <span id="s94">I had a lot of relations which lived in Poland, but not in this city.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: To your knowledge, what happened to them, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: The same time when they start making those towns “Judenrein” they all were shipped away -- all of them.</span> <span id="s97">My father, my mother, my brothers and sisters, my uncles.</span> <span id="s98">All.</span> <span id="s99">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What age were you at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Twenty-one years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: How did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: We heard already on the radio, I think, the last speech from Hitler.</span> <span id="s104">Then we heard that Ribbentrop went to Russia and made that peace, so we expected it, but we didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s105">In the morning, Friday the first of September, I think it was, the second war, in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Where were you at that time, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: At home.</span> <span id="s108">And then they started bombing.</span> <span id="s109">They said that the Polish army is practicing, is making maneuvers, but after a little time, we saw it.</span> <span id="s110">They came bombing, and we saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community in which you lived at this time?</span> <span id="s112">What did the neighbors say?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Fear.</span> <span id="s114">They were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: How did life change economically and socially after the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Socially we were better off.</span> <span id="s117">Everybody started grouping together, everybody started helping each other.</span> <span id="s118">Economically it was not too good, because we didn’t have no work, no nothing.</span> <span id="s119">Economically we were bad off.</span> <span id="s120">But socially we were pretty good off.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Were there discussions about staying or fleeing your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s123">My mother wants us to flee, to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s124">People are going there, and they are living there.</span> <span id="s125">It’s all right.</span> <span id="s126">But that’s the thing, the family was together.</span> <span id="s127">I didn’t want to go away without the parents, without the kids maybe.</span> <span id="s128">Maybe we’re going to be together, and maybe five will be gone, we won’t find each other, those things.</span> <span id="s129">A few hours we were discussing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: When did the Nazi occupation occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: In our town, September 4th they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: They start scaring us.</span> <span id="s134">Soon as they came in, the first day they came in, they took a whole bunch of people to the church.</span> <span id="s135">Then they sorted out who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s136">Non-Jews they let go home, and then they shot 35 Jews.</span> <span id="s137">There, right away, a scare.</span> <span id="s138">You know this is no play.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Other than that, do you remember any other anti-Jewish measures or legislation by the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s141">They shot those people.</span> <span id="s142">And then after a few days --I had an uncle, his name was Danzinger.</span> <span id="s143">He was a barber.</span> <span id="s144">He was a man, he minded his own business.</span> <span id="s145">He didn’t tell about politics, about nothing.</span> <span id="s146">He just had his own business, and he didn’t have no kids.</span> <span id="s147">One morning they came in, took him and another guy, and that night they shot him.</span> <span id="s148">So I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s149">What was the reason?’</span> <span id="s150">One guy said to me, “David, you are asking again ’Why?’</span> <span id="s151">You should know already.</span> <span id="s152">There’s no ‘why.’</span> <span id="s153">Because he was Jewish, that’s all.”</span> <span id="s154">It is the same thing.</span> <span id="s155">They didn’t have to make any specific things against the Jews.</span> <span id="s156">They told us not to go on the sidewalk, we walked on the street.</span> <span id="s157">They made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s158">We didn’t went out.</span> <span id="s159">But was nothing.</span> <span id="s160">They’re going to have to legislate something, what you got a right or you haven’t got a right.</span> <span id="s161">We were just like nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Were you contained in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: In Miechow I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And you were there for a year, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: A year, a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And what was your knowledge of the outside world, other ghettos, mass killings, or concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: We got all the news.</span> <span id="s168">We knew everything what’s going on.</span> <span id="s169">Everything, we knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: So you were transported to a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, from this ghetto they took me to the Arbeitslager -- to a working place.</span> <span id="s172">They took us to Cracow in the airport.</span> <span id="s173">They took just the skilled people.</span> <span id="s174">So I went there and I worked in the “maintaining” over there, the car mechanics, and things like this.</span> <span id="s175">I worked over there maybe for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And then you lived at night in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s177">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span> <span id="s179">They took us out there, and we were right there.</span> <span id="s180">We lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You lived there at the airport?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Then they took us from this place to the Arbeitslager in Plaschau.</span> <span id="s183">Did you hear about Plaschau?</span> <span id="s184">In Cracow there, on Jerusalemska Street.</span> <span id="s185">It was a big concentration camp.</span> <span id="s186">From Plaschau I went to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s187">Mauthausen was in Austria .</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Let’s go back to the Cracow airport.</span> <span id="s189">About how many people were there with you, and were they all Jewish, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: All Jewish.</span> <span id="s191">300 people were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And what were conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Food?</span> <span id="s195">Or housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Poor food, poor housing, but we did not work under the Polacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And about what day and month of the year did you arrive there in Cracow at the airport?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I arrived over there in August, ’41, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Okay, same thing for Plaschau.</span> <span id="s200">How many people were there, and were they all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: In Plaschau there were a few thousand, all Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And about what month and day of the year did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: At Christmas time they took us over there.</span> <span id="s204">Christmas ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And what did you do there?</span> <span id="s206">Did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Over there was awful work, awful conditions.</span> <span id="s208">It was so big, not organized.</span> <span id="s209">It was very bad over there.</span> <span id="s210">I worked in a rock mine, digging rocks and carrying ‘em from one place to the other place.</span> <span id="s211">Conditions were very bad there.</span> <span id="s212">Very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How about the sleeping conditions and the food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Oh, they were bad, too.</span> <span id="s215">And from there, they sent me to a small camp which was very good.</span> <span id="s216">Maybe did you hear about Schindler?</span> <span id="s217">I’m reading a book about Schindler.</span> <span id="s218">He was a Czechoslovakian guy, an SS man, but he was very nice to the Jews, I got to give it to him.</span> <span id="s219">He had a place where made pots and pans.</span> <span id="s220">The camp name was N.K.F.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: The initials for the name of the camp were N.K.F?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: That was what it was known by, and which stand for something else.</span> <span id="s224">And this was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Cracow, Poland.</span> <span id="s226">Like Plaschau was a camp, and outside Plaschau they had little camps, like the airport and Schindler, the N.K. F. place, or the salt mine.</span> <span id="s227">Everything did belong to Plaschau.</span> <span id="s228">I was there, maybe, for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Tell me then about the N.K.F.</span> <span id="s230">You said you made pots and pans?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s232">Over there it was nice.</span> <span id="s233">We had enough food.</span> <span id="s234">This Schindler, he took care of this.</span> <span id="s235">He’s going to have enough food for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And about when did you arrive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I arrived there Christmas.</span> <span id="s238">In February, I went to the N.K.F. ‘42</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And then how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Till the summer of ’43, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And about how many people were there while you were there in N.K.F?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Around 600, 700.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Were they all Jewish, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: All Jewish, all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So what happened after N.K.F. then?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: This was already when they sent me to Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: About when did you arrive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: About what month, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Probably in July, ’43.</span> <span id="s251">It was very hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Till I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: And what was that like, at Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: This was an awful camp.</span> <span id="s256">This was already such an organized camp, which they kept a close eye on it.</span> <span id="s257">In other camps you just saw the commander and the rest of the SS, but Himmler used to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Himmler?</span> <span id="s259">You saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I saw him.</span> <span id="s261">All those big wheels, they came there and they kept us very efficient.</span> <span id="s262">It was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Do you remember any other names of any German officials or officers in any of these camps?</span> <span id="s264">Commandants or visitors or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: In which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah, in Plaschau I remember a Goett.</span> <span id="s268">Till now, I’m afraid of a dog.</span> <span id="s269">The worst thing was when they start counting people, to make sure nobody run away and things like this.</span> <span id="s270">One guy from our city was Cholmo.</span> <span id="s271">Was a big, big guy.</span> <span id="s272">And Goett came with two dogs, big dogs, and he told him to undress himself.</span> <span id="s273">Everybody was watching.</span> <span id="s274">And he gave the orders to the two dogs -- they tore him apart!</span> <span id="s275">They just tore him apart!</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: You saw this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I saw it!</span> <span id="s278">I was standing here.</span> <span id="s279">So this happened over there.</span> <span id="s280">Since then, I’m afraid of a dog.</span> <span id="s281">Even now, a poodle going to go by, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s282">This guy was awful!</span> <span id="s283">As a matter of fact, they caught him, they sent him back to Poland, and they hanged him in this same camp.</span> <span id="s284">Goett.</span> <span id="s285">He was awful.</span> <span id="s286">And just like he was bad, this other Schindler, he was alright.</span> <span id="s287">He was a nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Do you remember any other incidents that you witnessed with systematic killing and fatalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s290">We had a dentist in our city.</span> <span id="s291">I can’t think of his name.</span> <span id="s292">This Goett wanted from him the gold.</span> <span id="s293">As a dentist you have to have gold.</span> <span id="s294">And he didn’t have.</span> <span id="s295">So everybody present came out, and they hanged him.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s298">Everybody had to watch while they hanged him.</span> <span id="s299">I’m going back.</span> <span id="s300">I hope I won’t mix you up.</span> <span id="s301">Like in our ghetto, one day, there came two SS guys.</span> <span id="s302">They told everybody to come out.</span> <span id="s303">We knew it was no good.</span> <span id="s304">They took a good friend of mine, a woman, in the ninth month pregnant, and two old guys, and everybody else had to stay around just in a closed circle.</span> <span id="s305">They had to kneel down, and they shot them, so slow, one by one.</span> <span id="s306">You should see those faces.</span> <span id="s307">Waiting for her to be shot.</span> <span id="s308">I have seen hundreds of those incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Now we’re going to talk about the conditions in this last camp you were at.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">Like when we came there, everybody got clothes.</span> <span id="s312">They gave you a shirt and a pair of shoes, and then a few days later they gave us a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s313">They gave me a pair of lady’s shoes with high heels, and I couldn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s314">They were small.</span> <span id="s315">I couldn’t wear this.</span> <span id="s316">What could I do?</span> <span id="s317">I was wearing these clothes for a year, a whole year.</span> <span id="s318">Never washed, never changed.</span> <span id="s319">One day they came, this was after New Year’s, cold, raining and snowing there.</span> <span id="s320">They took away all the clothes.</span> <span id="s321">They’re gonna disinfect us!</span> <span id="s322">In the meantime, I fell asleep, and they gave everybody, and I didn’t have nothing!</span> <span id="s323">When I woke up, I went over there to get the clothes.</span> <span id="s324">Did they beat me up!</span> <span id="s325">They beat me up so I couldn’t sit on my butt for weeks!</span> <span id="s326">For many weeks!</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Why did they beat you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s329">I was sleeping.</span> <span id="s330">I fell asleep when they gave the clothes.</span> <span id="s331">Then I woke up and took a look that everybody got clothes, so I went to them.</span> <span id="s332">So I got a licking for it.</span> <span id="s333">In Mauthausen, we worked and we worked.</span> <span id="s334">We were living in the concentration camp, maybe 20 miles away.</span> <span id="s335">There was a train took us to the place where we would work.</span> <span id="s336">We were making airplanes.</span> <span id="s337">When we went there they were counting us, and when we came back they were counting us.</span> <span id="s338">And everybody had a number on the chest and on the pants.</span> <span id="s339">This was a metal number on the pants.</span> <span id="s340">So something happened, I lost it.</span> <span id="s341">When we came in, they checked and they saw I hadn’t got a number.</span> <span id="s342">So if I haven’t got a number, they thought right away that this fluggeflucht -- I was planning to escape.</span> <span id="s343">So what could I do?</span> <span id="s344">They called my number to come into the schreibshuber, the headquarters.</span> <span id="s345">So I came in, and the SS man was sitting on a chair, and he said to me, “Please sit down.”</span> <span id="s346">So I sat down.</span> <span id="s347">And then he starts talking nice.</span> <span id="s348">“You know, you shouldn’t lose this, because…” and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s349">He talked so gentle.</span> <span id="s350">If it was in another way, I am alert.</span> <span id="s351">He stood up and started walking back and forth.</span> <span id="s352">On the wall was a lot of whips, six, seven whips.</span> <span id="s353">And I was sitting, not thinking about it, and he took off the whip, when he was talking so nice.</span> <span id="s354">He took it off the wall and with the handle -- you know the handles are the hard part, right?</span> <span id="s355">-- with the handle he started hitting me over my head.</span> <span id="s356">It was such a surprise that I couldn’t put my hands on it.</span> <span id="s357">When I went out, you had those caps, I had to cut it open to fit on my head, so swollen was my head.</span> <span id="s358">In other ways, I was always on the alert.</span> <span id="s359">If something happened, I hid my head.</span> <span id="s360">But he talked so nice and friendly and then he started hitting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Were there any other incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I don’t like the Hungarian Jews, you know why?</span> <span id="s363">Because they didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s364">When they came there, I begged them, “If you would see an SS man start hitting you, run!</span> <span id="s365">He could kill you.”</span> <span id="s366">But they didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s367">And they killed them all.</span> <span id="s368">I begged them.</span> <span id="s369">One SS man came and he started kicking, like a soccer game, this one Hungarian Jew.</span> <span id="s370">And I said to the other ones, “Run!”</span> <span id="s371">They were standing.</span> <span id="s372">They killed five guys, just kicking them in the stomach.</span> <span id="s373">Those are the things you saw every day, day in, day out.</span> <span id="s374">Those Hungarians, I had such a rough time just to explain to them, “Listen, you see the Ss men goes here, you go over there.</span> <span id="s375">Try to avoid them.</span> <span id="s376">Be more on the alert.</span> <span id="s377">Don’t walk straight.”</span> <span id="s378">And you just couldn’t get them through.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Who were your barracks-mates and where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Barracks-mates?</span> <span id="s381">Well, we came with, let’s say, 1,000 people from Plaschau to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s382">So we all knew each other, more or less.</span> <span id="s383">And they put us all together.</span> <span id="s384">But you had in the next barrack from Spain, from France, and you had to watch even our people, too.</span> <span id="s385">Food was very little.</span> <span id="s386">But we wanted to know what’s going on, so my brother took a piece of bread, and he says, “I’m going to buy a newspaper.”</span> <span id="s387">How you going to buy it?</span> <span id="s388">The guys which did cleaning by the Germans, they stole a newspaper and came in the camp and sold it for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s389">So my brother gave him a piece of bread and he gave him a paper.</span> <span id="s390">Then, when we came in the camp, we took a look in the paper -- it’s a French paper -- and we can’t read it anyway.</span> <span id="s391">This was a disaster.</span> <span id="s392">You give away a piece of bread, which you got once a week.</span> <span id="s393">So my brother went to the French guys and asked them if they want to buy a French paper.</span> <span id="s394">So one French guy, he went and told the SS man, and they start looking for my brother, but we all looked the same, he couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s395">After we were liberated, I found this guy.</span> <span id="s396">I didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s397">I just told him it’s not nice to do things like this.</span> <span id="s398">He apologized.</span> <span id="s399">It was such a daily thing that we didn’t thought too much of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What kind of people were in camp?</span> <span id="s401">Were they all Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, in Mauthausen, we had all the nations.</span> <span id="s403">Even in our barracks, we had the Yugoslavs, Czechs, Spain, French, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: What kind of religions were they?</span> <span id="s405">Were there gypsies in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: We had gypsies too.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How about Jehovah Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No, I didn’t know that such a religious exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How about baptized Jews, Jews who had been baptized in Christianity?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: One guy.</span> <span id="s411">One guy I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: How about Soviet prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: We had Russians, not prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s414">I was not with the prisoners, but I was with the Russians which they took to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: How about Homosexuals?</span> <span id="s416">Were there any?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, I didn’t notice over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did you have any contact with relatives or friends while you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: With friends, but no relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Was there a means of communicating throughout the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: In the camp?</span> <span id="s422">Yeah.</span> <span id="s423">We knew everything, everything what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How about the war effort?</span> <span id="s425">You said you tried to get a newspaper.</span> <span id="s426">Did you know anything about the war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: We knowed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: How’d you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: We did it like I told you.</span> <span id="s430">These guys came in contact with the Germans, let’s say they clean the house, so they stole a newspaper or they would read a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: You mentioned some of the major German personnel at the camps.</span> <span id="s432">Can you think of any other names of German personnel at the camps that we haven’t mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Can you recall any specific units of the German army or Nazi police that you came in contact with while you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Not me.</span> <span id="s436">We didn’t found nobody, just the SS.</span> <span id="s437">Once we saw the Russians, the Ukraine uniform.</span> <span id="s438">Ukrainia was just a volunteer to the German SS they were stationed over there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: They had volunteered for the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: When you were in the camps, what thought did you give to your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: I had such a little time to think, and never came to my mind that I gonna die.</span> <span id="s443">Like I told you, I was together with my brother, we were dreaming, dreaming always, we’re going to get liberated, we’re gonna have a lot of food.</span> <span id="s444">My brother said, “David, you’re gonna see.</span> <span id="s445">They’re gonna be a lot of people which gonna see their freedom and won’t be able to enjoy the freedom.”</span> <span id="s446">And I says, “Well, don’t talk those things.”</span> <span id="s447">And he survived and he died a month after the war!</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: What did he die from?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: When we came out, we were so hungry, we ate everything.</span> <span id="s450">I ate just bread and things like that, but he got a can of food, and he spoiled his stomach and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Where were you liberated, and what was the date, as near as you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I was liberated May 5, ’45.</span> <span id="s453">April 15, they took us from Mauthausen to the woods, which surrounded us.</span> <span id="s454">We just walked, and they didn’t give us any food, any water or nothing.</span> <span id="s455">No food or water, no place to sleep, no nothing.</span> <span id="s456">And we were there till May 5th.</span> <span id="s457">May 5th we were liberated in Wels.</span> <span id="s458">They took us from Mauthausen out in the woods, and when they liberated us from the woods, we came to the nearest city, and Wels was the nearest city.</span> <span id="s459">In Austria.</span> <span id="s460">In the woods, we went for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: So from Mauthausen you went to Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s462">And from there you went to Wels.</span> <span id="s463">Did you have indication while you were going through the woods, and to these two villages, that the war was about over?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yeah, we know it already.</span> <span id="s465">We heard already the shelling.</span> <span id="s466">And the SS were talking to us, “Now we’re going to kill all of you.”</span> <span id="s467">‘Cause they were on edge and they were angry at us, so they said, “You just wait a few days, and you’re all gonna be dead.”</span> <span id="s468">When we arrived over there in the woods they surrounded us, and there we are.</span> <span id="s469">You could see piles, mountains of dead people.</span> <span id="s470">And we had to pile them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And who liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: The Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s474">What do you recall about the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: It’s pretty hard to describe now.</span> <span id="s476">Suddenly you see people talking to you.</span> <span id="s477">You walk, they gonna kick you?</span> <span id="s478">You start thinking, is it a dream or is it true?</span> <span id="s479">We couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s480">Suddenly they are bringing food, as much as we wanted.</span> <span id="s481">This was the only one dream, just the only one dream what we had, is to have food, to be able to eat, to leave a little bit.</span> <span id="s482">(Laughs) Probably people would laugh if they heard this.</span> <span id="s483">When I was liberated, I was eating day and night.</span> <span id="s484">I mean it.</span> <span id="s485">Just took a whole bread, started eating.</span> <span id="s486">I was sore, already, from eating.</span> <span id="s487">I ate and I ate, and I didn’t have no feeling when it’s enough.</span> <span id="s488">I didn’t have no taste, like is it salty or is it sweet, didn’t have no taste at all.</span> <span id="s489">Just the knowledge that I am hungry, and you never know, maybe tomorrow I won’t have, at least I want to eat up now.</span> <span id="s490">We ate and ate and ate.</span> <span id="s491">We didn’t know how to stop.</span> <span id="s492">How long could you eat?</span> <span id="s493">I bet I ate for two, three days, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Where were you staying all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: In Wels they had a warehouse and they make from this warehouse a camp.</span> <span id="s496">So everybody which was liberated and came over there, they have right away where to sleep, where to eat, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: How long were you there in this warehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I was there for a few months.</span> <span id="s499">And then I thought looking, I’d find somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s502">Everybody died.</span> <span id="s503">Couldn’t find nobody.</span> <span id="s504">Didn’t have nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So did you have any thoughts about returning to your pre-war home?</span> <span id="s506">Or what happened to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I didn’t wanna go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: So did you stay in a Displaced Persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, I didn’t wanna stay in a camp.</span> <span id="s510">I had enough camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Did you want to look for work?</span> <span id="s512">What were you thinking about then?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: I started looking for my wife, she was my girlfriend then.</span> <span id="s514">And I found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Where did you find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I found her in Germany, in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s517">Then I got married there.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And from there you went to…</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Munchberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What did you do in Munchberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Over there we had such a community, a small community, which we lived together, very friendly.</span> <span id="s522">And we were waiting to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s523">I got married in ’46.</span> <span id="s524">In ’47 I had my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What kind of work were you doing in Munchberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s527">My wife was a photographer.</span> <span id="s528">She worked there.</span> <span id="s529">My son was one year old, and then suddenly I come up with tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: ’48.</span> <span id="s532">So I went to a sanitarium.</span> <span id="s533">I was there for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Do you think that this was a result of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s536">After two years I got out and in ’51 I came here to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And were you aided by any organization coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yeah, by the HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you have any idea where you would go in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s541">They made not everybody together.</span> <span id="s542">If they would say, you wanna go to the United States, all what we know about was New York, everybody will stay in New York.</span> <span id="s543">So they made it like 100 people goes to St. Paul, and 100 people goes to Chicago.</span> <span id="s544">They said to me, “Your place is going to be St. Paul.”</span> <span id="s545">And I didn’t have no idea what St. Paul is, if it’s a city or anything.</span> <span id="s546">I came here in the wintertime and it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What did you do here then?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: When I came here I went to a factory place, to Sears.</span> <span id="s549">They made frigidaires.</span> <span id="s550">I saw there’s not too much future for it, so I went to school and I learned welding.</span> <span id="s551">Then I got a job at Braniff Airway.</span> <span id="s552">And then I got a job in Remley Engineering, a good job as a welder, and I worked over there till now.</span> <span id="s553">Last year I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: You became a member of the Jewish community here, then, in St. Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Do you maintain contact with other survivors or are you in any survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I’m in the Holocaust organization.</span> <span id="s558">We still call ourselves “newcomers” after 30 years.</span> <span id="s559">We all stick together very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s562">There are mixed feelings about it.</span> <span id="s563">It depends on how your mood is.</span> <span id="s564">Sometimes the mood is up, it’s so nice.</span> <span id="s565">I’m happy I survived.</span> <span id="s566">Sometimes, if you’re mood is down, you hate yourself why you survived.</span> <span id="s567">Feeling not a deserter away from home, but like I sneaked out.</span> <span id="s568">I didn’t have nothing to do with it, but my whole family got killed and how come I am here?</span> <span id="s569">We didn’t want to be apart, and suddenly you’d be apart.</span> <span id="s570">Sometimes I feel like I am really not a survivor.</span> <span id="s571">You know why?</span> <span id="s572">A lot of times came to my mind, like 100 Germans took 10,000 Jews, we could kill them all in no time at all.</span> <span id="s573">If every Jew would kill one German, they would be in trouble.</span> <span id="s574">Such a thing comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s575">I sometimes feel guilty because I did not survive properly.</span> <span id="s576">I didn’t do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Have you ever talked to other survivors about this feeling?</span> <span id="s578">What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I talked with one guy in Los Angeles about it, and he had the same feeling.</span> <span id="s580">3,000,000 people perished.</span> <span id="s581">If every one Jew would say I gonna kill one German, that’s all.</span> <span id="s582">We know that we’re gonna be dead anyway, but I don’t know whether it was a fear, or like they say, the skin is closer than your shirt.</span> <span id="s583">You were afraid.</span> <span id="s584">Maybe I will survive.</span> <span id="s585">This way, maybe, I might survive.</span> <span id="s586">Then a thousand guys, you let 15 or 20 Germans take you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Based on your experience in the Holocaust, do you think your feelings about human nature, non-Jews and Germans has changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: A little bit has mellowed.</span> <span id="s589">A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: How about your belief and practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being?</span> <span id="s591">Has that changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s593">I believe I am a Jew and I’m doing just what I want to do about it, not so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Would you be willing to share with us any photos, mementos, or other things for the purpose of exhibition or research?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Good, great.</span> <span id="s597">So we can contact you about that.</span> <span id="s598">Have you seen any movies or read any books about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s599">And do you think that these tell the story the way it really happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Not enough.</span> <span id="s601">Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Do you remember anything recently you saw on the Holocaust that was on T.V. or in the movie theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: About the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s604">We didn’t have any movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Well there have been things on T.V. within the last few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: The most what shows this is the newsreel.</span> <span id="s607">The news right after the war when they liberated the camps, you could see that that is true.</span> <span id="s608">That’s the truest thing.</span> <span id="s609">The other things show just very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Is there anything you’d like to add before we wrap this thing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I probably will remember when you’re gone.</span> <span id="s612">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: This concludes the
