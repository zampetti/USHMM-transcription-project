Could you give me your full name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Answer: My name is Renate Rosemarie Fischer Chernoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: And where were your born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was born on June 25th, 1929, in Breslau, Germany.</span> <span id="s8">Germ -- Breslau is now Polish, but it was German at that point in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family background.</span> <span id="s10">How far back did your family go in Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My family actually went very far back, I would say.</span> <span id="s12">I have records to -- o-of graves having been erected in -- just right after the Napoleonic war, the Franco-Prussian War.</span> <span id="s13">And of all strange things, one of the graves that may have survived all the fighting in that area is still standing today.</span> <span id="s14">I managed to get a picture of it just very recently on the web.</span> <span id="s15">And we were very excited to see that gravestone.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What -- what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My father was Walter James Fischer.</span> <span id="s18">He was a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s19">He went to school in his native town of Breslau where most of my forebears were born.</span> <span id="s20">He was -- is the professional person in his family.</span> <span id="s21">His parents were merchants, they had a wonderful -- probably the largest toyshop in all of Silesia, and he chose not to go into that kind of work, perhaps because he was in the army in -- in the first World War, and fought in France, fought in Verdun, came back and -- and at that point he was only 16 or 18 years old.</span> <span id="s22">And came back totally paralyzed by what he had seen; he was a litter bearer in the field, and decided that medicine would be his calling.</span> <span id="s23">S -- my grandmother and grandfather had the shop, both of them worked.</span> <span id="s24">My grandmother worked alongside her husband and so did her sister and his brother.</span> <span id="s25">They were two brothers married to two sisters, and so it was definitely a family affair.</span> <span id="s26">And their parents, my great-grandparents were also in Breslau.</span> <span id="s27">What they did I’m really not sure, but in -- in business of some sort.</span> <span id="s28">The business, interestingly enough -- the house where the business was housed is standing today in the very same place, it was one of the few buildings that survived the second World War.</span> <span id="s29">It was on the rink, the main square of the city of Breslau, right opposite the court buildings.</span> <span id="s30">It’s number 26 on -- number 36, excuse me, on the rink.</span> <span id="s31">And I have seen reproductions of that area, or photographs of that area and sure enough, it’s still there.</span> <span id="s32">The Poles have really taken a great deal of trouble to try to rebuild that area as it was, and I think s -- handled it very successfully.</span> <span id="s33">My forbearers on my mother’s side were from Birnbaum, which is really on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s34">What -- my grandfather on my mother’s side was in the canning business, and was the first canner who did diabetic fruits in Germany, canned diabetic fruits.</span> <span id="s35">And had the factory just outside of Breslau and so my mother grew up really in the country, in this -- it’s suburban now, but it was really country when she grew up, and that she loved.</span> <span id="s36">And she did go to school in Breslau, but the rest of the time she was a country girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And was she a housewife?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Actually, she was, although she went to high school and upon graduating from high school went to a sort of a finishing school for girls and studied music.</span> <span id="s39">She had a magnificent voice, and was very nicely trained, and sang eventually professionally, in part, but always sang for the high holidays at synagogue.</span> <span id="s40">And in fact, I came across a letter just the other day, the head of the synagogue in Ratibor, which was one of the places where we lived, thanked her for making the service so beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: In talking about the synagogue, can you tell a little bit about how religious your family was?</span> <span id="s42">A: My grandparents on both sides were fairly religious.</span> <span id="s43">My father was pretty much of a free thinker.</span> <span id="s44">My mother was more religious than he, but I think both of them became very, very much more religious when we crossed over to this side of the ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s46">Did you, as a small child, remember celebrating any holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh yes, we always celebrated holidays and I particularly remember Sukkot in the synagogue in Ratibor, which is the little town that I really remember best of all.</span> <span id="s48">It was in the -- in Upper Silesia, which was a number of hours by train from Breslau going towards the Czech border and the Polish border, we were sort of in a -- very close, within walking distance of the Polish border, because I remember walking with my mother to have buttermilk on the Polish side of the border because the farmer -- that farmer’s buttermilk was by all means the very best, and so we walked across wheat fields and over the border to get our buttermilk.</span> <span id="s49">Very nice memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: So did you celebrate Shabbat, did you go to synagogue?</span> <span id="s51">A: We celebrated Shabbat, my mother kindled candles.</span> <span id="s52">We celebrated Passover, but mostly we celebrated our Passovers, and I have very vivid memories with very dear friends who were Orthodox, I believe.</span> <span id="s53">And we s -- I went to services on Saturday mornings, not with my parents, but with a friend of theirs who took me not only to synagogue on Saturday mornings, but took me out for a krimmelhelmchen which was a poppy seed roll o-on our way home.</span> <span id="s54">And that made a great impression on me.</span> <span id="s55">But my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I think all of them were really liberal Jews rather than Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s56">I think tha-that it was not named Conservative, I think that branch of Jewry in Germany was called the liberal branch and we went to synagogue there rather than the Orthodox synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Were your parents very politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: They had very strong opinions.</span> <span id="s59">Active, I wouldn’t say, no.</span> <span id="s60">Ma -- I think my father’s days were so full with his -- with his work, and with work for the courts.</span> <span id="s61">He was very often asked to be the s -- the psychiatrist who gave opinions in court cases.</span> <span id="s62">And they were very active at their lodge, the B’nai Brith lodge.</span> <span id="s63">That I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let’s just get a sense of a structure here with how long you lived where.</span> <span id="s65">Y-You said you were born in Breslau, and how long did you live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: All right.</span> <span id="s67">We were born -- I was born in Breslau.</span> <span id="s68">When my father w -- a-already was working in a suburban area -- area called Obernigk.</span> <span id="s69">O-b-e-r-n-i-g-k, I think.</span> <span id="s70">It was a suburb of Breslau and had a large psychiatric hospital in it.</span> <span id="s71">And there he had his job and there we lived.</span> <span id="s72">Now, I was very little and really have no memories other than picture memories of that place.</span> <span id="s73">It was the same town that my grandparents had the canning factory in, so this all worked out very nicely in that respect.</span> <span id="s74">We moved, I believe it was 1934 to Ratibor, R-a-t-i-b-o-r, it is now also in Polish hands and has changed its name just a little.</span> <span id="s75">And I think when we moved we -- I was i -- going into nursery kindergarten, and I went to the school of the Ursuline sisters and I loved my time there.</span> <span id="s76">They were so good to us, and they -- I learned so many little skills, and I even still have the little needle book that I embroidered for my mother, my first timid effort at working with fibers, and it was very precious to my mother, and a little moth-eaten but I still have it.</span> <span id="s77">And we moved into our first house and we rented an apartment on Svingerstrasser 17 and within a month or two we were asked to leave because we were unwanted.</span> <span id="s78">The owner of the house didn’t realize that somebody with the name of Fischer could be Jewish.</span> <span id="s79">And so we moved and found a very nice apartment on number 23 Svingerstrasser, and I have very vivid memories of it, I could draw the plan of the apartment.</span> <span id="s80">It was a first floor walk-up, very large apartment and my father was able to have his practice right in our apartment.</span> <span id="s81">The first room was very large, with -- I can’t think of the English word for the moment.</span> <span id="s82">It’s a-a-an [indecipherable] a a no -- a no -- a knockout, a glass knockout so that one could really watch the street up and down and see what’s going on and it was an up -- first floor, upstairs, and large.</span> <span id="s83">And then the room next to us was the waiting room.</span> <span id="s84">And during the day it was the waiting room for the patients and in the evening it was the gentlemen’s room to have cigarettes.</span> <span id="s85">And as we walked down the corridor, there was a kitchen to the left in which Maria, our very dear domestic help who lived with us, did her thing.</span> <span id="s86">And then further down, of course, was the dining room and the living room and my bedroom and my parent’s room.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So you were an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: I -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: My mother always said Mr. Hitler saw to it that I was an only child.</span> <span id="s91">They would -- they were ready to have a rather lar -- and had hoped for a rather large family.</span> <span id="s92">However, I did acquire a brother a little later on, but that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Were either of your parents artistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: My mother sang very beautifully and my father always thought that he might have, if he had not become a physician he might have become an architect.</span> <span id="s95">So I think yes, I would say so.</span> <span id="s96">They both had extremely fine taste in things that they chose to buy, and yeah, I would s -- and my mother’s singing, of course, was quite -- quite remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What languages did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: German only.</span> <span id="s99">My mother knew some French and my father studied Greek and Latin in school, and -- but of course it was the reading language of Greek and Latin, I don’t know that he spoke it, other than memorized poetry.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Was it a mixed neighborhood -- we’re now talking about Ratibor because you said you didn’t really remember before that, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Yeah, so can you -- was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, it was definitely a mixed -- a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s104">I don’t think that Ratibor had a specifically Jewish area, I think we were all very well here and there.</span> <span id="s105">I-I cannot think of -- of a Jewish neighborhood, per se.</span> <span id="s106">The neighborhood where we lived was -- was a nicely treed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s107">It was a main street, and yet it had trees on it and in the back of our house was a -- every apartment had its own little garden, and so we raised strawberries.</span> <span id="s108">It was a small garden, but we raised strawberries and flowers and there was a little house on the garden, in the back of the garden, big enough to have a table and maybe six or eight chairs and I know my mother’s book club met there in the summertime.</span> <span id="s109">And of course, I loved playing in the garden.</span> <span id="s110">And I had a nanny who made sure that I learned how to grow things and to weed, and to take care of flowers and who was really my steady companion after I came home from school each day.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So did you play with any of the other chil-children in the neighborhood or just with your nanny after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: You know, it was easy, it was -- well, not -- perhaps not the children in my neighborhood because across from our house were the courts, the courts of that part of the province.</span> <span id="s113">So there were not that many houses that had children in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You’re talking about judicial courts, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Judicial courts.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: -- not courtyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, no, no, no, judicial courts.</span> <span id="s118">But one usually made appointments with one’s friends and after school they could come to my house and it was always -- I always had a lot of little friends who came over and whose company I enjoyed and whose homes I went to as well.</span> <span id="s119">Not for very long, but for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s121">Were these Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: We had -- I had very close Jewish and non-Jewish friends, and I was very fortunate enough to have the non-Jewish friends because some of them were really lovely children with whom I enjoyed being together.</span> <span id="s123">And we were together really, until the time when it was no longer allowed that these little girls, particularly, could come and visit me.</span> <span id="s124">My very dearest friend was a young girl by the name of Ushi Blaut, whose father was an architect for the city, and who was threatened to lose his job if his little girl came and played with me.</span> <span id="s125">And I think maybe that was the first awakening that things were very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: That was your first awakening.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: My first awakening.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And -- and what was -- do you remember -- granted, you were very young, but do you remember any thoughts you had at that time, or what that meant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: It meant a great deal to me because we saw very much eye to eye and we loved being naughty together.</span> <span id="s130">I couldn’t understand why.</span> <span id="s131">I couldn’t -- I could see her at school, but yet she couldn’t come to my house after school, and I couldn’t visit her any more.</span> <span id="s132">And that -- that started -- I mean, that kind of began and then it was like something rolling on and on and on and it -- and it was -- I tell you, the one thing that I do remember is by going through some old photographs, I did find out that she was allowed to come to my birthday party and I think that must have meant a lot to me, and it was very special, but on a day to day basis, she couldn’t visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you remember which birthday party it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I think it was my fifth -- fifth and sixth birthday parties.</span> <span id="s135">Now, I -- as I say, I could not visit her, she could not visit me, but birthday parties seemed to be kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So this would be 1934 - ’35?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Hitler came into power in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What was your very first memory of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I think one of the most frightening things were the parades through our streets.</span> <span id="s142">And I mentioned the bay window earlier on, which gave wonderful visibility to everything that was going up and down the street.</span> <span id="s143">And the night that the brownshirts were having their parades, I remember my nanny holding me in her arms and we were watching it.</span> <span id="s144">It was nighttime, it was with candles lit and loud singing and -- and boisterous goings on on the street.</span> <span id="s145">And I wish I could tell you what year that was, that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s146">But I remember the fact -- oh, I remember the fact, I remember the shirts, I remember the glistening on the black boots.</span> <span id="s147">And we were one story up.</span> <span id="s148">But it seemed like endless numbers of people were marching and marching and marching.</span> <span id="s149">And yet, that part of Germany, I think was not as badly off as other parts of Germany.</span> <span id="s150">Somehow we were late, I think, in receiving the blows, so to speak.</span> <span id="s151">I think things were worse in other places, but I do recall this vividly and even today when I talk about it, I get a little chilly.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: What did your nanny say to you?</span> <span id="s153">Do you remember if she tried to comfort you or said anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I think she held me.</span> <span id="s155">She hugged me.</span> <span id="s156">She herself was so appalled at what was going on, I think, and understandable for her.</span> <span id="s157">And for Maria, our -- our help in that -- our live-in help in the house.</span> <span id="s158">Maria was a very simple Polish woman, who did all the housework for us, and was -- and lived with us, and when she would go to church and come home, she would always tell us what the father’s sermon was, each week.</span> <span id="s159">She would share that with us.</span> <span id="s160">She was totally against the regime, although her brother was a member of the Nazi party, and I remember having him come and visit and he sat out in the kitchen with her while she was preparing coffee or something.</span> <span id="s161">And he proudly showed off the lap -- other side of his lapel, with a swastika attached to it.</span> <span id="s162">When he came into the house he had the good sense of putting it on the reverse side.</span> <span id="s163">Most of the time I think he had it on the real side, he was a Nazi of the first order.</span> <span id="s164">But not his sister.</span> <span id="s165">Maria was a gentle, wonderful soul, with whom we kept in touch through the war -- not during the war, but after the war.</span> <span id="s166">She wrote to my parents and she wrote as long as they allowed mail to go through and I have le -- her letters t-to this day.</span> <span id="s167">And she actually, after my grandmother was deported, she actually walked out of the house and walked til she came across to the Czech side of the border.</span> <span id="s168">She couldn’t stand being in Germany.</span> <span id="s169">And she say -- she went into the service of a priest in Czechoslovakia and survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What does it mean to a little girl to see a swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Then, or now?</span> <span id="s172">Q: Then.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I think frightening.</span> <span id="s174">Terrifying to -- to say the least.</span> <span id="s175">I of course didn’t understand the ins and outs behind it all, but there was something frightening about the image.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Did your parents ever explain anything on their own, or did you go up and ask them?</span> <span id="s177">Granted, you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I don’t think that I was old enough to ask the right questions.</span> <span id="s179">They, of course, tried to shield me.</span> <span id="s180">Things got very difficult in Ratibor.</span> <span id="s181">My father, who was in private practice, when the decree came out that only Jewish patients could go to Jewish doctors, his patients, of course had to hold off coming.</span> <span id="s182">Although strangely enough in the middle of the night, very often the back door knocked, it was a patient who didn’t want to be seen entering the doctor’s house, would come.</span> <span id="s183">And of course, my father saw him.</span> <span id="s184">And patients asked him to come and see them.</span> <span id="s185">And he did not have a car, and in the early days he went to see his patients by bicycle.</span> <span id="s186">But later on, he got a motorcycle, yeah, a big do -- it was my father and his pale green motorcycle and his one piece suit, which covered him all the way from over his head, to his shoes, with a zip in front.</span> <span id="s187">Went to see his patients in Poland, and he would take his motorcycle and go over.</span> <span id="s188">And there was the standing joke, he stopped at the -- at the customs bureau -- at the customs office to get his papers signed that he was going across the border and about an hour later he would come back and the border guard sniffed -- he would sniff, oh Dr. Fischer, you have just seen a patient?</span> <span id="s189">Yes, and the payment was two wonderful Polish sausages that were hanging on the inside of his suit.</span> <span id="s190">They knew it, they looked the other way.</span> <span id="s191">It was just -- it was an -- an accepted norm.</span> <span id="s192">And so people did come and he did still help people who needed help, i-if they could just get to his hou -- to our house and not be seen.</span> <span id="s193">But one morning -- and I don’t remember what year it was, there was a big yellow sign plastered all over the entryway.</span> <span id="s194">And Maria went outside as always to pick up the milk and the fresh rolls that were left at the doorstep and she removed the sign.</span> <span id="s195">And the sign said, De Jude lugt.</span> <span id="s196">The Jew lies.</span> <span id="s197">And she tore it off very quickly and tore it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: How did you know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: My father told me.</span> <span id="s200">Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">And I think maybe that was sort of the beginning of when he thought probably it would be better to move to a larger city, and so -- and many people did move from the smaller towns, hoping to find their place and a better way of life in the larger city.</span> <span id="s202">So in 1936, I think it was 1936, he decided to go to Breslau.</span> <span id="s203">And so there was movement afoot to move the family, mother and me, up to Breslau.</span> <span id="s204">But the move was going to be a difficult one, he already saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s205">And so I was sent to Berlin to stay with my other granny, my mother’s mother, who lived in [indecipherable] in Berlin, and also, I was not allowed to go to school any more.</span> <span id="s206">Jewish children were not allo -- were not accepted at school any more, so it -- there was a duel reason for moving.</span> <span id="s207">I had to go to Jewish school.</span> <span id="s208">And there was no Jewish school.</span> <span id="s209">There were too few people in Ratibor for a Jewish school to be there, so I was sent to live with my grandmother in Berlin and to continue my education at a Jewish school, which I did, while my parent [indecipherable] while my parents were moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Do you remember what some of your thoughts were and your feelings were when you had to leave to go to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I disliked it with a vengeance.</span> <span id="s212">I did not want to go to Berlin and I have letters that I wrote home, I have them in my keep.</span> <span id="s213">Please take me home, I don’t want to stay here, I don’t like Berlin.</span> <span id="s214">It was all very strange to me, and living with my grandmother was sort of an unknown, I didn’t know her really that well.</span> <span id="s215">And she was a darling, kind, wonderful person, but it wasn’t my mother and it wasn’t my father and I didn’t know my surroundings.</span> <span id="s216">Not a soul did I know other than her, and I was deeply, deeply unhappy in Berlin and I had to stay there through maybe one or two semesters.</span> <span id="s217">And by that time, Mother and Father had moved to Breslau, but this was a sort of an interesting thing, they were not allowed to live with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s218">My grandmother had an enormous house, really.</span> <span id="s219">Beautiful house with spectacular gardens, a flower garden and a vegetable garden and a fruit garden and a -- it was really -- it was a semi-attached -- semi-detached?</span> <span id="s220">Semi-attached.</span> <span id="s221">Well, they were two houses together, but they were both enormous, and wi-with lots of help.</span> <span id="s222">There was a gardener, and there was a lady who came in and did the laundry and there were two people who just cleaned and cooked and washed and did things in the house.</span> <span id="s223">And she had some borders because she was at this point by herself, my -- her husband had passed away.</span> <span id="s224">Her husband, my Omi Hadel Fischer’s husband passed away of natural causes in 1936, I think it was and so there was plenty of room for us to have a very comfortable existence in the main house, but the Nazi wouldn’t have that.</span> <span id="s225">We weren’t allowed to live in the same house unless it was in servant’s quarters.</span> <span id="s226">And so we did, we lived in the servant’s quarters of the house.</span> <span id="s227">We were very, you know, it -- it was just another form of breaking the spirit.</span> <span id="s228">But we made the best of it, my folks did really very, very well in -- in adjusting to the new life.</span> <span id="s229">My father opened an office in Breslau and immediately had a fairly sizable practice -- practice.</span> <span id="s230">And things were moving along.</span> <span id="s231">Not well, but they were moving along.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s234">This is tape number one, side B. Before we go into talking more about Berlin, let’s finish up with some of your memories of Ratibor.</span> <span id="s235">Can you tell me a little bit about your friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I was very fortunate to have friends both Jewish and non-Jewish and we did a lot of visiting back and forth to each other’s homes, although always with an appointment, it wasn’t a natural going back and forth the way we have, or at least our children had it when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s237">It was an appointment made and the nanny was on hand and it was supervised play.</span> <span id="s238">For example, every Sunday my friend Maya Furlish and I had a date, it was every Sunday, it was at the home where the nanny wasn’t on duty for the weekend.</span> <span id="s239">And we always had the same meal, it was always hot dogs with potato salad, and either vanilla pudding with chocolate sauce, or chocolate pudding with vanilla sauce.</span> <span id="s240">That was the given menu and we had wonderful times together.</span> <span id="s241">Maya had an older brother.</span> <span id="s242">Maya and her family moved to Israel early on.</span> <span id="s243">Her father was a veterinarian and he went to Israel and was in charge of the chicken farms all over the country.</span> <span id="s244">And they were very happy to have him there.</span> <span id="s245">Her brother joined the army and stayed i-in the permanent army of the Israel force.</span> <span id="s246">Changed his name from Evian Furlish to Ari Rohn.</span> <span id="s247">Maya s -- kept her name, she married some a -- a -- an attorney by the name of Kolhana, who unfortunately passed away, and then she remarried a man from her own settlement, which was [indecipherable] and they both live in Haifa with all their children and grandchildren and I still am in touch with Maya, we write often, more so now that we have email.</span> <span id="s248">And we have visited back and forth a number of times, she coming here and we fortunate enough to be able to travel to Israel.</span> <span id="s249">At the birth --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Wh-When did they leave to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: They left in 1937, and it was a -- a good time because they were able to take things with them and they were i-immediately very well accepted, built a home and have lived there very well since.</span> <span id="s252">And my parents also went to visit them and the old ties are very strong in our chil -- in -- in ourselves.</span> <span id="s253">Our children don’t know each other too well, although two of my three kids have visited in Israel and stayed with her, so in a way it goes on.</span> <span id="s254">The -- there were many other young people who -- with whom I grew up.</span> <span id="s255">Many -- several of them went to Israel, one was Epstein, Rutal Epstein who went to Israel and has made a good life for herself, i-is still living there now, I have not kept up with -- with her, but hear about her, occasionally.</span> <span id="s256">Vera Marcus came to the United States with her family and lived in New York.</span> <span id="s257">Laura Mamlock, daughter of the ear, nose and throat Dr. Mamlock also came to the United States and my parents were in touch with the Mamlocks for many -- for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Wh-When you say these people left, do you remember specifically when -- all this time --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I think that they left in 1937 -- ’38.</span> <span id="s260">’37 or ’38, and they were very fortunate, those two families, of being able to get into the United States.</span> <span id="s261">I don’t think anybody else was.</span> <span id="s262">No one of my -- that -- whom I know, I don’t think anyone made it into Canada.</span> <span id="s263">Canada had a very tight immigration policy and only allowed physicians and farmers in and once they got here, they gave them a pretty hard time.</span> <span id="s264">The farmers were settled immediately, the doctors were kept from working, so -- but may-maybe more of this later.</span> <span id="s265">Other friends were the Baums, Dr. Baum went to Israel, he was a pediatrician and his children and grandchildren are in Israel now.</span> <span id="s266">His son, unfortunately lost an arm in the 1948 war.</span> <span id="s267">And the whereabouts of several other people, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s268">I know that my dear friend Ilse Meyer -- Mayer -- Meyer didn’t make it, nor did Yurachem -- forgotten his name at the moment, his first name was Yurachem, but he di -- he also -- Yurachem Vaber did not make it.</span> <span id="s269">And I have seen the fact that they did not make it in the files of the -- of the Yad Vashem database.</span> <span id="s270">And many of the teachers that I had also, unfortunately were unable to -- to escape.</span> <span id="s271">But Ratibor was a nice little city to grow up in, it was a charming town, winter was wonderful, we had snow and skating.</span> <span id="s272">We had a pond in the middle of the town and it froze in the winter, and the entire li-little town was there skating.</span> <span id="s273">In the summer my father took a boat and rode us all around in the boat.</span> <span id="s274">It was -- it was a good time, it was a nice time for -- for only a short period of time though, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What was the first day of school like?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Oh, first day of school was very exciting because every child who started school was given a cornucopia filled with candy.</span> <span id="s277">It’s called the Osted Tuete.</span> <span id="s278">It -- the Easter cornucopia because school started in spring.</span> <span id="s279">And I remember my friend Maya be -- who is a year older than I am, bringing me my cornucopia, I was still in bed and she brought it to me and it was such an exciting occasion.</span> <span id="s280">In fact, I have some pictures to verify the fact that it was really an occasion to be remembered.</span> <span id="s281">And of course, we went to school.</span> <span id="s282">School was an extremely formal affair.</span> <span id="s283">We did not wear uniforms, but we were very regimented.</span> <span id="s284">We had 42 children in a class of -- with one teacher.</span> <span id="s285">And school was from eight in the morning until one o’clock and then we were through.</span> <span id="s286">We all brought our little lunch in lunchboxes that were hung around our necks, sort of second breakfasts, my mother called them.</span> <span id="s287">And then we had -- when we got home after one o’clock it was dinner, dinnertime.</span> <span id="s288">And the curriculum when we started included of course, the usual reading, writing and arithmetic.</span> <span id="s289">But it also included art and music and gym, and religious studies.</span> <span id="s290">And to that end Halpy Befelt was my religious teacher, and I st-still have the Bible books that I used, written in German, of course.</span> <span id="s291">And once or twice a week he came, not to the school itself, but to a building close to the school, and we all walked over and took our studies while the catechism was being taught to the Catholic children in the si -- in the class.</span> <span id="s292">I think boys and girls were separate in school, I’m pri -- I’m sure they were, but to religious school we all went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you experience ana -- any anti-Semitism from any of the other children at the school, or any of the non-Jewish teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">I think one of the eye opening experiences to me was when an in -- an inkwell was thrown at me.</span> <span id="s296">And I think I was terrified.</span> <span id="s297">It was by one of the other children.</span> <span id="s298">That frightened me.</span> <span id="s299">The other thing that really upset me was the fact that we had row monitors who were supposed to take care of people not speaking or misbehaving, and if they did talk to anybody or in any way misbehave, the name was given to the teacher.</span> <span id="s300">And I remember getting more sh -- of my shares of -- of -- of censure to talking or misbehaving than I really should have gotten.</span> <span id="s301">And of course the result was that there was a stick that was used and was really -- we rece -- I received a whipping on both my hands every time I was unget zeigt, which meant, pointed out.</span> <span id="s302">And that I think kind of really ma -- discouraged me.</span> <span id="s303">And somehow the teachers, I don’t know, they turned their backs on these things.</span> <span id="s304">For what reason, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s305">For example, when we walked down the street, we -- and we had to wa -- we saw a teacher, the -- the way to acknowledge it was to raise one’s hand and to say, heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s306">I couldn’t do it and my parents absolutely forbade me to do it, and so I just curtsied.</span> <span id="s307">And the teacher, instead of acknowledging the curtsy, would look the other way.</span> <span id="s308">But of course, she didn’t do anything to -- to upset me, but it was that -- but in itself was upsetting to be looked over and not acknowledged.</span> <span id="s309">And so it was with most of the teachers.</span> <span id="s310">I think that they were being threatened and -- and we were being threatened in a way, too.</span> <span id="s311">That was a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Were there pictures of Hitler in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s314">I really don’t remember, but picture or not, he was there in -- you know, in -- just in so many little, small details.</span> <span id="s315">For example, there was every week or so, the pot was po -- passed around for money for Wintahilfe.</span> <span id="s316">Winter help for meals for -- for indigent people or money being raised for unusual causes, and you realized, of course, that the causes were the party, but you had to give.</span> <span id="s317">So that was another somewhat humiliating experience.</span> <span id="s318">But the fact that the teacher believed the children who -- whose hate was really being taught at home, and who took it out on -- on us, that was -- that was unpardonable.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Wa-Was this something you talked about with the other -- your other Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s320">Did you ever talk about such things?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: You know, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s322">I remember talking to my parents about it, but I don’t remember talking to other children about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And what would your parents say?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I don’t -- I real -- I just don’t remember.</span> <span id="s325">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s326">All I know is I have some pictures in my picture album in which I’ve got hanky in hand, and I remember the incidents, telling my mother and she was deeply, deeply unhappy.</span> <span id="s327">And you know, I think what I’ve learned, and I’ve -- it’s been with me all my life is, I don’t want to make my parents unhappy.</span> <span id="s328">And so rather than make them unhappy, I wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Would you describe yourself as a very independent child?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s331">I think so.</span> <span id="s332">I was fairly independent.</span> <span id="s333">I wasn’t a very good student, I was a very average student.</span> <span id="s334">And according to my report cards, all of which I have from Germany, I was not very artistic either.</span> <span id="s335">Music was better than art, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: We-Were you athletic?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t think so, but I did exercise well.</span> <span id="s339">I mean, I -- I was not athletic, but I was flexible and -- and I enjoyed games.</span> <span id="s340">But athletic per se, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s341">I don’t think I was ever very athletic, although I did play basketball on my high school team, and in college.</span> <span id="s342">But that was only because I’m very tall for a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did you as -- during that young childhood have any hobbies, or things that you liked to do, like reading?</span> <span id="s344">Anything outside of school?</span> <span id="s345">A: I loved to draw, and I liked to do handwork and my grandmother taught me how to crochet.</span> <span id="s346">And -- and I liked -- y-yes, I -- I -- I did like that very much.</span> <span id="s347">I liked to sing and my mother and I sang a lot together.</span> <span id="s348">And to this day I -- I recall with much pleasure the children’s folk songs that we -- we sang together.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Can you sing a little bit of any one of the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I probably can, let me think of one.</span> <span id="s351">[sings in German].</span> <span id="s352">I should bring my book up from downstairs where I have all of the songs.</span> <span id="s353">Just off the top of my head?</span> <span id="s354">Let me think a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I’ll go into song later.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s358">And so you said you had the Jewish instruction once a week and so forth, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s359">Well, se -- speaking about singing and music --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: The Jewish instruction did not at this point in time, include Hebrew.</span> <span id="s361">It was Biblical stories mostly and the Hebrew came later, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s362">I wish it had come at -- at much earlier age because I was at a tremendous disadvantage when I changed schools, not having had early Hebrew training.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: When you changed schools to Berlin, is that what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes, when I changed schools to Berlin and particularly to Breslau, everyone was able to read Hebrew quite fluently, and I was struggling terribly with it.</span> <span id="s365">And I really think to this day, I really struggle with Hebrew.</span> <span id="s366">I have learned French easily, of course the German and the English no problem, but with Hebrew, to this day I struggle.</span> <span id="s367">And I wonder how much this is a little resistance on my part.</span> <span id="s368">Not willing, mind you, but sort of subconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s370">Is -- yo-you had started to sing a song and I was saying something about music, and did you have any experience with the Jewish orchestra, the Kulturbund?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Of course I didn’t, I was too young, but in -- in Ratibor, for a -- a -- quite a while we were allowed to go to theater -- to the theater and to the movies, and to musical events.</span> <span id="s372">But the last one that -- the last cinema that I saw was in 1936 at the time of the Olympics.</span> <span id="s373">And after that we were not allowed to go to the movie theater any more.</span> <span id="s374">And I think it was after that ti -- point in time that the Kubu -- the Kulturbund came and did its outreach program to the smaller cities and towns and brought wonderful people to sing and to play and so on.</span> <span id="s375">One was, for example, Alexander Kipnis, who came.</span> <span id="s376">And I remember my father, who was very active in these circles, getting all dressed up, I think it was tails.</span> <span id="s377">And my mother in her very finest.</span> <span id="s378">And it was an evening of Alexander Kipnis.</span> <span id="s379">I remember this very well.</span> <span id="s380">And there must have been other occasions when the Kubu came down, but this -- this is the one that stands out in my mind.</span> <span id="s381">Also my father, who was a cigar smoker and a pipe smoker -- apparently before the performance there was a dinner and I think he pulled out his cigar and Alexander Kipnis made some very unpleasant remarks about people who smoke.</span> <span id="s382">It sticks out in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Where did this concert take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: The concert was actually in the social hall of the synagogue and the synagogue must have been an old church that was taken over by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s385">I remember it very lovingly, my father sat downstairs.</span> <span id="s386">My mother, who sang in the choir sat upstairs and I was allowed to sit with my mother.</span> <span id="s387">Mother was not only a member of the choir, but did the solo work for Yizker service and sang just very, very beautifully.</span> <span id="s388">On the side of the synagogue was a little courtyard and nice things went on including, in my memory, wonderful Sukkoth that was built each year with tables laden with fruits and vegetables and goodies to eat.</span> <span id="s389">And lovely decorations from a roof that was made of greens, and it was just such a delightful time for the children.</span> <span id="s390">We also had -- I guess it was like a club, but I can’t -- I can’t be a hundred percent sure, but I know that I -- one Sunday I guess it was, we made lead candlesticks for ourselves.</span> <span id="s391">Very tiny lead candlesticks, we were allowed -- they had some forms and I guess they poured the lead and each child went home with two candlesticks.</span> <span id="s392">They were big enough to take maybe a birthday candle, but it was so special and I still have them, and my granddaughter now has them.</span> <span id="s393">So they’ve come a long way and they were very dear.</span> <span id="s394">But a lot went on in the synagogue because of the social hall.</span> <span id="s395">In fact, plays were given and there were readings and lectures came.</span> <span id="s396">And all this happened in the social hall of the synagogue, which was pretty much in the downtown area of Ratibor, and Ratibor was a pretty little town, not far from the synagogue for example, was the marketplace.</span> <span id="s397">And I know that my mother went marketing many times during the week because of course we didn’t have a refrigerator, we only had an icebox.</span> <span id="s398">And so she went marketing.</span> <span id="s399">But besides getting fish and vegetables and things like that, they also had pottery, and it was called [speaks German].</span> <span id="s400">And they were wonderful pottery shapes and today, when you go into Pier One, sometimes you can see pottery made in Poland.</span> <span id="s401">It’s blue and white usually, and a very nice, repetitive, simple design, a repeat design on the pottery.</span> <span id="s402">And very charming, very attractive.</span> <span id="s403">It hasn’t changed a whole lot since then.</span> <span id="s404">I kind of -- I think it’s very lovely and I recall going to potter’s market with -- with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: What was the name of the synagogue and do you know the -- where it was located?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I do not know the name.</span> <span id="s407">I could draw it on a map, where it was located.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know the name of the street, but I do know it was on the corner of the place where the Marcus Furniture store was and the st-story about the Marcus’s -- and that was my friend Vera Marcus’s family, story I remember very best was a party at their house.</span> <span id="s409">A most unusual party.</span> <span id="s410">It was a party that celebrated the safe arrival of an electric refrigerator from the United States of America that had a light in it.</span> <span id="s411">I remember the children going to the refrigerator, trying the doors, trying to sneak in to see who it was who was opening and closing the lights.</span> <span id="s412">And so much joy and so much merriment.</span> <span id="s413">It was just a -- an unforgettable evening.</span> <span id="s414">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: What -- what did you know about the United States as a young child?</span> <span id="s416">Did you have any idea of what it represented to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I don’t know whether it was at this point in time or whether it was a little bit later because at this point I was what, seven or eight years old, but my greatest fear of perhaps coming to the United States or Canada was I was so afraid of the wolves.</span> <span id="s418">Four legged ones.</span> <span id="s419">I was petrified to think that I was going to have to live in log cabin with ice and snow all around and the wolves in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s420">It was kind of frightening, but I think the nicest, nicest story that my father told me, and I’ll remember to this day is, dear, he said, we’re going to a land where even a Jew can become a person in the government.</span> <span id="s421">And of course he was talking about Bernard Baruch.</span> <span id="s422">And I’m still a -- you can see, I’m still emotionally very touched by that.</span> <span id="s423">It must have been a little bit later than living in Breslau, but it was -- it was certainly -- you asked me about what I knew about America?</span> <span id="s424">Not a whole lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Did you ever hear any of the speeches on the r -- di -- on the radio that Hitler made, and if so, as a child, what did that do to you?</span> <span id="s426">A: I do remember hearing the speeches on the radio, on -- on -- and the yelling, and not really ever being able -- to this day I can’t follow the words, they were so garbled and mispronounced.</span> <span id="s427">But the tone of voice was so grating and the sheer shouts of adulation and adoration were frightening in themselves.</span> <span id="s428">And I recall my father saying that he had heard, and I’m sure this is so, everybody in the audience felt the fuehrer was looking into his eyes.</span> <span id="s429">One was a -- a person was standing there, one in 10,000 but each one felt that he had been individually touched by this, you must say, charismatic character.</span> <span id="s430">It was frightening and the music was frightening too.</span> <span id="s431">The -- the -- the marching music and the boots, the boots, the boots.</span> <span id="s432">The beat of the boots, oh, very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: You had spoken about one parade.</span> <span id="s434">Were there many parades in Ratibor while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: There were a number, I wouldn’t say many, because we left before there were many, but there were quite a number that I recall.</span> <span id="s436">I even recall the night that there was a fire in a building not too far away from us and it was always a question as to why the fire.</span> <span id="s437">Was it a set fire because there were Jews living in that building, or was it a Christmas three that -- it was on Christmas -- whether it was a Christmas tree that was responsible for it.</span> <span id="s438">I don’t think anybody ever knew, but I associate that picture along also with the marching, the marching, the beat.</span> <span id="s439">It may not have happened at the same time, but in my memory was very -- it must have been very close together.</span> <span id="s440">And of course the -- the birthdays that were always celebrated, Hitler’s birthday and other notable occasions.</span> <span id="s441">And then there were always special parades.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: What -- what would you do on Hitler’s birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: We would stay at home.</span> <span id="s444">We would not go out.</span> <span id="s445">It was not worthwhile jeopardizing oneself.</span> <span id="s446">And still we -- there in -- in Silesia were so much better off, I think, than people in the other parts of Germany.</span> <span id="s447">It was a little bit later in coming to us.</span> <span id="s448">It was as severe, but it was a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Were there banners, Nazi banners hanging from buildings in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s451">I believe that the -- the official building was -- had banners on them -- flags.</span> <span id="s452">And of course you couldn’t miss them, the bright red just was like blood hanging.</span> <span id="s453">That I recall.</span> <span id="s454">I don’t -- you ask me about pictures of Hitler in the classroom.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s456">There may have been the flag, but I’m not su -- I’m really not sure.</span> <span id="s457">That I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you have to ha -- ever have to say heil Hitler in the classroom, to the teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: In the classroom, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s460">Oh, it must have been.</span> <span id="s461">It must have, but I don’t think that -- I don’t think that I raised my arm, but I couldn't swear to that.</span> <span id="s462">That I’m -- I’m a little unsure of, but I do know very well walking along the streets and seeing my teachers, my various teachers and feeling totally hum -- not -- totally upset by the experience of not being recognized.</span> <span id="s463">Although, they tried to be fair with -- I think with grades.</span> <span id="s464">I don’t think that I was graded down in my -- in my studies.</span> <span id="s465">I’m sure I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s466">And I think in some respects these teachers were going through so much themselves, because usually, people who did become teachers in Germany were very dedicated, true teachers with high ideals and high principles, but when your life depends on it, sometimes those principles change.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning

And can you tell me about celebrating Passover in Ratibor?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Well, my most vivid memory of si -- Passover Seders were celebrated with my parent’s very dear friends.</span> <span id="s471">The Passover with the Weisbarts are really in my memory very frequently because they were absolutely wonderful Seders together.</span> <span id="s472">The Weisbarts had a store on the -- downtown in the rink area, the rink area of the downtown part of Ratibor.</span> <span id="s473">And it had all sorts of wonderful things like kitchen equipment and things for the house and they lived above the shop in a comfortable apartment.</span> <span id="s474">And just above them was a family by the name of Rechnitz.</span> <span id="s475">And so on Seder evening, first night of Seder, Frau Weisbart, whose husband used to take me to synagogue on Saturday mornings and buy me those delicious little rolls, had us over -- I think they had no children of their own.</span> <span id="s476">I don’t believe -- or perhaps they did, but at any rate, they were not there.</span> <span id="s477">He would conduct the service.</span> <span id="s478">We were all interspersed, sitting in -- at a long table and I also remember having f -- my four cups of wine and being a little bit out of it one year.</span> <span id="s479">But they had the most delicious sidoram.</span> <span id="s480">The food was unbelievable and a particularly good thing was a fish shodoe.</span> <span id="s481">And I cannot spell it, I don’t know how to tell you about it, but it was fluffy and it was lemony and it had fish in it and it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s482">And there were children around the table, and -- and a family by the name of Rechnitz, and it was a long evening, but always one that was a very, very happy one.</span> <span id="s483">I think I remember two years that we were there, and I’m sure there were more years than that.</span> <span id="s484">What I think is particularly interesting, my husband is very interested in Jewish genealogy and I bring this in because it really does relate.</span> <span id="s485">There was a request about people who knew people in Ratibor and in that general area of Upper Silesia and I answered it and I said yes, I do know the area, and immediately a response came, would you happen to know a -- I’m looking for the name Rechnitz.</span> <span id="s486">And it came from somebody who was originally in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s487">This was a Jewish family who went, instead of going west went east and found refuge in Shanghai, lived out the war years in Shanghai and then came to the United States.</span> <span id="s488">And the name of the lady who made the request was Yvonne Adler.</span> <span id="s489">And I said, this is very, very strange.</span> <span id="s490">I said, I saw a Mrs. Adler present almost every day when O.J. Simpson trials were carried on.</span> <span id="s491">And they sometimes interviewed her, would you be the same one?</span> <span id="s492">She said yes, that was me.</span> <span id="s493">So she wanted to know about Rechnitz, and I said yes.</span> <span id="s494">And she said, I have no knowledge of their whereabouts.</span> <span id="s495">I said, I can tell you nothing perhaps of the mother and father, but the two daughters survived and are living in Israel.</span> <span id="s496">She was delighted, needless to say.</span> <span id="s497">So then a little later a letter came.</span> <span id="s498">She said, you know, I have a relative who lives in Rockville.</span> <span id="s499">Is that close to Potomac?</span> <span id="s500">I said yes, I think within, sort of, walking distance.</span> <span id="s501">And so we met in the relatives, and had them over for a cup of coffee and enjoyed meeting them.</span> <span id="s502">And in between, every now and again, we still get on the genealogy line and a -- express a word of greeting at Passover time, and just to stay little bit in touch.</span> <span id="s503">But it all revolved around the pass -- that Passover table.</span> <span id="s504">And I was able to fill a -- in a little bit on her family tree, and likewise she was able to fill in a little bit of my family tree, because a distant cousin of my father’s was an editor of the Jewish newspaper in Shanghai during the years of the second World War.</span> <span id="s505">He was an editor in Breslau, made a trip and stayed in Shanghai, lived out the years in Shanghai and apparently moved to Israel and unfortunately died there before we could make contact.</span> <span id="s506">But she was able to help us out in that part of our family tree, so the internet’s a great thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And what was his name, the gentleman who was the editor?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Let me think.</span> <span id="s509">I have it, but it’s -- it’s not coming through [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s511">W-We can come back to it later, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s513">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did your family take vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s516">And I’ve -- I have several memorable vacations.</span> <span id="s517">My father and mother were great hikers and they loved to hike in the mountains and so very frequently we went up to the Tetras, and the Riesengebirge and walked and enjoyed the fresh air.</span> <span id="s518">I have happy memories of being put into a sled driven by horses and being pulled through deep snow, and staying at a lodge, and enjoying the -- the winter activities.</span> <span id="s519">Mostly -- it mostly was walking.</span> <span id="s520">But -- and this was all very well and good, we could go and do our vacations, go on our vacations and stay at the lodges, or at the hotels, but a time came when they were taking no more Jewish visitors and so the vacation places were somewhat rationed and we had to go to places that were Jewish -- run by Jewish families for Jewish families and that’s where we went on vacation.</span> <span id="s521">And I remember going up to Swinemünde, which is on the Baltic, where there was a very lovely vacation spot that catered to the Jewish trade.</span> <span id="s522">Was called the Möve.</span> <span id="s523">And the Möve is a seagull and it was on -- on the water, and we went.</span> <span id="s524">I stayed one year with my grandmother and one year I think I went with my mother.</span> <span id="s525">Yes, I remember going with my mother, because I had to do homework, so not to fall behind.</span> <span id="s526">And the German school year was a little bit different, but I was allowed to -- to miss a little time, as long as my mother kept up with the assignments with me.</span> <span id="s527">But it was interesting to think that we were really isolated even in where we could spend vacation time.</span> <span id="s528">Swinemünde was rather fri -- to me was a little bit of a frightening place to be because the lodge where I stayed with my grandmother sat opposite of Peenemünde.</span> <span id="s529">And that’s where the Germans were building their U-boats and we could see the white boats in the harbor, across the water.</span> <span id="s530">And we were well aware of the fact that in 1937, there were definite attempts at getting ready for a war.</span> <span id="s531">And I -- I still see in my mind’s eye the white -- the very white painted ships against very gray waters.</span> <span id="s532">And rather frightening looking, they looked like sharks.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Wow, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s534">Anything else in Ratibor that you wanted to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: There was a very -- in Ratibor was a very nice municipal swimming pool, and I was given my first instructions to swimming at that pool, I was five years old and it was a funny way of learning how to swim.</span> <span id="s536">There were ro -- there were L-shaped rods -- well, actually probably fairly stable pipes that had ropes on them, that were suspended over the water, and we were hooked onto these ropes, and were in a very safe place to study our strokes.</span> <span id="s537">And I -- I learned how to swim that way, I became a very good swimmer, very fast.</span> <span id="s538">And I remember it was a miserable day and I was about to take my test to pass to get my first card, and it required 15 minutes of uninterrupted swimming around the pool, the edge of the pool.</span> <span id="s539">And as I say, it was a dreary day, but my grandmother was visiting and she took me to the pool.</span> <span id="s540">And I passed, I even did 20 minutes, but in order to get your card you had to jump in at the far end, into the deep water.</span> <span id="s541">This I could not do.</span> <span id="s542">I was a totally petrified creature.</span> <span id="s543">But they said well, if you will jump, if we put you on the harness and the rope, we will let you pass.</span> <span id="s544">And of course I did, and I got my certificate and I was the happiest person in the world.</span> <span id="s545">But then that was closed to Jews after we left.</span> <span id="s546">It was no longer allowed for Jewish people to -- to swim there.</span> <span id="s547">But at least I learned how to swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So then you went off to Berlin while your parents settled -- were getting settled, and you were with your grandmother.</span> <span id="s549">And how long did you stay in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Actually, I think I probably was there less time than in my imagination.</span> <span id="s551">I was there a matter of maybe six months.</span> <span id="s552">But I was so lonely, and my grandmother tried to make it so pleasant and comfortable for me, but I was away from my parents and I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s553">I went to a school where I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s554">It was a Jewish school and I didn’t know Hebrew and all the children knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s555">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s556">However, the period came to an end and I saw a little bit of Berlin.</span> <span id="s557">I don’t remember very much of it, I remember where my grandmother lived, I remember where the beautiful synagogue was at which Dr. Joachim Prince was the -- the m -- the rabbi.</span> <span id="s558">I remember going to a service there.</span> <span id="s559">I re -- I remember going to the zoo and to -- doing things that little children like to do, but in general I have a very, very limited memory of what went on there, as opposed to the very accurate memory I have of Ratibor, where I c -- I can draw a map and I drew a map for my father some years back when -- and asked him whether he could go over this map with me to see whether my memory was accurate, and he said absolutely.</span> <span id="s560">The memory of the street where the dentist was, and where the knit shop was and where the market was and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s561">But my memory of Berlin is not at all that good.</span> <span id="s562">However, when I moved back to be with my family in Breslau, when I came back to Breslau, I have a much better memory of that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: When you were in Berlin, did you see lots of evidence of Nazi party symbols?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Actually, I don’t even remember that.</span> <span id="s565">I think there must have been -- there must have been, but I cannot visually pinpoint it as to where I might have seen it.</span> <span id="s566">My grandmother, I am sure took me only to places that were permitted.</span> <span id="s567">It was interesting, my uncle, my mother’s younger brother went to Israel.</span> <span id="s568">He wanted very much to emigrate to Israel and in 1935 or th -- ’36, he went to Israel and had a marvelous experience and wanted very, very much to go and settle there.</span> <span id="s569">He saw the handwriting on the wall and he wanted -- he had a chance to buy into Egged, the bus company.</span> <span id="s570">And my grandmother did not want to leave Berlin and she would not give him the money, although it was there in spades.</span> <span id="s571">The consequence was that Ludz did not go to Israel, had a terrible time leaving Germany, and my grandmother didn’t make it at all.</span> <span id="s572">There was a wonderful opportunity where the wrong turn was taken.</span> <span id="s573">You ask did I see much evidence?</span> <span id="s574">I just really honestly cannot recall.</span> <span id="s575">Mm, I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Did your parents come visit you in Berlin while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I don’t have memories of my parents visiting me at all because they were in the throes of moving and setting up a practice and trying to start getting things ready for a possible chance to -- to emigrate.</span> <span id="s578">My mother was very reluctant to emigrate.</span> <span id="s579">She wanted more than -- she was sure this was all going to blow over.</span> <span id="s580">My father knew better, or he -- he did indeed know better.</span> <span id="s581">He was sure that it wouldn’t and so at that point they were putting feelers out to see what might happen and what ha -- in effect happened was my father, being a physician was contacted by a number of countries in South America who were opening their doors to physicians particularly.</span> <span id="s582">And it was either Uruguay or Paraguay, and I’m sh -- not sure that I remember, but one of the -- one of those two countries that made a most attractive offer, but my father, not Spanish speaking, not having had too much contact with the Spanish speaking population decided that might not be for him.</span> <span id="s583">He also did not want to go to Israel, I might add.</span> <span id="s584">He was not at all set on going to Israel.</span> <span id="s585">But in the meantime, this wonderful telegram showed up, the one that really saved us when we were able to establish a family -- a blood connection to someone who lived in Canada.</span> <span id="s586">The question is, could we get into Canada, because Canada had a very tight quota.</span> <span id="s587">You might know the -- the book, 6,000 is too many and indeed I don’t even think that they got 6,000, or allowed 6,000 in.</span> <span id="s588">But an -- at any rate, perhaps this is not what I -- what I should be -- yeah.</span> <span id="s589">So my father turned down Uruguay or Paraguay, turned down Israel, but was absolutely positive that we had to leave.</span> <span id="s590">And so my mother decided she better learn how to do something.</span> <span id="s591">And so my mother, who was a singer and a lady who entertained beautifully and who was a -- a homemaker at heart decided that she would study and did study under ORT auspices, and studied physiotherapy.</span> <span id="s592">She had always loved a -- gym and exercise and physical culture and so on.</span> <span id="s593">Right up her alley, and she, in Breslau went to school and studied physiotherapy.</span> <span id="s594">And really, in effect, this step did keep body and soul together once we did come to Canada.</span> <span id="s595">And she loved what she was doing, and she did it for many -- well, for a number of years.</span> <span id="s596">So that was while I was in Berlin, she also started on that and got -- got into class and worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: And this is the Jewish Organization for Rehabilitation and Training.</span> <span id="s598">You said your father did not want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s599">Were your parents Zionists in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: My parents were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s601">You know, in Germany there was the big schism, the blue and white and the black and white.</span> <span id="s602">He did not belong to the blue and white, although that changed too.</span> <span id="s603">I mean, he was the strongest supporter of Israel that anybody could wish for, but at the time of our move he thought he could not take the weather in Israel.</span> <span id="s604">That was why.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Y-You said he was a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s606">He obvious -- he had an adult clientele.</span> <span id="s607">Did he have any kind of more of a specialty or just general psychiatry?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Actually, when he went to school, and he went to school at the university in Breslau after he came back from the war, he studied neu-neurology and psychiatry, that was a -- a study that always went hand in hand.</span> <span id="s609">And then he went for specialized work to Munich and studied in Munich for awhile before he actually went into practice.</span> <span id="s610">He dealt mostly with adult patients and he did some very early work on mescaline, which became a drug a -- that was used for, I believe recreational, but it was a -- a very potent drug and he wrote one of the first papers on mescaline.</span> <span id="s611">And he also dealt with bromism, which I’m not sure I really understand.</span> <span id="s612">And then he got very interested and very involved with electric shock therapy, and was exceedingly successful with electroshock until it was sort of downplayed, and was not used any more.</span> <span id="s613">And now things have come back and they are using electric shock therapy, under perhaps better circumstances because of the muscle relaxants and things that go with it.</span> <span id="s614">But my father was exceedingly successful.</span> <span id="s615">I always felt he was out of favor with the establishment because his basis, from the earliest of all times he said, we will find biochemical and biologic basis for mental problems and diseases of the mind.</span> <span id="s616">And of course when Freud became so popular, he was not at all in the swing.</span> <span id="s617">And he stuck to his guns and I think the world has changed.</span> <span id="s618">He was more of a Jungian.</span> <span id="s619">He was extremely interested in what Jung had to tell us.</span> <span id="s620">And he really felt, and I think he was -- h-he -- it -- it came to pass that his way of thinking was quite right, quite on the ball.</span> <span id="s621">And he worked until he was -- worked in his profession until he was 80 years old.</span> <span id="s622">And at that point in time he felt he couldn’t keep up with all the new medications and then decided that this was -- this was not, you know, good for the patient.</span> <span id="s623">But he was quite successful in his -- in his work and he loved every minute of it.</span> <span id="s624">He was the sort of person who, if somebody in the province, in New Brunswick when we came to Canada, was ill and needed his help, he got into his car and drove 300 miles without batting an eye.</span> <span id="s625">If the patient needed him, he was there.</span> <span id="s626">He made housecalls.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: That is some kind of a housecall.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s629">Oh my gosh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: All right, now you’re finished being in Berlin, you’re back with your family in Breslau, and how long did you stay there?</span> <span id="s631">A: I would say probably only a year.</span> <span id="s632">It was a very full year though, because I had to get used to a new school and new surroundings.</span> <span id="s633">I lived fairly far away from the school, the na -- [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: We were talking about your full year in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: I mean in Breslau [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Ah yes, I moved back to Breslau and I was started in the Jewish school in Breslau, Raydia ar -- school and all children there were Jewish.</span> <span id="s638">All, or most everyone was trying to leave and -- and I think everybody’s mind was such that -- that we were il -- we were losing people every day in school.</span> <span id="s639">I went to Raydia shula, it was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s640">It was a sizeable Jewish school, much bigger than my school in Ratibor, certainly ba -- much bigger than the one in Berlin, which was a small, little independent school.</span> <span id="s641">This was a large school, and almost all the children there were being prepared, really, to leave the country.</span> <span id="s642">Hebrew was very big in the curriculum and I was painfully inadequate.</span> <span id="s643">I did not like the school.</span> <span id="s644">I only made two friends while I was in school and it was -- it was a very unhappy time of my life.</span> <span id="s645">My father started his new practice and my grandmother -- my grandmother was having to rent out more rooms so that things would go reasonably well.</span> <span id="s646">She was made to give up the store at the point of a gun.</span> <span id="s647">This beautiful store, this beautiful toy shop, the biggest one in the entire province of Siles -- of Silesia, where people came from all over to buy.</span> <span id="s648">In fact, the people who had the guta, the large farms, these enormous farms would bring their families in at Christmastime to do their shopping at Garson Frankel.</span> <span id="s649">That was the name of the store, was the name actually of my great-grandfather.</span> <span id="s650">The store had been in the family since 1826 and my grandmother was running it with her sister because both had lost their husbands, and they were made to sell it, as I say, because it was taken over.</span> <span id="s651">And I even have a clipping to the effect that it’s now Aryan, a big clipping from the newspaper.</span> <span id="s652">So she took in borders into her big, beautiful home and everybody got along very well.</span> <span id="s653">But it was not as it was before.</span> <span id="s654">Still, she was able to have help in the house because help was still allowed to work.</span> <span id="s655">It was later that the help was not allowed to work for Jewish people any more, but at that time, in that place, there was help.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Were the borders Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I believe they were.</span> <span id="s658">I do believe they were.</span> <span id="s659">The house was one, two -- four stories high and the lowest part had the servant quarters of the gardener, which became our apartment.</span> <span id="s660">It was on the lowest level, the entry level and there were lovely shrubs around it.</span> <span id="s661">I remember there were lilacs that smelled so beautifully, and Lilies of the Valley.</span> <span id="s662">Had a large iron gate that opened up to allow cars to move in.</span> <span id="s663">We di -- she did not -- we did not have a car.</span> <span id="s664">My father had his motorcycle, never drove a car until he came to Canada.</span> <span id="s665">And then there was the rote deala.</span> <span id="s666">That was a red foyer where when people came to visit, left their coats before being shown upstairs.</span> <span id="s667">And that was, of course, my favorite place to play because everything was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s668">Red satin or velvet or plush, very beautiful, with a bay window looking out into the shrubs.</span> <span id="s669">And then the back or side part of it had a huge kitchen.</span> <span id="s670">It was not a kitchen for cooking though, it was an area to do the laundry.</span> <span id="s671">And every week the laundresses came in and that was always great fun for me because they would hand wash everything on boards and then they would rinse it and then dry them, and then at the end of the day the two of them would take the sheets, one standing at one end, one at the other and they would pull them in order to dry them completely and my greatest joy was to stand underneath in the middle and have my hair fly up into the sheets.</span> <span id="s672">It was such a joy and it was so much fun.</span> <span id="s673">That was so much fun.</span> <span id="s674">We had a lovely gardener who took care of the garden, which had a walk all around it so that one could stroll around a central green area.</span> <span id="s675">And then the borders were all peonies and roses and lovely shade flowers and tall trees.</span> <span id="s676">And then there was a small garden arch that led into the fruits and vegetable gardens.</span> <span id="s677">And we had gooseberries.</span> <span id="s678">Never see gooseberries any more.</span> <span id="s679">And red and white currants and raspberries and apple trees and peach trees.</span> <span id="s680">It was -- it was a paradise, it was absolutely lovely, and the gardener worked hard to do -- to keep it so.</span> <span id="s681">And the back of the house had an enormous balcony so that one could sit in the balcony and then look down on this lovely green area and then into the distance where the fruit trees were.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s684">This is tape number two, side B. Cou -- let’s start talking about the actions that your father took to try to get the family ou-out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Once my grandmother was found and was able to establish contact with a distant relative who had emigrated to Canada much earlier, and I wish I could tell you exactly when, I don’t ec -- but, at any rate, he was a blood relative and action was taken to try to contact him and see whether he could, in any way help out.</span> <span id="s686">His response was immediate and he said he could, of course try to help out but not monetarily because it was in the late 30’s and Canada was still reeling, as the States, I know must have been after the depression, and really no one had much of anything.</span> <span id="s687">He -- Uncle Charlie, his name was Charlie Redlish, had established a small institute where he treated alcoholics.</span> <span id="s688">And it was very small and he ran it by himself with one nurse.</span> <span id="s689">But he apparently was successful enough, but I don’t think was getting paid exceedingly well because he and his wife and his married daughter and unmarried daughter, all -- an-and son and his wife all had to live together in one flat just to be able to make it.</span> <span id="s690">But he was instrumental in getting things going and very fortunately, his daughter Fay Redlish had a friend who was extremely well-to-do.</span> <span id="s691">He was in the manufacturing business of men’s suits, and at the time just before the war, was starting to get contracts for army uniforms, and apparently had an in politically speaking.</span> <span id="s692">And Jack took it upon himself, and I think I’m right in saying this, that he went up to Ottawa to see whether there was some way of expediting bringing us into Canada.</span> <span id="s693">Well, Canada had the law, of course, that only farmers and physicians could come in, and the other law, the law stated that they, if after a year’s time, the person could not make it on their own in Canada, they would be sent back.</span> <span id="s694">So it was a trial run, so to speak.</span> <span id="s695">In addition to fulfilling that, the person also had to bring 3200 dollars with them, which at that point in time I guess must have been a fair amount of money.</span> <span id="s696">And it took many months to actually get the permission to come, and once the permission was granted there was an awful lot to go through as far as the Canadian authorities were concerned, but as far as the German authorities were concerned.</span> <span id="s697">Because they were on our tails constantly about signing this paper and that paper.</span> <span id="s698">And during that period of time, many people were called to the police stations and never returned.</span> <span id="s699">This was a time in ’36 - ’37, when people were called on unbelievably small details to their leaving and to their lives, they were called, and they were made to jump off buildings.</span> <span id="s700">And this happened indeed, to friends of ours.</span> <span id="s701">Well, I think I can tell you, one day my father was called.</span> <span id="s702">We were trembling, I think all day long, but he was one of the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s703">He signed whatever he needed to sign and pay whatever he needed to pay and he came back.</span> <span id="s704">In the meantime we were granted permission and a van was ordered to pack up our things.</span> <span id="s705">And I think it’s interesting to mention that we were allowed to bring things with us that had been -- that were old things.</span> <span id="s706">So my grandmother suggested that we take her furniture because that could be certified as being old.</span> <span id="s707">I don’t know how -- I -- I know it was 10 years on suits because my father had to go to his tailor and tell him to put labels into his suits which indicated when they were made, and he did.</span> <span id="s708">But the van was -- as I say, was ordered and some of the old pieces were packed and -- and put in, but nothing of their modern furniture could come with them, it -- it was only the old things, which -- which was fine.</span> <span id="s709">But when we were packing -- and my father ha-had a terrific library, and a wonderful stamp collection, and when the actual packing took place, the Nazi, with their guns came, and they stood over us as we were doing the packing.</span> <span id="s710">And I remember very, very well, we were in our little downstairs gardener’s apartment with lots and lots of boxes on the floor, these two men with guns watching as my father packed all the books.</span> <span id="s711">And whenever they liked a book -- an they particularly liked my children’s books, they just helped themselves.</span> <span id="s712">And they helped themselves to some of my father’s stamps too, and there wasn’t a thing we could do about it.</span> <span id="s713">And I remember my father putting his hand to his mouth and saying shh.</span> <span id="s714">It was just, that’s the way it was done.</span> <span id="s715">Well, he still came over with a lot of books and I did come over with some children’s books, but I think my best ones didn’t come with me.</span> <span id="s716">That’s all right.</span> <span id="s717">But it was just, you know, the situation.</span> <span id="s718">Also, for example, it’s interesting; in that same apartment where we were packing the books, we were also taking our food, because we were not allowed to eat with our grandmother upstairs.</span> <span id="s719">We had to eat separately.</span> <span id="s720">I mean, the little downstairs apartment was like an independently organized apartment.</span> <span id="s721">They were allowed to bring the food down to us, but we couldn’t eat it together with them upstairs.</span> <span id="s722">All the boarders could eat upstairs and my grandmother could eat upstairs, but we couldn’t, and we had to eat downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: How would your family know this rule, this regulation that you couldn’t eat upstairs?</span> <span id="s724">How were you told?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Oh, you know, that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s726">I don’t recall, but there would be -- day after day there would be leaflets left on th-the doorstep and people were checking up.</span> <span id="s727">So, I assume it must have been through those leaflets.</span> <span id="s728">Otherwise I -- I can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s729">But there were people always coming by and always checking up.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: What about your going outside to play with friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I didn’t go out to play at all.</span> <span id="s732">I went to school, but I rode my bicycle on the side of the street.</span> <span id="s733">I took a streetcar to school and I remember having to actually change places on Victoriastrassen and -- into another streetcar and that seemed to be safe enough.</span> <span id="s734">I don’t remember having friends when I was in Breslau at all, because I was hardly there long enough and people -- there wasn’t that nice easy going back and forth to houses as there is in America, it just wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s735">And surely not at that point in time.</span> <span id="s736">I only had -- I only made two friends while I was in Breslau.</span> <span id="s737">I wasn’t there that long, I guess, and the times were just not conducive.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: When you would see a Nazi officer in uniform, do you d -- do you remember any visceral effects it had on you?</span> <span id="s739">A: You know, I must say I don’t.</span> <span id="s740">Again, I don’t remember, other than seeing them in groups.</span> <span id="s741">And yes, I was scared, terribly scared because of what I remembered from Ratibor.</span> <span id="s742">But I -- either I was held away from being put into that situation or it perhaps just didn’t register.</span> <span id="s743">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s745">I remember in Breslau it was not a time to go to the movie theater, because we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s746">It was not a time to go to a concert because we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s747">And I think everything was in the home.</span> <span id="s748">There wasn’t much of that either.</span> <span id="s749">I think the times were so desperate.</span> <span id="s750">My mother went to class and came home.</span> <span id="s751">But I have to add this, because this I think is very important.</span> <span id="s752">My parents both decided it was -- would be good if they took English lessons.</span> <span id="s753">And so they found out that there was a man, an Englishman who was settled in Breslau, who was giving lessons to people who were leaving the country.</span> <span id="s754">My parents decided to also study English, as many of their friends were, a-and they went to the home of somebody who had come from England and who was doing something other than giving English lessons.</span> <span id="s755">But he gave English lessons on the side, and he gave them in the evening, and my parents decided to take them.</span> <span id="s756">And first they walked into his home, and he’s -- they were sitting at his desk, he with his back to a huge picture of Mr. Moseby.</span> <span id="s757">And who is Mr. Moseby?</span> <span id="s758">He was the Nazi of England.</span> <span id="s759">He was the emissary there.</span> <span id="s760">Well, my mother and father said, we’ve got to learn English, we’ve got to face Moseby, and they went ahead and did and just disliked the occasion terribly but liked their teacher.</span> <span id="s761">Their teacher was a very good teacher and a very nice person.</span> <span id="s762">So they never could understand why Moseby was there, but he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So th-th -- you said they continued with their English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes, they took their English lessons and they did rather well and at least got a little bit of a foundation and developed their hearing skills and along with taking the -- along with taking the ORT group, my father also learned how to concoct beauty preparations.</span> <span id="s765">He learned how to make cold creams and vanishing creams and moisturizing creams and all sorts of things practical.</span> <span id="s766">And this stood us in very good stead, actually.</span> <span id="s767">And he bought jars, beautifully designed jars and labels for the jars, so -- in English -- so that they could be at -- affixed to the jars that perhaps might be of -- of use on immi -- on immigration.</span> <span id="s768">So that was a time when you asked what did people do, my parents were very busy, taking classes and doing very practical things.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did you know they were preparing to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I knew, yes.</span> <span id="s771">I knew that we were going to leave.</span> <span id="s772">When my mother -- when my father finally persuaded my mother that we had no alternative, she came around to it and of course I knew, because of the papers that needed signing and the documentation that needed to be gotten and the visits to ready ourselves, yes.</span> <span id="s773">And of course, when the furniture was being packed, I think it was very clear.</span> <span id="s774">It was very -- a very difficult time for my grandmother, because unfortunately we could not bring her with us.</span> <span id="s775">The Canadian government put an age limit on those whom they would permit.</span> <span id="s776">And of course, she was not a trained person, either a farmer or a physician, so she -- on her own she would not be able to go.</span> <span id="s777">And she could not come as a member of the family, much to the everlasting sadness that my father went through.</span> <span id="s778">He was an only child and he was very close to his mother, and I think he suffered terribly, just the fact that she had to stay behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Her name was Hedwig, Frankel was her maiden name, Fischer.</span> <span id="s781">And the store’s name was Garson Frankel, it was her father’s and that family’s store.</span> <span id="s782">She was a good business lady, she was very interested in genealogy.</span> <span id="s783">In fact, I’ve just put together lots and lots of genealogic data, much of which she wrote down in German script.</span> <span id="s784">And since there are not too many of us left who can still re-read German script, I thought I’d best do that, and I’ve done it and I am so glad because it has opened up all sorts of interesting new avenues to investigate.</span> <span id="s785">And unfortunately she -- she was taken to Belzec.</span> <span id="s786">And you know Belzec, of course is a -- was a killing camp.</span> <span id="s787">So that was her demise.</span> <span id="s788">I -- I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: How old was she when she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, we’re not really quite sure, but I know that I’m older than she was when she died.</span> <span id="s791">In fact, I think she must have been 60.</span> <span id="s792">Probably something like that.</span> <span id="s793">I can look that up, I -- that I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s794">But she was the -- it -- it was so much fun visiting her when I was a little girl because she read stories to me and she introduced me to handwork.</span> <span id="s795">She did beautiful tatting and beautiful crocheting and I still have collars that she made me, which I have put into tissue paper, and have kept a tablecloth that she made for my mother, and just lovely handiwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So your family was preparing to leave.</span> <span id="s797">Were you kind of thinking of what to take with you, cause you know you’d be leaving your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I don’t think that I had any choice, because they could not buy things new for me, so I had to take what I had.</span> <span id="s799">And for themselves they couldn’t either, so we went with what we had, we couldn’t really prepare in that sense, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: So what was it like when you had to leave, for you emotionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Well, I remember taking leave from my grandmother -- my grandmother in Berlin, we said goodbye to earlier on.</span> <span id="s804">When we moved to -- I think she came to visit us and we said goodbye then.</span> <span id="s805">My grandmother in Breslau, with whom we stayed, we said goodbye and -- and it was a very -- it was a very quiet time.</span> <span id="s806">And I remember that one of the people who rented rooms from my grandmother was a pianist, and he played one of Chopin’s etudes.</span> <span id="s807">And to this day, when I hear that etude, the tears come -- welled up in -- welled up in my eyes.</span> <span id="s808">This -- there was not much to say.</span> <span id="s809">I think we all knew that this would be the last time and we were taking leave.</span> <span id="s810">It was -- it was tough, very tough.</span> <span id="s811">I don’t remember how we got to where we went, I mean to the station, but I know we went by train.</span> <span id="s812">I don’t know how we got there.</span> <span id="s813">We went by train from Breslau to Hamburg and in Hamburg we had to undergo medical checks with a Canadian doctor.</span> <span id="s814">And that was not a nice experience, but it was done.</span> <span id="s815">My mother, who very early in her life developed glaucoma, she was in her 40’s, she thinks that the doctor who examined her, Canadian doctor who examined her, might have had a suspicion that there was something there, but he didn’t let on.</span> <span id="s816">All she remembers is that she was forever getting her eyes examined.</span> <span id="s817">Now, she was an undiagnosed glaucoma [indecipherable], so imagine if she had had the glaucoma 10 years before and they would have told her about it, she might never have gone blind.</span> <span id="s818">Because she did eventually become blind.</span> <span id="s819">But yes, we passed our exams, our physicals.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Did they check you?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: All over.</span> <span id="s824">All over and then some, a little bit more than they really needed to, I think, but I passed.</span> <span id="s825">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Was your mother able to stay with you during the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yes, yes, she was.</span> <span id="s828">But it was -- you know, I was a little girl, nine years old.</span> <span id="s829">It was not -- it wasn’t my doctor, the one that I was used to, and being patted all over by a strange person who was not -- whose language I didn’t understand, was not a happy situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: What month in 1938 was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Well, I figure it must have been June, or July.</span> <span id="s832">June or July.</span> <span id="s833">My mother’s brother came to see us off -- I mean, came to Hamburg to see us before we took our leave, and oh well, we were hoping that we would see each other again.</span> <span id="s834">And we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: But it was very iffy, because he hadn’t gotten permission to leave Germany, and it was late 30’s -- mid-30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: The anschluss had taken place in March of ’38, when Hitler marched into Austria.</span> <span id="s838">Did you -- were you aware of that, or did your parents tell you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes, they did, and they -- I could -- you know, interestingly enough, they didn’t have to tell me.</span> <span id="s840">There was so much electricity in the air, just our every day routine.</span> <span id="s841">And hearing particularly what was happening, through the maids, who went out and did their shopping and who went and -- to church.</span> <span id="s842">We always were aware of what people were thinking and what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s843">I think it came -- it came as a bit of a shock, I think.</span> <span id="s844">But then my father -- by that time my father had already made up his mind to go, and I think that reinforced his judgment.</span> <span id="s845">It was just such a nerve-wracking time to be there.</span> <span id="s846">One had to watch ones P’s and Q’s so carefully.</span> <span id="s847">Didn’t say anything in public, didn’t have an -- you know, even -- even when -- when you went for little walks, you’d look around and sort of make sure that nobody was hearing your conversation.</span> <span id="s848">It was fraught with -- with all sorts of intangible, unpleasant things.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Did you see any violence on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s851">I wasn’t on the street long enough, really.</span> <span id="s852">I -- I was fairly well sheltered.</span> <span id="s853">I don’t -- that I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s854">But I recall the dinner conversations when so and so was asked to come up to the Gestapo and so and so lost his business and such and such a person was asked for extra documentation, which of course they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s855">And it was -- it was just an unsure and uncertain and nerve-wracking time.</span> <span id="s856">And I think my mother, who was a bit of an insomniac must have suffered terribly.</span> <span id="s857">But you know, life continued and it’s amazing that it does, but it did.</span> <span id="s858">And bi -- after Hamburg and having the medical exam and seeing our -- my Uncle Ludz, we were put on the train and we left for -- for Holland first, on our way to England.</span> <span id="s859">And I don’t remember the day that it was, but it must have been -- it was in the summer of 1938, and we were on the train from Hamburg to Hoek van Holland, which was the port, the seaport in Holland, before getting on the little peanut boat to Greenwich.</span> <span id="s860">And I remember we had second class tickets.</span> <span id="s861">My father had gotten those and we were to get on the train and we were entering the second class carriage when somebody came waving a paper.</span> <span id="s862">Dr. Fischer, Dr. Fischer, would you kindly move over into the first class carriage?</span> <span id="s863">My father said he had second class tickets.</span> <span id="s864">Yes, but it would -- it would be better if we went into the first class carriage.</span> <span id="s865">I remember it so vividly, but the second class carriage had red leather seats, and first class carriage had green velvet seats.</span> <span id="s866">I was dressed -- what is it, to the sevens?</span> <span id="s867">To the fours?</span> <span id="s868">Q: To the nines.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: To the nines, well okay, I was very nicely dressed with while gloves.</span> <span id="s870">I remember my mother slipping several rings on my fingers and telling me to keep my gloves on, which I did.</span> <span id="s871">But we were ushered into this very nice carriage and sat with not too many people, whereas the other carriage was very, very full, and we came to the border and I know we came to the border because there was my father, knowing exactly at what time that train was leaving Germany and getting into Holland, because he was waiting to be out of the clutches.</span> <span id="s872">Just before the border, the stop before the border, the train stopped.</span> <span id="s873">Second class carriage people left the train.</span> <span id="s874">We went on without many of second class carriage people.</span> <span id="s875">I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s876">I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s877">And my father to this day said, we were that lucky because of the English teacher with Moseby’s picture in back.</span> <span id="s878">He was trying to help people out of Germany in whatever way they could.</span> <span id="s879">My father said he was very interested in knowing what trains we were taking.</span> <span id="s880">And really, my mother and father both, many, many times had said, if it hadn’t been for the English teacher, we might not have gotten out of second class carriage.</span> <span id="s881">So we crossed the border.</span> <span id="s882">I remember everybody, we three, just hugging each other, crying and making our way over to Hoek van Holland and getting on our little boat.</span> <span id="s883">My father and I got very sick crossing the English channel.</span> <span id="s884">My mother, the good rider -- or sailor I should say, had no problems whatsoever, as she did on the voyage across the Atlantic as well.</span> <span id="s885">And we landed in Greenwich -- or Harwich -- Harwich.</span> <span id="s886">S-Sorry, Harwich I think it was.</span> <span id="s887">H-a-r-w-i-c-h.</span> <span id="s888">Yeah, Harwich.</span> <span id="s889">And from there we took the train to London.</span> <span id="s890">And in London my father had made arrangements for us to stay in a very nice hotel, which we have since visited.</span> <span id="s891">And we stayed there and h-he had fraternity brothers in London and his cousin was in -- no, his cousin wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s892">But the fraternity brothers were in London and we had a few very nice days in London until about three days before we were to sail to Canada, I came down with appendicitis.</span> <span id="s893">Had to go to the hospital emergency.</span> <span id="s894">Where did they take me?</span> <span id="s895">To the German hospital.</span> <span id="s896">Had to have my appendix removed, and fate again, fate unbelievable.</span> <span id="s897">I was on the operating table, about ready to have my appendix removed when the young surgeon who came and was about to do the job said, oh, and what’s your name and where are you from, and said, is your father a physician?</span> <span id="s898">Yes.</span> <span id="s899">And we -- we established the fact that my father was a physician, and he said, he helped me out in my final exam.</span> <span id="s900">I told this story to my father.</span> <span id="s901">He said, you know, he was trying to keep calm, but sure enough, my father slipped him some answers when he was taking his final exam.</span> <span id="s902">And this was the doctor who took out my appendix.</span> <span id="s903">But I had to stay in hospital for a week, I guess it is.</span> <span id="s904">I was very well looked after, but it was a German hospital.</span> <span id="s905">And I suppose it was good that I was there because I understood what was going on, and they understood what I -- and af -- we had to miss our boat to Canada, and that was the difficult part.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s908">This is tape number three, side A, and you were saying because you had your appendix operation you missed your -- the boat.</span> <span id="s909">Before we get to that, did you have any special toys that you brought with you from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: I had a lovely doll, a Katie [indecipherable] doll and something happened to her between the -- in the last 20 years.</span> <span id="s911">I cannot locate her and I am desolate.</span> <span id="s912">Yes, mine [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s913">I certainly brought a doll with me and I don’t think I brought too much else in way of toys.</span> <span id="s914">That was -- not even a Teddy bear, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s915">Just a doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: You were nine years old at the time.</span> <span id="s917">Also, did you -- a-and you also said the Germans who were watching you while you were packing took some of your children’s books.</span> <span id="s918">Did you have any favorite children’s books that you didn’t bring with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I brought some fairy tales and a few stories about animals and I still have them and look at them every now and again.</span> <span id="s920">There was one lovely one about an aquarium.</span> <span id="s921">But I loved fairy tales.</span> <span id="s922">My mother always used to say [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s923">I am too much involved in play.</span> <span id="s924">I was always imagining, playing imaginary games of -- I think my joy in life was to be a princess, to have a crown on my head and to eat noodle soup.</span> <span id="s925">I -- I don’t -- I can’t think of other toys.</span> <span id="s926">I did bring card games.</span> <span id="s927">Some games and some puzzles.</span> <span id="s928">And I have the card games, they were quartets and they were quartets dealing with authors and with flowers and with comics.</span> <span id="s929">Very funny comics from the newspaper, but they were in sets of fours.</span> <span id="s930">And also cards with letters so that one could make Scrabble words, but all as cards.</span> <span id="s931">Small, small things.</span> <span id="s932">But I think that’s all.</span> <span id="s933">Maybe a chessboard.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: And -- all right, you’ve now recuperated from your appendix operation?</span> <span id="s935">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I recuperated, and my father of course, had to scout around to find a new -- a voyage for us across the ocean and it was close to September and the visitors were returning back to Canada after vacationing in Europe.</span> <span id="s937">It was a particularly busy time of the year because the teachers were coming home on their trips and it was -- it was a bit of a -- of -- of a difficulty.</span> <span id="s938">However, the Canadian embassy could not have been nicer.</span> <span id="s939">They found my folks a place to stay because staying at a hotel was too expensive, and they settled them in somebody’s home in Golders Green, which is a f -- well-known Jewish community, and perhaps not so far away from the hospital either.</span> <span id="s940">And they arranged, through the Jewi -- with the help of the Jewish Aid Society in London to get us a later boat over and we came over on the Montrose, which was a slightly smaller ship than we were supposed to come on, but they had room for the three of us and we had a good voyage across the sea.</span> <span id="s941">At least my mother had a good voyage.</span> <span id="s942">My father and I took it downstairs.</span> <span id="s943">We were -- he and I were quite seasick.</span> <span id="s944">Not that it was such a hazardous journey at -- according to the information that I got from pier 21, it was a rather smooth journey, but our stomachs did not know that.</span> <span id="s945">My mother played ping pong onboard and we were downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Were there many refugees on the bor -- on the boat?</span> <span id="s947">A: No, there were not.</span> <span id="s948">There were -- I don’t think there were -- I -- as far as I know there were none, and I have the -- I have the entire list of the people in our class, tourist class, and we did not see Jewish names at all.</span> <span id="s949">Most of them, as I say, were returning visitors to Europe.</span> <span id="s950">Did not at all.</span> <span id="s951">We did have iceberg practice and we all got into our assigned jackets and had to parade out.</span> <span id="s952">And we were very close to an iceberg.</span> <span id="s953">I think it’s as close as I’d like to get to an iceberg.</span> <span id="s954">But it was a drill, and of course everybody took part.</span> <span id="s955">There was a very nice party, I’m told, at the end of the ride.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t think my parents were in -- in a partying mood, but there was a party.</span> <span id="s957">And I should mention to you that the last day, the day that we were supposed to -- that we did in fact land in Montreal, I woke up and could not move.</span> <span id="s958">I had total paralysis of both my legs and my father had to carry me off the boat.</span> <span id="s959">This happened twice in my life.</span> <span id="s960">This was the first time, and the second time it happened when, as a student in 1948, I had the -- and I was on an international student service seminar, I had the opportunity to go back to Germany and the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s961">I woke up paralyzed from my waist down.</span> <span id="s962">The paralysis did not last very long.</span> <span id="s963">My father carried me off the boat.</span> <span id="s964">The relatives were there to meet us.</span> <span id="s965">And in a day the paralysis was gone.</span> <span id="s966">I think they call this a hysterical paralysis, which it undoubtedly was.</span> <span id="s967">Terribly frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: What were you frightened of?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: This new life in a new country where we didn’t know the language, where we didn’t know anybody really, not even our relatives.</span> <span id="s970">I think just terrible fright.</span> <span id="s971">But you know, it happened that time, the first time and we ascribed it to that.</span> <span id="s972">But it was interesting that it should happen -- what was it, 10 years later?</span> <span id="s973">Again, and th-the return visit.</span> <span id="s974">And I’ve never been back to Germany, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Did you know any English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s977">Not at all.</span> <span id="s978">And I learned it very quickly.</span> <span id="s979">But for the first couple of months I was very silent, but after that I could grapple with it quite nicely.</span> <span id="s980">I sat.</span> <span id="s981">My schoolteacher did not allow me to have a dictionary in school.</span> <span id="s982">She wanted me to absorb it totally by ear, which I guess perhaps was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s983">I was horrified that I couldn’t have my dictionary, but she didn’t allow it, and I learned it very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: So you settled in Montreal?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: We came to Montreal and met Uncle Charlie and Aunt Bertha, the people who sent the telegram, and their children and it was decided that all of us, Uncle Char-Charlie, and his wife and the daughter, married Wilfred and their son, and my mother and father and I would all take a flat together in Montreal.</span> <span id="s986">And we did, and we all lived together for a number of years in one flat, where --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: When you mentioned telegram what were you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Well, I think the telegram was sort of the lynchpin, if you will.</span> <span id="s989">This was a telegram that arrived at the wedding, for the wedding of my grandparents, sent by a distant relative in Canada by the name of Charlie -- Charles Redlish.</span> <span id="s990">It was a telegram that was sent to send congratulations to the wedding of and the mishpoka of the grandparent, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s991">And my grandmother kept that telegram, as she kept many, many things, and remembered in the 30’s that there was somebody in Canada who was distantly related.</span> <span id="s992">And this telegram really started the correspondence between my parents and that distant relative that lived in Montreal.</span> <span id="s993">And I have many copies of this telegram because I feel it was the thing that saved our lives.</span> <span id="s994">The one item that established a relationship with family abroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: When you started school, were you placed in your chronological grade, or a younger grade?</span> <span id="s996">A: No, actually I started in grade four and was in my -- with my own peer group, so that I had to learn English, but I think I could do most everything else.</span> <span id="s997">Math I certainly could do, and I learned English soon enough.</span> <span id="s998">By the end of the year I won the prize for the best student.</span> <span id="s999">So I didn’t do too badly.</span> <span id="s1000">I worked hard at my studies because I had so much to catch up on.</span> <span id="s1001">My distant relative played all kinds of tricks on me and made me say horrible things because I didn't know what I was saying.</span> <span id="s1002">And I got into a lot of trouble, but it sorted itself out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Did you miss Germany?</span> <span id="s1004">Did you consider Germany your home at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I missed my friends, I missed my grandmothers.</span> <span id="s1006">I don’t know that I missed the physical part of Germany.</span> <span id="s1007">I think at that age perhaps that’s not so important, but I certainly missed my friends.</span> <span id="s1008">It was so much -- there was so much to learn and so much new, and so much to catch up with.</span> <span id="s1009">It -- the impressions came so hard and so fast and they were so different.</span> <span id="s1010">Coming from -- coming from a home, for example, as we were lucky enough to have, with servants and whatnot to a one room that we stayed in.</span> <span id="s1011">We had one room and that -- that was it.</span> <span id="s1012">It was a -- a new lifestyle, but you know, my -- my mother particularly was quite adventuresome.</span> <span id="s1013">My father became very depressed.</span> <span id="s1014">My father, who was unable to find work because they wouldn’t let him work, was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years came along, it became even more so.</span> <span id="s1015">Because remember, in Canada, the war started September the third, 1939.</span> <span id="s1016">We were at war exactly a year from the date we arrived in Canada.</span> <span id="s1017">My father tried to join the army, they wouldn’t have him because he wasn’t a citizen.</span> <span id="s1018">He wanted to join the medical corps, they wouldn’t have him because he wasn’t registered as a medic in Canada and you couldn’t become a medic in Canada until you took up citizenship.</span> <span id="s1019">And so all -- everything was closed, and his main concern was trying to get the grandmothers over.</span> <span id="s1020">And he had absolutely no luck in that department.</span> <span id="s1021">I know he traveled back and forth to Ottawa trying to persuade the powers that be, the natio -- the commissioner of refugees, a wonderful woman by the name of Senator Karen Wilson, to see if there was some way of getting the grandparents out, even if it would be over at the Dominican Republics, or Cuba, but even that door seemed to be closed because of their ages.</span> <span id="s1022">And my father was making creams at that point and my mother, fortunately got a job and worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1023">She fortunately met a physician through friends, I guess, or family, Canadian family, in Montreal, who was very interested in the fact that she was able to do physiotherapy, which was not done a whole lot on this side of the ocean.</span> <span id="s1024">And she was very well trained and it was a period of the polio epidemic starting.</span> <span id="s1025">And also, she did post-operative -- broken legs and things like that, she worked with patients and so on.</span> <span id="s1026">And she really had a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1027">She -- she e -- well, in time she even -- we even got an apartment that had a basement in it, a finished basement in which she gave classes, gym classes, and then the rest of the apartment was rented out to different people -- different rooms.</span> <span id="s1028">And she -- she did very well and -- because my father couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s1029">But he was invited by Dr. Wilder Pennfield and Dr. Cohen at the Neurological Institute in Montreal, which is a very well known place, to come on rounds and to hone his skills and to get the English lingo.</span> <span id="s1030">And he did that, and in time he met someone who asked him to become an intern in a hospital in the Maritime provinces of Canada, where the medical people left in order to join the army.</span> <span id="s1031">So a place became available where they really needed his skills, and he -- he worked there until -- until someone said, why do you have this enemy alien working for the Ca-Canadian government?</span> <span id="s1032">And he went through a horrible period of time in which his life was made miserable by the powers that be because he was -- they considered him as an enemy alien who -- whom they suspected of being a farmer and a spy.</span> <span id="s1033">He -- the Mounties came to visit him one day and he said, take the cameras, because they were afraid that he was photographing installations on the shore -- o-o -- the seacoast of New Brunswick, which was where his job was.</span> <span id="s1034">He went to New Brunswick to take on the job, my mother and I stayed in Montreal so that she could continue working.</span> <span id="s1035">And as an intern, you know, it’s hardly enough to support a family, so they -- we lived in separate places for awhile, for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1036">But he even weathered that, and I came across some of the clippings in the newspaper in getting ready to talk to you just the other day and I didn’t realize the splash that all this made in the newspapers across Canada, that, you know, the government was employing enemy aliens to -- who were taking advantage and taking the money from our people.</span> <span id="s1037">So you come from Germany, you come to Canada -- and of course, I was called a dirty Jew from Germany in school in Canada, where you know, the blinders were close to the head.</span> <span id="s1038">And it was not an easy time in Canada.</span> <span id="s1039">It was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: So how did you handle this?</span> <span id="s1041">Coming from Germany and hearing this in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: With great difficulty.</span> <span id="s1043">With very, very great difficulty.</span> <span id="s1044">But I did have Jewish friends in class, and I must say, I found -- I found my friends among Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1045">All -- practically only Jewish children in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1046">And we did not live in a Jewish section of Montreal at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Were -- were these other refugee children, or these were Canadians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: In -- they were can -- my friends were Canadian friends, but my mother circulated with a group o-of refugees because in Montreal they were quite a number and yes, she had -- well, she also had non -- she also had Canadian friends, but many not -- many Jewish friends who, like ourselves came over at one time or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: What about the teachers in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: The teachers in general were absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s1051">I had never of -- I -- been so well received, and the principal of the school was really -- they were trying so hard to make me comfortable, and they did.</span> <span id="s1052">And I had a very -- I had a happy time in Montreal in school -- well, you know, you always have one teacher that’s maybe not so great.</span> <span id="s1053">But I would say, generally speaking, they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1054">And in the Maritimes they could not have been nicer.</span> <span id="s1055">They were very accepting.</span> <span id="s1056">Na -- but nobody ever asked me about where I’m from or why I’m here.</span> <span id="s1057">Nobody, even when I went to college, nobody ever brought up the subject.</span> <span id="s1058">And with a name like Fischer, y-ye -- and I had no accent, nobody even suspected.</span> <span id="s1059">And it’s interesting in these last few years was the first time that my college friends and my high school friends, with whom I’m still in touch, some of whom I’m still in touch, posed questions to me.</span> <span id="s1060">I-I think they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1061">They didn’t want to rub salt into wounds.</span> <span id="s1062">I would have been very happy to talk.</span> <span id="s1063">I think I would have.</span> <span id="s1064">In -- in college I would have, but nobody ever asked, and I wouldn’t -- you know, I wouldn’t speak on my own.</span> <span id="s1065">In fact, I’ve not spoken too much, although I have with my children, I’ve told them a fair amount.</span> <span id="s1066">Not everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Your -- your father was in the Maritime provinces, you were in Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did you go back and forth to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s1071">In the summer, I was sent to camp and my mother went to visit my father.</span> <span id="s1072">It was just too expensive.</span> <span id="s1073">I -- I went to Y camp, and one summer I stayed with friends who invited me to stay with them while Mother visited my father.</span> <span id="s1074">And then other -- then I went to summer camp.</span> <span id="s1075">One summer, the first summer, I think it was the summer of ’39 -- the summer of ’39, my mother and father were engaged to be camp doctor and nurse and I was allowed to go along as addition.</span> <span id="s1076">And I was a camper, and they were in charge of things and that gave us all a little vacation in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Wa-Was this a Jewish camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yes, Camp Hiawatha.</span> <span id="s1079">Yes, it was a Jewish camp and my mother met and was very, very friendly with one of the counselors there, and it was a lifelong friendship that continued til both of them really passed away.</span> <span id="s1080">In fact, Sophie came and visited my mother here when my mother was in the nine -- in her 90’s.</span> <span id="s1081">Sophie was a bit younger.</span> <span id="s1082">The Sophie that I mention is interesting because she’s a poet -- was a poet, Sophie Yellen, and was one of Canada’s outstanding poets.</span> <span id="s1083">And si -- the friendship continued and a wonderful one it was.</span> <span id="s1084">All happened in Hiawatha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Did you have, or did your parents have any correspondence or connection with the people back in -- ya -- the family back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Well, that’s a very interesting question, because yes, they tried to have and they have letters to their mothers until the war broke out, which was only a year.</span> <span id="s1087">And after that, there was no more correspondence.</span> <span id="s1088">But when my father knew that somebody was going -- traveling from Montreal to the Maritime provinces, or from the Maritime provinces back to Montreal, depending on where he was, he would always ask them would they mail a letter in the one stop that the train made in the United States.</span> <span id="s1089">And so yes, they got mail over to them, a-at least to let them know that things were going well for us, even though the only -- they could only write to the States, and then States would send us the mail.</span> <span id="s1090">So that -- that was very di -- that was traumatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Did you write to your grandparents?</span> <span id="s1092">A: I don’t know that I did.</span> <span id="s1093">I don’t know that I did.</span> <span id="s1094">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1095">I think those little blue letters were very, very closely written upon and I think maybe I signed my name, but I don’t re -- I don’t recall writing to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1097">And then as the war proceeded in the early, you know, early 40’s, did you as a child know what was happening?</span> <span id="s1098">What was your world like during the war in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: My world was totally consumed with the war.</span> <span id="s1100">My father used to keep a map on the wall and punch pins into where the Germans were, and especially once the war started, how the movements of the Germans were taking place, how the forces were progressing, both into the east zone towards Russia, as well as out to -- through France and into Holland.</span> <span id="s1101">And we would listen to news every night, of course, and as many times during the day as, you know, as there were news on, which wasn’t always our time.</span> <span id="s1102">I mean, the news came on at seven o’clock and everybody was sitting around.</span> <span id="s1103">And I think it was the most trying of times because my father was trying to tell people in Canada what was happening and nobody listened.</span> <span id="s1104">My father brought out clippings from newspapers, German newspapers that he hid in slatted areas of his suitcases.</span> <span id="s1105">He hid them in the linings of the suitcases, to show the powers that be on this side of the ocean what was happening because nobody was listening and nobody wanted to believe what was going on.</span> <span id="s1106">Fortunately, he did not get caught, because when he was called one time to the police station -- and he was called many times -- he was very afraid that they might have found something because he was clipping, he was clipping newspaper articles right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Clipping from which papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Newspa -- the German newspapers.</span> <span id="s1109">He was taking sections out of newspapers to bring here to this side of the ocean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: -- in order to tell people who were so unbelieving, of s -- things that were happening that didn’t make papers here, and people weren’t willing to listen.</span> <span id="s1112">You know, when you read what Steven Wise couldn’t even get through.</span> <span id="s1113">Nobody listened, nobody.</span> <span id="s1114">And nobody wanted to.</span> <span id="s1115">They didn’t want to believe.</span> <span id="s1116">So you asked -- I was -- I was totally consumed with the war.</span> <span id="s1117">I would come in from school and listen.</span> <span id="s1118">I listened.</span> <span id="s1119">It was almost a way of life, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Were -- were your fam -- was your family aware of what was happening to the Jews specifically during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Oh, oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s1122">Not -- well, they saw the beginnings of it all when people disappeared and people just didn’t make it back from the police stations or they were snatched out of their beds.</span> <span id="s1123">I mean, that was happening all around.</span> <span id="s1124">And it was 1938.</span> <span id="s1125">Things were not at all tranquil, even -- even in Silesia.</span> <span id="s1126">I think there was much fear, there was much fear and there was the constant hope that we could bring the mothers out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: What happened to your grandmother in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: My grandmother in Berlin was in a round-up and was put on a train and died in the cattle car on her way to Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Her name was Unni Haushner -- Unni Rosenber -- Rosenbaum Haushner.</span> <span id="s1131">She had two children, my mother and Uncle Ludz and Ludz was the younger of the two and he was smuggled out of Germany by his non-Jewish girlfriend and made it to the States in ’39, the war had already started, and made it to Chicago, and signed up almost immediately for the army.</span> <span id="s1132">And what I’m trying to find out at this point in time is whether he might have been one of the Ritchie boys.</span> <span id="s1133">The Ritchie boys, the German Jewish people who came over who became interpreters and who were sent back to Germany in the army to help with language things.</span> <span id="s1134">Because he did indeed go into the army and became an interpreter and stayed in Germany after the war had finished to help with the -- with translations for the Nuremberg Trials.</span> <span id="s1135">But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1136">I’m trying to find out whether he might have been a Ritchie boy because there’s been some interesting information.</span> <span id="s1137">Ritchie boys, the camp that was started here in Maryland that trained linguists -- he might have been, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1138">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: How did he get into the United States now, and you all couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Well, that’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s1141">He established -- well, I -- I think that he was able to come through an uncle on my mother’s side who declared him as being very well versed in the canning industry.</span> <span id="s1142">I think that may have been it.</span> <span id="s1143">He worked for my grandfather, I mean how -- he -- and he was trained in the chemical aspects of this canning business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s1146">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1147">You were already in Canada when Kristallnacht happened in November ’38.</span> <span id="s1148">How did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Well, I think we probably learned about it through the radio, a-and of course knew at once that if synagogues were the targets, ours, both in Ratibor and in Breslau were undoubtedly part of the picture, and indeed they were.</span> <span id="s1150">I don’t know that we knew the particulars, but I do know that my father said, and they didn’t burn part of that synagogue because there were stores around the synagogue that were in hands of Germans, close to the wall around or near the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1151">So part of the building was destroyed, and part of it was not.</span> <span id="s1152">But the [indecipherable] synagogue, which is the one that my parents and grandparent went in -- we-were in -- were members of and where my grandparents had pews, strangely enough next to each other, we know that that -- we knew that that synagogue was badly damaged in part.</span> <span id="s1153">And the pictures have borne that out.</span> <span id="s1154">They’re in the process of restoring that synagogue at this point in time, but what I learned -- what we learned, and of course to the horror of everyone, oh we -- we learned through the radio and then also I believe there must have been notification by mail as to what -- what was damaged.</span> <span id="s1155">Interestingly enough, I think that my father and his mother probably had sort of an understanding of what was going to be said in a -- in a code sort of way, as to the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: This was a code between the two of them so you wouldn’t understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: No, so that -- so -- all the letters were censored at that point and they did not want the censors to be aware.</span> <span id="s1158">And I know that certain people’s names were mentioned, and never with a surname, and maybe with Uncle John did such and such, and you kind of knew what was going on and I do remember the last letter that my grandmother wrote.</span> <span id="s1159">She wrote that she needed some tea, would we be able to send her some tea, and that was the last -- that was the last letter that we ever received from her.</span> <span id="s1160">And in all the letters, it was a little bit upbeat, in I am very well, but -- or -- or I am very well, and then period, and then could you possibly send me some tea.</span> <span id="s1161">And we knew that that was a very bad sign.</span> <span id="s1162">About Kristallnacht itself, other than hearing it, and of course my parents just speechless with the news that was coming in, I still see us sitting around the radio, the whole family and really despairing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: You must have been a very old nine year old by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: My mother always said -- she said -- of herself, she said, I had a childhood, you never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s1165">And I think it’s true.</span> <span id="s1166">I don’t think I ever did.</span> <span id="s1167">And what can I say?</span> <span id="s1168">I didn’t have a childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1170">Any other experiences you can remember about during the wartime while you were in Canada?</span> <span id="s1171">I mean, you said your father followed the progress of the war with the pins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Well, in our Canadian schools, a lot of English guest children came over and so we had many guest children in our classes.</span> <span id="s1173">People who opted to send their kids overseas until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1174">And I had a very, very dear friend, Monya Williams was her name and we stayed in touch for awhile after she went back home.</span> <span id="s1175">And life in Canada, as life was here was -- had rationing, we had a lot of rationing.</span> <span id="s1176">I think you probably had more rationing than we did, but it was as my mother always used to say, this isn’t rationing.</span> <span id="s1177">She went through the first World War, and she said this was just equalizing things out.</span> <span id="s1178">It was, you know, very, very little rationing per se.</span> <span id="s1179">Nobody ever went hungry.</span> <span id="s1180">And during the war -- a-as a child during the war I rolled bandages.</span> <span id="s1181">I went down to Red Cross headquarters on Saturdays and I helped served coffee.</span> <span id="s1182">My mother also w-worked for the Red Cross at the -- at the blood donating centers.</span> <span id="s1183">I work -- I -- I helped when we had service personnel come to the Jewish u -- like a USO.</span> <span id="s1184">We went and we washed dishes and we served sandwiches to the young soldiers who were coming through.</span> <span id="s1185">And this was a little bit later on, this was when the soldiers were coming through the Maritime provinces to get on the ships to send them overseas.</span> <span id="s1186">The Jewish lads had a place to come to to dance and to write letters and just to have a good time, and we teenagers were allowed to help and that was always -- that was very nice.</span> <span id="s1187">I had a job very early on.</span> <span id="s1188">I tried to get a job in Montreal painting signs, but they thought maybe 11 was too young to get a jo -- to give anybody a job.</span> <span id="s1189">But I used to sometimes walk to Sunday school -- to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1190">I did go to Hebrew school in Montreal, we went to Shaar Hashomayim, which is a very beautiful, large synagogue and I had Hebrew twice a week and I had Sunday school, but most of the time I either walked, or more than likely I took the tram, if I wasn’t lucky enough to get a ride in the Bronsman car.</span> <span id="s1191">Now, the Bronsman kids, Charlie and Edgar were classmates of mine at Shaar Hashomayim, and they had a -- a driver who drove them back and forth from class to Hebrew school, and once in awhile we got rides with them, and that was very nice because they had chocolate milk on the cars and the rest of us usually just got white milk.</span> <span id="s1192">And my mother, as a matter of fact, in her -- in her physiotherapy capacity massaged -- gave massages to Mrs. Bronsman.</span> <span id="s1193">And I remember very well in Montreal my mother did the Bronsman job, I guess once a week and she would have to walk, because of course she didn’t have a car and the streetcar or the bus would only carry her so far, and she would have to walk up Westmount.</span> <span id="s1194">Now mind you, the Bronsmans lived up on the very top of the hill and there certainly wasn’t a -- a bus going up there.</span> <span id="s1195">And so she marched in the cold of winter.</span> <span id="s1196">And Montreal can be very icy in wintertime and she got such chilblains, and I remember she came home, her legs were just so cold.</span> <span id="s1197">I remember weeping and thinking how she was suffering.</span> <span id="s1198">And I asked her about it a number of years back and I said, Mother, I used to cry so, because I was so unhappy that you had such hard work.</span> <span id="s1199">And she said oh, she said, you know, I look back on this and she said it was such a good time.</span> <span id="s1200">It was the only time in my life, when we lived in Montreal, where I was an independent woman and where I carried the family on my shoulders, and she said that was very satisfying.</span> <span id="s1201">I go -- I -- I’ve mulled that over many, many times, and indeed it was.</span> <span id="s1202">She did wonderful work in -- in her capacity as therapist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: So, did you experience any anti-Semitism during the war years in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: I would say, other than being called names in school every now and again, dirty Jew from Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: -- I would say those were really very few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Ho-How would you respond when that happened?</span> <span id="s1208">A: I think I just walked away from it.</span> <span id="s1209">I don’t think that I could respond to it.</span> <span id="s1210">I would think I could not.</span> <span id="s1211">I still recall exactly where these encounters took place, and they were not in sight of the teachers, they were when we were having recess, either playing marbles, or downstairs.</span> <span id="s1212">On very cold days we were -- we were just mulling around and sitting on the benches and so on for -- for a little time out.</span> <span id="s1213">And it wasn’t the boys as much as the girls that were nasty.</span> <span id="s1214">But maybe girls are nastier to each other anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Did you tell your parents about these incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s1217">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1218">Probably not, I think -- I think I just did not want them to worry about things more than they did.</span> <span id="s1219">They had -- they had so many worries on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s1220">My father, who couldn’t work and who wanted so much to work.</span> <span id="s1221">And y -- no -- you know, no money coming in.</span> <span id="s1222">My mother, who worked so hard, and nothing in the offing for my father and that must have been, to the kind of person that he was, a tremendous blow.</span> <span id="s1223">And -- however, he had a fantastic sense of humor all -- all his life, and I think maybe it even helped him then when things looked so bleak.</span> <span id="s1224">And I think the frustration that he carried within him, having so much information, wanting to tell people -- he even was in touch with a writer from the newspaper who was the son of somebody who knew somebody, you know, closer, and not just the man on the street.</span> <span id="s1225">And nobody wanting to believe.</span> <span id="s1226">I think that must have been so frustrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1228">Did you feel German at that point?</span> <span id="s1229">Canadian, Jewish?</span> <span id="s1230">How would you describe yourself during the war years in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Well, I didn’t feel Canadian, certainly not.</span> <span id="s1232">Everything was very strange to me.</span> <span id="s1233">I didn’t feel German.</span> <span id="s1234">I guess I felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s1235">And maybe not by choice, but I was made to feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s1236">Not that, you know, not that I wouldn’t say I was Jewish, but I think yes, I think I was made to feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s1237">I remember a sad thing.</span> <span id="s1238">I was walking in front of a shop one day, looking at some baked goods in the bakery store, I’d -- would feast my eyes on all these good, good things.</span> <span id="s1239">And there was my father, I didn’t realize that he was in back of me, looking at me -- so he tells me, and I’m sure it’s true -- with not enough change in his pocket to buy me the little roll that I wanted, that I would have liked to have had.</span> <span id="s1240">It -- I think, you know, these are such small things in the scheme of things, but such humiliating and -- and depressing reactions.</span> <span id="s1241">I mean, I think of it often.</span> <span id="s1242">I’m sure he never thought of it that much any more after the fact.</span> <span id="s1243">He was a realist, it couldn’t happen at that point.</span> <span id="s1244">I, on the other hand, internalized the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1245">And -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: And so you made -- you continued to make friends though, when -- y-you were talking about during those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Yes, I had -- I made friends, I had no trouble making friends.</span> <span id="s1248">Made good friends.</span> <span id="s1249">And then, of course, I was in Montreal only fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh -- four years in Montreal and then we moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where my father got the job as an intern, but we were not able to join him until the four years were over and h-he was able to get an apartment and get enough money to support us, because my mother did not work after we came to Saint John.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: And then how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: And we stayed in Saint John -- well, I was married in Saint John.</span> <span id="s1252">So I think my parents moved in 1955.</span> <span id="s1253">My father got his citizenship in 1945 or ’46, and then took his Dominion Council exams and passed his exams so that he could go into practice, which he did, and then he be -- he became a diabetic and had some physical problems and so it was thought that he should give up private practice and go into a hospital situation, which he did in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</span> <span id="s1254">And it was a psychiatric hospital there, and he was in charge of all the woman patients, I think, at that hospital.</span> <span id="s1255">And he stayed there until he retired and he was -- that was ’78, I guess.</span> <span id="s1256">So he was there quite a number of years and they made a very happy life in Halifax.</span> <span id="s1257">Saint John was a very small town, little in-bred.</span> <span id="s1258">I mean, it was very small in every way.</span> <span id="s1259">And moving to Halifax was really a nice thing for them to do because first of all it was a beautiful city and then it had the stimulation of having a university there.</span> <span id="s1260">Two, as a matter -- three -- three universities, with a lot of cultural things going in, which they loved.</span> <span id="s1261">And they got a house on the Dartmouth side of the -- of the city and then they joined us.</span> <span id="s1262">When my father -- when my father retired, he wanted to move Mom and himself down to Knoxville, which they did.</span> <span id="s1263">They came and they joined us in Knoxville and were there a couple of years when my husband was called by the NIH to come and work here and to head the department of blood diseases.</span> <span id="s1264">And so my parents said, well we’d like to go back to Halifax.</span> <span id="s1265">With heavy heart.</span> <span id="s1266">They -- they did not want to come to the Washington area.</span> <span id="s1267">So they moved back to Halifax and had many more good years in Halifax until my father died and then my mother did indeed come to visit -- I mean, come to stay with us, and that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Let’s go back a little bit in time, to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1269">What was it like for you when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Oh, it was the most freeing, wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1271">I remember being in camp, and my father sending me information about the victory, and all hell broke loose in camp.</span> <span id="s1272">This was Canadian camp, you know?</span> <span id="s1273">And it was such a freeing -- it was like tearing away ropes that bound one’s chest, really.</span> <span id="s1274">And of course, with it came the realization that even though the war was over, there were so many gone.</span> <span id="s1275">I remember, for example, in the middle of one night when my mother woke us all up screaming.</span> <span id="s1276">And this was in the 40’s, the early 40’s.</span> <span id="s1277">And to this day she thinks that was the day that her mother was killed.</span> <span id="s1278">And -- and probably it was.</span> <span id="s1279">Probably it was.</span> <span id="s1280">But the fact that the war was over was -- at least the European part of the war was over.</span> <span id="s1281">This was not yet the end because -- but Canadian forces were not in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1282">So in a way, for us that war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: During the war, during the latter parts of the war, did your family know anything about the camps, or did that come out only later for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: You know, I had the feeling that they did know about the camps because there were some camps that were already in existence when we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s1285">Mauthausen for one, and Dachau.</span> <span id="s1286">So, I think they were very well aware of what was going on, and I don’t know, but they kept in very close touch with friends who had also emigrated, and when one got, you know, word about anything, that they would share with the adults, not the -- not the children.</span> <span id="s1287">And as I say, for many years my father tried so desperately to get the grandmothers out, and would go to the States in order to do some of his work.</span> <span id="s1288">I mean, up to Ottawa, down here to this area.</span> <span id="s1289">But there was -- there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1291">So the war is over, did the camp celebrate at all, or did you celebrate in any specific way?</span> <span id="s1292">Was it a Jewish camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: No.</span> <span id="s1294">No, I don’t think there was a celebration.</span> <span id="s1295">I can’t -- I can’t -- I can’t -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: And you were 16 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1298">Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: In 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yeah, I w -- yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: And then what happened, just generally with your life, from 16 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Well, I’ll tell you a wonderful thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1303">After all -- after the war was over, my parents wanted to adopt a child from a DP camp.</span> <span id="s1304">And indeed they did.</span> <span id="s1305">Our darling Saul came to us -- my father had wanted to have a son, a boy come.</span> <span id="s1306">He didn’t have a boy of his own, I think, and he probably thought it was best not to have another girl.</span> <span id="s1307">So arrangements were made through the Canadian -- mm, I can’t think of the organization, but it was a refugee organization, and in time Saul arrived with a number of other children who were brought to Canada, for whom homes were found, and he came to live with us.</span> <span id="s1308">And he came, I was away in college already and when I came home from college, here was this new addition to the family.</span> <span id="s1309">Well, as it turned out, he was with us for awhile, and when he gain -- when he realized the kind of person Mom and Dad were, he said, you know, I really have a mother, but I was afraid -- a -- a blood mother who survived -- and -- but I want -- I needed to get -- I wanted to get out and the only way to get out was to declare myself as an orphan, which is how he got into Canada, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: How old was he and where was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: He was from Poland, I re -- I don’t know the name of the town.</span> <span id="s1312">I think I can look it up, but I don’t know the name of the town.</span> <span id="s1313">And his mother and one sister survived.</span> <span id="s1314">The rest of his family, his father and his other brothers and sisters did not, but these two survived.</span> <span id="s1315">And of course as soon as my father heard that there was blood kin, he did his level best to get them out and -- and did.</span> <span id="s1316">And, as a matter of fact, next week I am going to Los Angeles to be present at the Bar Mitzvah of his grandson.</span> <span id="s1317">And we have kept in close touch.</span> <span id="s1318">Saul stayed with my family for a number of years, went to high school in Saint John, stayed with Mom and Dad and then decided he would like to go to Montreal where there were more Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1319">And he became a typesetter and type -- was able to do typesetting in English and Fren-French and in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1320">And then got a job in Los Angeles and took his mother and sister to Los Angeles, and that’s where he is today.</span> <span id="s1321">He married a girl from Poland, from his village, and as I say, we’re going to see them next week.</span> <span id="s1322">They have come to all our simchas, we have tried to be at theirs.</span> <span id="s1323">And it’s a very happy and wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s1324">It’s -- it’s a different sort o -- probably not like a kin -- an -- a blood kin relationship, but it’s a wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s1325">And there isn’t a week that goes by that we don’t talk.</span> <span id="s1326">And he’s a lot of health issues with his wife over the last six months and I think I talked to him every other day.</span> <span id="s1327">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: HoHo-w old was he when he came to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: 16.</span> <span id="s1330">He was a little younger than -- no, he was 14, he was 14, yeah.</span> <span id="s1331">And it -- it was something that I know my mom and dad wanted to do it and you know, you never know how things work out, but I think this worked out very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What was his last name -- what is his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Saul S-Silvershein -- Silvershein, but he changed it to Saul Silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1335">So you finished high school, you went on to college, where did you go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: I went to college in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Dalhousie University and I studied chemistry.</span> <span id="s1337">Not by choice, I wanted to go to art school, but my parents wouldn’t let me go to art school, I had to do something practical with which I could earn my keep and preferably not something that required a change of language.</span> <span id="s1338">And being the good daughter that I was, I did not fight the thing, this was ordained, my father had said so, and I did it.</span> <span id="s1339">I went to college, I did well in school, and ended up going to graduate school at the University of Chicago in microbiology, for which the province paid.</span> <span id="s1340">Then I -- but then I met my husband and that’s the tale.</span> <span id="s1341">I met my husband while I was at the University of Chicago, at international house.</span> <span id="s1342">I w -- I, as an international student and he as a good representative of American-hood.</span> <span id="s1343">He was in a residency at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1344">And it was love at first sight and we got married in 1953 in Saint John, New Brunswick, my parents were still living in Saint John, and we moved to Saint Louis, where he finished his residency and our first child was born in Saint Louis, David.</span> <span id="s1345">And then we moved to Durham, North Carolina where he was at Duke and Susan was born.</span> <span id="s1346">And then we moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he headed a research unit of the University of Tennessee and Judy was born, and then we didn’t move any more, until we moved here.</span> <span id="s1347">It was too late then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Whe-When did you move to the Washington area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: About 20 years ago, which would have been -- well, 25 almost, 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: 1980.</span> <span id="s1352">And our kids went on to make good lives for themselves.</span> <span id="s1353">David is at Cornell, he’s a professor at Cornell.</span> <span id="s1354">Our daughter Susan is an attorney in Chicago with two children, and Judy, who is a physician, lives in Laurel and she has two children.</span> <span id="s1355">So we are so blessed with four grandchildren, and good kids all the way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Di-Did you say earlier that you had gone back to Germany?</span> <span id="s1357">Can you tell me about that?</span> <span id="s1358">A: Last year, plans were made to take the children, our three children to Germany.</span> <span id="s1359">We had plans ready in action, and unfortunately I got sick.</span> <span id="s1360">Now, whether this was a return of the paralysis, I don’t know, but I really did get ill, and it was advised that I not go.</span> <span id="s1361">It was a cardiac thing and it was deemed not -- not good to take any long trips, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: -- we did not go.</span> <span id="s1364">I have not been back, not ever been back.</span> <span id="s1365">I shouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s1366">I went -- that’s to my hometown -- hometowns.</span> <span id="s1367">I did go back.</span> <span id="s1368">Amos had to deliver a lecture in Berlin and I had an old aunt who survived the war.</span> <span id="s1369">A non-Jewish wife of a brother of my grandfather’s who survived the war in Berlin, and we -- since Amos went to gi -- talk there, I wanted to see her because she really was a favorite of the family.</span> <span id="s1370">And she did survive and we did see her and we had a wonderful visit.</span> <span id="s1371">So yes, I’ve been back to Berlin, but only to see her and I saw nothing of Berlin, I just saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: That was purposeful, not to see anything of Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1374">I think so.</span> <span id="s1375">I really -- I wa -- I don’t think I was up to it, really, but I did want to see her because she was a very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: What year was this?</span> <span id="s1377">How long ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: It must have been in the 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1380">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s1383">This is tape number four, side A. Let’s now talk about some of your thoughts and feelings about what you went through.</span> <span id="s1384">You said before that your mother had said you really didn’t have a childhood.</span> <span id="s1385">Do you agree with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: I do.</span> <span id="s1387">And I’ll tell you, to this day, though I have a large circle of friends, I am still an outsider.</span> <span id="s1388">I still feel myself as removed from others.</span> <span id="s1389">Not that there -- not that I don’t have friends, I have plenty of friends, but I’m still the one who’s looking in.</span> <span id="s1390">And some days I find this rather discouraging.</span> <span id="s1391">I think -- I think that in my artwork, a lot of it has dealt with Holocaust and Holocaust issues, and even there I feel as though there is a layer between me, my work -- me and my -- and friends, and I don’t know how else to explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Do you feel in a sense that you are like -- you are two people, one person on the inside and one person on the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: I guess so, because most people think I’m rather a jolly person, that I am full of fun and games and beans.</span> <span id="s1394">And I can be that person, but I -- I’m not that person.</span> <span id="s1395">I’m really reserved and I am withdrawn at times.</span> <span id="s1396">I get very easily depressed, and I have kept a journal of some of my thoughts, not -- not often, but there are times.</span> <span id="s1397">I have insomnia.</span> <span id="s1398">And I have the dreadful need -- and I say dreadful because I dread it, I guess, I have to read every scrap of Holocaust literature I can put my hands on.</span> <span id="s1399">Whether I can find an adequate answer to something, or when I look at broadcasts on the television, I’m looking for those people that are no longer in my life.</span> <span id="s1400">I look for my grandmothers everywhere and I keep saying sometime I’m going to see them again.</span> <span id="s1401">And I busy myself in -- in a quiet way, with many of the questions of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1402">And I’ve tried to read not only people who -- work of people who have gone through it, but of authorities who have written about it, and studies that have been -- psychological studies that have been done.</span> <span id="s1403">I guess I’m trying to answer, who am I. And -- and it all has made me what I am today, I guess, but I’d like to know, you know, why.</span> <span id="s1404">I often say oh, if life had been different and if I had -- if this had happened and if that had happened.</span> <span id="s1405">But everybody says that.</span> <span id="s1406">You don’t have to be in -- in ma -- in my shoes or anybody else’s shoes, everybody asks that.</span> <span id="s1407">But I sometimes think my life would have been so different if times had been -- in th -- had run in a normal way and I had grown up in Germany and gone to school in Germany.</span> <span id="s1408">Maybe it wouldn’t have been as interesting at this point in time, but it would have been very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: You had said that you went back to Germany and visited your aunt, but that’s all you did.</span> <span id="s1410">Why did you not see more of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Well, for one thing we only had a few days in Berlin, being practical about this.</span> <span id="s1412">Amos was asked to give a lecture and we went and we came back.</span> <span id="s1413">I think I wasn’t ready to go back and I don’t believe it was easy to get to Breslau at that point in time.</span> <span id="s1414">Berlin was open, Breslau o -- I don’t think was a tourist place -- tourist -- not that it needed to be a tourist place, but I don’t think it was a place that wa -- I -- I -- we di -- we didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1415">I -- I -- I wish I -- I wish I could tell you more, but we didn’t, and it was a ma -- it was really a factor of time, and of fear, and of fear.</span> <span id="s1416">You know, you want to go back and you don’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s1417">We’ve gone back to places where we had visited.</span> <span id="s1418">We lived in Thailand for awhile and went back 30 years later and were so sorry as to what had happened to the country.</span> <span id="s1419">I like to remember it the way it was 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1420">Now, everything that I remember -- not everything, but things that I remember in the -- in Germany at the countryside, and meadows and -- and the beautiful winters and so on, they’re still there.</span> <span id="s1421">The h -- th-the houses and the buildings in my mind are still the ones that are there, they’re not there any more.</span> <span id="s1422">That area was terribly shot up, particularly the Russians took their guns to that area.</span> <span id="s1423">And I don’t -- perhaps didn’t know or didn’t want to know what had really happened.</span> <span id="s1424">Although some of my friends have gone back.</span> <span id="s1425">My friend in Israel has gone back several times.</span> <span id="s1426">But, interestingly enough, she is a year older than I am and couldn’t remember a thing.</span> <span id="s1427">And yet, I’m the visually one -- visually active one, and I can remember it and I -- no.</span> <span id="s1428">But I -- I think I’m ready to go back now.</span> <span id="s1429">I would like to be well and go next year, and we’re talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: What was it like though, when you put your foot down on German soil again, when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: I did not like it and I did not tell anybody that I could understand what they were saying, because I could.</span> <span id="s1432">I did not speak German, I spoke only in English.</span> <span id="s1433">And it’s very interesting when a German talks German to me, I question in my mind, where were you and where was your family?</span> <span id="s1434">Take an example.</span> <span id="s1435">My next door neighbor a few years ago was a couple.</span> <span id="s1436">He was from Germany, he was a writer for the Frankfurter Allgemeine, wonderful German, conservative German newspaper, a good newspaper, though.</span> <span id="s1437">He was married to a Spanish gal and they lived next door and it took me at least half a year before I could be comfortable with him.</span> <span id="s1438">They had since become perhaps our closest friends and neighbors.</span> <span id="s1439">They -- you know, if anybody could make me feel that maybe the younger generation today is different, he was the one.</span> <span id="s1440">I am still in touch with them, they have moved back to -- well, at this point to Spain.</span> <span id="s1441">He still is writing for the Frankfurter Allgemeine.</span> <span id="s1442">I watched their daughter grow up, I babysat with the daughter.</span> <span id="s1443">I have a little plant here that’s my little Laura plant because she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1444">They are -- he is such a dear person and he has -- the one who has sent me books on Ratibor and Breslau and tried to make contacts for me to make it easy for me to go back if I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1445">The dearest people in this world.</span> <span id="s1446">And I hope -- I hope that the young people today are like him because he’s an incredible person, maybe one of our best friends.</span> <span id="s1447">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Did you tell him about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1450">He asked and I told him, and he was also -- he was the first writer who wrote anything about the memorial -- the memorials, the Holocaust memorials in Florida.</span> <span id="s1451">He was -- and he had an interview, one of the very few interviews that were given by the chap who headed the memorial -- the Holocaust Memorial Center.</span> <span id="s1452">Now, he was the one from Israel -- was there one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Weinberg, Shaika Weinberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1455">He had one of the few interviews and had a two hour interview with him and was amazed and thrilled to have it.</span> <span id="s1456">He was often a visitor over there.</span> <span id="s1457">He was an un -- he’s an unusual person, to say the least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Are there any sights or sounds, smells, or anything that bring back the experience that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1460">Well, the sight of boots, leather boots, black leather boots.</span> <span id="s1461">Not suede boots, but black -- shiny, black leather boots, and the rhythm of the -- of this -- o -- th-the marching rhythm really, really bothers me very much.</span> <span id="s1462">Now, on the other hand, I can listen to Wagner music and be absolutely thrilled by it and where’s the logic there?</span> <span id="s1463">There is no such thing as logic.</span> <span id="s1464">Smells, I don’t think I’m at all aware of.</span> <span id="s1465">And did -- did you say sights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Mm-hm, or sounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Sounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Which you talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: The sound -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: -- the beating of the -- of the cobblestones, feet on cobblestones, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Do you think in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: I count in German, I do my sums in German.</span> <span id="s1474">I’m not very good at using a little machine, so I -- I do all my math in German.</span> <span id="s1475">I read German, I -- I would say I’m fluent in every day German.</span> <span id="s1476">I read slowly, stuff that’s a little bit more complicated, because after all, I kind of stopped talking German when I came to Canada and my parents wanted to improve their English, so of course I had spoke English to my parents.</span> <span id="s1477">But -- but I did speak German, and -- when I went home, Mother and I always did try to keep it up at least a little.</span> <span id="s1478">But I feel comfortable speaking German ma -- if I know who I’m talking to.</span> <span id="s1479">Otherwise I don’t open my mouth and let on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I don’t like to think -- I don’t li -- th-there is a sound in the German language when I sometime hear people speak, that rarely there is a brashness about the language that bothers me.</span> <span id="s1482">If I know that they are German Germans, I-I just -- I don’t react.</span> <span id="s1483">I can listen and know exactly what they’re talking about.</span> <span id="s1484">But there is a manner, there is a brusqueness ab -- the German tongue in some -- some people that I find a little difficult to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: When your -- when your children were the ages -- the age that you were, seven, eight, nine, when you were going through those difficult times in Europe, did that bring back th -- your childhood experiences even more vividly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: I guess I was -- I was a tougher mother probably, than I needed to be.</span> <span id="s1487">I was probably a more careful mother, in many respects a stricter mother.</span> <span id="s1488">My children tells -- tell me that I was fairly strict.</span> <span id="s1489">But I guess the -- the inclination is to -- to now let anything happen, to be careful, to not see them hurt, as I was.</span> <span id="s1490">They had very good rapport with each other and with their cohorts and I think they had very happy childhood and very often I was just peeking in.</span> <span id="s1491">I’m not sure I answered your question very well.</span> <span id="s1492">Pose it to me again, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: I -- I was just thinking, when your children were the same age, when they were seven, eight and nine, when you were going through these difficult times in Europe, did you look at them and did it make you think of your age -- what you went through at that time?</span> <span id="s1494">When --</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Yes, I think particularly with the -- with the two girls.</span> <span id="s1496">Not so much with my son.</span> <span id="s1497">I could identify less with him, of course.</span> <span id="s1498">But yes, I -- I guess I -- I did, I -- I did think -- I did think so often how fortunate, how fortunate they were to be born in this country and to live in this wonderful, wonderful country, of which I became a citizen, not too long ago.</span> <span id="s1499">I did not -- I was a Canadian citizen for a long period of time and then when I started to critique the government, I was told I better take out citizenship.</span> <span id="s1500">You cannot criticize -- well, the story was ma -- my husband needed Q clearance for his work, and so ah -- I -- I did take out my citizenship and it was a very formal thing in Knoxville, Tennessee in the old-fashioned way and it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1501">It was a day to remember.</span> <span id="s1502">And my children were there and they were just sorry I couldn’t become the president of the United States, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Did you tell your children as they were growing up, about your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: You know, it -- it’s interesting, I did and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1505">I think I -- I was hesitant until they asked questions and then when they asked questions I tried to answer as truthfully as I could.</span> <span id="s1506">On the other hand they, like I, did not want to rub, you know, salt into any wounds.</span> <span id="s1507">They did not want to put me into a situation that would make it hard on me, as I did to my mother, because I did not want to hurt her.</span> <span id="s1508">I -- I did share with them, especially the school experiences.</span> <span id="s1509">I di -- I shielded them, I think, a great deal as to what happened to the grandmothers.</span> <span id="s1510">I just -- I couldn’t talk about it and obviously they couldn’t either.</span> <span id="s1511">But we watched together many offerings on television which prompted questioning, and I was tra -- I tried to answer as best I could, what I thought was appropriate for their ages.</span> <span id="s1512">So in a way I did share.</span> <span id="s1513">But I think -- I think now -- I think now that more is being written and more is known.</span> <span id="s1514">The children today -- I mean, my -- my grown children today feel freer to ask me and I am able to answer them, perhaps a little bit better than before.</span> <span id="s1515">And even my grandchildren have asked me questions and I’m very willing to answer.</span> <span id="s1516">And my grandchildren range in age from 13 to 17.</span> <span id="s1517">So I have a good range there, and they -- the thi -- the youngest one, who has just turned 13, is the only one who has not yet been really exposed to things.</span> <span id="s1518">But were he to ask, I would certainly be able to -- to answer, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through and your family had to go through and pay the price that it did and people living in this country didn’t have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s1521">But you know, on the other hand, I am so grateful that things turned out relatively well for our family.</span> <span id="s1522">And they did.</span> <span id="s1523">I sometimes am very angry that the world didn’t respond.</span> <span id="s1524">On the other hand, we were so lucky and I feel so blessed that I have come -- I’m much less angry now than I was at one time, and I think that in my early adult years, I was very angry.</span> <span id="s1525">But I think, as I’m getting older I’m -- I’m seeing it perhaps more in perspective.</span> <span id="s1526">And I think the -- who in the world would have known, or would have believed what was happening?</span> <span id="s1527">I mean, the whole thing is so in-inconceivable.</span> <span id="s1528">That’s why I think I -- I-I -- I am much more aware and -- and worried about places like Darfur, because again the world is silent.</span> <span id="s1529">But not quite as silent as they were then because we were inoculated at that point with a -- with a virus, if you will.</span> <span id="s1530">So I cannot -- you know, I -- I’m far less angry now than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Were you involved in any way in the civil rights movement because you came from a country that deprived many people of their civil rights, did you respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: I was very involved in the civil rights movement.</span> <span id="s1533">We lived in Knoxville, Tennessee and we lived there during the marches, and we lived there during the sit-ins and we lived there during the non-mixing of the races, and I was very involved.</span> <span id="s1534">I took part in sit-ins in the south when it wasn’t exactly a picnic to do that.</span> <span id="s1535">And I was one of the very, very few white people who became a counselor at a black -- a mixed -- well, it was not mixed, it was a black camp, and I was maybe one of the few white people who, during those times went and taught at a camp when I was thr -- we were threatened.</span> <span id="s1536">The camp was threatened because it had some black and whites together.</span> <span id="s1537">But I felt strongly enough -- in fact, I felt so strongly about going to that camp, my little Judy was 18 months old and I took her in her stroller to that camp.</span> <span id="s1538">I felt that if -- you know, maybe we didn’t have the money with which to -- to -- to give large donations, I felt my place was to do the right thing, and so I -- it was very close to that movement and we always had friends who were -- black friends who came to our house and with whom we, you know, worked together.</span> <span id="s1539">My husband was the first one who gave a black person a job at the University of Tennessee Memorial Research Center.</span> <span id="s1540">Yes, we were very involved, always have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Do you think that’s because of your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1543">It’s also because we’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1544">That’s -- that’s our religion, and we have to live it.</span> <span id="s1545">And that was one way of doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Which was going to be my next question about what your thoughts are about being Jewish, after all your family suffered because -- and you did too, because you were Jewish, I was just wondering what your thoughts on that subject was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: More Jewish than ever.</span> <span id="s1548">Not necessarily in the religious sense, but in the way of life sense of doing the right thing and supporting the right causes.</span> <span id="s1549">And helping where help is needed and living the exemplary life that our religion teaches us to live.</span> <span id="s1550">And you know, whether I go to sh -- s -- Shabbat services every Saturday, that’s not my thing.</span> <span id="s1551">I go, I do gis -- I -- I go to Yizker services and I go to the high holiday services, and I do go to Sabbath services.</span> <span id="s1552">But to me it’s the -- it’s the every day life.</span> <span id="s1553">And I -- I hope I have instilled that in my children, because one of my children worked for the brown lung situation, has worked in the mountains of Appalachia, doing good work.</span> <span id="s1554">And they’ve taken synagogue activities very seriously, but not the -- maybe not the little things, but in helping the homeless and that sort of a thing, so I think they’re instilled hopefully with -- with that -- those thoughts in mind.</span> <span id="s1555">Am I more religious?</span> <span id="s1556">Well, it depends what you call religious.</span> <span id="s1557">I li -- I live my life in the best way I know how to.</span> <span id="s1558">I serve on the Hevre Kadisha at my synagogue.</span> <span id="s1559">I did a lot of volunteer work when I was younger.</span> <span id="s1560">I taught Sunday school, all that good stuff.</span> <span id="s1561">Going to synagogue, depends.</span> <span id="s1562">I like to think that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: So being discriminated because you were Jewish, and losing relatives who were close to you because you were Jewish has not negated any of your feelings about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1565">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1566">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1567">I would say it may have reinforced the doing of the right thing at all times and be it in very simple and easy ways of doing the right thing or -- or making more difficult decisions.</span> <span id="s1568">It has not negated it.</span> <span id="s1569">I know many people left their religions on the other side of the ocean when they came over.</span> <span id="s1570">I was not one of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Nor were my parents, in fact, quite on the contrary.</span> <span id="s1573">It had ma -- made them more s -- much more religious and they too, fought for the good causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Let’s talk a little -- just more about some history.</span> <span id="s1575">When the Eichmann trial was going on in Jerusalem, what were your thoughts at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Get the bastard.</span> <span id="s1577">I don’t know, at that point I probably was in a way seeking revenge.</span> <span id="s1578">I -- I really can’t -- I can’t remember how I felt at the time.</span> <span id="s1579">I watched it diligently and I felt that Israel came up with the right answer.</span> <span id="s1580">Of killing him.</span> <span id="s1581">Putting him to his [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: If you -- if you hadn’t gone through what you did go through, do you think you would be a different person?</span> <span id="s1583">Are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: In what way are you the person you are today, attributed to your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: I think if I had lived in Germany and brought -- had been brought up in Germany, I would have had a -- a much more superficial kind of life.</span> <span id="s1587">I think I would have been a pampered daughter, certainly a pampered granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1588">I was the only granddaughter on both sides, and the apple, I guess, of many eyes and I think my life would have been very different.</span> <span id="s1589">I don’t know that I would have gone to university, I probably wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1590">I probably would have done something much more frivolous.</span> <span id="s1591">I’m not -- well, I don’t know, but I’m not so sure that causes would had stirred me so, as -- well certainly the civil rights cause did, but there were so many other causes that, you know, that my husband and I were associated with.</span> <span id="s1592">And he comes from a very, very strong Zionist background and his father was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1593">I’m sure Aba Chernoff thought his son married out of the faith, but -- I don’t keep a kosher house and that sort of thing, but I think -- and you know.</span> <span id="s1594">I-I don’t know, I think I would have been a -- a pampered girl in Germany.</span> <span id="s1595">Maybe not, but you know, this is speculation and life is life and I am just -- you know, I am so grateful, there isn’t a day that I don’t thank the fact that I’m here and that I’ve got four grandkids who are well and healthy and -- and life goes on.</span> <span id="s1596">And it’s -- it’s a good place to be at in -- in life because when Amos and I got married, life was not easy for us, but we muddled through somehow and -- and here we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff.</span> <span id="s1599">Tell me a little bit about your artwork.</span> <span id="s1600">What media do you work in, and what subjects?</span> <span id="s1601">You had mentioned the Holocaust before, and so if you could expand on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Well, I -- I was a frustrated art student when I was studying microbiology and really all my life wanted to go to art school.</span> <span id="s1603">Wasn’t allowed to because of other matters.</span> <span id="s1604">However, finally, after my children stayed in school til 3:30 in the afternoon, my husband urged me to do what I’ve always wanted to do and that was to go to art school, which I did.</span> <span id="s1605">I went to school at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.</span> <span id="s1606">And first I -- he had had a -- a second heart attack at that point in our story and I again thought well, I should go back to school and learn to do something that would prepare me to earn a living, God forbid, and thought I would study art education.</span> <span id="s1607">However, after the second class of art education I decided that was not for me under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s1608">Perhaps I should try the art school.</span> <span id="s1609">And he wanted very much to have me do that and so I did go to art school and I studied metalworking.</span> <span id="s1610">And I -- I learned how to s -- do metalsmithing, metalcasting and all aspects of the metal as an a -- as a tool, and taking a Master’s degree in Fine Arts at the university.</span> <span id="s1611">And worked in metals and also had to choose a second part and that was fibers, and so I took metals and fibers both, and then interesting situation arrived in the sense that after two years I was told -- and I was working part time because I still had the carpools and the kids and 18 puppies and all that sort of thing -- I was told I had to choose a thesis project.</span> <span id="s1612">And so I decided I would write a thesis on the history of the ceremonial objects pertaining to the Torah and make contemporary pieces based on the research of the history of each of these as implements on their own.</span> <span id="s1613">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1614">So I made breastplates and I made [indecipherable] pointers, and I proposed the [indecipherable] and I made the covering for the Torahs and I made mezuzahs and all sorts of other things along the side, learning the technique.</span> <span id="s1615">But I wanted to do something that was a bit cerebral as well as doing -- creating something new, and so that I did.</span> <span id="s1616">And I wrote a thesis, a thick book, which -- the work of which I enjoyed tremendously, both doing the library re-research, which was a little difficult from Knoxville, Tennessee, but the university got me all kinds of books that I needed to and I was able to do that and in my graduate show I showed my pieces, and it was accepted and I was a happy camper.</span> <span id="s1617">I graduated in 1973 with all my dear ones around me.</span> <span id="s1618">Cap and gown and the whole thing, and David graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s1619">So we had a gala celebration together.</span> <span id="s1620">And then we left Knoxville and I had -- I had the use of the university lab to do my work in and then we came to Knoxville and I no longer had a lab to work in and so I decided perhaps it was time to switch from doing metalwork, which required gas, which I find very hard to -- to keep in my house, which psychologically was very difficult for me to have a gas tank in my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Because of -- because of memories or thoughts about gas.</span> <span id="s1623">I decided I would go ahead and carry on with weaving, which I loved, and I did tapestry weaving on -- I have a loom and I used the loom for various tapestry projects.</span> <span id="s1624">But all along I still loved my metal.</span> <span id="s1625">And so, in the l-last number of years I’ve combined the two and I weave metal on my loom.</span> <span id="s1626">And it’s wire that I use, and I use stainless steel wire and copper wire and brass wire and I weave it on my loom and I do sculptural pieces.</span> <span id="s1627">Many of them are Judaic.</span> <span id="s1628">I take really my inspiration from the jew -- things Judaic.</span> <span id="s1629">And of course, I have concentrated both on the liturgy -- I’ve done a series on the High Holy Day prayers, but I’ve also done Holocaust series and I did one particular six piece Holocaust -- progression of thoughts on the Holocaust from the earliest days to the final days.</span> <span id="s1630">And so -- and also my metal, my woven metal -- metal pieces are [indecipherable] boxes and things that could -- that could be used in worship or in home worship at least.</span> <span id="s1631">I made mis -- mizrahs and the -- various other implements where I can use the wos -- woven fi -- the woven fabric made out of metal.</span> <span id="s1632">And the combination of the technique of the loom plus the material of the metalsmith has given me a great deal of satisfaction, and I still continue working, very much influenced by my Judaic background, and very happy doing what I’m doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Can you describe your -- your six panel work that you did relating to the Holocaust in a little more detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1635">I called it “Never Again” and it is really a -- a group.</span> <span id="s1636">It’s made up of six individual pieces and you’ll see a lot of symbolism in this, o-of course.</span> <span id="s1637">It -- it’s a progression of the events that occurred from the beginnings, relating increasingly to the restrictive things, of the ims -- restrictive laws of the Nazi regime in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s1638">The second panel details Kristallnacht using my synagogue as a -- part of the synagogue as my emphasis.</span> <span id="s1639">The third is badges, reminding us of the oppressive acts of the Nazis when they tried to cleanse the country of undesirables.</span> <span id="s1640">Incarceration, a progression for the confinement, enclosure and last journeys.</span> <span id="s1641">The rapid escalation to -- to convey to and remove prisoners from the camps.</span> <span id="s1642">I think one of the ideas that I used o-on the side, there’s a progression from one to six, I used the stripes of the tallid, progressing from one to six.</span> <span id="s1643">I chose six because of the reference to six million.</span> <span id="s1644">My last piece is a very dark one, but it has a little glimmer of gold, and that is our hope for the future, that these things never happen again.</span> <span id="s1645">They’re small tapestries.</span> <span id="s1646">I wanted them small so that one has to lean into them in order to really study them, more like putting one’s nose into a book, if you will, by coming thr -- into very close contact.</span> <span id="s1647">I used cotton material because it was a non-precious material.</span> <span id="s1648">I felt that I wanted to use something rather universal and simple and there are -- there are many references to numbers and to colors and to the stripes on the prisoners garb.</span> <span id="s1649">And the colors of the -- the badges, which represented different factions, not only Jews, but people in general who were incarcerated.</span> <span id="s1650">It’s a series that I did not start with piece number one, strangely enough, piece number five was the first one I did, and then kind of wove.</span> <span id="s1651">I knew I wanted to do six pieces, but started with number five and then went backwards and started to number one.</span> <span id="s1652">The first one has a few let -- letters in it, and it says Jude Raus, but if you’ll see the d-e and the u-s is Deus, and my question is where was Deus, where was God then?</span> <span id="s1653">It was a mammoth undertaking psychologically for me to do this piece, but I hope that the children will look on it sometime and remember what happened to all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum, or any other Holocaust museum or Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: I have been to Yad Vashem and I’ve been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington many, many times.</span> <span id="s1656">I go frequently.</span> <span id="s1657">I feel privileged in the fact that I can go and read names on Yom HaShoah.</span> <span id="s1658">I take every visitor that comes to visit me here in Washington to the museum.</span> <span id="s1659">I find it an e-extremely uplifting as well as the other extreme.</span> <span id="s1660">I feel both buoyed by the experience and I feel very sad and -- and -- and live it again and again but I feel sometimes it’s important to go and just be there and see maybe just one or two of the exhibits, or go to the library and do a little research on subject matter that’s very dear to your heart.</span> <span id="s1661">And I -- as I say, I go very frequently.</span> <span id="s1662">I go to the bookshop, I find very wonderful books there to -- to take home.</span> <span id="s1663">And I find it an -- perhaps the most unusual place to visit in Washington and I tell every one of my visitors they mustn’t leave Washington without going and they will be well rewarded in different ways by going.</span> <span id="s1664">I think that the teaching programs there are just remarkable.</span> <span id="s1665">I love the fact that so many of the teaching is done, not only teaching children, but teaching the police force that comes through the gates, the teachers.</span> <span id="s1666">I like the spirit of the workers there, who are just remarkable people who -- I can’t say enough for it.</span> <span id="s1667">I think we are just so blessed to have the museum here.</span> <span id="s1668">And have I been to others?</span> <span id="s1669">I’ve been to Yad Vashem and I will probably go to the Wiesenthal Center when I go to Los Angeles next week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: In closing, is there anything else that we haven’t talked about, or any message you wanted to give to your children or your grandchildren, before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Learn well the lesson, as the great philosopher said.</span> <span id="s1672">You are fated to wander through it again if you don’t learn the lesson well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: That is a very important note to end on.</span> <span
