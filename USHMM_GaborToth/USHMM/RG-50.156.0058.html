League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is an interview with Dora Zaidenweber.</span> <span id="s5">The interviewer is Jane Katz.</span> <span id="s6">August 15, 1984 for the JCRC-ADL Oral History Project.</span> <span id="s7">(Katz then asks a series of factual questions, using the questionnaire provided by the JCRC/ADL.</span> <span id="s8">Zaidenweber’s answers are as follows:)</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: My name is Dora Zaidenweber.</span> <span id="s10">My Jewish name is D’vora.</span> <span id="s11">I was born on January 24, 1924, in Radom, Poland.</span> <span id="s12">My parents’ names were Hannah Eiger and Isaiah Eiger.</span> <span id="s13">I had one living grandmother.</span> <span id="s14">Her name was Chaia Frydman.</span> <span id="s15">I also had one living great-grandmother.</span> <span id="s16">Her name was Chavah Eiger.</span> <span id="s17">They were born in small towns in the general area of Radom.</span> <span id="s18">My father was an accountant, and my mother was a homemaker.</span> <span id="s19">At home the parents spoke Yiddish, largely, with each other.</span> <span id="s20">My brother and I spoke Polish, mostly.</span> <span id="s21">Our family was basically secular, but it had a religious orientation.</span> <span id="s22">Primarily they would be classified as Zionists.</span> <span id="s23">My father was very prominent in the Jewish community, and was an active Zionist in the Polish Zionist parties -- the Centrist Party.</span> <span id="s24">He was on the executive committee of the Zionist Labor Party, but it was really the Centrist part of the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s25">My formal Jewish education was quite extensive.</span> <span id="s26">I went to a Jewish day school, which was a grade school and high school, and so my Hebrew background and Judaic history and Bible, and so on.</span> <span id="s27">The population of Radom was close to 100,000.</span> <span id="s28">It was an industrial town.</span> <span id="s29">The Jewish community was probably about 25% of the population.</span> <span id="s30">And it was, relatively speaking, a middle class Jewish community.</span> <span id="s31">There were poor Jews, of course, but a large number were in the middle class.</span> <span id="s32">Radom is located about 60 miles south of Warsaw in an area that was deliberately built up by the Poles as an industrial center, where there was actually quite a bit of war-type industry.</span> <span id="s33">There was a very large weapons factory in Radom, and there were some other munitions factories in other towns in the area.</span> <span id="s34">It was called the Iron Triangle.</span> <span id="s35">Not that Poland ever amounted to any kind of a military power, but whatever military production there was, happened to be in that area.</span> <span id="s36">And as I’ll explain a little later, this may have been the reason why quite a substantial number of Jews from Radom survived, because the manpower was used to work in those factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: It occurs to me that in order to support a Jewish elementary and high school, there must have been quite a bit of affluence in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yeah, because that was private, of course, and everybody had to pay tuition.</span> <span id="s39">So it was a very vital, very vibrant, a viable Jewish community.</span> <span id="s40">A very active Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Now your father had a college education?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No, my mother did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: As you said, your mother was a homemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: She was a homemaker, very busy visiting with relatives and friends.</span> <span id="s47">We had, actually, a very nice middle-class type of life.</span> <span id="s48">We lived, as most people did, in apartments, but we had a very large, very beautiful apartment, very nicely furnished.</span> <span id="s49">And my mother was a very elegant lady.</span> <span id="s50">She was very concerned with clothes and trends and she was always very nicely dressed, and she was very concerned about how I looked.</span> <span id="s51">Of course I had to wear a uniform.</span> <span id="s52">All school children wore uniforms, regardless of whether they attended public schools or private schools.</span> <span id="s53">We all had to wear uniforms, which was in some ways probably good.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was your mother concerned about your education, or was that entirely your father’s province?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s56">She was very concerned about my education until we got to the college level.</span> <span id="s57">She didn’t happen to believe that a woman needed a college education…but she didn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s58">So the educational concern was for all of us.</span> <span id="s59">I think it was the typical Jewish concern.</span> <span id="s60">My mother grew up in a time when very few women went to high school.</span> <span id="s61">In fact, a high school education, even in my days, in the ‘30s, was a really privileged thing.</span> <span id="s62">Not that they couldn’t afford it, but it just simply wasn’t done in those years.</span> <span id="s63">Women did not go to college, yet, in my mother’s generation.</span> <span id="s64">They did go to high school, but not to college.</span> <span id="s65">It was not the common thing to do.</span> <span id="s66">It was just my generation that started breaking out, and going to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: And that is true to a large extent all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s69">And the mothers had a hard time coping with their daughters going off to school, because of course there were no colleges in these small cities.</span> <span id="s70">The nearest city where there was a university for us was Warsaw, and that was the “big city,” the biggest city they had ever seen, you know.</span> <span id="s71">So it was, for those mothers, a real trauma to see their daughters go to a place like Warsaw, or Cracow, or Vilna -- even further away -- to go to a university.</span> <span id="s72">So it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s74">Come home with new ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: New ideas, and then they were really afraid for their virtue!</span> <span id="s76">(Laughs) but of course, I didn’t go to college in Poland.</span> <span id="s77">I was too young.</span> <span id="s78">I didn’t go to college until after the war ended, and that was in Germany -- and after I was married already.</span> <span id="s79">So my mother didn’t really have much say in it.</span> <span id="s80">But when I told her that I intended to, she didn’t think it was necessary.</span> <span id="s81">She wanted…</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Your role was to preserve the home and the traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: That’s right, but then I told her, she sent me to high school and had given me all these fancy ideas, now she had to put up with me wanting to go to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What about religious observances in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well we did observe.</span> <span id="s86">My mother was much more observant than my father was.</span> <span id="s87">He was the secular one.</span> <span id="s88">She came out of a very religious home.</span> <span id="s89">Her father was very religious.</span> <span id="s90">It was a very interesting family situation, because my mother’s mother died when my mother was very young.</span> <span id="s91">She was maybe 10.</span> <span id="s92">My grandfather, my mother’s father, had an estate.</span> <span id="s93">They lived on a farm near a small town.</span> <span id="s94">So then after his wife died, and he was left with -- my mother was the second oldest, so he was left with four young children, three boys and this girl, he remarried.</span> <span id="s95">And he married this woman from Radom.</span> <span id="s96">She was a widow and had five children.</span> <span id="s97">Well her oldest son became my father.</span> <span id="s98">So then the two step-children married.</span> <span id="s99">You see my mother married her step-father.</span> <span id="s100">So it was a merging of families that was quite interesting, because then I found myself with just one set of grandparents, the other being dead.</span> <span id="s101">So she came from a very religious, very observant home.</span> <span id="s102">My grandfather was very religious, and I think he thought my father was really far out, but my father, before his father died -- just after the end of World War I -- my father was planning to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s103">He was a very ardent Zionist.</span> <span id="s104">He had quit the Yeshiva -- he came from a religious home, too -- and he threw himself into the Zionist movement, and was planning on going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s105">But then his father died and he was the oldest son, so obviously he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s106">So he continued his education.</span> <span id="s107">That’s when he became an accountant.</span> <span id="s108">Went to Germany and attended a German school of higher education.</span> <span id="s109">There, at that time, and even today, like we have here colleges within a university, there they’re special institutes -- separate.</span> <span id="s110">So he went to a school of business.</span> <span id="s111">Which was a college level school.</span> <span id="s112">But it was not part of a university.</span> <span id="s113">Then he got married, and of course started raising a family, and ended up not going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s114">He went as a tourist later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: He did finally go.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yeah, finally, in the ‘30s he went.</span> <span id="s117">I think it was 1935 or ’36.</span> <span id="s118">So they were both very dedicated to Judaism in different ways -- my mother and my father -- and they didn’t interfere with one another.</span> <span id="s119">My mother kept kosher, of course, and we observed all the holidays.</span> <span id="s120">I didn’t go to school on Saturdays, because I went to a Jewish school but schools ran for six days, so you either had to go to school on Saturday, if you were in a non-Jewish public school, or you had to go on Sunday, which we did.</span> <span id="s121">My brother attended a private school, but not a Jewish one.</span> <span id="s122">And he went to school on Saturday, so there were certain compromises that we had to make.</span> <span id="s123">And riding on Shabbat was never any problem, because everything was walking distance, anyway.</span> <span id="s124">So, yes, we were a traditional home.</span> <span id="s125">Ours was a traditional home, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: With a strong sense of spirituality?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Very strong sense of Jewish identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And ideals and a belief in a Supreme Being?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s130">And Jewish precepts such as education, observance, a commitment to, and loyalty to, the family.</span> <span id="s131">I was 15 years old when the war broke out, so I was in high school.</span> <span id="s132">And I was very much aware of what was going on in the world already.</span> <span id="s133">Our high schools were somewhat different than the general high school here.</span> <span id="s134">I think the level was much higher.</span> <span id="s135">We were probably, in educational terms, maybe two years ahead of the high school student here in knowledge.</span> <span id="s136">It was much more concentrated, and the education was much less specialized, much more humanistic, particularly the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s137">The high school that I went to was a humanistic gymnasium.</span> <span id="s138">And we studied languages, and we studied history and geography and biology and all the sciences as well -- math and science.</span> <span id="s139">But I think that our awareness of literature and history and world events was absolutely superior to what I found here.</span> <span id="s140">I found this to be very disappointing when I came.</span> <span id="s141">At the age of 15 I could already speak German, which was a foreign language.</span> <span id="s142">I had studied Latin for four years and I studied English!</span> <span id="s143">And in addition, by the time the war broke out, I had probably read all of the Nobel laureates --up to that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: In what language/</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: In Polish.</span> <span id="s146">In translations, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: But at the same time, you were in a Jewish high school, so that you were getting an intense…</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: …education in Jewish literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes, but that school, which was accredited by the State, had to provide all the general education that was required of all other high schools, and the Hebrew language and Jewish subjects were all in addition, so our school day was longer.</span> <span id="s151">Our school week was 7 or 8 hours longer than the others.</span> <span id="s152">And in those 7 or 8 hours a week we had our Hebrew so…</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So there was early training in self discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: That’s right!</span> <span id="s155">We had an awful lot of homework!</span> <span id="s156">But we had no television to distract us.</span> <span id="s157">We all belonged, most of us, to Jewish youth groups and very often on Friday evenings were what we called an Oneg Shabbat.</span> <span id="s158">You know, that you find here, too.</span> <span id="s159">And there were some meetings during the weeks, too.</span> <span id="s160">But otherwise there weren’t as many distractions.</span> <span id="s161">And gym and sports were included in the school curriculum; boys, I suppose, played soccer a lot after school, but the girls didn’t have that many sports events.</span> <span id="s162">I did go skating in the winter, played some tennis in the summer.</span> <span id="s163">I was a gymnast -- or track -- mostly in track.</span> <span id="s164">And I was good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Okay, so you had broad education, wide interests and very clear community expectations.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: You knew exactly what your role was, what was expected of you and what you needed to contribute.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s169">It was expected not only that I would excel at school -- which was very much expected in our family -- but also that I would make my contribution, eventually, that my training would get me to a commitment to the Jewish community, and that’s where my direction would be.</span> <span id="s170">And I think that that early training, even in spite of all that happened later, remained.</span> <span id="s171">The commitment to Jewish education, to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s172">Because of my father’s position in the Zionist party, we had some very important people pass through our lives.</span> <span id="s173">When they came through Radom, they would stay with us, and we sat in a corner of the room and listened to the conversation, and a lot of it rubbed off.</span> <span id="s174">I can’t remember, exactly, the names at the moment, but I know that the people, later, became leaders in many aspects in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: That was an important part of your education.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Very.</span> <span id="s177">Zionism was very important.</span> <span id="s178">My membership in a Zionist youth organization was probably the focal point of my extra-curricular activities.</span> <span id="s179">And I certainly, at the age of 15, entertained the idea of going to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Now, tell me about the onset of threatening activities, threatening events in Europe which you were becoming aware of.</span> <span id="s181">How were you obtaining information.</span> <span id="s182">Were you reading about these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, the first thing, radio.</span> <span id="s184">Radio and the media.</span> <span id="s185">But the first really upsetting event that I remember happened in 1936.</span> <span id="s186">My mother, and my brother and I always went away in the summer.</span> <span id="s187">At least until that year.</span> <span id="s188">After that, we went to camp -- my brother and I.</span> <span id="s189">But before that, we went to various places.</span> <span id="s190">When we were young children, there was a little resort outside of Radom where everybody went in the summer, for the whole summer, and then the fathers came for the weekend.</span> <span id="s191">But in 1936 we went to a resort sort of northwest of where we were in Poland, closer to the German border.</span> <span id="s192">And in fact it was an area that was very much culturally Germanic, because up until the end of World War I, that area was part of Germany.</span> <span id="s193">This was a political, historical situation that you may not have been aware of.</span> <span id="s194">My uncle -- my father’s brother -- married a woman who lived in that area.</span> <span id="s195">And it was some distance from that resort where we were staying, but my father came for a weekend visit, and then we all took the train and went to visit my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s196">As I said, this was an area that was very Germanic, and there were a certain percentage of German population which later turned out to be quite loyal to the Germans, and it was the first time when I saw placards on the walls with real hate messages about the Jews.</span> <span id="s197">We already knew what was going on in Germany, that the German Jews were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s198">But of course, Jews have always been used to persecution, so you think, “This will blow over, too.”</span> <span id="s199">But when I saw these placards on the walls, and beside the scribblings on the walls, hate messages about the Jews, that was the first time I really saw that it was practically in our backyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: What was the content of the messages?</span> <span id="s201">“Death to the Jews?’</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well, “Death to the Jews!”</span> <span id="s203">, “Juden Raus!”</span> <span id="s204">, meaning “Jews leave!”</span> <span id="s205">That sort of thing.</span> <span id="s206">And I remember saying to my uncle, “How can you live here?</span> <span id="s207">How can you?</span> <span id="s208">Aren’t you afraid?”</span> <span id="s209">And he said, “Oh, well, you know, the anti-Semites are everywhere.”</span> <span id="s210">So this wasn’t anything that anybody was particularly upset any more than about anything else.</span> <span id="s211">Now to be sure, we encountered anti-Semitism in one form or another in just daily contact.</span> <span id="s212">Even the non-Jewish children who lived in the same courtyard that we did…the buildings in Europe, they’re sort of like U-shaped, and there’s a courtyard in the back, and that’s where we all played.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You were not really in a Jewish community, were you?</span> <span id="s214">You lived among gentiles, as I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s216">Even if 25% of the population was Jewish, we were not all confined to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s217">We happened to live in an area where it was completely mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And I assume that your father’s work as an accountant brought him into contact with gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yeah, some.</span> <span id="s220">But he really worked mostly with Jews.</span> <span id="s221">His clients were mostly Jews, but being an accountant, he dealt with the tax authorities, who were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s222">So I think, in my case, since I went to a Jewish school, mainly my contact with non-Jews was just the kids in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s223">My brother went to a non-Jewish school, and so he was only one of three in his class, and I’m sure he told you about some of the incidents that happened to him, which illustrate that there were tensions, that there were problems.</span> <span id="s224">But it wasn’t anything that we really let bother us.</span> <span id="s225">You have to go on living.</span> <span id="s226">A girl might say to me, “You damn Christ killer!”</span> <span id="s227">And ten minutes later she’ll come back and say, “You want to play?”</span> <span id="s228">This was a reality of life, but I think what it did to me, is made me want to get away, to leave, and I really considered, that when I could, when I didn’t have to ask my parents any longer, that I would leave, and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s229">Because as I said, my father really always wanted to go to Palestine, too.</span> <span id="s230">And I think, even when he came back, in 1935, that he wanted to go, but my mother, she had her siblings, and her father was still living then.</span> <span id="s231">And she felt that we should have an opportunity to finish school first, so she wanted to wait.</span> <span id="s232">I mean, nobody could have foreseen…if they could have been clairvoyant, and could have foreseen what was coming, I’m sure they would have all left!</span> <span id="s233">But you couldn’t foresee that, so that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So it was 1936, your first awareness of hatred,</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: That was my first encounter after knowing, intellectually, what was going on in Germany from radio and newspapers.</span> <span id="s236">It was my first eye contact with the German version of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s237">We were used to the Polish version of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s238">When I was young, things were fairly quiet.</span> <span id="s239">But then in 1936, Marshal Pilsudski died.</span> <span id="s240">He was a benevolent dictator of Poland, the father of modern Poland, the freedom fighter who by the end of World War I, regained independence for Poland.</span> <span id="s241">After he died, the anti-Semitic forces really came to the fore, and there was actually official anti-Semitism in the Polish government.</span> <span id="s242">There were incidents that were very disturbing, and they probably took their clues from Germany -- if you can get away with it, you know -- and they hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s243">So therefore, there were some incidents in Poland, too.</span> <span id="s244">But you don’t live your life terrified all the time.</span> <span id="s245">It wasn’t any worse than going out here at night, or maybe not even as bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Do you recall specific laws?</span> <span id="s247">Can you pin-point the year of those laws which…</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I can’t remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: …put restraints on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: It was a gradual…the restraints?</span> <span id="s251">They never happened until after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s252">But the first incident, that hit me in the face, were seeing those German signs -- in Poland.</span> <span id="s253">You see, this was Polish territory.</span> <span id="s254">And so you could see that the hatred penetrated from Germany to Poland already, and this was not official yet.</span> <span id="s255">This was probably the work of just people who were anti-Semites putting up these placards.</span> <span id="s256">But the point is that the police did not object to it.</span> <span id="s257">The government did not object to it.</span> <span id="s258">And from then on, in the late ‘30s, there was an upsurge of this open anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s259">For instance, if a Jew insulted a Pole, he could be taken to court and really be severely punished for it, whereas a Pole could insult a Jew and say anything!</span> <span id="s260">There were certain phrases that they used, and that were considered more than a misdemeanor if a Jew uttered them.</span> <span id="s261">And there were beatings.</span> <span id="s262">My grandfather was beaten up one evening when he was returning home.</span> <span id="s263">So in the late ‘30s, there were bands of students -- primarily they were students -- and young thugs, but you don’t think of them as criminals.</span> <span id="s264">They were ideologically opposed to the Jews.</span> <span id="s265">And they wore little sabers, a little reproduction of a saber in their lapels, and you knew they belonged to this organization which was violently anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s266">That carried through during the war.</span> <span id="s267">In fact, that same faction, which later fought the Germans in the woods as guerillas, they, at the same time, waged the war against the Jews, too.</span> <span id="s268">Jewish young men or women found their way into the forests, into the guerilla groups, and encountered that ultra-nationalist group, and they were invariably killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So they had their training in killing against the Jews first.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s271">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Do you recall any talk in those early years of resistance to those thugs who were taking over the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well there were some actual cases, of course.</span> <span id="s274">There were some Jewish men who fought back.</span> <span id="s275">There was a pogrom in the small town that my mother originally came from, and a number of young Jews then retaliated.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And the pogrom was in this period of the late ‘30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah, it was in about ’37 or ’38.</span> <span id="s278">I don’t remember the exact year, but it was in the late ‘30s.</span> <span id="s279">I had read about pogroms, but I had never really been close to one.</span> <span id="s280">Those were things that happened way in Russia, but there actually happened one on market day.</span> <span id="s281">The Polish thugs ran out, started turning over the stands of the Jewish merchants, and beating them up.</span> <span id="s282">And then the Jewish boys came out and started to retaliate, so it was a hassle.</span> <span id="s283">Some of them were arrested.</span> <span id="s284">Nobody ever found the Poles, needless to say.</span> <span id="s285">The police never found the Poles, but they did try to find the Jews.</span> <span id="s286">They really hunted them, and one of the guys -- one of the Jewish kids -- they were older teenagers and in their early 20’s -- was a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s287">And what I remember is that he fled, and came and hid in our house for a few days, and then he skipped the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I think he’s now in Canada.</span> <span id="s290">This was a cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: You’ve lost track of him for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh, yeah, I lost track of him, and I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s293">But he was the son of a cousin of my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: So the message was conveyed during that period that there was a price for fighting back.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s296">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: For resisting anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: At least there was still a possibility to fight back.</span> <span id="s299">Okay, you could skip town or skip the country.</span> <span id="s300">It wasn’t the same as happened later.</span> <span id="s301">We were not yet trapped.</span> <span id="s302">We were trapped in a sense, trapped by the fact that immigration was very difficult at any given time.</span> <span id="s303">You couldn’t pick up and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s304">There was a price to pay for emigrating -- if at all possible.</span> <span id="s305">America was closed at that time, too.</span> <span id="s306">You couldn’t go to the United States, and besides, who can just easily pick up and go.</span> <span id="s307">A young man can.</span> <span id="s308">If his freedom is threatened, he can skip out and run.</span> <span id="s309">But a family cannot pick up and go -- even if they have the means.</span> <span id="s310">So, at that time, not envisioning that anything more drastic would happen.</span> <span id="s311">I think that people sort of philosophically thought, “We’ve gone through this before.</span> <span id="s312">We’ll weather it again.”</span> <span id="s313">But this is before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s314">Times were still fairly normal.</span> <span id="s315">If you look in retrospect, of course you can see some danger signals already.</span> <span id="s316">At the time, looking forward, it certainly wasn’t possible to predict.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Hitler was getting more and more organized, but then again, this was another country.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes, and not only another country!</span> <span id="s319">Let me tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s320">I think it was in March of 1939.</span> <span id="s321">How blind everybody was!</span> <span id="s322">This is after Munich, already after 1938.</span> <span id="s323">This was at the time when the Germans annexed the Sudetenland, and then marched into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s324">There was a town, and I can’t remember the name of it without looking at the map.</span> <span id="s325">I think the name of the town was Cieszyn -- the town was half in Czechoslovakia and half in Poland, on the southern border.</span> <span id="s326">And when the Germans marched into that part of Czechoslovakia, they handed that half of the town back to the Poles.</span> <span id="s327">And I remember the dancing in the streets and the rejoicing, because this town was now reunited and was in Poland.</span> <span id="s328">This is how blind and how unprepared everybody was.</span> <span id="s329">But it’s not any different than all the other allies.</span> <span id="s330">Nobody was prepared for what was happening, or what ultimately happened.</span> <span id="s331">It’s not unusual for a civilian population not to recognize the danger points, not to be prepared.</span> <span id="s332">I think it would be too much to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Well, a great many of the political machinations are secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A; Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">And besides, which, at no time can we really be sure that we know everything that’s going on.</span> <span id="s336">Of course there were the German Jews who were expelled in 1938 after the Kristallnacht, after the Night of the Broken Glass.</span> <span id="s337">Some of them came to Radom.</span> <span id="s338">We housed a family in our home for several months -- a woman and four children -- until the Jewish community could set them up on their own.</span> <span id="s339">Every community in Poland took in some of those German Jews.</span> <span id="s340">That was part of the Jewish way of doing things.</span> <span id="s341">But that was Germany!</span> <span id="s342">Hitler was in Germany!</span> <span id="s343">We were in a different country!</span> <span id="s344">And we knew that there were Geneva Conventions, and there were international laws that forbade any kind of access to other populations!</span> <span id="s345">So we felt sorry for them, but of course, this wasn’t going to happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: The world was a rational place.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: At that time, it seemed to be going in a rational direction.</span> <span id="s348">It seemed like countries were setting up certain rules of conduct.</span> <span id="s349">And it seemed like we lived in a civilized world.</span> <span id="s350">And that we’re becoming more civilized than less.</span> <span id="s351">From what I studied in history, it seemed to me we were becoming more civilized.</span> <span id="s352">And at that point, there was no reason to believe yet, that we were actually falling back - so far back that we couldn’t even comprehend it!</span> <span id="s353">But it was too early to know.</span> <span id="s354">And in fact, we lulled ourselves into this, much, much too long.</span> <span id="s355">In 1942, at the height of the deportations, we still didn’t believe it, because it wasn’t possible to believe, that human beings really are basically, at their core, barbarians.</span> <span id="s356">When you’re not, you cannot believe that others are.</span> <span id="s357">So you can see that it was really not possible for us to foresee what was coming.</span> <span id="s358">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s359">When the war broke out, I was 15, and it was September 1st, so school never started.</span> <span id="s360">The weather was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Now we’re talking about 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: 1939 and just prior to the outbreak of the war, about two weeks before I went through a very traumatic experience.</span> <span id="s363">I was in a summer camp with my Zionist Youth group, in the mountains in southern Poland.</span> <span id="s364">It was a very stormy summer.</span> <span id="s365">There were a lot of electrical storms, and they’re very dangerous in the mountains.</span> <span id="s366">We went on a hike in the mountains, and one group -- there were three groups -- one group encountered a severe storm, and as they were approaching the peak of one of the lower mountains, lightning struck the rocks on top, and the rocks started rolling down.</span> <span id="s367">And the two leaders and another person -- I think in the end, six people were killed -- but both leaders were killed and another 12 were severely injured, either by falling rocks or by lightning.</span> <span id="s368">And so we came back.</span> <span id="s369">It was just a terrible, terrible thing.</span> <span id="s370">And it happened exactly on the 14th of August, in fact, of 1939.</span> <span id="s371">So it’s some kind of anniversary today -- or yesterday.</span> <span id="s372">Forty-five years.</span> <span id="s373">But it really affected our community a lot.</span> <span id="s374">There were 400 kids in that camp from all over Poland, so it was really a very traumatic experience.</span> <span id="s375">And then we came back and were still in total shock from what had happened, and then the mobilization started, and a lot of boys who were in that camp, and were our friends, were 18, and some volunteered to go into the service, so obviously there was something going on that we did not quite know, and it was just a lot of rumors.</span> <span id="s376">By the time we realized what was going on, in fact, and by the time anybody really had time to be inducted or mobilized, the Germans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So no members of your family went into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: David, my brother turned 17 in November, 1939, so he was just under 17 -- they wouldn’t take him, because he was too young.</span> <span id="s379">He tried to volunteer.</span> <span id="s380">Nobody from my family, because all my uncles were older, but a lot of people I knew did get mobilized.</span> <span id="s381">I remember we didn’t really have anything to do, and what we heard on Polish radio was not necessarily…we could hear German radio, too, by the way.</span> <span id="s382">We could receive German stations.</span> <span id="s383">But we couldn’t really make much sense of it, because there were many conflicting reports.</span> <span id="s384">But the early morning of the 1st, it was announced on the radio that the German troops had crossed the border.</span> <span id="s385">I don’t remember exactly how far Radom is from the old German border.</span> <span id="s386">Maybe 200 miles.</span> <span id="s387">Of course the Poles claimed -- there was fierce fighting going on -- that they were repelling the Germans.</span> <span id="s388">In the meantime, we saw the German planes flying over.</span> <span id="s389">I don’t know, really, whether I can convey it truthfully to you; there is a certain excitement in war for young people.</span> <span id="s390">I really can’t explain why there is.</span> <span id="s391">I think our culture has played up and romanticized war -- at least up until that point.</span> <span id="s392">Maybe today, after Vietnam, we look on war differently.</span> <span id="s393">But, there was a certain romantic notion about young men going off in uniform, and leaving girls, their sweethearts, behind and crying, There was a romantic element to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Don’t you think that that was almost universal?</span> <span id="s395">Historically.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s397">I don’t think it was unique to us.</span> <span id="s398">I remember, in the ‘30s, seeing a lot of movies of World War I. I didn’t realize, until I studied history, how miserable World War I was!</span> <span id="s399">When you looked at the movies, it was always something very romantic.</span> <span id="s400">There was always somebody being hidden, a wounded soldier being taken in by a family, landed gentry, you know, and then the Russians coming in and searching the house and not finding him, because she put him under the bed.</span> <span id="s401">And that sort of romantic notion was very universal.</span> <span id="s402">Because until you’re hit with the misery of war, there is something gallant about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Well also, don’t you think that was the way countries preserved themselves throughout history?</span> <span id="s404">By teaching their young men that it was noble to fight for the motherland?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Maybe, yeah, it could be.</span> <span id="s406">But I remember the excitement in the very first days.</span> <span id="s407">The war only lasted, for us, one week.</span> <span id="s408">Friday the 1st the Germans crossed the border, and Friday the 8th, they went through Radom, and we were occupied by the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: You saw the tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s411">I fact it was a very, very long week.</span> <span id="s412">It was very eventful.</span> <span id="s413">At some point, when the bombs started falling, and they did fall on Radom, my father wanted my mother and me to leave.</span> <span id="s414">At that time, 1939, he was 42, he was a young man.</span> <span id="s415">He was still going in and fight the Germans, and so was David.</span> <span id="s416">So my mother and I were to leave town -- which we did.</span> <span id="s417">We went by horse and buggy to my mother’s home town -- this little town of Przytyk, where the pogrom had been.</span> <span id="s418">And it’s a well known town.</span> <span id="s419">Because of that pogrom, it became notorious, of course.</span> <span id="s420">So we went there and stayed.</span> <span id="s421">I think that was on Tuesday.</span> <span id="s422">Now we’re talking about that one week between September 1st and September 8th.</span> <span id="s423">This was, however, a little west of Radom, so we were closer to the Germans ,unfortunately than we had been in Radom.</span> <span id="s424">Well there was no communication, no way to communicate with father and my brother and so my mother was really torn.</span> <span id="s425">Here she was with me, and there, the other half of the family.</span> <span id="s426">So she decided that we would go back.</span> <span id="s427">On Thursday evening, finally, she found a horse and buggy that would take us back.</span> <span id="s428">And it was absolutely an unreal scene.</span> <span id="s429">It was really in the middle of the night, because we arrived back in Radom just at daybreak, and this having been September, I would imagine daybreak must have been at about 5:30 or 6.</span> <span id="s430">Well, it was like going through a landscape of unreality, like I would think of Dante’s Inferno.</span> <span id="s431">Everything burning around you!</span> <span id="s432">As far as you could see-not where you were, but around in the distance -- everything…well, we finally got to Radom.</span> <span id="s433">And then, not only was there fire burning, but the Polish soldiers were fleeing in great disarray, and so it looked like things were going pretty badly.</span> <span id="s434">Where that driver let us off, wasn’t anywhere near our house.</span> <span id="s435">It was daybreak -- very brilliant sun - the sun was just rising….</span> <span id="s436">this image is so with me, because it was probably one of the most frightening experiences that night, being so close to what was going on -- the actual fighting.</span> <span id="s437">When you’re in the city, and the bombs are falling, you’re kind of scared.</span> <span id="s438">We spent the days, when the air raid sirens went off, in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s439">There was an orchard in the back of our courtyard, and we had dug a zig-zag trench, where we were hiding, and I was looking up and seeing the anti-aircraft fire, and little silver bullets, not hitting anything, you know, but that morning was really close -- with those fires and the fleeing soldiers and the artillery in the background.</span> <span id="s440">When we got back to town, there was a curfew, so we really should not have been walking.</span> <span id="s441">We had to sneak through back yards.</span> <span id="s442">And at one point, as we were in the back yard of a house-- not too far any more from our own, from where we lived -- the planes came in.</span> <span id="s443">They came in so low that you could see the faces of the pilots.</span> <span id="s444">We hid under the bushes, and the planes were flying over, flying low, and spraying the area with machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s445">And this is something you see in a film, you never think it will happen to you.</span> <span id="s446">It was the most fascinating, the most terrifying thing up until that time that I had ever experienc4d.</span> <span id="s447">So after this, was almost like a relief, the war was over for us.</span> <span id="s448">The Germans came in.</span> <span id="s449">They came that afternoon.</span> <span id="s450">They marched through town.</span> <span id="s451">And that was the beginning of the occupation.</span> <span id="s452">It was a very uncertain time.</span> <span id="s453">It was being trapped, the realization that we were here to stay.</span> <span id="s454">We could no longer get anywhere.</span> <span id="s455">A lot of people fled ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s456">They were fleeing ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s457">They were fleeing eastward.</span> <span id="s458">But now we were behind the German lines, so this was it.</span> <span id="s459">This was really actually the end of combat for us.</span> <span id="s460">For the next three weeks, the war was still going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s461">It lasted another three weeks, and mainly because we were, I guess, in the flight pattern of the airplanes coming into Warsaw, bombing Warsaw, that every time there’d be a squadron of planes, a formation of planes flying heavily -- you could hear how heavy they were, laden with bombs,, going on… to Warsaw, only 60 miles away, and then returning empty -- and we could discern the difference in the sound of the airplanes.</span> <span id="s462">And then the motorized divisions driving through the town, which was also a main highway, in the direction of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s463">The siege of Warsaw, which we really didn’t know…it was at that time and ever after that, that listening to the radio was really sort of a background for guesswork.</span> <span id="s464">You couldn’t trust anything you heard on the radio.</span> <span id="s465">From that point in, was all German broadcasts, and everything we deemed to be propaganda.</span> <span id="s466">And from then on, all through the war, all through those long 51/2 years, we never really knew for sure what was going on.</span> <span id="s467">It was always used as a background for discussion, for speculation, for rumor.</span> <span id="s468">Nothing was factual any longer.</span> <span id="s469">Do you understand what feeling that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Yes, I think I do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: You really don’t know what kind of world you’re living in.</span> <span id="s472">And nothing is certain.</span> <span id="s473">You have absolutely no knowledge of whether what you’re hearing is true.</span> <span id="s474">What enters, at that point, is wishful thinking.</span> <span id="s475">You interpret what you hear any-old-way that suits you, in order to maintain some kind of sanity and you have to be somewhat normal.</span> <span id="s476">And you can, only by creating your own world within what is going on.</span> <span id="s477">So reading German newspapers, forever after, we always deemed it to be propaganda.</span> <span id="s478">Whatever we read, whatever we heard, was always “propaganda.”</span> <span id="s479">It was exaggerated.</span> <span id="s480">Therefore, things must be bad for them, and the expectation was that the war, because it was so swift, would have to end very soon.</span> <span id="s481">I remember the exultation when we heard on the radio that Britain and France had declared war on the Germans.</span> <span id="s482">That was on Sunday the 3rd.</span> <span id="s483">It was two days after the Germans marched into Poland.</span> <span id="s484">And we knew that that will do it!</span> <span id="s485">I mean, they’ll destroy them, immediately.</span> <span id="s486">It’s just totally incomprehensible, unless you really dig into your own thinking processes, and see how this is very plausible, that you have to create your own world, that’s more positive than what you’re encountering, or else you could never make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Oh, I’ll say you had the conditioning process that a…</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Well that didn’t enter in until somewhat later.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: But these other countries were super-powers.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s491">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s492">I mean, they will just swoop down with their airplanes and their armies, on the Maginot Line, and it was, “They will just crash them!”</span> <span id="s493">And you know, in a week or two, they’ll be running back through Poland, leaving all their trucks and everything behind.</span> <span id="s494">And from day to day, this is what we expected.</span> <span id="s495">Give them four weeks, and that will be it.</span> <span id="s496">But it didn’t quite happen that way, of course.</span> <span id="s497">Those first few weeks, as it dragged on, a lot of things that happened were pretty much what was happening in World War I.</span> <span id="s498">You see World War I wasn’t that far back in time.</span> <span id="s499">It was only a little over 20 years.</span> <span id="s500">And my parents were young adults at that time.</span> <span id="s501">They remembered very well.</span> <span id="s502">With the curfew hour being about 8 o’clock, you couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s503">What became the norm, was that all the neighbors would meet every evening, and there would be political discussions going on, speculation.</span> <span id="s504">And so we kids were just sitting there listening.</span> <span id="s505">It usually was at our apartment, that all the neighbors met.</span> <span id="s506">The neighbors were all very good friends of each other--the adults -- and the kids, too.</span> <span id="s507">So sometimes we’d listen and sometimes we were busy with our own things.</span> <span id="s508">But eventually, as people optimistically kept thinking the war would be over very soon, it turned out that there really wasn’t anything going on on the western front.</span> <span id="s509">Britain and France weren’t doing anything.</span> <span id="s510">They were just sitting there.</span> <span id="s511">They mobilized their armies and they were sitting.</span> <span id="s512">I guess some British forces were transported to France, but there was no action going on on the western front.</span> <span id="s513">They just had plenty of time to destroy Warsaw, and to mop up.</span> <span id="s514">And of course the fact that the Russian army entered into Poland, too, this was the big surprise that even the allies never knew about -- the fact that the Soviet Union executed with Germans, that they would divvy up Poland, and therefore there wouldn’t be an eastern front after half of Poland was “conquered” by the Russians -- so that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s515">So what was happening, was mainly what happened in World War I under an occupation, and that is, it seemed like they always needed some workers, and so they would round up Jewish men for day-work, and everybody was trying not to be caught., of course.</span> <span id="s516">I remember in those days, those weeks, we were looking out for the German soldiers coming, and the men would hide in the attic and behind locked doors so as not to be caught to go to work.</span> <span id="s517">That’s from stories that we heard of World War I. That, I guess, was common behavior for soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: The men were rounded up and the men disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s520">They came back.</span> <span id="s521">They were just rounded up for hard work.</span> <span id="s522">A lot of it was work that they weren’t accustomed to doing, like digging trenches, and carrying heavy packages, unloading and loading, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s523">So they preferred not to go.</span> <span id="s524">Of course, there was an element of uncertainty too, and you didn’t get paid for it either.</span> <span id="s525">And there was some rough handling.</span> <span id="s526">But mainly it was a sort of a preparatory stage for occupation.</span> <span id="s527">You must understand that we were the young generation.</span> <span id="s528">We had never encountered an “occupation.”</span> <span id="s529">But I don’t think there was a person alive who was more than 30 years old that didn’t know about an occupation.</span> <span id="s530">Every country in Europe was occupied either by the Russians or by the Germans in World War I. And so they knew about occupation, and they were pretty stoic about it.</span> <span id="s531">They knew you had to put up with certain things that were not very convenient or comfortable.</span> <span id="s532">They took away our radios.</span> <span id="s533">But that wasn’t as Jews.</span> <span id="s534">They took away everybody’s radios.</span> <span id="s535">We had to surrender that.</span> <span id="s536">If people had weapons, which very few people did, had to surrender them.</span> <span id="s537">I mean, there isn’t a lawful, legal system where there’s an occupation – at least not in the initial stages while there’s still a front going on.</span> <span id="s538">So in a town like Radom, we experienced the behind-the-lines sort of treatment.</span> <span id="s539">And at that point, a lot of orders were issues which were posted on walls.</span> <span id="s540">And of course, you don’t have any excuse for not knowing what the order is.</span> <span id="s541">You have to know what the order is.</span> <span id="s542">So these things had to be surrendered.</span> <span id="s543">And then, I think the biggest thing that happened at that time and probably something that nobody could foresee the consequences of, was the registration and the issuance of separate passes, different passes for Jews, the identification process, which you can only understand in retrospect.</span> <span id="s544">I guess, at the time, we couldn’t envision that this would be the base for the identification of the Jews.</span> <span id="s545">Everybody had to register.</span> <span id="s546">They set up these registration places, and in order to get a ration card -- rationing of course was instituted -- everybody had to receive a new I.D. card.</span> <span id="s547">And the Jewish cards were, if I remember correctly, blue, and they had the word Juden”, “Jew”, stamped on it.</span> <span id="s548">And we had to carry that with us at all times.</span> <span id="s549">So that’s the thing that really was the crucial point in that whole plan, which we did not, at that time, understand, because, obviously, they had no other basis to identify the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And here you identified yourselves.</span> <span id="s551">That was very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s553">Well, there was really no way of not, unless you didn’t want to have a ration card.</span> <span id="s554">I believe you had to bring with you an identification, which was a birth certificate, and the birth certificate obviously had the religion on it.</span> <span id="s555">So you didn’t have to come and say, “I’m a Jew.”</span> <span id="s556">It was right there.</span> <span id="s557">This was not unusual.</span> <span id="s558">I think in Europe, still, people are identified by a religion.</span> <span id="s559">And I think in your day, probably, when you were a child, your birth certificate might still have your religion on it, too.</span> <span id="s560">Religion and race.</span> <span id="s561">I wouldn’t be a bit surprised, because it wasn’t until the ‘50’s that that was discontinued.</span> <span id="s562">So a birth certificate was something that was you, that gave you the status of being a person!</span> <span id="s563">And all the information was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So with the issuance of that pass, you were clearly marked.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s566">Not yet outwardly marked, but marked, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s567">The first big action that I remember -- I don’t remember if there was anything sooner --was really also of a general nature, that there were hostages taken.</span> <span id="s568">And that was just prior to November 11th.</span> <span id="s569">In Poland, and until recently in the United States, and in most of Europe, November 11th is Independence Day.</span> <span id="s570">That was the day of the end of World War I, so it was observed as a very important occasion.</span> <span id="s571">It was an important holiday in Poland, because it was the Polish independence day.</span> <span id="s572">Poland was not independent for 150 years until that day.</span> <span id="s573">So prior to that, I guess in expectation that there might be some unrest, the Germans rounded up quite a large number of Poles and Jews.</span> <span id="s574">And across the hall from us lived a doctor, an older man.</span> <span id="s575">He was retired at the time.</span> <span id="s576">He was one of those who was rounded up and taken hostage.</span> <span id="s577">There weren’t any riots, and there was no unusual activity, so they were eventually released, but this was the first time that we encountered this responsibility of people, who were totally innocent, for actions of others -- taking hostages -- which is quite common today, but it was very frightening then.</span> <span id="s578">And then several events took place in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s579">The Jews of Poland were issued a charter by the king of Poland, way back in the 15th century, that guaranteed them self-determination and autonomy.</span> <span id="s580">So Jews were allowed to take care of their own internal matters, such as marriages and births and deaths, and internal organizational matters of a religious nature.</span> <span id="s581">And there was always a committee that was called the Kehilla, representatives of the Jewish community, and so they pretty much ruled themselves.</span> <span id="s582">The Kehilla was even empowered to deal with minor legal matters that involved only a civil law between parties, so they could mediate.</span> <span id="s583">The Bet Din is a sort of court, which is mainly a religious court, but it also carried over into the civil area, where contracts can be negotiated, or disputes negotiated and arbitrated.</span> <span id="s584">And it had legal power in Poland.</span> <span id="s585">When the Germans started settling down in their occupation, they converted this organization to a sort of liaison.</span> <span id="s586">They still would carry out the functions of overseeing the activities of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s587">The representatives of the Jewish community really became sort of a contact group.</span> <span id="s588">They were to convey the orders of the German occupation forces to the Jewish population, and then carry them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Now you’re saying this is the responsibility that was given to the Kehilla?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: To the Kehilla.</span> <span id="s591">They had a ready made group.</span> <span id="s592">Of course some people had left.</span> <span id="s593">Some fled to the east, and some just simply did not want to serve.</span> <span id="s594">Eventually they set up a Council of Elders, and there was one in Radom, that was the liaison between the Germans and the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s595">One of the first things that they did require of the Council of Elders -- and I’m not sure when that name was actually coined, I can’t exactly pinpoint it, whether it was yet in 1939 or somewhat later -- was imposing a fine on the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s596">And that is a fine of some hundreds of thousands of zloty, which is the Polish currency.</span> <span id="s597">And if that wouldn’t be delivered within a specific period of time, members of the Council of Elders would be arrested and executed.</span> <span id="s598">Now this is the sort of official extortion that went on continuously.</span> <span id="s599">But that, too wasn’t new, from what we were told.</span> <span id="s600">That happened in World War I, too.</span> <span id="s601">Those were all things that were sort of expected.</span> <span id="s602">Except that identification -- the patches, the armbands, which was done, as I recall, late in 1939, maybe in December, or January of 1940 -- I think that was totally new.</span> <span id="s603">But those extortion periods took place throughout.</span> <span id="s604">Every so often that would happen.</span> <span id="s605">And I remember one joke that went around.</span> <span id="s606">Curiously enough, during all this time, there were actually jokes, there was actually a certain sense of humor that people had to maintain.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: It was the only form of resistance open to you at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, not only resistance, but also survival.</span> <span id="s609">You have to be able to laugh at it, to take a lighter approach to life, or else it would have been totally intolerable.</span> <span id="s610">Because in economic terms, things became just absolutely, awful, almost immediately.</span> <span id="s611">Schools were closed.</span> <span id="s612">Factories were gradually being opened.</span> <span id="s613">But stores, pretty much, had no merchandise in them -- only grocery stores where rations were delivered, so that people could pick up their rations.</span> <span id="s614">But actually, commerce had come to a complete standstill.</span> <span id="s615">I suppose doctors had some patients I don’t know how they got paid for it -- but lawyers certainly didn’t have anything to do.</span> <span id="s616">There was no law that they could practice, because the Jews, particularly, were outside of the law, and law was imposed on the country -- occupation law, military law.</span> <span id="s617">So there was no government, no Polish government.</span> <span id="s618">So really the only means of making a living was either bartering or working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s619">Ultimately that became somewhat of a routine; they required certain numbers of workers every day.</span> <span id="s620">And it became the function of the Jewish council to deliver these people.</span> <span id="s621">They weren’t paid, you know.</span> <span id="s622">The Germans didn’t pay, but if you worked for them, you could possibly get a meal, depending on who you worked for.</span> <span id="s623">So in a sense, the Jewish Council was responsible for delivering a certain number of men -- they may have had some women that they needed, but most of them were men -- so it became like a work force that was bought!</span> <span id="s624">And if, say, my father -- he worked in a different capacity, and I’ll tell you in a moment -- but somebody like my father, who would be required to go to work for the Germans on a given day, but he really didn’t want to, he could pay to have another man go for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Now my father was actually working and earning money.</span> <span id="s626">What was one of the big industries in Radom was the tanning industry.</span> <span id="s627">There were several tanneries, and a number of them were owned by Jews.</span> <span id="s628">Well, some of them were my father’s clients, of course, before the war.</span> <span id="s629">When the Germans settled down to their occupation, they expropriated all these factories, but they were in great need of leather, so these tanneries were very soon reopened, and because it is a highly specialized type of industry, they had to keep the owners and the managers, and the people who knew about how to mix these chemicals for tanning.</span> <span id="s630">They had to keep them on, but they kept them on as employees, of course, not as owners.</span> <span id="s631">My father was also one of those employees, but naturally accounting services still had to be done, only he was working in the factory as an accountant.</span> <span id="s632">So as a result, he was not subject to the daily work, because the work he was doing in that industry was more important.</span> <span id="s633">And, as I mentioned before, those were parts of the things that made for the fact that the Jews of Radom were slightly, ever so slightly, more likely to survive in a little larger percentage than in some other cities.</span> <span id="s634">And indeed, that’s the case.</span> <span id="s635">There are many more survivors, percentage-wise from Radom, than there are say from Warsaw, where there were ten times as many Jews.</span> <span id="s636">But that’s because of those industries that were very essential to the German war effort, where they needed forced labor, and later slave labor, until quite late in the war.</span> <span id="s637">And the longer you lived -- worked -- the slightly better your chances were.</span> <span id="s638">So those are some of the reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Okay, now during this time of occupation, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: How was the family faring?</span> <span id="s641">I mentioned my father.</span> <span id="s642">David went to work for the Kehilla, for the Council of Elders, in the office there.</span> <span id="s643">And I was sort of at loose ends.</span> <span id="s644">Being 15, there really wasn’t anything much for me to do.</span> <span id="s645">I had finished the 10th grade.</span> <span id="s646">David finished high school that summer.</span> <span id="s647">He went to a specialized high school, which was primarily a business and accounting orientation, so he had office skills, and that’s why he went to work in the office.</span> <span id="s648">But my education wasn’t complete.</span> <span id="s649">I did finish 10th grade before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s650">The high school system in Poland was such that there was a breaking point at the 10th grade.</span> <span id="s651">After the 10th grade, there was an examination, and you could consider yourself a high school graduate.</span> <span id="s652">The next two years were college preparatory, and they required an entrance exam.</span> <span id="s653">I had passed that entrance exam that summer, but school never reopened.</span> <span id="s654">What we did then, was that a few of the girls from my class, five of us, hired one of the teachers -- our parents did -- and we were having private instruction, so we continued our education.</span> <span id="s655">Teachers didn’t have any means of making a living, either, so this was one way.</span> <span id="s656">It was really forbidden, and it was kind of risky to be meeting that way, but actually, we had three teachers!</span> <span id="s657">We had one teacher who taught us science and math, and then we had one teacher for the other subjects.</span> <span id="s658">We had a teacher for Hebrew.</span> <span id="s659">So we were busy studying at that time.</span> <span id="s660">And then a little later in the winter of 1939-’40, I also had an English teacher.</span> <span id="s661">I studied some English.</span> <span id="s662">That was strictly risky, because English was really something Germans frowned upon studying.</span> <span id="s663">This whole thing was very clandestine.</span> <span id="s664">But that’s what I kept busy with.</span> <span id="s665">In the meantime, there were some other developments.</span> <span id="s666">My uncle whom I talked about before, who lived in the northwestern part of Poland, the one we visited in 1936, where we saw these placards, he and his family were expelled.</span> <span id="s667">So he came back to Radom with his family, and they lived with us for a while, because we had the largest apartment.</span> <span id="s668">Eventually, he moved to my grandmother’s house, and the room that they had was then billeted by Germans, so we had German officers billeted in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Well that was really very inhibiting, because you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s671">You had to be quiet, you had to be very careful about what you were saying.</span> <span id="s672">And we still had a maid, a live-in maid, at that time, but the German officer did not allow the maid to clean his room.</span> <span id="s673">I had to clean it.</span> <span id="s674">And I was just as skilled at cleaning as you can imagine!</span> <span id="s675">I mean, we always had a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s676">So there were certain things that we couldn’t do as a result of having Germans billeted in our house, and at that point, of course, we couldn’t even have our neighbors dome in the evening to talk.</span> <span id="s677">We would have to go…</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Well, at a certain point, I recall, gatherings were forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yeah, gatherings were forbidden.</span> <span id="s680">But certainly, after the curfew hours, we could gather and take a risk.</span> <span id="s681">But with a German in the house, you certainly couldn’t take that risk.</span> <span id="s682">So during that period, we had to meet in somebody else’s house.</span> <span id="s683">It was very inhibiting, and it was very inconvenient.</span> <span id="s684">But we had someone billeted in our house quite, quite some time.</span> <span id="s685">Different people.</span> <span id="s686">Sometimes there were men…</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Did you have to put an end to all your religious observance at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s689">Not as long as they were private.</span> <span id="s690">There were no synagogue services, of course.</span> <span id="s691">But to some extent, people still gathered in a minyan and had services.</span> <span id="s692">But holidays weren’t really, any more, what they used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: And I imagine with Germans in the home, it was becoming more and more difficult to have any kind of observance.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: It’s interesting that life sort of went on.</span> <span id="s695">It settled down to an unpleasant kind of normalcy -- an expected kind of unpleasant normalcy.</span> <span id="s696">Measures were being taken on the outside that were tightening the noose.</span> <span id="s697">There were more pronouncements being issued.</span> <span id="s698">More orders.</span> <span id="s699">We had to start wearing an armband, which identified us as Jews.</span> <span id="s700">And then at some point it was announced that we could no longer walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s701">We had to walk in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s702">At first, it was, you had to step off the sidewalk if you encountered a German soldier.</span> <span id="s703">And after that, you just couldn’t even walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s704">And there were beatings, and there were very unpleasant encounters, but, as I mentioned before, it was all sort of part of the occupation.</span> <span id="s705">We still didn’t envision anything much worse than that.</span> <span id="s706">It was a terrible inconvenience, and it was very disappointing that the war wasn’t ending sooner than it was, which we sort of expected in those big conversations and speculations.</span> <span id="s707">The war was going to last only a month!</span> <span id="s708">Well,, the months started dragging on.</span> <span id="s709">And it didn’t seem like anything was doing, and then of course in 1940, the big defeat of the allies was a terrific blow to the expectations.</span> <span id="s710">But the point really is that at some phase, in that kind of situation, you do settle down to some sort of normalcy, a lower level of normalcy.</span> <span id="s711">There were things going on, like a lot of sickness and a lot of poverty.</span> <span id="s712">The economic situation was such that most people didn’t have, really, any means of surviving, so the community had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s713">There were soup kitchens.</span> <span id="s714">And there was a great deal of suffering on the part of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">One incident is very, very interesting, very important.</span> <span id="s716">My father had always been very active in the Jewish community, as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s717">He was a prominent member of the Jewish community, and always very active in one capacity or another.</span> <span id="s718">So that year, 1939, maybe even before, he was the chairman of the committee of the board which oversaw the local orphans’ home.</span> <span id="s719">During the war, in those early months of the war, a lot of people who were really in dire straits economically, wanted to put the children into the orphans’ home, so the children would at least have some food.</span> <span id="s720">And every day my father would come home for dinner, and there’d be people lined up at the door, waiting, asking him to see if he could get their children into the orphans’ home.</span> <span id="s721">And I remember my mother complaining that his food was getting cold, and in the meantime he was talking to the people.</span> <span id="s722">And the thing that always stuck in my mind was the reply he gave to my mother.</span> <span id="s723">He said, “I can’t do anything for these people.</span> <span id="s724">The home is full.</span> <span id="s725">I can’t take any more children in.</span> <span id="s726">But I have to listen to them.</span> <span id="s727">That’s the only thing I can do for them.</span> <span id="s728">At least listen to them.”</span> <span id="s729">And, you know, how kind he was.</span> <span id="s730">Really, he suffered that he couldn’t help everybody, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s731">The place was full.</span> <span id="s732">Now this is something that I have never forgotten.</span> <span id="s733">I’ve tried to live up to that example.</span> <span id="s734">You know, how important it is to listen to people, and let them get their suffering off their chest.</span> <span id="s735">So the months that followed, were pretty much that low level of normalcy, with a lot if individual things going on that affected people’s lives, that were hardships.</span> <span id="s736">But at that time, our family was not particularly affected with great hardship, because my father did work, and as a result we did have some means, enough, probably, for my mother to buy additional food on the black market, so that I don’t remember, really, ever being hungry in those days, those early couple of years of the war, or not having clothes.</span> <span id="s737">We still lived in our apartment, and had our things.</span> <span id="s738">As a result of having Germans billeted in our house, we probably were sort of off limits to the bands that came into the house and just took whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s739">It did happen later, but not at the point while we were still living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: The bands, you mean people who were pillaging, is that what you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah, Germans!</span> <span id="s742">Germans.</span> <span id="s743">German soldiers who could just come in and take furniture and linens and silver and whatnot, and sent it home!</span> <span id="s744">They were the masters, and we were totally outside of the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So even then, it was the law of the jungle.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s747">But I think there must have been a tacit approval.</span> <span id="s748">They were probably given the freedom to do that.</span> <span id="s749">The Jews could be done anything to, that they wanted to.</span> <span id="s750">We had no protection, in other words.</span> <span id="s751">But it did not happen to us at that time.</span> <span id="s752">Actually, at that time, we settled down to a certain degree of normalcy, and I continued with my studies with the teachers, and I continued to see my friends and things were sort of on an even keel.</span> <span id="s753">But certain people we knew were coming down with the typhus, and were dying, so there were disturbing things.</span> <span id="s754">As I think back on it, it was biding time.</span> <span id="s755">I think we thought that’s what it would be like until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s756">That year, 1940, things were getting tighter, and they were being set up in a more administrative way, and the Germans were consolidating their hold on the country.</span> <span id="s757">But it was pretty much, for us, waiting for the war to end.</span> <span id="s758">And I think the thinking was, if it doesn’t get any worse, we can survive.</span> <span id="s759">What that “worse” would be, we really had no idea -- the depth of the actual misery that could be inflicted on people.</span> <span id="s760">But obviously, other people did suffer a great deal more than we did at that time.</span> <span id="s761">And then, it was in the beginning of 1941, that the order was issued -- it came through the Jewish Council -- that all Jews would have to move out of their houses if they lived outside a certain designated area.</span> <span id="s762">And of course, in every city there was an area that was more Jewish, more concentrated than others, and we lived outside that area.</span> <span id="s763">So that meant that we had to move out.</span> <span id="s764">And I think we were given six weeks to find a place in the designated area.</span> <span id="s765">I don’t really remember exactly when the word “ghetto” was used first, whether the Germans actually used the word “ghetto” in designating this section.</span> <span id="s766">The German word was not “ghetto” it was “wohnung bezirk’ -- the “living area.”</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: But you knew that your life was disrupted!</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: We knew that our lives were being totally disrupted, and that because that quarter was already very crowded, it would be difficult, and nothing like the large apartment that we had, that we had to move out of.</span> <span id="s769">We could still take our furniture and our belongings.</span> <span id="s770">Eventually, because my father was who he was, we and all the neighbors in that building, we all got a small house that had four rooms, so there each family had a room.</span> <span id="s771">I think we had sort of like one larger room and a real small little room, which was a little better than a lot of the people.</span> <span id="s772">Now my grandmother lived in that area, but her apartment was already full, because I had an aunt who was a widow, with her daughter, who lived with my grandmother, and then another family -- an aunt of mine and her husband and two children, had to move in from the outside of the designated area -- moved in with my grandmother, and also the uncle who was expelled from the west.</span> <span id="s773">So they had five families there already, so of course there wasn’t room for us.</span> <span id="s774">Well, as it happened, we got assigned this little house for all the Jewish inhabitants of the building that we lived in, and it was a house that Poles had lived in that had to move out, because the area that was designated as the special area for Jews included that little section of very little, and very poor quality houses.</span> <span id="s775">It wasn’t a villa, it was just a small house, a small wooden house with an outhouse.</span> <span id="s776">It didn’t have indoor plumbing!</span> <span id="s777">There was a water pump outside, and there was an outhouse, one or two, maybe three or four, maybe one for each.</span> <span id="s778">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s779">A couple of outhouses.</span> <span id="s780">So it wasn’t your luxury place, you understand, but compared to the tenements where people lived two or three families in a room, this was really terrific.</span> <span id="s781">But it was a real step down, and it turned out to be what we had feared when we said, “If it only doesn’t get worse, you know, it won’t be so bad.”</span> <span id="s782">It did get an awful lot worse, because of the crowding, and because, in the ghetto, once we were in that isolated area, it was much harder to get around.</span> <span id="s783">In order to get out of that designated area, one had to have special permission, and not everybody would be given a special pass to go out.</span> <span id="s784">The first summer we could still sort of move in and out.</span> <span id="s785">I remember riding my bike with Jules.</span> <span id="s786">That’s when I met Jules, because Jules -- my husband --and his family moved in next door, also, into a little back of a house.</span> <span id="s787">I knew him by sight -- he’s four years older, so when you’re a 15 year old, you don’t really know many 19-year-olds -- but I saw him going to school.</span> <span id="s788">We went to a school which was near where I lived, and when I went to school, our paths sometime crossed.</span> <span id="s789">So I knew who he was and he knew who I was.</span> <span id="s790">He, too, was working where David was, for the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s791">So he knew David, and that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s792">That house where we lived was the very last house on the block.</span> <span id="s793">In fact, the other side of the street was already outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s794">It was important later, in one incident that happened, that was important to our survival, actually.</span> <span id="s795">So that’s when Jules and I met.</span> <span id="s796">And that summer our romance started blooming.</span> <span id="s797">It was interesting that at this time, the young people -- I think we started developing sort of a nihilistic attitude.</span> <span id="s798">You have to live every day, because there is no point, the tomorrow became very uncertain.</span> <span id="s799">The uncertainty was really based more on the hunger that was all around us, and the disease.</span> <span id="s800">It seemed like it would catch us all.</span> <span id="s801">We still didn’t think of any ultimate destruction of all the Jewish people in 1941.</span> <span id="s802">But certainly it looked like there wasn’t much left of our youth.</span> <span id="s803">And so we got together a lot with our friends.</span> <span id="s804">There was a curfew even in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s805">We couldn’t go out after 8.</span> <span id="s806">But we did.</span> <span id="s807">We sneaked through backyards -- you know, young people do take risks --and we got together, and we sort of partied, and did a lot of laughing and joking and talking, in a…really sort of a…I can’t quite describe what I’m trying to say.</span> <span id="s808">I think “nihilistic” describes it.</span> <span id="s809">Does it?</span> <span id="s810">To you?</span> <span id="s811">Sort of a “hell with it all!</span> <span id="s812">We’re not going to live to enjoy adulthood, anyway, so we might as well have some fun.”</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: In your conversations, were you questioning the impact of being Jewish?</span> <span id="s814">What it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: I don’t recall that we really philosophized about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s816">I think it was an accepted fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s818">There was no resentment of the fact that you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I really don’t remember, at any time, except on very rare occasions, and that was much later, that I started thinking, “Why did I have to be born Jewish?’</span> <span id="s820">It wasn’t at this time.</span> <span id="s821">At this time, it still looked like some of us will make it.</span> <span id="s822">Maybe most of us will make it.</span> <span id="s823">But our youth is being wasted.</span> <span id="s824">We’re not really enjoying our youth.</span> <span id="s825">What will we do when it all ends, how will we get back into some sort of mainstream, pick up where we left off?</span> <span id="s826">It didn’t look so desperate yet.</span> <span id="s827">It was beginning to look more and more so, but it didn’t seem like we were yet in any immediate danger, except from disease and hunger.</span> <span id="s828">But at that time, some people were beginning to leave -- to get false papers.</span> <span id="s829">Not very many, naturally.</span> <span id="s830">Not very many had the means to do so.</span> <span id="s831">And not many would leave families behind, but some of our friends did.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Were there efforts by the Zionist organization to enable those who wanted to leave?</span> <span id="s833">Or had that organization, at that time, fallen apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Not in Radom.</span> <span id="s835">In Radom, I was not aware of any organized effort.</span> <span id="s836">I think that whenever anybody left, they left by their own effort -- by their own contacts with non-Jews on the outside who provided them with false passes or a place to stay.</span> <span id="s837">But not too many yet, at that time.</span> <span id="s838">Now the first traumatic action that took place -- it was the forerunner of things to come -- was in February of 1942.</span> <span id="s839">At that time, in the middle of the night, there was a raid, and a number of people were arrested, among them the president and vice-president, I believe -- I don’t remember for sure -- the president of the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s840">And they were shipped out.</span> <span id="s841">Nobody knew where to.</span> <span id="s842">Now this was a time when we didn’t know anything yet about camps, other than the concentration camps which were official concentration camps, and everybody knew about, such as Dachau and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s843">They existed before the war.</span> <span id="s844">So everybody knew there were official concentration camps.</span> <span id="s845">The first time we hear about Auschwitz, which apparently was also a detention camp, was in the winter of 1939.</span> <span id="s846">I told you they took hostages before November 11th of 1939?</span> <span id="s847">Then some Poles came back, when they were released, and I remember one coming to our house.</span> <span id="s848">I don’t remember who he was or why he was there, but he was very reluctant to speak about his experience, and at some point he mentioned the word Auschwitz, so apparently already in ’39, they were setting up something at Auschwitz which was a detention camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Now this man was a non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: He was a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s851">He was one of those hostages, and I don’t remember how we happened to have him come to our house one evening, when he came back after he was released.</span> <span id="s852">But I remember that that was the first time that I heard the word Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s853">We had known that there was a town named Oswiecim in Polish, and that the German name is Auschwitz, but it wasn’t something that made any particular sense in terms of it being a special place.</span> <span id="s854">So that night, in February of 1942, when these men were arrested, the next day they were shipped out, and by then, there were rumors about a camp in Auschwitz, but really it was almost impossible to isolate rumor from fact.</span> <span id="s855">“Who told you this?”</span> <span id="s856">“So-and-so and someone.”</span> <span id="s857">You could have been the 50th or the 150th person to get it, and how much accuracy there was in that rumor, was really not…that’s why we were so reluctant to believe almost anything.</span> <span id="s858">Nobody knew where it came from.</span> <span id="s859">Our entire lives were based on rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">“Such and such is going on in Warsaw, and so-and-so is going on here and there.”</span> <span id="s861">And absolutely no way of finding out, because we were not very mobile, and we couldn’t travel from town to town.</span> <span id="s862">There were some people, of course, who did take the risk of removing their Jewish identity, and traveled.</span> <span id="s863">They were probably the ones who brought communications from one place to another, but who knew, when it eventually got to you, what the actual facts were.</span> <span id="s864">So it was really a time of total uncertainty of what was going on, what the actual facts were.</span> <span id="s865">There were people, of course, interestingly enough, who worked for the Germans long-term.</span> <span id="s866">By then, a sort of a steady work force evolved.</span> <span id="s867">There were still these who went for daily work, but over a period of these months, Germans, say in the army, who needed work to be done daily -- it was usually just labor, daily labor -- would keep some of the same people.</span> <span id="s868">And people actually became steady workers from some German unit or another.</span> <span id="s869">And it wasn’t necessarily the army.</span> <span id="s870">Even the Gestapo employed some Jews.</span> <span id="s871">They weren’t picky.</span> <span id="s872">When they needed simple labor or hard work, they used Jews, because that was slave labor.</span> <span id="s873">They didn’t have to pay them.</span> <span id="s874">But they did get some food there.</span> <span id="s875">They’d get fed.</span> <span id="s876">And also they had access to some of the German information.</span> <span id="s877">Not that that information was, in our opinion, dependable, because of course, it was all biased and all propaganda, at least from our point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">One important thing, of course, that happened, which I should mention in general terms was in June of 1941.</span> <span id="s879">The Germans opened an eastern front and attacked the Russians.</span> <span id="s880">That had a very, very terrible effect on us.</span> <span id="s881">It was obvious the allies had lost.</span> <span id="s882">They were expelled from the continent and had to run for their lives to England.</span> <span id="s883">And so the Germans were completely in control of all of western Europe, and now, in a very quick swoop, they took back the Polish territory -- the eastern Polish territories -- and took care of the Russians, and put them running.</span> <span id="s884">And from then on, I remember the discussions that went on -- about the big conquests that the Germans were making, Leningrad was besieged, and Moscow was besieged -- and we still clung to the idea that this was all propaganda.</span> <span id="s885">It can’t possibly be true, because by then it looked so desperate.</span> <span id="s886">You see, the Germans were winning the war, and if they were winning the war, I think that more than anything else gave us this outlook on life that we really didn’t have much to look forward to, in the second half of 1941, because the war wasn’t going to end in a month, and it wasn’t going to end in a year.</span> <span id="s887">The Germans were winning, and that’s what we have to look forward to for the rest of our lives.</span> <span id="s888">We still weren’t going to be all killed, you know, but we’re going to die out.</span> <span id="s889">This is it.</span> <span id="s890">This is the end of the war, and they won it.</span> <span id="s891">So I think that, more than anything, dampened our spirits, until 1943 when the German retreat started.</span> <span id="s892">That’s when it picked up again, but by then, of course, there weren’t very many of us left.</span> <span id="s893">So in 1942, after the arrest of the leadership of the Jewish Council, they started registering again.</span> <span id="s894">Everybody had to register -- the Jews -- and receive a work pass.</span> <span id="s895">But work passes were only given to those who were not younger than 16 and not older than 35.</span> <span id="s896">And then a terrible thing happened in our family.</span> <span id="s897">And that was in April, on April 28th of 1942.</span> <span id="s898">That’s when the knock on the door came at our house.</span> <span id="s899">That night, there was a knock on the door, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s900">And since there was an early curfew, you knew it wasn’t anybody from the neighborhood or any of your friends.</span> <span id="s901">You knew it had to be a German -- besides which, of course, there was firing going on outside, so we were already awake.</span> <span id="s902">There was something going on, another action similar to the one that took place in February.</span> <span id="s903">And I think David opened the door.</span> <span id="s904">There was a Gestapo man standing at the door with a list in his hand, and asked if Isaiah Eiger lived in this house.</span> <span id="s905">And David said yes, so he came into the room where we all slept.</span> <span id="s906">And my father was getting up.</span> <span id="s907">He had not been well.</span> <span id="s908">He had an inflammation of the sciatic nerve, so he couldn’t walk very well.</span> <span id="s909">He walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s910">He got up and had to show his I.D., and then the Gestapo man told him to get dressed and come with him.</span> <span id="s911">Which he did.</span> <span id="s912">And we were just standing there, paralyzed, totally unable to say anything.</span> <span id="s913">I think he hugged us and he walked out limping, with the Gestapo man, and there is this machine gun fire going on outside, and my mother was totally beside herself!</span> <span id="s914">And we…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s915">This is like totally blotted out of my memory, what happened after that, because naturally we didn’t go back to sleep.</span> <span id="s916">I think we were just standing around, waiting to see what to do.</span> <span id="s917">We didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s918">We did know, at that point, that our neighbor across the hall was also arrested, and that there were arrests going on all over.</span> <span id="s919">There was a so-called Jewish police, sort of a militia, in the ghetto, which had to keep order, and deliver orders; the Jewish Council and the Jewish militia were really conduits of the Germans to carry out orders.</span> <span id="s920">And at some point, I think one of the Jewish militia came by, and told us what was going on, and he said that there were a lot of casualties, that a lot of people were just being taken out of their homes and just shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s921">Well about 6 o’clock was the end of the curfew -- the night curfew -- and then David went to the Council, which is where he worked, to find out what happened, and what happened to our father.</span> <span id="s922">It was really an event that was very traumatic to the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s923">He found out that about 200 people had been taken out of their homes, and more than half were executed on the spot.</span> <span id="s924">He wanted to know what happened to father, and they said, “Well, nobody knows!</span> <span id="s925">You go and look at those who were shot, and if he isn’t among those who were shot, then he’s at the Gestapo headquarters.”</span> <span id="s926">So David actually had to go and…I imagine he told you about this.</span> <span id="s927">This is probably an experience that I couldn’t relate, that was probably indescribable.</span> <span id="s928">I don’t really know how he felt when he went and had to look at all these lined up bodies to finally know that father wasn’t among them.</span> <span id="s929">But he had to do that.</span> <span id="s930">That was his function, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s931">So we knew then, at that point, that father was among the maybe 75 people who were at the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s932">And during the day, the Jewish Council was notified that they were to bring food for those, which they had sent with the Jewish militia.</span> <span id="s933">And then my father writes about that day in his memoir.</span> <span id="s934">How they were beaten and mistreated and questioned and really thought that was the end, that they would never see the end of that.</span> <span id="s935">And by the way, my uncle -- my father’s brother, who was expelled from his home -- he was also arrested that night, but not executed.</span> <span id="s936">So both of them were there at Gestapo headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: As you explained to me earlier, but not on tape, your father survived the camp, and later was to write his memories of that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Right, yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: And that memory in Yiddish is deposited where?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Well, I have a copy, and David (Eiger) has a copy, and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which is the memorial to the 5,000,000 has a copy of it.</span> <span id="s941">I hope to, someday, be able to translate it into English and incorporate it in some kind of story -- family saga -- because we each, really, had separate experiences, having been separated at one point or another, except for myself and my mother, who were together the whole time.</span> <span id="s942">So someday, those memoirs, hopefully will be integrated into the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">But it was that night in 1942 that my father was then shipped out -- the next night, that is.</span> <span id="s944">He was arrested one night and then the next evening they were taken to the railroad station and they were shipped out.</span> <span id="s945">And it was, again, by word of mouth, it was conveyed to us that they probably were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s946">Auschwitz, by then, was popping up more often in conversations, and it was a word that was used more often describing a detention or a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s947">Nobody knew much about it, yet, but there was such a place, and there was some kind of camp, because the people in the first group that were arrested, in February, were also sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s948">And about four to six weeks after they were shipped out, that first group, telegrams began arriving to their families that they had died at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s949">And eventually, I think, all but maybe two families were notified that their people had died in Auschwitz of “natural causes”, of course.</span> <span id="s950">And shortly after my father and his group were shipped to Auschwitz, a few weeks later, telegrams started arriving, too, to those families.</span> <span id="s951">But then, everybody just denied it!</span> <span id="s952">“It can’t be!</span> <span id="s953">They didn’t all die.</span> <span id="s954">It’s just a ruse.</span> <span id="s955">It’s just to make us suffer more.”</span> <span id="s956">We didn’t believe it, you see.</span> <span id="s957">It’s denial, because it’s the ultimate that destroys your life if you accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s959">It occurs to me, that this capacity to deny is sometimes destructive, and at other times, it’s a protective mechanism, don’t you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I think in this case, as I look back, in all instances, I think the denial was more constructive, psychologically.</span> <span id="s961">It may have been destructive, in some ways, that people became more fatalistic.</span> <span id="s962">Because if they didn’t believe that it was going to happen, they didn’t do anything, maybe, to enhance their chances.</span> <span id="s963">In the end, there really weren’t that many ways that one could enhance one’s chances, but in some instances…</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: There must have been an increasing sense of hopelessness, helplessness.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Helplessness, but not hopelessness.</span> <span id="s966">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s967">I think that’s the big difference.</span> <span id="s968">But we never did get a telegram, interestingly enough.</span> <span id="s969">My uncle’s family was notified that he had died.</span> <span id="s970">Our neighbor’s family was notified.</span> <span id="s971">There were only about two or three that didn’t receive telegrams.</span> <span id="s972">So of course, the idea was then, that the telegrams certainly don’t mean anything, because why wouldn’t we receive a telegram/ By then my mother began to worry, because she thought that those who didn’t receive telegrams, maybe, were the ones who died.</span> <span id="s973">You just don’t know what to worry about!</span> <span id="s974">You don’t know what any of this means!</span> <span id="s975">And it’s a just absolutely impossible situation.</span> <span id="s976">Well, in the meantime, of course, after my father was arrested, we lost our protector.</span> <span id="s977">He ran the show.</span> <span id="s978">We looked to him to…he was all powerful to us.</span> <span id="s979">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Your supreme being.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yeah, he was our supreme being.</span> <span id="s982">He really was.</span> <span id="s983">The whole family.</span> <span id="s984">Because he was really the man that everybody looked to for advice, and for judgment.</span> <span id="s985">And suddenly we were just rudderless.</span> <span id="s986">We were just floating there.</span> <span id="s987">My mother was very severely affected by this, because she really never exercised her own personality, or her own initiative.</span> <span id="s988">This wasn’t the sort of things that one did.</span> <span id="s989">But then suddenly she had to gather herself together, and she had to become the head of the family.</span> <span id="s990">She had to start making these decisions.</span> <span id="s991">And one thing that was very disturbing at that point, was that she couldn’t get a labor pass, because she was over 35.</span> <span id="s992">We didn’t know exactly what that meant, but it had to mean something bad.</span> <span id="s993">And she didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s994">One thing that happened to us as a result of not having father’s protection, because he knew all these people in the Jewish Council, was that immediately they raided our house, and took a lot of the belongings, a lot of the lovely things that my mother cherished, because we had to all surrender furs and silver and gold and jewelry way before that, that the Germans required.</span> <span id="s995">In fact there were a few things that my mother just said she absolutely isn’t going to give to anybody, and so my parents dug a hole in the basement and buried a lot of their lovely things, like her fur, and beautiful sterling silver.</span> <span id="s996">It’s still sort of a joke in our family.</span> <span id="s997">I sometimes recall what a beautiful candelabra my mother had that she used for Friday evening.</span> <span id="s998">A beautiful, big sterling candelabra.</span> <span id="s999">And Barbara, my sister-in-law, is very fond of antiques; I like modern things.</span> <span id="s1000">She says, “Oh, I would have loved to have had that candelabra!?</span> <span id="s1001">And I say, “Barbara, don’t sharpen your appetite, you never would have gotten it!</span> <span id="s1002">I would have had it.”</span> <span id="s1003">(Laughs) But nobody ever had it.</span> <span id="s1004">I don’t know who dug it up.</span> <span id="s1005">I’m sure some Polish family that moved in afterwards; I’m sure they found it.</span> <span id="s1006">That’s not something I miss.</span> <span id="s1007">But my mother, at the time -- when she was losing her things, that they worked for for so many years, they struggled, they didn’t have anything handed to them, either, they worked for it – she suffered very much, and she really cried when the Germans came and took her beautiful wardrobe, and they took her beautiful linens and tablecloths and such.</span> <span id="s1008">Some of it she gave to a woman who was our maid -- had been our maid --for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s1009">Of course she never saw that again, either.</span> <span id="s1010">But those are the sorts of things that I certainly have no particular regret about, except when you intellectualize the whole thing, you can see that unfortunately, a lot of people benefited from the misery of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1011">To us it was unimportant.</span> <span id="s1012">At that point, when was 18 years old, I said to my mother, very matter-of-factly, “Don’t cry about things, because if you are alive, if you survive this, you’ll have new things, and I don’t think we’re any of us going to survive this.”</span> <span id="s1013">By then, by April of 1942, May of 1942, it looked like nobody would ever make it.</span> <span id="s1014">This is, you understand, all the victories, the military victories of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1015">And the situation of the Jews was getting worse and worse and by now we’re seeing the victims lying on the streets with bullets in their heads.</span> <span id="s1016">This wasn’t common before.</span> <span id="s1017">This was new.</span> <span id="s1018">And as a result, a certain amount of resignation is now entering into the picture, and it looks like we’re not going to make it.</span> <span id="s1019">It looks like the Germans are going to win the war, and as a result they really have nobody to account to, and they can do to the Jews what they want.</span> <span id="s1020">Later, much later in life, I realized how people would feel the way my mother did.</span> <span id="s1021">You know, “Here goes my whole life!</span> <span id="s1022">Now my husband is gone!</span> <span id="s1023">Now my things are gone!</span> <span id="s1024">What’s next?”</span> <span id="s1025">And I think that she was in a very, very bad state of mind at the time.</span> <span id="s1026">Took a little time for her to dig herself out of it.</span> <span id="s1027">She still had to feed us, of course.</span> <span id="s1028">She still had to get some kind of life going.</span> <span id="s1029">She, she did pick herself up, and what she started to do was she was trading on the black market in order to have some food for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: As I recall, David was involved in that, too, felt the obligation to keep food on the table for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1032">Well, he was the older one.</span> <span id="s1033">There was a Polish woman who had been a housekeeper of my uncle’s, and she came with him and his family.</span> <span id="s1034">I fact, she, I think, was a nanny to his wife yet; she was an older woman.</span> <span id="s1035">And she couldn’t be with the family in the ghetto, because she was not Jewish, so she had a room outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1036">She would purchase some vegetables and fruits and some foodstuff, bring it to the wooden wall -- there was a wooden wall surrounding the ghetto -- and she would take the money from my mother and hand her the bundle.</span> <span id="s1037">And then my mother would sell it to other people who still had some money, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Did this woman do it out of concern and interest in the family?</span> <span id="s1039">Or was it simply for monetary reasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Both.</span> <span id="s1041">No, not simply for monetary reasons.</span> <span id="s1042">She did risk her freedom to some extent, and I’m sure she wouldn’t have done it just for anybody.</span> <span id="s1043">She did it because of the concern for our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Were there other instances of non-Jews coming to your aid…</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: There were other people!</span> <span id="s1046">Sure there were other Poles who were trading with Jews.</span> <span id="s1047">This was a very common thing.</span> <span id="s1048">This was one way that we could get some food.</span> <span id="s1049">But my mother made enough in food -- what she sold was enough money – to buy some more food from her and keep some for us.</span> <span id="s1050">So this went on for about a year.</span> <span id="s1051">Between April of 1942, and when the deportation took place in the Radom ghetto, which was August of 1942, it was a time of foreboding and knowledge that something was happening, that was going to disrupt our lives terribly.</span> <span id="s1052">We didn’t know what, and we tried to deny it.</span> <span id="s1053">There were rumors at that point, that there were deportations, that there was an “action” in a city by the name of Lublin, which was to the east of us, which is where Jules is from, originally.</span> <span id="s1054">This is where his family lived, and his family, indeed, was all killed in that action.</span> <span id="s1055">But not until Jules’s cousin came to the ghetto did we know for sure what had happened there -- and it was really a massacre -- in the ghetto, and then the rest of the people were deported, and nobody knew where they had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">And then the rumors started reaching Radom that the same thing was going on in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1057">And I don’t remember when we found out about the incident with the chairman of the Jewish Council in Warsaw committing suicide, but I know that we knew about it.</span> <span id="s1058">We did hear about it.</span> <span id="s1059">Again, probably because some people did risk their lives by taking off their identity and traveling.</span> <span id="s1060">That’s what Jules’s cousin did.</span> <span id="s1061">Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1062">That was later -- after the deportations already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">But in those few months, people started scampering around.</span> <span id="s1064">It became apparent that something with those labor cards was important, that it was important to have one, that it was important, maybe to work for a German unit someplace.</span> <span id="s1065">I had been attending ORT classes in sewing.</span> <span id="s1066">I was taking a course in sewing.</span> <span id="s1067">And in fact, that course was so filled, that the instructor said she’d only take me in if I could bring a sewing machine with me.</span> <span id="s1068">It was another item that my mother dearly cherished.</span> <span id="s1069">She isn’t going to give up her sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1070">I said, “Mother, you’re not going to have that sewing machine anyway, you might as well give it away, and at least I’ll learn something.</span> <span id="s1071">I’ll learn to sew.”</span> <span id="s1072">So she did.</span> <span id="s1073">She gave away her sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1074">And I was taking this course in sewing, which came in very, very handy later.</span> <span id="s1075">And in fact I still sew!</span> <span id="s1076">My mother felt like her daughter isn’t going to be a dressmaker!</span> <span id="s1077">You know, I was going to be a lady of leisure.</span> <span id="s1078">Once I get married, I’ll be like her!</span> <span id="s1079">I didn’t need a trade!</span> <span id="s1080">(Laughs) By then, maybe she changed her mind a little.</span> <span id="s1081">There was an incident that happened at that time which was very, very significant, that takes a little back-grounding, and I don’t know if David told you about this.</span> <span id="s1082">And that was the encounter with that Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s1083">Did he ever tell you about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Yes, but you might tell it from your perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well, I really have a hearsay only, knowledge about it, because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1086">David really was the principal in this, but I was there when we met him.</span> <span id="s1087">What happened was that a young woman came from a small town to see us, and she identified herself as the daughter of a cousin of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1088">This is not that town named Strowicz.</span> <span id="s1089">She traveled as a non-Jew, and indeed, if there is a stereotype of a non-Jewish looking person, she certainly was it.</span> <span id="s1090">Tall and fair skinned, and light-haired, and blue-eyed.</span> <span id="s1091">And my mother didn’t know her, because she was young.</span> <span id="s1092">She was my age.</span> <span id="s1093">But of course, it was her first cousin’s daughter.</span> <span id="s1094">She came because she wanted to see a certain Gestapo man for whom she worked in Ostrowicz; he was very kind to her and very helpful.</span> <span id="s1095">And she came to find out if he could do something for her, because now these deportations were going on -- these “resettlements” is what they were called -- but she wanted to protect her family, and she wanted to protect herself.</span> <span id="s1096">So she apparently sent word to him that she was coming to Radom, and could he meet her.</span> <span id="s1097">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, there wasn’t any romance involved.</span> <span id="s1099">He was an old, fatherly man.</span> <span id="s1100">Our place happened to be very convenient, because, do you remember I said ours was the last house on the block?</span> <span id="s1101">And the other side of the street was already outside the ghetto, so one could slip in very unobtrusively, which is what he did.</span> <span id="s1102">He came in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1103">I remember being terrified.</span> <span id="s1104">I thought that a Gestapo man has to just be a horrible person, to begin with, just looking at one.</span> <span id="s1105">Well he came in civilian clothes, so he looked very normal, and we sat and talked.</span> <span id="s1106">What it turned out, was that he had been a policeman before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s1107">And he was just integrated into the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1108">He was really a very kindly man, and he really absolutely could not tolerate…he did meet a bad end, of course, because he was trying to be helpful to Jews.</span> <span id="s1109">He gave us one very important piece of information, and that was if we didn’t get a telegram from Auschwitz, that meant conclusively that my father was alive.</span> <span id="s1110">That those telegrams were indeed true, but that they were sent when people actually died.</span> <span id="s1111">He said he had checked, and that father was alive, so that was a very, very important piece of news that we had, and it just meant everything!</span> <span id="s1112">I think it just revived my mother!</span> <span id="s1113">It’s interesting, because he may have died the next day, you know.</span> <span id="s1114">Or the day after.</span> <span id="s1115">But it just picked up our spirits.</span> <span id="s1116">Here he was, two months later.</span> <span id="s1117">He was still alive.</span> <span id="s1118">And others, apparently, did die.</span> <span id="s1119">What I suppose didn’t dawn on us, was how people couldn’t live there very long.</span> <span id="s1120">It was a very high point, finding that out.</span> <span id="s1121">And then he left, and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1122">And my cousin --we never saw my cousin again.</span> <span id="s1123">We don’t know exactly what happened to her, but we know that she did try to pass as a non-Jew and go to Germany to work, but was exposed by the Poles, was denounced, and she was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Well, I still was going, taking these classes in sewing.</span> <span id="s1125">And it looked like one has to be doing something -- has to be employed by the Germans, preferably.</span> <span id="s1126">After my father was arrested, the Jewish Council sent another person to live with us in his place.</span> <span id="s1127">I meant, we couldn’t -- just three -- have one room.</span> <span id="s1128">So they sent us a woman who was alone, who had already lot her whole family in another city.</span> <span id="s1129">Either she lost her family, I wasn’t sure exactly, or they were in a different ghetto, and she came to Radom.</span> <span id="s1130">She worked for the German army.</span> <span id="s1131">She worked in one of those units that they employed permanently.</span> <span id="s1132">It was the unit that took care of their vegetable gardens, for their food, you know, for their kitchens -- and so they planted and weeded and whatever needs to be done in a garden.</span> <span id="s1133">So she lived with us and went to work every day.</span> <span id="s1134">And one day she came --- and I can’t remember the exact date, wait, something else happened before.</span> <span id="s1135">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1136">And I don’t remember the exact date of that; I think it was August 6th, but I’m not positive.</span> <span id="s1137">Suddenly we woke up.</span> <span id="s1138">It was just daybreak.</span> <span id="s1139">And we heard distant firing.</span> <span id="s1140">And here were, at the very end of the ghetto, so we really didn’t know, most of the time, at least at night, what was going on, because we were really very, relatively speaking, far from the central square of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1141">But we heard the firing, and obviously jumped up.</span> <span id="s1142">You know something terrible is going on.</span> <span id="s1143">And by the time we found out what went on, it turned out that there was a deportation going on.</span> <span id="s1144">I never mentioned this, but there were two sections of ghettos in Radom that were about maybe two-and-a-half miles apart.</span> <span id="s1145">And they had emptied out that smaller section, that smaller ghetto, and apparently had some spare boxcars, so they came to the big ghetto, and rounded up, maybe, 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s1146">And when we came to, the whole family was gone.</span> <span id="s1147">Grandmother, great-grandmother, all the aunts and children, the other uncles.</span> <span id="s1148">(The one, of course died in Auschwitz) Everybody was gone.</span> <span id="s1149">There was not one of them left, except the three of us, David, my mother, and I, because we were in that little house way on the outskirts that they didn’t get to.</span> <span id="s1150">And obviously there was an awful lot of killing.</span> <span id="s1151">There was just a slaughter!</span> <span id="s1152">And that morning, they took a bunch of young men from the ghetto -- and Jules was among them -- to the small ghetto, that smaller area, to dig a mass grave and bury all the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">And that was, I think, at that time, the sign that we really didn’t have a chance of making it.</span> <span id="s1154">Because it wasn’t a resettlement.</span> <span id="s1155">It obviously was just a very brutal action that was just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s1156">But we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1157">We didn’t know what happened to the people who went in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s1158">That was an absolute unknown.</span> <span id="s1159">The word “gas chamber” had never even surfaced yet, at that time.</span> <span id="s1160">It wasn’t until a little later when that term was coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">That was the time when people started really scampering to get some kind of a position with a German unit, to escape that, because now it became obvious that it was just a matter of time that the rest of the ghetto will also be resettled, or that the same thing will happen in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1162">My mother was absolutely desperate, because of me, because I really didn’t have any place.</span> <span id="s1163">There was no place for me to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Well one day this woman who lived with us, who worked for the German army -- it was a Wednesday -- she came running in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1165">She came running to the house, and she said, “They just told us to go home and get our belongings, because now we’re going to stay there overnight, too, in the army barracks.”</span> <span id="s1166">And she said, “They told me I could bring somebody, so if you want to come with me,” she said to me, “You can come.”</span> <span id="s1167">And I said, “No way.</span> <span id="s1168">I’m not going without my mother.”</span> <span id="s1169">And my mother took me by the neck and practically shoved me out the door!</span> <span id="s1170">And she said, “You’re going!”</span> <span id="s1171">That’s the most unforgettable time, when I really felt I was saying good-bye to my mother for the very last time, that I’d never see her again.</span> <span id="s1172">And I was very unhappy about going, but I went.</span> <span id="s1173">We went to the military barracks, which were just on the edge of town.</span> <span id="s1174">And that’s where we were placed.</span> <span id="s1175">This was a unit of the German army that employed these women.</span> <span id="s1176">What we were doing, was tending their vegetable gardens, and it was a huge field of lettuce and radishes and all kinds of other vegetables which we tended.</span> <span id="s1177">I remember weeding these beds.</span> <span id="s1178">And it was backbreaking labor.</span> <span id="s1179">You think of working in your garden as being a work of pleasure.</span> <span id="s1180">This was really hard work, because, of course, a soldier with a gun was standing there watching you all the time, and you had to do it all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">We were outside.</span> <span id="s1182">It was August, so the weather was nice.</span> <span id="s1183">It was sunny.</span> <span id="s1184">But I was crying constantly.</span> <span id="s1185">I didn’t know what was going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1186">I had no contact with the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1187">And I was constantly thinking, “This is it!</span> <span id="s1188">What am I going on for?</span> <span id="s1189">What am I working so hard for?”</span> <span id="s1190">It was just a few days later -- I don’t remember exactly whether this was on a Tuesday or a Wednesday; I think it was a Wednesday -- well it was a Sunday night, that we were awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of gunfire.</span> <span id="s1191">This was not a large city, you understand, Radom, and the ghetto wasn’t that far.</span> <span id="s1192">We heard the shooting, but we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1193">Obviously, we suspected the worst, knowing what had already gone on in the ghetto a week or so before.</span> <span id="s1194">And I was just beside myself.</span> <span id="s1195">I was crying.</span> <span id="s1196">I was probably one of the youngest women there.</span> <span id="s1197">This was a group of maybe -- I can’t really remember the numbers -- maybe 50, maybe 100 women, and they were consoling me.</span> <span id="s1198">Most of them to my recollection, did not have anybody in the ghetto -- certainly not a mother -- the situation I was in.</span> <span id="s1199">They were consoling me, and I was crying hysterically.</span> <span id="s1200">The next day, I was trying to find out what had happened, what had gone on.</span> <span id="s1201">I knew one telephone number of a friend of my family’s, an older man, who had a workshop that was important for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1202">And so they had a German administrator, and kept the workers, so they were isolated like we were, kept there separately without being let into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A soldier went with me to a telephone -- one of the soldiers who guarded us, went with me to a telephone!</span> <span id="s1204">I begged him!</span> <span id="s1205">-- that I needed to make a phone call.</span> <span id="s1206">And I telephoned this place -- this Mr. Brenamann, and I got to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1207">And he said he heard -- he wasn’t in the ghetto either -- but he had heard that my mother was okay.</span> <span id="s1208">I really didn’t know whether he was just trying to make me feel better, or whether this was actually so, but I did feel better that day.</span> <span id="s1209">Not knowing, of course, that the second night, Monday night, was a repeat of the same performance, that they hadn’t finished on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1210">They were finishing up on Monday.</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t remember -- this is so fuzzy in my mind, because it was probably the most difficult time, just finding out, being on the outside, not knowing what was going on on the inside -- I don’t remember how long it was that I finally did find out.</span> <span id="s1212">I think the instant that I do remember, was when we were in the field working, and across the road was a factory where they made pots and pans, okay?</span> <span id="s1213">These enameled pots ‘n pans.</span> <span id="s1214">And they had a unit of Jews working there.</span> <span id="s1215">And as I looked up, somebody was motioning to me from across the road.</span> <span id="s1216">I couldn’t go across the road of course, because if I did, I would have been…(gestures.)</span> <span id="s1217">I mean no question asked, you understand.</span> <span id="s1218">It was a dear friend of mine, who had come to work to this factory, and he yelled to me, “Mother and David are okay!”</span> <span id="s1219">In fact, this dear friend just visited us this summer.</span> <span id="s1220">He lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1221">(Laughs) But I don’t remember what day that was, whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday.</span> <span id="s1222">It was a couple of days after, but I did find out.</span> <span id="s1223">And he said, “I saw them!</span> <span id="s1224">They’re okay!”</span> <span id="s1225">I wasn’t very trusting, you know.</span> <span id="s1226">I thought people are really trying to console me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">So that was great.</span> <span id="s1228">I went on working there.</span> <span id="s1229">And afterwards, when things quieted down, we did have some communication through people who were coming to work in some of the places that we worked in.</span> <span id="s1230">But I really wanted to get back, to be with my mother, and she wouldn’t allow me.</span> <span id="s1231">The situation in what had now become a forced labor camp -- that I really hadn’t even seen yet; I didn’t know what it looked like -- but they were now being marched out to work in columns, those who remained, and I really didn’t have any opportunity, particularly, to talk to anyone, to know exactly what the situation was, until maybe two weeks later when Jules, my husband got a pass, and came to see me.</span> <span id="s1232">And then I found out everything.</span> <span id="s1233">What had gone on, what happened in the ghetto during the deportation, and that there were only, really, a small number left.</span> <span id="s1234">His sister and father were both deported.</span> <span id="s1235">His mother was left.</span> <span id="s1236">So it was a very tragic meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: And what was Jules doing at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Jules was working, too, but he did get a pass and he got somebody to come with him.</span> <span id="s1239">A Jewish policeman came with him, and he saw me.</span> <span id="s1240">This was already September, and our work was pretty much coming to a close, after we harvested the vegetables.</span> <span id="s1241">Ramblings went on that we would be transferred to a different place for the winter, which was maybe about 10 miles out of town.</span> <span id="s1242">And I really didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1243">They would release me, but my mother still didn’t want me to come back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Well, finally, talking back and forth I told her that no matter what she’d say, I’m coming.</span> <span id="s1245">So by then it was probably about the middle of October, I came to the camp, and of course you know when they were assigned places to live, I wasn’t figured into it.</span> <span id="s1246">So there were five people in a tiny little room.</span> <span id="s1247">There was my mother and David, and my uncle Sam, the only other member of the family who was not deported in those mass deportations.</span> <span id="s1248">He was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1249">And there was Jules and his mother.</span> <span id="s1250">So there were five of them.</span> <span id="s1251">And when I came, I was the sixth.</span> <span id="s1252">This whole big room of maybe 9x15 was just filled with beds.</span> <span id="s1253">There was nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Well, at that point, food was being prepared in a communal kitchen, and we just got our rations every day, so there were no cooking facilities.</span> <span id="s1255">We didn’t need any.</span> <span id="s1256">And I came to the camp, and I had to be assigned a job.</span> <span id="s1257">I was not there legally, in other words.</span> <span id="s1258">I was not counted into those numbers that were left.</span> <span id="s1259">Of course there were others like me, too.</span> <span id="s1260">There were some people who were hiding out with Christian friends who came back into the camp, but couldn’t stay there for any length of time.</span> <span id="s1261">There were others who were hiding otherwise, and some like myself, who were out, temporarily, in some work place, and then wanted to join their families -- came back to the camp.</span> <span id="s1262">So at all times, there were numbers of people who didn’t have an assigned place of work.</span> <span id="s1263">And that was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1264">That camp was not for people to lounge around!</span> <span id="s1265">You had to be going to work!</span> <span id="s1266">Well very soon, some very terrible things started happening, because the Germans knew that this was going on, obviously, that more people were coming back to the camp.</span> <span id="s1267">So they staged raids in the daytime, to flush those who weren’t at work.</span> <span id="s1268">And on at least two occasions, they lined up people and took out every 10th person -- just counted 10 -- the 10th person was lined up and executed in front of everybody else.</span> <span id="s1269">So it was very imperative that I go to work.</span> <span id="s1270">Well David was working in a workshop where they were making bookcases -- woodworking workshop.</span> <span id="s1271">And he arranged with the German administrator who was in charge of this, that he would use me.</span> <span id="s1272">So I went to work there, and I worked there for a while.</span> <span id="s1273">Then, in course of the following year, maybe, I worked at a number of various tasks, because there were certain jobs that were temporary, and they needed people for maybe two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1274">I remember one particular incident that is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1275">I was assigned to a unit that was supposed to mend rugs, runners that are finished at the end, and when those were fraying, they had to be replaced.</span> <span id="s1276">So one day, I was working in the main government building in Radom, mending those runners.</span> <span id="s1277">And the governor walked by-- the German governor.</span> <span id="s1278">I was immediately dismissed.</span> <span id="s1279">“A Jewess?</span> <span id="s1280">In the government building?!</span> <span id="s1281">In full view of everybody?</span> <span id="s1282">A slave laborer?!”</span> <span id="s1283">And I was very obvious there.</span> <span id="s1284">And of course, I had to wear the armband, so it was obvious that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1285">That was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Then I made covers for mattresses.</span> <span id="s1287">One thing that’s memorable, is I was assigned as a maid to a government employee, to clean her apartment.</span> <span id="s1288">Well, one of my tasks -- I never cleaned my own room at home, you understand, we had a live-in maid -- so cleaning somebody’s apartment was okay, but to build a fire in the fireplace was a different story altogether.</span> <span id="s1289">We had these freestanding fireplaces.</span> <span id="s1290">I don’t know if you’ve ever seen it, with white ceramic tile?</span> <span id="s1291">On the outside?</span> <span id="s1292">And then a fire was made.</span> <span id="s1293">This was a coal fire.</span> <span id="s1294">And when the oxygen was shut off, at a certain point when the coal was glowing, then the heat emanated from those tiles.</span> <span id="s1295">Well, I was supposed to make that fire.</span> <span id="s1296">I didn’t know how to make a fire.</span> <span id="s1297">I remember coming back absolutely desperate, and getting lessons in how to make a fire, David, my mother, and Jules teaching me how to make a fire.</span> <span id="s1298">Another task I did was, at one point I was a cook for a group.</span> <span id="s1299">Now, you understand, I’m 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1300">I’d never done any of this at home.</span> <span id="s1301">And here I’m supposed to be cooking a meal for a bunch of Jewish workers.</span> <span id="s1302">The kitchen in the camp gave us the dry ingredients.</span> <span id="s1303">This was an option if the place of work had facilities where a meal could be cooked.</span> <span id="s1304">And I was supposed to cook a meal!</span> <span id="s1305">I didn’t even know how to cook -- how to boil water, or boil an egg.</span> <span id="s1306">But I learned in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1307">I became so good at these things that it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1308">After a week or two, I was very good at whatever I was doing.</span> <span id="s1309">And then I did some clean-up work after painters.</span> <span id="s1310">I had a very, varied career.</span> <span id="s1311">In other words, at least it wasn’t boring.</span> <span id="s1312">I did something different all the time.</span> <span id="s1313">They weren’t pleasant tasks, and those were 12 hours of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Now I had told you about my father, that he was shipped off to Auschwitz, right, in April of 1942?</span> <span id="s1315">Must have been early spring of 1943 when we came back.</span> <span id="s1316">I was working at Armbruster’s at the time, this was the woodworking shop where David and I both were working.</span> <span id="s1317">We came back, I believe it was Friday.</span> <span id="s1318">My mother was very excited.</span> <span id="s1319">She told us, very conspiratorially -- nobody could hear what she was saying -- that a letter came from my father.</span> <span id="s1320">Well, this was totally unbelievable!</span> <span id="s1321">This is how the story went: My father had worked in that tannery before he was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1322">That tannery was still in operation, and the Jewish workers were still there.</span> <span id="s1323">There was a woman who was in charge of the office, and when she came back into the camp, she said she had a letter from a former employee of that factory -- a Pole -- but when she opened the letter, it wasn’t this employee, but it was father’s writing.</span> <span id="s1324">And she said she can tell father’s writing!</span> <span id="s1325">She knew him so well!</span> <span id="s1326">I mean they worked together for a long time!</span> <span id="s1327">So she brought the letter.</span> <span id="s1328">And quite obviously -- my father had the kind of handwriting that was absolutely unmistakable -- that was a letter written by him, But of course, as a Jew, he was not allowed to write a letter.</span> <span id="s1329">The Poles who were shipped to Auschwitz, could write letters to one address.</span> <span id="s1330">Well we didn’t know all this until much later, but it was a letter from him, writing as though he was this “John” or whatever, this laborer who worked in that factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">He also said that he had run into somebody he knew from the factory, indicating that he saw somebody there.</span> <span id="s1332">Father knew that we would recognize the handwriting, obviously.</span> <span id="s1333">And then in the rest of the letter, he just said to send him some things -- I guess the Christian Poles could receive packages -- onions and garlic, and some other things which I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1334">The memorable thing is the garlic and the onions!</span> <span id="s1335">so I remember that next day, when we went to work, David and I, we made contact to buy garlic and onions and made a package to send to Auschwitz, which we did.</span> <span id="s1336">And this went on.</span> <span id="s1337">A letter would come maybe once a month.</span> <span id="s1338">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1339">We did get several letters, and we did send several packages that included garlic and onions.</span> <span id="s1340">And then they stopped coming.</span> <span id="s1341">The letters stopped coming.</span> <span id="s1342">And of course that was very disturbing, although now, this is 1943, understand it’s about a year later.</span> <span id="s1343">So we knew he was alive a year after he was shipped out to Auschwitz, and that was totally unheard of, anyway.</span> <span id="s1344">At a later time, we did get to see him in Auschwitz -- much later.</span> <span id="s1345">But in the summer of 1943…well, I really have to backtrack, because during that year in the camp, there were several actions.</span> <span id="s1346">This wasn’t really going to work and living quietly.</span> <span id="s1347">I told you about the executions that took place.</span> <span id="s1348">Then on January 13, 1943, there was another action -- apparently the population of the camp had swollen by about 500 people, like myself, who came back -- and so there was a very tragic action on that day, and probably about five or six hundred people were deported.</span> <span id="s1349">But the perfidy of it, was really just totally unbelievable!</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">In November of 1942, suddenly an order came from the Germans to the Jewish administration of the camp, to start registering people who had relatives in Palestine, and to set up a priority in such a way, that those who had parents or children in Palestine would be at the top of the list.</span> <span id="s1351">Then other relatives, like grandparents, or brothers or sisters or cousins, whatever relatives, in that order, to register them.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, first of all, everybody was very suspicious.</span> <span id="s1353">Why do they want to register everybody who has relatives in Palestine?</span> <span id="s1354">The top of the list would be those who actually had -- were -- had been residents of Palestine at any time – assuming that they would that way have been citizens of Palestine.</span> <span id="s1355">It was very, very suspect -- what this might mean.</span> <span id="s1356">And a lot of people were reluctant to register -- even if they did have relatives.</span> <span id="s1357">Rumor had it, that there was going to be an exchange of Jews for Germans who lived in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1358">There was a German colony in Palestine -- in Jerusalem -- Katamon, right on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and they were, of course, under arrest by the British, because Palestine was a British protectorate.</span> <span id="s1359">So this was the rumor, that they were registering Jews in order to exchange them for those Germans.</span> <span id="s1360">So a lot of people did register, and in fact, there was a real scramble to find any kind of connection to register.</span> <span id="s1361">We registered even though we didn’t have anybody in Palestine at the time, other than cousins, but my father had been to Palestine in 1936, so we registered as though we were Palestinian citizens!</span> <span id="s1362">and we were pretty high on the list!</span> <span id="s1363">it was pretty dangerous.</span> <span id="s1364">We really didn’t know what it would entail.</span> <span id="s1365">That deportation -- and it was the first one that I had been to, in January of 1943 -- they actually took the time to read that registration list, and on that day, those people who were not on the list were deported, and those who were on the list were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: How can you explain anything that they did!</span> <span id="s1368">It was a bitterly cold day -- the 13th of January.</span> <span id="s1369">It was terribly cold!</span> <span id="s1370">And there we stood, from dawn to dusk, standing there for that list to be read.</span> <span id="s1371">About 2,000 thousand names were read.</span> <span id="s1372">And the rest, whoever wasn’t on the list, was to be deported.</span> <span id="s1373">We got back to our places, and life returned to the horrible reality that it had been before.</span> <span id="s1374">And actually, I have a friend who lives in Israel now, who stood there with her parents, who had a son in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1375">Her brother was in Palestine, and they didn’t register!</span> <span id="s1376">And they were deported.</span> <span id="s1377">They didn’t register because they didn’t trust the Germans!</span> <span id="s1378">Can you blame them?</span> <span id="s1379">Who could have trusted them?</span> <span id="s1380">Nobody really knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">That’s a perfect example of how we couldn’t take our own destiny in our own hands, because we never knew what the results would be.</span> <span id="s1382">Then on Purim of 1943, suddenly the Jewish head of the camp received an order to get all doctors, lawyers, all professionals, together with their families.</span> <span id="s1383">And so then the rumor was, they are going to be the first ones to be exchanged for those Germans in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1384">And they were so overjoyed.</span> <span id="s1385">They gathered together, and were led out in a column, out of the gate, and then somebody noticed, that as soon as they were put on a truck, another truck was following them, and that that truck was full of Ukrainian soldiers in uniform.</span> <span id="s1386">And a few hours later, a few came back.</span> <span id="s1387">They were taken to a town less than 20 miles away, to the Jewish cemetery there, and they were executed!</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: And these were doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Doctors, lawyers, all the professionals.</span> <span id="s1390">The intelligentsia with their families.</span> <span id="s1391">They left maybe a handful of people, who, after the massacre was over, were not dead.</span> <span id="s1392">They had thrown themselves on the group, pretending that they were dead, whatever.</span> <span id="s1393">A handful remained, and they were brought back to the camp.</span> <span id="s1394">And that’s how we knew what had happened.</span> <span id="s1395">The massacre of Purim of 1943.</span> <span id="s1396">So this is understandable, then that those who registered really took their lives in their own hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">You just couldn’t outsmart them.</span> <span id="s1398">We were absolutely helpless, totally helpless.</span> <span id="s1399">There was nothing that we could do to foresee what might happen.</span> <span id="s1400">They came up with constantly new tactics of terror.</span> <span id="s1401">It really is just totally incredible because when you talk about these things, you talk in general terms, you know about the extermination camps, and all the standard stuff.</span> <span id="s1402">But the terror was so imaginative, so full of innovations all the time, that you couldn’t out-guess them, and you couldn’t possibly foresee what was coming next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Well, by the summer of 1943, a group came from Warsaw, a small group of people who were printers, supposedly.</span> <span id="s1404">And they told us a terrible tale of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s1405">This was a group that survived the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s1406">They were taken to Majdanek and then brought to Radom where a printing unit was established.</span> <span id="s1407">One of these people was Alexander Donat, who later wrote quite a remarkable book called the Holocaust Kingdom.</span> <span id="s1408">He’s still alive -- he’s an old man now -- and I remember him.</span> <span id="s1409">I remember that group then became sort of integrated into the Radom group and spent the rest of the war in the various camps with us -- the women with the women and the men with the men -- wherever we went afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">The rumors in that summer of 1943 were that the camp -- the labor camp -- would be liquidated.</span> <span id="s1411">Of course there were rumors going on all the time.</span> <span id="s1412">Lots of people were working with Germans, not that the average German knew what the plans were -- but there was speculation.</span> <span id="s1413">There was constantly speculation going on, and besides, after the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, it became apparent that none of the small camps which were still in residential area, sort of like small ghettos would survive very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Now in Radom, parallel to that small ghetto -- we called it Small Ghetto; it was officially called Zwungsarbeiterlager, which means, Forced Labor Camp, Radom -- all the while, while there was a forced labor camp in town, there was also a Jewish unit working in the weapons factory, which was in Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">There were maybe about 500 men working in the weapons factory, and they never came to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s1416">We never saw them.</span> <span id="s1417">But this went on for some time.</span> <span id="s1418">And from where we were, that seemed like the worst that could happen to anybody, would be to be sent to the weapons factory to work.</span> <span id="s1419">So, the rumors were, that’s where everybody would be sent -- ultimately.</span> <span id="s1420">So we tried to figure out, maybe, a way of going there before and getting some kind of work that wasn’t the type of work that was so terrible.</span> <span id="s1421">You heard about the backbreaking labor that people had to perform there.</span> <span id="s1422">The worst jobs, of course, were reserved for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1423">Jules had a friend from school, a Christian Pole, who he knew was an assistant medical director or something in the weapons factory.</span> <span id="s1424">And so he contacted him to find out if there was anything he could do to arrange for some kind of work that would not be awfully hard.</span> <span id="s1425">Jules had -- in the meantime, of course, some experience.</span> <span id="s1426">He was mechanically very good, and he knew about electricity.</span> <span id="s1427">Now, being an electrical engineer, obviously he must have had this inclination.</span> <span id="s1428">So this man -- I don’t remember his name; Jules would -- said that he would look around and see if he could arrange for something.</span> <span id="s1429">The main thing was, you see, the factory worked on a 24-hour basis, so there were night shifts.</span> <span id="s1430">And the night shift was really terrible -- 12 hours night shift.</span> <span id="s1431">What Jules asked him to do, was to find out if he could find work for us that would only involve day-work -- the 12 hours day shift.</span> <span id="s1432">And eventually he did.</span> <span id="s1433">By about September, Jules and I transferred to the factory, to that camp, which was outside the town, next to the factory, or in relative proximity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">But before that, Jules and I got married.</span> <span id="s1435">This is really something that’s related to that registration for Palestine, way back a year before.</span> <span id="s1436">Jules was not registered, and it was a terrible thing to get him out on January 13th during that Palestine action which we, the Radomer, all called the “Palestine action,” January 13, 1943.</span> <span id="s1437">But now, since the rumors were still going, that that Palestine exchange -- they kept floating, coming up again and again, the rumors -- and I fact, earlier that year, they did take a group of people who really had relatives in Palestine, and took them out of the camp, and they told them to dress up very nicely, to take a nice suitcase with nice clothes, and they were taken out, and we didn’t hear that they were killed.</span> <span id="s1438">So if they weren’t killed, apparently they were transferred someplace.</span> <span id="s1439">As it turned out, that group actually was taken to a German internment camp, and they were not actually exchanged, because the exchange did fall through, but there was such a plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: But they were taken to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s1442">But when I came to Bergen-Belsen in January of 1945, there they were.</span> <span id="s1443">They were treated pretty well.</span> <span id="s1444">So they escaped going through these death camps and all the hardships we went through.</span> <span id="s1445">They were in a camp, but they were treated like foreign nationals.</span> <span id="s1446">But to us, if we didn’t hear that they were killed, that means they were alive.</span> <span id="s1447">So the hope revived that there would be more of those transports.</span> <span id="s1448">And since I was registered and pretty high on the list, we decided we better get married, so if I’m able to leave, he would leave with me.</span> <span id="s1449">So we got married on July 8th of 1943.</span> <span id="s1450">This was some kind of wedding, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1451">We went to the Jewish head of the camp, who was a Dr. Klineberger.</span> <span id="s1452">I guess he was empowered to perform civil marriages.</span> <span id="s1453">And believe it or not, Jules saved that marriage certificate in his shoe, and it’s really a museum piece ,a marriage certificate from Zwungsarbeiterlager Radom.</span> <span id="s1454">There was, however a nice Jewish man there who was a friend of the Zaidenweber family, who performed the Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s1455">But many years later, Rabbi Goodman married us again.</span> <span id="s1456">(Laughs) So when we went to the weapons factory, Jules and I were married.</span> <span id="s1457">However we didn’t live together.</span> <span id="s1458">I was in a woman’s barrack and he was in a men’s barrack.</span> <span id="s1459">Jules got a job in the factory.</span> <span id="s1460">Now my mother and my brother David remained in the camp.</span> <span id="s1461">This was a very unhappy situation for me.</span> <span id="s1462">I really didn’t like the idea of going away, but it seemed like four people could not constantly stick together.</span> <span id="s1463">We really had to do something separately.</span> <span id="s1464">My mother insisted that we do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">So Jules got a job through his friend of his as an electrician.</span> <span id="s1466">And I got a job because I had the experience from the woodworking shop a year before, I got a job in the woodworking shop in the factory.</span> <span id="s1467">What they did, they had some very high class Jewish cabinetmakers working there.</span> <span id="s1468">And I was the only woman.</span> <span id="s1469">What they were supposed to be working on was making shipping boxes for the guns.</span> <span id="s1470">But in the meantime, a lot of these Germans in the higher echelons had them make some very fancy furniture for them.</span> <span id="s1471">And I was the finisher.</span> <span id="s1472">I was the polisher.</span> <span id="s1473">The men taught me how to do it, and it’s a highly skilled type of work, which I did very well.</span> <span id="s1474">And it was only day work.</span> <span id="s1475">And these men really pampered me, because I was a young girl and I was only 19 years old, and I was the only woman there.</span> <span id="s1476">And so they shielded me and pampered me and helped me when necessary.</span> <span id="s1477">And I had it pretty good, at that time.</span> <span id="s1478">I had many opportunities to escape, because this furniture was quite illegally done, you understand.</span> <span id="s1479">So often, if the expected an inspection or something, the Germans would take the piece of furniture to their home, to their apartment, and then bring me there with a guard to finish it there.</span> <span id="s1480">Well the guard, just walked off and left me there.</span> <span id="s1481">I could have walked out, I don’t know how many times!</span> <span id="s1482">And just disappeared, if I had someplace to disappear to!</span> <span id="s1483">And if I were willing to take the risk of what would happen to Jules and David and my mother.</span> <span id="s1484">And that’s why I never did walk away.</span> <span id="s1485">But I remember having this overwhelming urge, sometimes, to do it.</span> <span id="s1486">And I had to really use reason with myself, that, “What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1487">Who will let me in?</span> <span id="s1488">who will help me?”</span> <span id="s1489">And then to jeopardize their lives.</span> <span id="s1490">That was for sure.</span> <span id="s1491">This friend I mentioned to you?</span> <span id="s1492">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1493">She walked away -- with help.</span> <span id="s1494">She had assistance.</span> <span id="s1495">Somebody took her out of the factory.</span> <span id="s1496">And afterwards, her father was tortured to death.</span> <span id="s1497">Well I couldn’t possibly see myself doing that.</span> <span id="s1498">But my mother sort of intimated that I should.</span> <span id="s1499">I said, “No, I just can’t.”</span> <span id="s1500">So I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1501">in the meantime, the camp in town was liquidated by the end of 1943, and mother and David also came.</span> <span id="s1502">A second camp was established adjoining that camp that the people who worked in the factory were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">They were separate camps -- they were separated by a barbed wire fence -- and guarded by Ukrainian guards, but they could be bribed.</span> <span id="s1504">So like maybe every evening or every other evening I would go under the barbed wire, helped by this Ukrainian, and visit my mother.</span> <span id="s1505">Sometimes I even stayed overnight and then came back in the morning in time to go to work.</span> <span id="s1506">And again, things settled down somewhat.</span> <span id="s1507">They settled down for a few weeks at a time until the next crisis arose.</span> <span id="s1508">It seemed like maybe this is the end of it, and this is how we’ll finally live out, live out the remaining time.</span> <span id="s1509">We didn’t have exact knowledge of what was going on in the world, but certainly, working for Germans, we did manage to get a glimpse of newspapers, and some people even heard radio when they worked in their places of work.</span> <span id="s1510">Not in the factory, but if they worked for a German unit.</span> <span id="s1511">So we knew that things were going terrible for them, that they were losing the war.</span> <span id="s1512">And that just helped to build up our hope, because in spite of all these terrible things that were going on, in spite of the constant terror and the uncertainty, there had to be an element of hope in order to even be able to go on from day to day, because the days were really long, hard -- there were physical hardships, there was mental anguish -- so there had to be something, to want to go on to the next day.</span> <span id="s1513">Because sometimes it really seemed -- maybe not so much at that time yet, but later, it was easier to die than go on!</span> <span id="s1514">The prospects were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">So in that period, really, it was just work.</span> <span id="s1516">Eventually I did get put onto the gun production.</span> <span id="s1517">I did get transferred from that cushy, cushiony job in the woodworking shop, and I was put on the machines.</span> <span id="s1518">And that first one that I was on was really terrible.</span> <span id="s1519">I worked day shift and night shift.</span> <span id="s1520">Coming back to the barracks in the daytime, there was no way to shut out the light.</span> <span id="s1521">There was no way to shut out the noise when you’re in a barrack with dozens of people.</span> <span id="s1522">I couldn’t sleep in the daytime.</span> <span id="s1523">I couldn’t stay awake at night.</span> <span id="s1524">And the responsibility for the piece of metal that I was working on on a machine which was deadening, boring, because it was a semi-automatic machine, and it was exactly the same procedure on each piece of metal for 12 hours!</span> <span id="s1525">It was devastatingly boring.</span> <span id="s1526">It was just excruciating.</span> <span id="s1527">And I stood there and cried, and I couldn’t keep awake, and I couldn’t sleep in the daytime.</span> <span id="s1528">It was just a disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Well, finally my husband, Jules went to his friend again -- the friend who had originally arranged for us to come to the factory -- and asked him if he could do something for me.</span> <span id="s1530">Which he did.</span> <span id="s1531">He came through again.</span> <span id="s1532">And he arranged for me to be transferred to a day machine, to a machine where parts could be made during the day, in one 12 hour shift.</span> <span id="s1533">It was a small part that went into the gun.</span> <span id="s1534">And I think they made like 300 guns in a 24 hour period.</span> <span id="s1535">That machine produced 300 little parts in 12 hours rather than in 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1536">So it was a lot better, but I had a terrible unit.</span> <span id="s1537">I was very unfortunate with the people I worked with.</span> <span id="s1538">There was only one other woman, a Christian woman.</span> <span id="s1539">To describe her correctly, I’d have to say she was probably a streetwalker, from the behavior, the language, the looks.</span> <span id="s1540">You can imagine the type.</span> <span id="s1541">She resented me bitterly, and called me “Intelligentsia,” or something like that, because I was educated and she wasn’t and this was an insult!</span> <span id="s1542">The man who was the foreman -- the foreman of the unit -- was Ukrainian, who was known to have been a very…you know, the Ukrainians cooperated with the Germans so that had an “in.”</span> <span id="s1543">and they had to be even “better” than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1544">Of course, the Ukrainians are also known for having been great anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1545">You know what happened to the Jews of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1546">So it wasn’t a very happy “marriage.”</span> <span id="s1547">I tried to mind my own business, but she particularly really harassed me, constantly.</span> <span id="s1548">That whole department was headed by a German who was an ethnic German.</span> <span id="s1549">Those were also the worst -- the ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s1550">They were actually Poles of German origin.</span> <span id="s1551">The trouble with those was, that they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1552">One day this woman harassed me particularly, and finally got my ire up to the point where I really got into an argument with her.</span> <span id="s1553">And she cursed and yelled and screamed, and finally went to the foreman, and then the foreman came, and very quietly said to me, “Follow me.’</span> <span id="s1554">It didn’t look good.</span> <span id="s1555">I followed him.</span> <span id="s1556">And all the Jews who were working at the machines there were following me with their eyes, you know, and we were thinking, “This is it!”</span> <span id="s1557">This Adler, the ethnic German, was known to be a particularly cruel individual, and everybody was just terrified of him.</span> <span id="s1558">He’d beaten up many a person, but mostly men.</span> <span id="s1559">Nobody knew of him beating up women yet, but it looked like I was going to be the first one.</span> <span id="s1560">So I go in there.</span> <span id="s1561">And the Ukrainian stayed there, too.</span> <span id="s1562">I go into his office, and he says to me -- now this is the first time I hear what I am accused of, you understand, I didn’t know what I was being accused of, or what was going to happen to me -- so suddenly he says to me, “You said to this woman that when the Russians come, you, the Jews, will take care of us, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1563">Is that right?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Meaning that you would retaliate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: That we would retaliate, and that we would do to them what they did to us.</span> <span id="s1566">Well I was absolutely devastated!</span> <span id="s1567">And I wondered, “How am I going to defend myself from this?’</span> <span id="s1568">And suddenly.</span> <span id="s1569">Not having anything to lose, I decided I’d have to say something, so I said, “You don’t really believe that I would have said that!</span> <span id="s1570">.</span> <span id="s1571">Even if I thought it, which I don’t, you don’t think I’d be that stupid that I would say that to her!”</span> <span id="s1572">And he just looked at me, and he nodded, and told me to go back to my machine.</span> <span id="s1573">Which I did.</span> <span id="s1574">And the Ukrainian followed me.</span> <span id="s1575">After that, I was really terrified of this Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1576">I thought, “He’s going to look for something to pin on me.’</span> <span id="s1577">And I was even more terrified of this woman.</span> <span id="s1578">I stayed away from her.</span> <span id="s1579">This was the summer of 1944, and it was at the time when the Germans were being really chased across Poland by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1580">And so the situation wasn’t very good for them at all, and I suppose they were being a little concerned about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Suddenly, one day, we were told not to go to work, and to stay in the camp.</span> <span id="s1582">And that day it was announced that we would be leaving.</span> <span id="s1583">It was July of 1944.</span> <span id="s1584">We had heard rumors.</span> <span id="s1585">In fact some people even saw German soldiers barefoot and without guns, they were routed so fast across the Vistula, which was only about 25 miles from where we were.</span> <span id="s1586">The next day, we took our bundles and we were marched out.</span> <span id="s1587">Nobody told us where we were going, what was in store for us, but we were on our way, a column of about 2,000 people, I would imagine, maybe even more.</span> <span id="s1588">And it was a hot day.</span> <span id="s1589">We were marching on roads which are…well, at that time in Poland, it’s hard to describe the roads.</span> <span id="s1590">They were really not very good.</span> <span id="s1591">It was a highway, but it wasn’t a very good highway.</span> <span id="s1592">Many people were not able too walk fast enough.</span> <span id="s1593">It started looking almost immediately very, very grim, because anybody who dragged their feet and stayed behind, while we didn’t see it, we did hear the shots.</span> <span id="s1594">We were guarded by many, many SS, with machine guns and dogs.</span> <span id="s1595">We were walking through fields -- the highway ran through woods and fields of ripe wheat and at one point, maybe five or six young men broke out and started running into this very tall grain, and immediately the Machine guns went off, and they were falling like flies.</span> <span id="s1596">At the end of that first day, we camped outside.</span> <span id="s1597">They put us next to a small brook on one side and a pond on the other side, so there was just a little opening, where they could guard it very easily.</span> <span id="s1598">They had given us some bread and some food to carry along, and you know, when you march like this, the heat, practically everybody was throwing away the food, because you can’t carry stuff.</span> <span id="s1599">We were terrible worried about mother.</span> <span id="s1600">It was hard enough for us to walk.</span> <span id="s1601">And especially, you know, she was older.</span> <span id="s1602">(Laughs) I mean, not by my today’s standards!</span> <span id="s1603">In 1944, she was 45 years old!</span> <span id="s1604">Which, I don’t think, even by your standards, is “older,’ right?</span> <span id="s1605">But at that time, she was!</span> <span id="s1606">However she held up pretty well.</span> <span id="s1607">Another thing was, that horse-drawn carriages were following us.</span> <span id="s1608">And as the guards saw it that people had a hard time walking, they invited them to get on the carriage, on the wagon.</span> <span id="s1609">And then pretty soon, afterwards, the wagons came back empty again.</span> <span id="s1610">And of course, you couldn’t tell any more, because the shooting was going on all the time.</span> <span id="s1611">It was like a trail of blood and bodies on the way.</span> <span id="s1612">They were just left there by the wayside.</span> <span id="s1613">I don’t know if anybody followed and buried those bodies or collected them, but there were an awful lot of them.</span> <span id="s1614">One of the victims was my other uncle -- the uncle by marriage whose picture I showed you, my aunt’s husband, who couldn’t walk very well, and went for a ride on the wagon.</span> <span id="s1615">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1616">Then the next day we marched.</span> <span id="s1617">And there were more people falling by the wayside.</span> <span id="s1618">And the third day.</span> <span id="s1619">Now the third day, in the morning, they brought back a young boy who apparently had tried to escape during the night.</span> <span id="s1620">They brought him back, and right as we were assembled there in that place, in the meadow where we spent the night, they made him kneel in front of everybody and shot him at point-blank.</span> <span id="s1621">Just maybe from a foot away, with a handgun.</span> <span id="s1622">That was really a terrible, terrible experience, that march.</span> <span id="s1623">The phrase “death march” wasn’t coined until much later, but this was a death march!</span> <span id="s1624">Well on the third day, towards the end of the day, we got into a town, and were told that this is where we were going to stay, that we had arrived at our destination, the town of Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s1625">And I remember one thing on that evening.</span> <span id="s1626">It wasn’t evening yet, but it was late afternoon.</span> <span id="s1627">One woman who was walking next to me, she was alone, an older woman, I mean, maybe my mother’s age, meaning “older” for a 19 year old, she stepped out of the column and onto the sidewalk and then was looking around.</span> <span id="s1628">I guess she was testing it, to see if anything could happen.</span> <span id="s1629">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1630">And she just disappeared into the mob.</span> <span id="s1631">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s1632">I don’t know where she went that night.</span> <span id="s1633">She may not have lived another hour.</span> <span id="s1634">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1635">But it was very tempting, seeing how easy it was, to do the same.</span> <span id="s1636">She obviously didn’t survive, because then when all the Radomer gathered after the war ended, I never saw her again, so she must not had any place to go.</span> <span id="s1637">Whatever happened to her, I don’t know, but I saw her, making it, and at the time it looked very tempting.</span> <span id="s1638">But we couldn’t both do it, I mean, all four.</span> <span id="s1639">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1640">It was out of the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">We were separated in Tomaszow, the men and the women.</span> <span id="s1642">There were fewer women, of course, than men; I would say maybe only 25% of the 2,000 were women, about 500 women and 1,500 men.</span> <span id="s1643">The women were taken to a building that turned out to be the local jail, and we were put not in cells, but in an attic -- in a huge attic where we all were.</span> <span id="s1644">There were some straw mattresses on the floor -- bundles of straw -- and that’s where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">The men, we didn’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s1646">We didn’t see them again for a week.</span> <span id="s1647">Needless to say, there was no water, and there were no sanitary facilities there, and we were given some food, but not much, and nothing very memorable, as none of the food was very memorable the whole time.</span> <span id="s1648">A week later, on a Saturday -- that I know for sure, it was a Saturday, because this is probably the really most important moment in this whole epic -- that Saturday afternoon, we were gathered up from our attic and taken down and marched to where there were railroad tracks and wagons were waiting.</span> <span id="s1649">And there were the men!</span> <span id="s1650">So we saw them very briefly.</span> <span id="s1651">And we embraced, and we cried, and expressed our uncertainty, because by then there weren’t even rumors.</span> <span id="s1652">We knew absolutely nothing that was going on.</span> <span id="s1653">This was really being totally led like cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Well, then we were put in those train -- the well known phrase, “the cattle boxcars.”</span> <span id="s1655">And we were not allowed to be with the men.</span> <span id="s1656">The women were put in separate boxcars and the men were put in separate boxcars.</span> <span id="s1657">And the train started moving.</span> <span id="s1658">We didn’t know where it was going.</span> <span id="s1659">We didn’t know how long we would be on the train.</span> <span id="s1660">Spent the night there.</span> <span id="s1661">Hot.</span> <span id="s1662">No food.</span> <span id="s1663">No water.</span> <span id="s1664">No place to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1665">This looked like absolutely the end.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, we knew where that train was gonna go.</span> <span id="s1667">This was it.</span> <span id="s1668">What happened two years before to the other people, in 1942, was now happening to us.</span> <span id="s1669">It was obvious that this was the final deportation.</span> <span id="s1670">Well that Sunday morning, bright and early, just a daybreak, and it was a sunny day, the sky was as blue as can be, and the sun shining, we arrived.</span> <span id="s1671">And the first sign we saw was “Arbeit Macht Frei.”</span> <span id="s1672">“Where are we?</span> <span id="s1673">Where are we?”</span> <span id="s1674">as they started opening the doors.</span> <span id="s1675">And somebody said, “Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s1676">So, of course, we knew that was it.</span> <span id="s1677">And actually, at that point, nobody needed to tell us what was going on in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1678">The smell told us all.</span> <span id="s1679">The horrible smell of the burning flesh.</span> <span id="s1680">It was just unmistakable.</span> <span id="s1681">Although you or I or anybody else had never smelled the smell of burning flesh, it was obvious what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1682">And so the doors were opened.</span> <span id="s1683">And “Out!”</span> <span id="s1684">We were told to get out, which we did.</span> <span id="s1685">And then we discovered it was just the women who got out -- at least at that point.</span> <span id="s1686">The men did not.</span> <span id="s1687">They only opened the wagons of the women’s boxcars, and everything went very fast.</span> <span id="s1688">We were ordered constantly to -- some orders were thrown at us -- we were totally bewildered.</span> <span id="s1689">And then finally we ended up in a building where there were a lot of people, obviously prisoners, who were very nicely dressed, very clean.</span> <span id="s1690">They wore the striped prison uniforms, but very clean and neat.</span> <span id="s1691">Their hair, their appearance was very nice.</span> <span id="s1692">And it was just like an unreal world.</span> <span id="s1693">I mean the whole experience seemed totally unreal.</span> <span id="s1694">The sun shining, the cloudless sky, warm, and these people, with smiles on their faces, very casual, but they did talk to us, and they said, “Do you know where you are?”</span> <span id="s1695">And they told us what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s1696">“You know what’s going on here?</span> <span id="s1697">Do you know what you’re here for?”</span> <span id="s1698">And they were quite open about it.</span> <span id="s1699">But the orders kept being shouted very quickly, “Ger undressed!</span> <span id="s1700">Line up here!</span> <span id="s1701">Line up there!”</span> <span id="s1702">Everybody was lined up and they were going through and shaving off some people’s hair and not others, but everybody’s hair was cut.</span> <span id="s1703">My hair wasn’t totally shaved off, but it was cut like to here.</span> <span id="s1704">It wasn’t long to begin with, but whatever there was cropped very short.</span> <span id="s1705">My mother’s hair was shaved off completely, and many women’s hair was shaved off.</span> <span id="s1706">And then the grotesque situation of looking at each other, we just started to laugh!</span> <span id="s1707">Have you ever seen a woman with her hair shaved off?</span> <span id="s1708">It looks grotesque, so we were laughing.</span> <span id="s1709">I mean, the whole situation was so totally unreal -- the total uncertainty of what was going to happen and then what already was happening -- that we were crying and laughing.</span> <span id="s1710">We didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">And then suddenly the order came to line up single file.</span> <span id="s1712">At that point, a number of German officers walked in.</span> <span id="s1713">At the head of that group was one who was very tall, extremely handsome.</span> <span id="s1714">He was wearing a monocle in one of his eyes.</span> <span id="s1715">He had a little stick under his arm, and he was wearing white gloves.</span> <span id="s1716">His uniform was immaculate.</span> <span id="s1717">And then a number of others, but he stood out, because he was like three feet taller than everybody else, or so it seemed.</span> <span id="s1718">We were lining up, the orders are flying, “quick, fast,” and there he stood, with his hands like this, and one finger only going to the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s1719">And it seemed like immediately there was a group forming on one side, and a group on the other side.</span> <span id="s1720">And I’m standing behind my mother, and suddenly, almost as we come in front of the officer, she grabbed me and shoved me in front of her.</span> <span id="s1721">And before we knew what was going on, it all went so fast, he motioned me over there, and by the time I turned around, my mother was behind me.</span> <span id="s1722">And so when I came to from this total confusion, looking at the other side and seeing that on the other side were women who looked a little older, who didn’t look very good.</span> <span id="s1723">Their bodies were a little, you know, the skin was hanging, and they didn’t look very good.</span> <span id="s1724">I could see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1725">Obviously those of us who were young and still in good shape were on one side, and those who were on the other side were not in such good shape.</span> <span id="s1726">And so, suddenly, the whole terror of the situation became real to me, that here I was!</span> <span id="s1727">We were going through a selection.</span> <span id="s1728">But this was still just speculation.</span> <span id="s1729">I mean, you don’t know anything for sure, but it was apparent, because there were daughters on this side, and mothers on this side, and they were crying and they were pushing, they wanted to go to the other side, and they were holding them back forcibly, so it didn’t look good.</span> <span id="s1730">It looked like a selection, although I had never been to one before like this, So then I said to my mother, “Why did you push me ahead of you?”</span> <span id="s1731">and she said, “When I saw what was going on, I didn’t want you to follow me.’</span> <span id="s1732">She was afraid that if I were behind her, and she was put on the other side, I would follow her.</span> <span id="s1733">It was many years later that I really fathomed the magnitude of this.</span> <span id="s1734">You have to have children of your own to understand what a mother can do,</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1736">And she knew you, she knew of your devotion, all the times when you could have left, and you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: She knew I’d follow her, and there wouldn’t be any doubt.</span> <span id="s1738">There was no doubt in her mind.</span> <span id="s1739">She knew I would go with her.</span> <span id="s1740">But we were lucky.</span> <span id="s1741">We were both on the same side.</span> <span id="s1742">And so then, in quick order, we were shoved into another room which had shower heads -- it wasn’t until later that I found out that the gas chamber on the other side also had shower heads, and this is how the deception was.</span> <span id="s1743">But everything was so fast.</span> <span id="s1744">The water came out so fast that we knew we were in a shower room.</span> <span id="s1745">We didn’t even have time to speculate what it was.</span> <span id="s1746">There it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Excuse me, the German officer was Dr. Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1749">That’s who it was.</span> <span id="s1750">But I didn’t know then.</span> <span id="s1751">I didn’t know until afterwards.</span> <span id="s1752">When we came out of the shower and they handed us -- now mind you, wet bodies, this was the beginning of August, but it was a very nice warm day -- they handed us a dress.</span> <span id="s1753">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1754">And we had our shoes.</span> <span id="s1755">They told us to take our shoes with us.</span> <span id="s1756">In fact, that was one of the lucky things.</span> <span id="s1757">Same as Jules and David.</span> <span id="s1758">At that point, they didn’t have enough shoes to take away those and give other ones, because there were so many transports coming to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1759">There was so much commotion, they told us to keep our shoes -- and fortunately, because my mother had in her red shoes, which I remember, with heavy heels, she had diamonds in those heels, which later came in very, very handy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: (Gasps.)</span> <span id="s1761">and Jules, of course preserved the family pictures in his shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Well it wasn’t until later, also, that we found out that the men did not stay in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1763">The men were shipped out elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1764">And at that point, from then on, we did not know anything that happened to them.</span> <span id="s1765">We had no idea where they were sent, we had no idea whether they were alive or dead, until six months after the war, that we found out where David and Jules were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">But we did find out, that very day, that father was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1767">And alive and well.</span> <span id="s1768">As we came out of the shower and were given that dress, and outside to line up, a young man from Radom who had been arrested also, but later, and shipped to Auschwitz, came up to us.</span> <span id="s1769">This son of this Brenamann.</span> <span id="s1770">The man whom I called the first day after the deportation in 1942?</span> <span id="s1771">He was there and he came to see us.</span> <span id="s1772">And he said to my mother, “Your husband is here.</span> <span id="s1773">He knows that you have arrived.”</span> <span id="s1774">And I guess we couldn’t see him, but we knew he was there.</span> <span id="s1775">There was an internal machinery in Auschwitz of prisoners who had been there for a long time.</span> <span id="s1776">Obviously, those who had been there for a long time had contacts, knew each other, and by virtue of having survived for such a long time, had some functions that gave them a little more freedom to move around within the confines of the cap, and also to know Germans and have a tiny bit of pull.</span> <span id="s1777">You understand.</span> <span id="s1778">So this was the situation with this young Brenamann and this was the situation with my father, after two-and-a-half years of having been there.</span> <span id="s1779">Of course, his is an entirely different story.</span> <span id="s1780">He’s no longer alive to tell the story, but his story by far exceeds anything that we could tell you.</span> <span id="s1781">To have survived for two-and-a-half years in Auschwitz is really something that’s unheard of.</span> <span id="s1782">From the transport he was in with, of the 70, some 75 - you remember, I told you earlier about it, only three were alive.</span> <span id="s1783">But my father was a registrar.</span> <span id="s1784">He knew German and Polish and Russian and French, and therefore he could act as a contact between these various nationalities that were arriving in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1785">There was a group that did the tattooing -- this was all done by prisoners, and with them were the registrars.</span> <span id="s1786">Germans kept meticulous records of everybody who arrived in Auschwitz and stayed .</span> <span id="s1787">Those who were gassed immediately were not registered.</span> <span id="s1788">But those who were tattooed and remained for any length of time in Auschwitz were registered.</span> <span id="s1789">And my father was a registrar.</span> <span id="s1790">So as a result, he wore a clean, neat striped uniform, and he could move around between the compounds, but not in the women’s compounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">He was a registrar of the arrivals of the men, although there was some work that men performed that did bring them to the women’s compound.</span> <span id="s1792">There were some men that came into the women’s compounds, but not my father, so the time we did see him, and it was only once that we saw him when he was in Auschwitz, was across the electrified barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s1793">But we did see him, and we did talk to him.</span> <span id="s1794">Our Compound B adjoined Compound A, which was a men’s compound, so he came there one day, and somebody called us to come!</span> <span id="s1795">We stood between the two barracks, on our side of the fence, and he was on the other side, and we yelled to each other, and talked.</span> <span id="s1796">But he was able to arrange -- because he did know other people, having been there so long -- he was able to arrange for us to get a work assignment, which the women from my transport did not get.</span> <span id="s1797">The Lodz ghetto was being liquidated at the time, and many transports were arriving every day.</span> <span id="s1798">The gas chambers were going full blast.</span> <span id="s1799">The compounds were full, and they were actually in the process of shipping many out into Germany.</span> <span id="s1800">We were considered a transit group that was to be in Auschwitz only until somebody required labor workers.</span> <span id="s1801">So we were not assigned any work.</span> <span id="s1802">We were in the barracks doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1803">Occasionally they would come and take a few of us out of the compound to carry rocks from one place to another, and the next day another group would go and carry the same rocks back from that place to that place.</span> <span id="s1804">And in a place like Auschwitz, to sit there, every day, all day, doing absolutely nothing, with the amount of food that we were getting, and the shadow of the gas chamber, and the horrible smell, and the smoke coming out of the chimneys, was the kind of mental torture -- and physical, really -- that is totally impossible to describe.</span> <span id="s1805">Not having anything to do just compounded it all.</span> <span id="s1806">So he arranged for us to be assigned to a group -- a workshop, a sewing workshop.</span> <span id="s1807">And as a result, we were transferred from the barrack, which was a transit barrack, to a permanent barrack.</span> <span id="s1808">In other words, we’re staying now.</span> <span id="s1809">We’re staying in Auschwitz rather than…well, one didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1810">Was it better to stay or was it better to try to get out --on a transport.</span> <span id="s1811">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1812">The only certainty was where you were.</span> <span id="s1813">Once you were given a tattoo in Auschwitz, it seemed like you were registered to stay.</span> <span id="s1814">It didn’t work that way, of course, because many people were gassed while they were residents in Auschwitz, but it seemed, at that point, that perhaps the known was better than the unknown.</span> <span id="s1815">And further more, we didn’t have to stand muster for quite as long as the people who were in the transit barracks, so in a way, we were a little privileged, being there.</span> <span id="s1816">And then there was an opportunity of course, to organize a little more food.</span> <span id="s1817">and this was done by doing some sewing for the women who worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1818">Since I had a needle, and I had thread, and there was some fabric, I could make blouses to wear under those -- the striped prison uniforms were made of very coarse cloth -- and so it was nice to have a little blouse to wear underneath.</span> <span id="s1819">And then, working in the kitchen, they wanted little aprons.</span> <span id="s1820">Those who had plenty of food could think of these little things.</span> <span id="s1821">I made blouses for them by hand, I sewed it by hand.</span> <span id="s1822">And in turn they gave me a little margarine, and a little sugar, and some jam, some marmalade, so we could supplement our diet, a little -- which was really great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">I mean, one doesn’t think that those things go in in Auschwitz, but even there, people who were there for a long time settled down to a certain routine!</span> <span id="s1824">A certain amount of normalcy.</span> <span id="s1825">It’s totally inconceivable for us, living in a normal society, that there are levels of normalcy.</span> <span id="s1826">And there are.</span> <span id="s1827">I imagine that even prisoners in a jail -- in a prison -- have some kind of a normalcy routine.</span> <span id="s1828">This is how we had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">There were all these things going on.</span> <span id="s1830">There was all this danger there, every day.</span> <span id="s1831">There was always the chance to be put into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1832">There was a chance that you’d get sick.</span> <span id="s1833">There was a chance that they would pick you for medical experiments.</span> <span id="s1834">There was all this going on.</span> <span id="s1835">But in the meantime, while it wasn’t happening, you had to live.</span> <span id="s1836">You had to settle down to some kind of routine to feel that you’re still a human being.</span> <span id="s1837">Does this make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Of course!</span> <span id="s1839">There is this extraordinary ability that humans have to adapt to their surroundings.</span> <span id="s1840">And those who didn’t adapt, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Exactly!</span> <span id="s1842">It was a great effort not to give in to that state where you wouldn’t accept, and you’d be rebellious, and you would think, “What’s the use,” and then give up.</span> <span id="s1843">This was the easier way.</span> <span id="s1844">You had to fight.</span> <span id="s1845">It was a fight to settle down, to have a normal day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow!</span> <span id="s1847">But today, as long as it’s a normal day -- I don’t even know what’s going to happen at 5 in the afternoon, but at noon, things are still normal -- I’m fighting.</span> <span id="s1848">I’m living.</span> <span id="s1849">And I resolve to be alive.</span> <span id="s1850">And this is how, day after day went on in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1851">And things happened.</span> <span id="s1852">People were being sent out.</span> <span id="s1853">Ultimately, by probably the end of September, all the women that came with us, that were still in the transit barrack --- were sent out.</span> <span id="s1854">And I remember having some pangs at times, thinking, “Maybe, maybe it would have been better for us to leave.”</span> <span id="s1855">But in the meantime, you had to accept what you had, and hope for the best.</span> <span id="s1856">And in Auschwitz, we definitely didn’t know what was going on in the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">In the meantime, one Friday afternoon, there was an explosion, and the camp siren, the main siren went off, and subsequently we found out that one of the crematoria was blown up by the Zonderkommando, which was the special command of the Jews who had to burn the bodies of those who were gassed.</span> <span id="s1858">They were apparently all captured and executed.</span> <span id="s1859">But there was a commotion at that time, and it seemed like things were very unsettled there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">There were air raids, air raid sirens went off a number of times, and we heard planes.</span> <span id="s1861">There were maybe even some distant sounds, but I’m not sure that those were bombs or not.</span> <span id="s1862">There were rumors that one of the factories in one of the camps was bombed by Allied planes, but I don’t really know for sure whether that was the case.</span> <span id="s1863">It may have been anti-aircraft fire that we heard.</span> <span id="s1864">But we did hear things were going on.</span> <span id="s1865">And in the meantime, transports kept coming.</span> <span id="s1866">And the gassing was going on until about November.</span> <span id="s1867">Everything stopped in November.</span> <span id="s1868">There was no longer any smoke coming out of the chimneys.</span> <span id="s1869">Suddenly everything stopped.</span> <span id="s1870">The whole extermination process stopped, and transports were no longer arriving in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1871">They were leaving.</span> <span id="s1872">There was only one transport, I remember, having arrived.</span> <span id="s1873">It was from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1874">And one fellow, a good friend who now lives in Minneapolis, was in that transport, in fact.</span> <span id="s1875">He did survive.</span> <span id="s1876">There were children in that transport, mothers with children, and the fires were not going anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">My father had left, too.</span> <span id="s1878">We heard that he had left on a transport.</span> <span id="s1879">I think it was young Brenamann who again notified us that he had left.</span> <span id="s1880">It wasn’t until later that we found out the circumstances of why he left.</span> <span id="s1881">He actually left on his own.</span> <span id="s1882">He joined a transport practically under the noses of the Germans, who didn’t want him to leave, because he had a death warrant on his head, and he found out about it, and that’s why he -- essentially -- escaped, via a transport out of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">And then things were very uncertain.</span> <span id="s1884">We knew that the medical experiments were still going on, because around late fall, a group came to our compound and we all had to line up, and they were picking out women for experiments.</span> <span id="s1885">That was terrifying.</span> <span id="s1886">We didn’t know exactly what was going on, but we knew there were medical experiments going on.</span> <span id="s1887">And then on January 18th, it was like a replay of what happened in Radom six months before, when we didn’t go to work, were told to get dressed, and be ready to leave.</span> <span id="s1888">And again, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1889">We were given blankets.</span> <span id="s1890">We were given some food.</span> <span id="s1891">and we were marched out.</span> <span id="s1892">It – it was almost like unbelievable, turning back and looking at that sign, and actually leaving Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1893">It was unreal.</span> <span id="s1894">Some people stayed.</span> <span id="s1895">They said nobody could stay, but it turned out later that those who were not well, those who were sick, or just couldn’t walk, could stay.</span> <span id="s1896">Which, of course, nobody would want to do.</span> <span id="s1897">We thought, immediately after we leave, they’ll blow up all the barracks, if only the sick people are staying.</span> <span id="s1898">But it turned out that they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1899">That maybe 2,000 people remained.</span> <span id="s1900">We didn’t find that out until much later.</span> <span id="s1901">But they were left there to their own devices, without food, without anything, and it was at least a week before the Russians came.</span> <span id="s1902">But they were alive!</span> <span id="s1903">At least most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">They did blow up the remaining crematoria and the gas chambers -- the Germans -- before we left.</span> <span id="s1905">In fact, maybe a couple of weeks before, they were blown up, so you couldn’t even see the chimneys any more.</span> <span id="s1906">You know, not only the smoke, but not even the chimneys, so that gave us a lot more hope.</span> <span id="s1907">Once there isn’t this immediacy of that death lurking right there -- no distance at all -- it seemed like there was a little more of a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Well we were marching.</span> <span id="s1909">That was another death march of three days, which was absolutely incredible -- in the middle of January.</span> <span id="s1910">It isn’t quite as cold there as it is here, but it was cold.</span> <span id="s1911">And walking in the snow.</span> <span id="s1912">And cold.</span> <span id="s1913">With the guards.</span> <span id="s1914">The same thing.</span> <span id="s1915">People trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1916">People sitting down at the side of the road, just not caring anymore, and being shot.</span> <span id="s1917">We walked.</span> <span id="s1918">We happened to be walking, and a couple of non-Jewish women that we got acquainted with, as we were walking.</span> <span id="s1919">This was a column of thousands of women.</span> <span id="s1920">I mean, this was a much larger group than the one from Radom.</span> <span id="s1921">Maybe three times as large.</span> <span id="s1922">And it was really getting -- I was getting very, very down.</span> <span id="s1923">I was worried about mother, about her being able to walk.</span> <span id="s1924">And all the while it seemed that while I was worried about her, I was the one to be worried about, because my state -- my psychological state -- wasn’t so good.</span> <span id="s1925">And I was beginning to contemplate whether it was really worth going on and fighting, whether there was, really, an end to this suffering, and I started talking to my mother about sitting down and just giving up.</span> <span id="s1926">And it was really her strength that kept me going, and these two young women who were with us were really getting me worked up and pepped up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">The second night that we were marching -- well, you know, days are short, so it probably wasn’t night, it was evening, it was after dark -- I was getting to the point of total exhaustion, and I thought, well, if we are not going to stop some place for the night, I’m just not going to be able to go on.</span> <span id="s1928">While we were marching, my mother noticed one of the guards who was walking nearby was a guard from Radom whom she recognized.</span> <span id="s1929">And he recognized her, too.</span> <span id="s1930">So he started a conversation with her.</span> <span id="s1931">It must have been boring, marching, for them, too.</span> <span id="s1932">So he was talking to her.</span> <span id="s1933">So I said to him, “Can you tell us when we’re going to stop for the night?”</span> <span id="s1934">and he said, “See that church steeple there?”</span> <span id="s1935">it was about a kilometer-and-a-half, which is about a mile.</span> <span id="s1936">He said, “That’s where we’re stopping, in that village.”</span> <span id="s1937">You know, when you have a destination, you sort of feel like you can gather the last of your strength and go on, which I did.</span> <span id="s1938">And we’re passing the steeple, and we’re going and going on and on, and we’re not stopping.</span> <span id="s1939">Suddenly -- now this is, mind you, five years later, this is January of 1945 -- I got so upset that a German lied to me.</span> <span id="s1940">Why should I have expected anything else, is the question?</span> <span id="s1941">(Laughter) Five years later, I’m still trusting a German!</span> <span id="s1942">I got so upset!</span> <span id="s1943">“Why did he lie to me!</span> <span id="s1944">Why did he lie to me!”</span> <span id="s1945">And these two women said, “Why are you so upset?”</span> <span id="s1946">“I can’t believe it!</span> <span id="s1947">He didn’t have any reason to lie to me and he did!</span> <span id="s1948">I’m not going to go on any further.”</span> <span id="s1949">I really got hysterical.</span> <span id="s1950">And finally my mother said to me, “Okay, if you want to sit down, let’s sit down.”</span> <span id="s1951">And I said, “No, not you!</span> <span id="s1952">Just I!”</span> <span id="s1953">Suddenly the whole ridiculous situation struck me.</span> <span id="s1954">And I mean, she was really saying I said, “No, you go on, I’m gonna sit down and have them shoot me.’</span> <span id="s1955">And why I ever thought that she would agree to that, you know…(Laughs.)</span> <span id="s1956">Your mother was a psychologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: She really was.</span> <span id="s1958">So we went on.</span> <span id="s1959">It wasn’t much longer after that that we stopped.</span> <span id="s1960">And we did stop in a village where the people -- those were ethnic Germans, and it was probably the first time in all these years that we encountered some kindness -- because these people let us into their houses.</span> <span id="s1961">They were told we were either to sleep outside or in the barns.</span> <span id="s1962">But they let some of us inside, and they gave us hot soup.</span> <span id="s1963">And they didn’t have room for everybody to lie down, you know, but we could sit on the steps, and we could find as much room as we could to rest.</span> <span id="s1964">It was really, I mean, inside a warm house.</span> <span id="s1965">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s1966">Because the night before we slept in barns, and it was excruciatingly cold.</span> <span id="s1967">And I remember my feet were wet inside, but I was afraid to take off my hiking boots.</span> <span id="s1968">I was afraid to take them off, lest somebody would steal them.</span> <span id="s1969">And so eventually, I had to take them off to let my socks dry out.</span> <span id="s1970">And both of us put the boots between us, my mother and I, as we were lying next to each other, so that if anybody was tampering with them, we would feel it.</span> <span id="s1971">It was a terror to lose your boots!</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">So here we were in this warm house, and it really, it sort of restores your belief in human beings sometimes, when you most need it.</span> <span id="s1973">That was a real boost to my morale.</span> <span id="s1974">And the next day, we marched again until late afternoon, and then we came to the siding where the cars were -- back onto the boxcars.</span> <span id="s1975">Only this time, they were open boxcars.</span> <span id="s1976">Now I don’t know whether that was better or worse.</span> <span id="s1977">I the winter it probably would have been better to be in closed boxcars, but those were open ones.</span> <span id="s1978">And there was only room for half of us, maybe, to sit, and half to stand, so we took turns.</span> <span id="s1979">And we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s1980">The train started moving, and not too much later, we arrived at a station that said, “Grossrosen.”</span> <span id="s1981">And we knew there was a concentration camp called Grossrosen.</span> <span id="s1982">So it looked as though that’s where they brought us.</span> <span id="s1983">Now this was a very long train.</span> <span id="s1984">There was more than one group marching from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1985">There was also a men’s group, so there were thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1986">It took a long time to load up that train.</span> <span id="s1987">And I don’t know whether Grossrosen was a women’s camp or a men’s camp or both, but the train stood there for a while on the tracks, and what turned out later was that that was actually the destination of the terrain, but that the camp was being evacuated, also, and so they didn’t want to accept us.</span> <span id="s1988">This was, you understand, January of 1945.</span> <span id="s1989">Things are very bad for the Germans, militarily.</span> <span id="s1990">The war is going very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1991">So while the train was standing on the tracks there at the station, I was right at the end of the boxcar, standing there.</span> <span id="s1992">And the place was deserted.</span> <span id="s1993">There wasn’t a soul to be seen.</span> <span id="s1994">And at one point, from the back of the train, one of the guards started walking towards the front of the train, and as he passed by me, by the boxcar that I was on, I -- impulsively -- I said, “Could I get a drink of water?”</span> <span id="s1995">He looked up, but he didn’t even stop.</span> <span id="s1996">He just kept walking.</span> <span id="s1997">And I thought, “There I go again, thinking (laughs) that I can get something.”</span> <span id="s1998">A while later, he walked back.</span> <span id="s1999">And as he was walking, he was looking up as if he was searching for somebody, and spotted me, and handed me a canteen full of warm water with a slice of bread floating in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">That was the other incident of kindness that I encountered in that particular sequence.</span> <span id="s2001">Of course that was something.</span> <span id="s2002">Because I told you that in the beginning, when we left Auschwitz, they gave us food.</span> <span id="s2003">They gave us each two loaves of bread, and a can, a large can of something.</span> <span id="s2004">Well, very soon, we had to throw all this away, because we couldn’t carry it.</span> <span id="s2005">The only thing we carried were the blankets.</span> <span id="s2006">We knew that you could survive without food, but in this cold, you couldn’t survive without a blanket.</span> <span id="s2007">And even carrying the blanket, I still remember how heavy my shoulders were, how I just couldn’t really carry, even the blanket.</span> <span id="s2008">So we hadn’t had anything to eat except for that soup that was given to us by these people in the village.</span> <span id="s2009">So that piece of bread was very welcome, which I shared as much as I could, you know, with the people who were around me, and my mother.</span> <span id="s2010">Then the train started moving again, and it went all night.</span> <span id="s2011">Early in the morning, it stopped, and we were at a big station.</span> <span id="s2012">This turned out to be Breslau, a very large city in western Silesia.</span> <span id="s2013">And from a distance, we could see a lot of people at the train station.</span> <span id="s2014">Germans who were being evacuated, because this is already pretty close to the front line!</span> <span id="s2015">The Russians are very close, and people were running deep into Germany.</span> <span id="s2016">There were young boys, Hitler Yugend, with steaming kettles of soup, handing out -- to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2017">This wasn’t for us!</span> <span id="s2018">We were parked there on a siding.</span> <span id="s2019">But those were the images that I saw that morning.</span> <span id="s2020">And it actually gave us a lift, because we saw how panic-stricken the Germans were, how things were going badly for them, and it seemed like the end of the war was very close, so naturally this somewhat lifts your spirits, we weren’t being killed.</span> <span id="s2021">They were still transporting us.</span> <span id="s2022">So there was still some hope.</span> <span id="s2023">And they could have lined us up.</span> <span id="s2024">They could have thrown a few bombs, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2025">They didn’t have to march us, and take us to the trains, and transport us.</span> <span id="s2026">We didn’t know what was going on, but it looked like there might still be some hope for us.</span> <span id="s2027">Then the train went on, and towards evening, we got to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2028">This was one of the major camps, Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2029">There we got off the trains, and we stayed.</span> <span id="s2030">However they didn’t put us anywhere.</span> <span id="s2031">We stayed there right beside the siding.</span> <span id="s2032">And there was soup.</span> <span id="s2033">They gave us soup.</span> <span id="s2034">This was a men’s camp.</span> <span id="s2035">We encountered some of the men, the prisoners of Buchenwald, and talked to them.</span> <span id="s2036">but it appeared as though we weren’t staying in Buchenwald, either.</span> <span id="s2037">We didn’t know what was going on, whether they were making arrangements for us to remain there, or whether we were going further.</span> <span id="s2038">It was totally uncertainty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Shortly after that, however, a different train came, with closed boxcars, and we were loaded again into the boxcars.</span> <span id="s2040">And it was just an overnight trip.</span> <span id="s2041">Early in the morning, the train stopped again.</span> <span id="s2042">That was a very harrowing trip, because we were very, very crowded, and people were getting sick.</span> <span id="s2043">And my mother wasn’t well.</span> <span id="s2044">She was sick that night, and I was really terror-stricken.</span> <span id="s2045">That was a very bad trip.</span> <span id="s2046">It was still dark.</span> <span id="s2047">Was it?</span> <span id="s2048">Yah, I think it was still dark when we stopped at a station.</span> <span id="s2049">The train stopped, and the guard opened the door a little bit, just a slight bit, and he asked, “Where are you coming from?</span> <span id="s2050">Where were you, where did you start out from?”</span> <span id="s2051">and we said, “Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s2052">And he said, “Oh, you poor girls.</span> <span id="s2053">It’s too bad that they managed to take you away from there.</span> <span id="s2054">The Russians just occupied Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s2055">He was a Czech -- an ethnic German.</span> <span id="s2056">He spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s2057">I don’t know whether he felt sorry for us really, or whether he was just taunting us.</span> <span id="s2058">I don’t know, but that’s what he said.</span> <span id="s2059">So we knew that much.</span> <span id="s2060">That now, a week later -- this was now a week after we left Auschwitz -- that Auschwitz was now occupied by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">So we asked him where we, what station that was, and that was Hanover, which is a major city in northern Germany.</span> <span id="s2062">He didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s2063">And pretty soon the train started again.</span> <span id="s2064">And it moved and it stopped and it moved.</span> <span id="s2065">It was a long, long time.</span> <span id="s2066">I think that took that whole day.</span> <span id="s2067">And Hanover is very close to where we actually ended up.</span> <span id="s2068">But it was dark when we arrived, so it must have been daytime when we were in Hanover, I think.</span> <span id="s2069">It must have been.</span> <span id="s2070">I don’t remember exactly, but I do remember that it was dark when we got to our destination.</span> <span id="s2071">And the train stopped.</span> <span id="s2072">We didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s2073">The train stopped and we got off, seemingly in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s2074">It was right in the middle of a forest.</span> <span id="s2075">And the reason I remember it so vividly, is because the surroundings were breathtakingly beautiful.</span> <span id="s2076">It was fairly mild.</span> <span id="s2077">It wasn’t very cold, although it was January, and there was snow on the branches.</span> <span id="s2078">It was a forest of needle trees, of pines, so it was green.</span> <span id="s2079">And the snow on the trees, and just a little snow on the ground, and it was a very bright night.</span> <span id="s2080">There was a moon, a bright moon, it was very bright.</span> <span id="s2081">And it looked just totally unreal -- so beautiful.</span> <span id="s2082">And there was no camp to be seen.</span> <span id="s2083">Of course, it didn’t dawn on me, at the time, that that’s how the executions were being carried out -- in forests.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">At the moment, I was just really taken by the beauty of the surroundings, And so off the trains, and we’re marching again.</span> <span id="s2085">And finally we came to where there were barbed wires, and there were buildings.</span> <span id="s2086">Actually, it was almost comforting to see that there was a camp.</span> <span id="s2087">And as we passed by some barracks, there were people at the barbed wire, and some of those people were the ones who had left Radom in exchange, who were supposed to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2088">They were there.</span> <span id="s2089">But in a separate section.</span> <span id="s2090">We were taken to a shower.</span> <span id="s2091">There was no smell, so it didn’t seem like there was a gas chamber or burning bodies.</span> <span id="s2092">We assumed we would just get a shower, which we did, and then get our clothes back, which were then put through disinfection, and we were brought to the barracks.</span> <span id="s2093">Now the barracks looked very neat and clean.</span> <span id="s2094">What tipped us off -- what this had been before -- were the signs in the various barracks in different languages.</span> <span id="s2095">It had been a prisoner of war camp, see, so one barrack had all the signs in French, and one had all in Italian, and one had all in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">But it was empty.</span> <span id="s2097">When we arrived, there wasn’t a soul.</span> <span id="s2098">We were the first inhabitants of what was to become one of the most infamous of the end-of-the-war camps -- Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2099">There were no bunks.</span> <span id="s2100">Yeah, there were bunks in some of the barracks, but the barrack we were assigned did not have bunks.</span> <span id="s2101">We were handed -- as we walked out of the shower room -- we were all dressed -- we were handed a bundle of straw.</span> <span id="s2102">And we still had our blankets, or at least some of us still had our blanket.</span> <span id="s2103">And there was the floor!</span> <span id="s2104">So we laid out the straw, and we laid down on the straw, and that was that.</span> <span id="s2105">And that was how we lived in Bergen- Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">After that, daily, hundreds and thousands of people were arriving in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2107">We were the very first group.</span> <span id="s2108">But after that, the transports arrived daily.</span> <span id="s2109">And pretty soon, all these barracks -- I keep on wanting to say cabins, because they really looked like cabins, they didn’t look like the barracks in Auschwitz -- they were all filled up.</span> <span id="s2110">And this was just one area that I knew of, and there were some others.</span> <span id="s2111">Ultimately there were 25-40,00 people in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">This was the end of January.</span> <span id="s2113">The camp was liberated on April 15 which was only 10 weeks later.</span> <span id="s2114">We spent 10 weeks in Bergen-Belsen, and the kind of devastation that took place in Bergen-Belsen was never in Radom, or Auschwitz, with all these other things that were going on.</span> <span id="s2115">This was new, imaginative.</span> <span id="s2116">This was death by starvation and disease.</span> <span id="s2117">Just absolutely incredible how people were falling like flies.</span> <span id="s2118">Maybe for the first four weeks, I think, we were given a slice of bread and a cup of soup -- daily.</span> <span id="s2119">After the first four weeks, the bread was cut out, and the soup consisted of rutabagas and water.</span> <span id="s2120">And in the last six weeks, half the people, half of the 25,000 were dead.</span> <span id="s2121">Because of the straw on the floor, the lice started.</span> <span id="s2122">And by the end of February, many people were dying of typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Now the group I was with, we were the ones from Auschwitz, and the crew, the guards and the commandant came from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, so the whole hierarchy was transferred, directly, and they were in charge.</span> <span id="s2124">So they set up the same kind of set-up as in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2125">So we just continued in our work -- in the workshop, the sewing workshop, which is what we did in Auschwitz, which of course, in a way, was also a blessing in disguise, not having to be in the barracks all day.</span> <span id="s2126">We didn’t have any special privileges as far as food was concerned, but just keeping busy -- doing something with your hands in this horror that was Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">But towards the end of February, one day I felt sick.</span> <span id="s2128">I really felt sick.</span> <span id="s2129">I felt nauseous, and I had a terrible headache.</span> <span id="s2130">The main thing was that terrible, splitting headache.</span> <span id="s2131">And pretty soon I was very, very sick with a high fever.</span> <span id="s2132">And by then most of the women in that sewing workshop had become ill, and that was discontinued.</span> <span id="s2133">Of course, I couldn’t go to work any more, either.</span> <span id="s2134">My mother, at that point, was transferred to work.</span> <span id="s2135">She wasn’t sick.</span> <span id="s2136">She had had typhus in World War I, and very often, typhus gives you a lifetime immunity once you’ve had it.</span> <span id="s2137">So she was working in the kitchen now.</span> <span id="s2138">Of course there was nothing in the kitchen but rutabagas and water, because that’s all that was being prepared for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2139">In the meantime, we had been transferred to a different barrack that had bunks.</span> <span id="s2140">We still just had the bundle of straw, but there were bunks in that barrack.</span> <span id="s2141">I was very sick, and it was obvious that I had typhus.</span> <span id="s2142">And typhus is a very deadly disease.</span> <span id="s2143">It’s carried by lice, and it’s infectious.</span> <span id="s2144">It’s an epidemic kind of disease, since it’s carried by infected lice.</span> <span id="s2145">And the whole camp was infected.</span> <span id="s2146">Generally the course of the disease takes two weeks.</span> <span id="s2147">After two weeks there is a crisis point at which one either totally recovers -- the fever goes away and you’re left very weak, but you’re alive -- or else some vital organ is attacked.</span> <span id="s2148">Nobody dies of typhus.</span> <span id="s2149">They die from a secondary disease which is caused by the typhus virus or bacteria -- I don’t know what it is caused by exactly -- and it attacks the liver or the kidneys or the brain, and that’s what people usually die of.</span> <span id="s2150">And there really was no treatment.</span> <span id="s2151">It’s a very fuzzy period in my life, because I had such a high fever most of the time, and I was really lucid only occasionally.</span> <span id="s2152">Very often, I was just totally out of it.</span> <span id="s2153">I remember certain episodes, but not the entire thing.</span> <span id="s2154">So I remember episodes of my mother coming from work, my awareness that she was coming into the barracks, that she would come into the barracks, and I had to be conscious, because I was really in a twilight zone most of the time, that I’d better be conscious, because she called my name from the door of the barracks to make sure that I was alive.</span> <span id="s2155">If I was dead, she wouldn’t even want to come in, you know, so if I didn’t answer, she would assume that I was dead.</span> <span id="s2156">So I had to force myself to hear her voice when she called.</span> <span id="s2157">I remember this .</span> <span id="s2158">And I remember occasions when she brought me some potato peels to eat, and how I thought this was the greatest delicacy, how marvelous it was, how I really just relished this marvelous food.</span> <span id="s2159">And then every day even though I was most of the time half-conscious, I had to get up and go to the muster.</span> <span id="s2160">And I knew that if I didn’t make it to the muster and they discovered that I was sick -- you see I had to pretend that I wasn’t sick -- I would be transferred to the “hospital” -- in quotation marks “hospital” -- where people were sent to die.</span> <span id="s2161">So I dragged myself out of the bunk, and dragged myself to the front of the barrack -- I was in the back of the barrack, my bunk, and I had to go the whole length of that hallway, out the front door -- to stand in muster, And I remember fainting about five times before I dragged myself out.</span> <span id="s2162">And once I got there, two people would usually sort of hold me up, so I could stand up.</span> <span id="s2163">And I managed, until I was past the crisis.</span> <span id="s2164">I managed to escape being sent to the hospital that whole time, until one day I suddenly dropped.</span> <span id="s2165">I just folded during the muster, and they took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2166">And I knew that if my mother found out -- that if she came to the barrack and I wasn’t there -- she’d think I was dead Well, she did find out -- the blockeldester -- the woman who is in charge of the barrack, told her where I went -- and she came.</span> <span id="s2167">There I was in a bunk about two feet wide, with two more people.</span> <span id="s2168">And it was obvious -- I mean, people lived only maybe a few hours, then somebody else was -- this was it.</span> <span id="s2169">Well, I mentioned the diamonds in my mother’s heel.</span> <span id="s2170">She still had those shoes.</span> <span id="s2171">She still had that diamond there.</span> <span id="s2172">She went to the women who was in charge of our barrack, and she said, “I’ll give you a diamond ring if you bring her back.”</span> <span id="s2173">(Laughs.)</span> <span id="s2174">and that’s where the diamond ring went.</span> <span id="s2175">And that’s how I came back to the barrack to be with my mother again, still alive, out of that death trap that was the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: And with no medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: No medication.</span> <span id="s2178">Well, that goes without saying, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: The diamond ring couldn’t buy medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: No, but the diamond ring got me out of sure death in that “hospital.”</span> <span id="s2181">So it was fortunate that she had that.</span> <span id="s2182">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2183">There was one other diamond ring that was left, that I have.</span> <span id="s2184">She had two, one in each heel.</span> <span id="s2185">She gave away this one, and the other one she had.</span> <span id="s2186">And when she died, I have it.</span> <span id="s2187">And when I die, my daughter will have it.</span> <span id="s2188">I think this is probably the one and only thing that we have left of our former lives, plus a few pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">This was already the end of March or beginning of April, and so it was very close to liberation.</span> <span id="s2190">At that point, it looked like we might make it.</span> <span id="s2191">We knew that the Germans were surrounded.</span> <span id="s2192">We knew that the Allied forces were already on German soil.</span> <span id="s2193">We didn’t know any particulars, of course, but we knew that something was very, very imminent.</span> <span id="s2194">So while there was hope building up, there was also a certain amount of despair, because we were so trapped, that how much would it take to just take care of us all?</span> <span id="s2195">First of all, death was all around us.</span> <span id="s2196">There were piles -- mountains of bodies lying around, because there was no one to bury those bodies.</span> <span id="s2197">There were so many hundreds dying every day in Bergen-Belsen, that there was nothing but piles and piles of bodies.</span> <span id="s2198">I remember that in my lucid moments when I was sick, I was looking at those piles of bodies and saying to myself, “I don’t want to be one of them.</span> <span id="s2199">I’m not going to be one of them.”</span> <span id="s2200">I was so resolved.</span> <span id="s2201">I had such will, and much later, most of my friends who are doctors say.</span> <span id="s2202">: This is nothing to sneeze at.”</span> <span id="s2203">This was a very important psychological tool that I was using, telling myself, “I’m gonna make it!</span> <span id="s2204">I’m not gonna be like one of those bodies.”</span> <span id="s2205">And of course, my mother, you know, the incentive of wanting to go on from minute to minute, because, while she hadn’t been sick, she was just like a stick – emaciated – and it wouldn’t have taken much for her to just fall down.</span> <span id="s2206">I remember this one Belgian woman who lay on the floor next to me.</span> <span id="s2207">She was alone.</span> <span id="s2208">She had a husband and a child who were deported previously.</span> <span id="s2209">And when we first arrived, she kept telling herself that they took the child to some place where children were treated pretty well, and she was kidding herself that they were still alive and that they were well.</span> <span id="s2210">And then, at some point, she seemed to be changing.</span> <span id="s2211">We didn’t want to tell her anything, you know, otherwise.</span> <span id="s2212">Nobody contradicted her, that she was fooling herself.</span> <span id="s2213">But at some point she must have given up this delusion, this self-deception.</span> <span id="s2214">And one morning she just didn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s2215">She was getting more and more despondent, telling how it’s not worth surviving, what is she going to live for when all her family is no longer here, and one day she just didn’t wake up!</span> <span id="s2216">She resolved to die, because it was easier.</span> <span id="s2217">And I could see that, and I knew that all it took was for me to do the same.</span> <span id="s2218">The body didn’t have any more resistance, so it had to be all up here in the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: And you had something to live for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Exactly!</span> <span id="s2221">Exactly.</span> <span id="s2222">But you see, most women managed to form the kinds of bonds with strangers that would make it possible for them to have a meaning, that their life had a meaning for somebody, that if they died, somebody would be sad, and it would be devastating to them, and so almost all of us who survived had some kind of an incentive, I think.</span> <span id="s2223">Or it wouldn’t have been possible to make it psychologically.</span> <span id="s2224">Because physically, obviously, it was totally impossible to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Well one week before the liberation -- this is now, of course, from hindsight: I know it was a week before -- the Germans left.</span> <span id="s2226">They suddenly left.</span> <span id="s2227">One morning we got up, and there were no German guards.</span> <span id="s2228">However we weren’t unguarded you understand, in their place were Hungarian soldiers.</span> <span id="s2229">Just regular soldiers!</span> <span id="s2230">And when we asked them what had happened, they said they didn’t know, but the Germans left, that the Allies are very close, and that there is a front not far from there, and they were just told to guard us.</span> <span id="s2231">So we just continued with hardly any food, and the total uncertainty of what might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">At this point, with the few barracks, a very confined little camp, a few bombs would have -- we expected it to be obliterated.</span> <span id="s2233">And then day after day went on.</span> <span id="s2234">And things were just the same.</span> <span id="s2235">Until one day -- the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s2236">Let me read to you a few thoughts that I wrote down about that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">April 15, 1945, was a bright and sunny day at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2238">I remember thinking how ironic it was, that the sun would be shining on this desperate, indescribably horrible hell of a camp, which would seem more properly enveloped in darkness and gloom.</span> <span id="s2239">The wretched remnant of humanity of which I was a part, on the verge of collapse from starvation and epidemic of spotted typhus, trying to soak up the sunshine which has meaning only for those who are free and happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Despair, hunger and death were our constant companions.</span> <span id="s2241">Fewer than half of us who arrived here from Auschwitz less than three months before were still alive, shadowy skeletons all.</span> <span id="s2242">The thought of death was with me for so long that it no longer scared me.</span> <span id="s2243">All the emotion left in me was regret, sorrow that my life, too, like so many before me and around me, would end.</span> <span id="s2244">That I, too, would end up on a pile of bodies which were filling the camp with no one to bury them, discarded like so much trash.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">When I heard the commotion and noise some distance away, I didn’t even raise my head, thinking that now the end was coming.</span> <span id="s2246">But suddenly I heard a voice coming over a loudspeaker, a voice saying something, not in German, but in English, and then in Polish.</span> <span id="s2247">And then I heard the most beautiful words, “We have come to free you.</span> <span id="s2248">This is the Polish Brigade of the British Army.’</span> <span id="s2249">And I saw a British tank with the white star moving slowly between the two rows of barracks, and the soldier on top of the open turret saying these words over and over again.</span> <span id="s2250">And people crying and laughing and hugging each other, crowding around the tank.</span> <span id="s2251">I didn’t see any of these very clearly; my eyes were full of tears I didn’t think I was still capable of.</span> <span id="s2252">I wanted to shout, but no voice came.</span> <span id="s2253">I was terrible afraid that this was but a dream from which I would soon awake to face the horrible reality once again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">But it was not a dream.</span> <span id="s2255">For me, one of the not too many lucky ones, it was a dream come true.</span> <span id="s2256">(Pauses, weeping.)</span> <span id="s2257">This was a day of euphoria.</span> <span id="s2258">But the reality was still around us.</span> <span id="s2259">The British tank was the only one we saw that day.</span> <span id="s2260">And it wasn’t until about two or three days later that there were more British troops.</span> <span id="s2261">It turned out that this was really an advance tank.</span> <span id="s2262">This was a front line.</span> <span id="s2263">And there could have been a military reverse.</span> <span id="s2264">That euphoria could have turned back into the nightmare that it had been.</span> <span id="s2265">But fortunately, of course, the British did come and firmly occupied that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">For the first two days, we had no food at all, which wasn’t any different than what was before.</span> <span id="s2267">But then when they finally brought in a field kitchen, and they were able to establish their position, they did give us food.</span> <span id="s2268">so what did they give us?</span> <span id="s2269">A loaf of bread - freshly baked bread.</span> <span id="s2270">It was warm.</span> <span id="s2271">And they brought in a kettle of soup that was thick, and what I remember was the pieces of meat and fat on top of it.</span> <span id="s2272">I mean, we were absolutely wild!</span> <span id="s2273">Fortunately, our stomachs couldn’t hold much of it, because it was nothing short of disaster -- that fresh bread and that rich soup.</span> <span id="s2274">For myself one of the lucky ones, I just got dysentery, which lasted for six months.</span> <span id="s2275">But some people fared much, much worse.</span> <span id="s2276">Some people actually died from it.</span> <span id="s2277">It wasn’t until maybe a day or so later that they had some different food and realized what they were dealing with, and started giving us some very bland cereal-type food, which was what our stomachs could tolerate.</span> <span id="s2278">(Laughs) People were still dying of typhus, and people were still coming down with the typhus -- new cases – and people were dying from the typhus and from the over-eating.</span> <span id="s2279">In fact, they numbered in the thousands.</span> <span id="s2280">I know people -- I knew people personally -- who died after they were liberated.</span> <span id="s2281">So it was a lucky day for some of us, but not for all of us.</span> <span id="s2282">There was still an awful lot of sick, dying people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">The British captured the German guards who had left the camp previously and brought them back.</span> <span id="s2284">They bulldozed the entire area where the decomposing bodies were.</span> <span id="s2285">The Germans had to do that, the German guards, and bury the bodies in a mass grave, which is still there.</span> <span id="s2286">This is what remains of Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">We stayed in these barracks for three weeks.</span> <span id="s2288">That was a quarantine.</span> <span id="s2289">It was at that time that I found out that Roosevelt had died.</span> <span id="s2290">We just found out what was going on in the world!</span> <span id="s2291">The war was still on!</span> <span id="s2292">This was April 15th!</span> <span id="s2293">It lasted for another three weeks, until the 8th of May.</span> <span id="s2294">During that time, while we were still in those barracks, they brought in a van and had us all go through a DDT spray.</span> <span id="s2295">You know, at that time, they thought DDT was totally harmless.</span> <span id="s2296">I remember they told us that we could leave our food uncovered in the barracks, that they would spray it with DDT, because it was completely safe, and then we went through the van, and the entire body was sprayed with -- with just a ton of that white powder!</span> <span id="s2297">I had holes in my skin from the lice.</span> <span id="s2298">From the scratching -- the skin was so thin anyway, anyway, it was scratched off.</span> <span id="s2299">I had really pockmarks on my skin from scratching from the lice.</span> <span id="s2300">But after that, the lice were gone.</span> <span id="s2301">So then three weeks after the liberation, we were transferred from these barracks to maybe a mile down the road where the military barracks had been.</span> <span id="s2302">Those were very nice -- you know, the German military barracks.</span> <span id="s2303">And we were put in those nice buildings which were divided into smaller rooms, and just a few people to a room.</span> <span id="s2304">And by then we settled down to pretty much of a routine of a diet that was pretty bland, but very adequate.</span> <span id="s2305">And it was at that time then, you started thinking, now, what’s next?</span> <span id="s2306">What’s going to happen to us?</span> <span id="s2307">Where are we?</span> <span id="s2308">Where’s everybody else?</span> <span id="s2309">Who survived?</span> <span id="s2310">Where is anybody?</span> <span id="s2311">How are we going to find each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Well they started registering us.</span> <span id="s2313">The UNRRA officials came.</span> <span id="s2314">UNRRA was the United Nations refugee and Resettlement -- whatever -- Administration, I think was what “A” stood for.</span> <span id="s2315">And the question they asked was to decide where one wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2316">Did you want to go back to your country of origin?</span> <span id="s2317">Actually, I think they wanted to repatriate most people to their countries.</span> <span id="s2318">Well my mother and I really didn’t know what to do -- whether to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2319">It seemed to be a logical thing to do, because if anybody survived, that’s where one would think of meeting again.</span> <span id="s2320">But we really didn’t want to make that kind of decision.</span> <span id="s2321">Not that it was imminent -- we were told that repatriation wouldn’t start immediately, they just wanted to have an idea of what people wanted to do with their lives -- so at the moment we did not make any decision.</span> <span id="s2322">We said we wanted to stay and find out if there was any way of checking if anybody was alive, or where they might be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">And pretty soon, people started arriving, particularly young men who were healthy, and who had a little spirit of adventure, to start traveling in this country that was totally devastated, and where there was no communication, there was, really, no transportation, or anything, But, in the meantime, some people came -- at least one person that I remember --and said that he had seen some people, some men from Radom.</span> <span id="s2324">But we didn’t know where, we didn’t know who, we didn’t know how to get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s2325">And one day -- without being told why or where we were going -- we were simply transported out of Bergen-Belsen just a random group from that building that we lived in, to a different camp.</span> <span id="s2326">They said this was too crowded, so they were transferring people to other places.</span> <span id="s2327">And where we were put up was in a town not very far away, but it was near a military airfield -- also in military barracks.</span> <span id="s2328">And nobody else arrived!</span> <span id="s2329">There was this group.</span> <span id="s2330">There we were.</span> <span id="s2331">And then a couple of weeks later, maybe three weeks later, we were transferred to another place.</span> <span id="s2332">The people who were from UNRRA, who were in charge of this group that I was with, they were French, and we really couldn’t communicate very well, and we didn’t really know what was going on, and we didn’t know what to do, and we didn’t know how to find anybody One day, a young man from Radom came by, one of those who was wandering around trying to find somebody also.</span> <span id="s2333">And there were a number of us from Radom in that group.</span> <span id="s2334">And he said that he had come from a camp near Stuttgart -- near Heidelberg, actually -- where most of the men from Radom were, but he didn’t see David or Jules.</span> <span id="s2335">He didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s2336">They were not there.</span> <span id="s2337">But to us, it gave us a little impetus to want to stay where we were, because he was moving on, and he said if he encountered anybody, then he would tell them where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Pretty soon, they told us that we could go to Sweden, that Sweden would accept this group of women.</span> <span id="s2339">And it was voluntary.</span> <span id="s2340">If we wanted to go to Sweden, the transport would be leaving in two or three days, and we were to sign up for it.</span> <span id="s2341">Well it was really very attractive.</span> <span id="s2342">To go to Sweden for recuperation, was really very tempting.</span> <span id="s2343">But we didn’t want to go, because now we knew that there were men from Radom who survived from that group that left when we were separated in the summer of 1944, and how will they find us in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">So we decided not to go.</span> <span id="s2345">But in order to stay -- not to go to Sweden -- we had to return to Bergen-Belsen, which is where we started out from.</span> <span id="s2346">My mother wasn’t feeling very well, and she was doctoring herself.</span> <span id="s2347">She wasn’t gaining weight.</span> <span id="s2348">This was three months later -- we’re now in July of 1945 -- and I had gained back all my weight, even though I weighed about 50 lbs when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s2349">I practically doubled my weight, and I was really recovering very well.</span> <span id="s2350">I suppose at the age of 21, you recover much faster than when you’re 46.</span> <span id="s2351">That day -- this was two days before the group was to leave for Sweden -- a young man came by again -- a different one -- from Radom.</span> <span id="s2352">And he knew where David and Jules were.</span> <span id="s2353">He told us.</span> <span id="s2354">He said, in fact, Jules is on the way.</span> <span id="s2355">He’s looking for you.</span> <span id="s2356">He knows where you are, and he’ll probably be here tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2357">So, for sure we don’t want to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s2358">And so, the next morning, I was going to town from that camp where we were -- it was called a DP camp, a displaced persons camp -- to pick up the results of a test that my mother had.</span> <span id="s2359">The doctors suspected that she might have maybe diabetes, and that’s why she wasn’t recovering.</span> <span id="s2360">So I got up, and I started walking towards town.</span> <span id="s2361">It was about a 15 minute walk.</span> <span id="s2362">And as I was walking, I saw that figure in the distance, wearing sort of a uniform -- a khaki type of outfit -- but the step looked familiar.</span> <span id="s2363">And he saw me immediately, of course, and recognized me right away, and it was Jules!</span> <span id="s2364">Well, I can’t tell you about this encounter.</span> <span id="s2365">This was really something.</span> <span id="s2366">I think I did go to the doctor’s office to get the test, but it was all pretty fuzzy (laughs) in my memory.</span> <span id="s2367">We stayed overnight with a German family, and then the next morning when everybody else left for Sweden, we got on a coal train and started making our way to Heidelberg, where these people were.</span> <span id="s2368">It took us a long time.</span> <span id="s2369">It was very, very difficult to find transportation but Jules and David had been liberated by the Americans -- that’s where that khaki uniform came from -- and he was armed with a letter from one of the officers there in the officers’ club where they worked as busboys, asking whoever could, to give them assistance in transporting him -- this was Jules alone, because both of them couldn’t leave at the same time -- and he told us, of course what had happened, how they were liberated, and where they were.</span> <span id="s2370">They were not with that whole group of Radomer, because they had been sent to Dachau in the meantime, and they were liberated some place else, but that’s a whole different story.</span> <span id="s2371">And eventually, after about three or four days, we made it to that camp that the Radomer were in, and this was some camp, that’s totally unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2372">It was a castle near Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2373">This was in the American zone, the Americans, when they first encountered what they did, what they found in these camps, they simply threw the Germans out of some nice places and put the former prisoners in there.</span> <span id="s2374">So it was just incredibly beautiful, a beautiful castle, where we stayed until August, about two weeks.</span> <span id="s2375">And then this was liquidated -- of course, this was a very temporary thing -- and the whole group was transported to Stuttgart, which is a large city in western Germany.</span> <span id="s2376">And we were put up in a housing project which was emptied of the Germans, and that became the DP camp in which we lived until September 1st of 1950.</span> <span id="s2377">This is how long it took for us to be able to emigrate from Germany to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">In the meantime, my father was liberated in Theresienstadt by the Russians, but we knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s2379">When we got to Heidelberg, there were some people.</span> <span id="s2380">One person filled us in on what happened to my father, what camps he had gotten into, and then he told us about the death march that he was on with my father.</span> <span id="s2381">And according to him, my father was shot on that march.</span> <span id="s2382">And you know, at that point, with the four of us together, we sort of accepted it.</span> <span id="s2383">We sort of felt we were so fortunate for four of us to survive that, while it was a tragic bit of news, we sort of expected it.</span> <span id="s2384">But he wasn’t shot!</span> <span id="s2385">(Laughs) He ended up in Theresienstadt, and he was liberated!</span> <span id="s2386">And he showed up!</span> <span id="s2387">One day he just showed up!</span> <span id="s2388">He knew about us, but he was under the Russian administration.</span> <span id="s2389">There was no connection there; we couldn’t find out.</span> <span id="s2390">But he found out about us, and he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: That is remarkable!</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: It was really very remarkable.</span> <span id="s2393">And he was great!</span> <span id="s2394">He was in great shape.</span> <span id="s2395">But my mother wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2396">She was sick.</span> <span id="s2397">She got very, very ill that August of 1945.</span> <span id="s2398">I don’t know that it was ever really diagnosed, exactly what it was, but she had an internal hemorrhage, and practically died.</span> <span id="s2399">She was in the hospital for six weeks, and somehow, miraculously, managed to recover.</span> <span id="s2400">She was in a German hospital where the nurses were all nuns.</span> <span id="s2401">It was really some experience to have to live amongst the Germans at that point after liberation.</span> <span id="s2402">But they were really kind to her, and they were really -- they cared for her.</span> <span id="s2403">She went from doctor to doctor, and tests, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2404">It wasn’t possible to really determine.</span> <span id="s2405">I don’t know what her illness was, but she was not well.</span> <span id="s2406">And in 1948, on June 19th, she died very suddenly – probably from another internal hemorrhage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">It was a terrific blow to us.</span> <span id="s2408">It seemed like such an impossible thing to happen, after having survived all this hardship, and all those horrors of the war, to just suddenly expire like this.</span> <span id="s2409">It was a really terrific blow to us.</span> <span id="s2410">And after she died, then my father and David decided that they had to leave.</span> <span id="s2411">They couldn’t wait any longer, and they emigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s2412">Now I have to fill you in generally, what was happening in those years between ’45 and ’48.</span> <span id="s2413">We were in those DP camps -- displaced persons camps -- actually not knowing what to expect.</span> <span id="s2414">We were waiting, most of us were waiting, for a way to leave -- to emigrate.</span> <span id="s2415">A large number of people waited to have an opportunity to emigrate to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2416">Other people were waiting for a chance to emigrate to the United States, which was also extremely difficult, because of the quotas.</span> <span id="s2417">Most of us from eastern Europe, under normal circumstances, under the normal quota system, would have about a ten year wait, except for people who had close relatives in the United States who could send them affidavits.</span> <span id="s2418">A few people left at the end of ’46 and beginning of ’47.</span> <span id="s2419">But it wasn’t really until about 1948, late ’48 or maybe ’49 that the DP act was passed by Congress, which admitted a large number of displaced persons.</span> <span id="s2420">Now displaced persons were not only Jewish survivors of camps.</span> <span id="s2421">This included all nationalities and also included people from eastern Europe who had been brought from Germany as laborers in the factories, and then chose not to =return to their native countries.</span> <span id="s2422">So the whole DP Act admitted maybe over 300,000 people, a very small portion of whom were Jews from the displaced persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Palestine was still totally inaccessible, except for illegal immigration.</span> <span id="s2424">You know the story of “Exodus.’</span> <span id="s2425">People were caught and then sent to Cyprus -- to camps as well.</span> <span id="s2426">But at this point, my father decided that they could no longer wait to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2427">They just had to leave.</span> <span id="s2428">So they left.</span> <span id="s2429">They went to the United States.</span> <span id="s2430">But in 1945, the end of 1945, we decided that we had to start our education.</span> <span id="s2431">We’ve lost five years already.</span> <span id="s2432">In Stuttgart there was only an institute of technology, but that’s what Jules was interested in.</span> <span id="s2433">He wanted to study engineering -- electrical engineering.</span> <span id="s2434">So, as soon as the school opened, maybe it was early ’46, I think, February of ’46, he enrolled and started going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Excuse me, did you say that your camp was in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: Yeah, our DP camp was in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s2437">Most of the DP camps were in former military barracks.</span> <span id="s2438">Stuttgart was one exception.</span> <span id="s2439">As I mentioned, we lived in a residential area which had been cleared of the Germans, and we were given their apartments, and we lived right in the city.</span> <span id="s2440">The others were usually in small towns, not too far from a large city, so there were camps around Munich, but not in Munich itself.</span> <span id="s2441">Some numbers of DP persons -- privately with German families, also.</span> <span id="s2442">People were settling down.</span> <span id="s2443">There was a great uncertainty about when or where anybody would be able to go.</span> <span id="s2444">Canada admitted a few.</span> <span id="s2445">Australia admitted a few.</span> <span id="s2446">So a trickle was leaving, but the main body of the DP’s were still there, and they didn’t know when they would be able to leave, or where they would be able to go.</span> <span id="s2447">So a certain normalcy set in, living in those DP camps.</span> <span id="s2448">And Jewish communities usually were set up with all its institutions, as we’ve always done.</span> <span id="s2449">So there were schools, not formal schools, but there were schools for younger people.</span> <span id="s2450">There were ORT schools, which is the Organization for Rehabilitation and Training, so people could learn a trade.</span> <span id="s2451">You understand, most of the survivors were young, so they also settled down to getting married and raising families.</span> <span id="s2452">There were a lot of children being born.</span> <span id="s2453">It was sort of a transitional period, but it had the smell of permanency.</span> <span id="s2454">There were newspapers.</span> <span id="s2455">There were all kinds of Jewish institutions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">When Jules went to school, I started working for UNRRA in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s2457">I worked because somebody had to earn some money.</span> <span id="s2458">We were given a basic diet.</span> <span id="s2459">We didn’t have to pay rent, we had food, and we had used clothing that was sent to us by the JDC from the United States -- that’s the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2460">But nevertheless, when you live, you want to go to a theater, you want to go to the opera, you want to go to a restaurant occasionally.</span> <span id="s2461">You have to have some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Maybe in those days I didn’t even really think that I needed an education, too.</span> <span id="s2463">I guess it was that old fashioned notion that the husband was the one who needed to have a profession, so that he could support a family.</span> <span id="s2464">I think that in those early years I didn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s2465">Then shortly after that, David started going to school as well, but he didn’t live in Stuttgart, you see.</span> <span id="s2466">He lived near Munich.</span> <span id="s2467">My parents and David lived near Munich.</span> <span id="s2468">And so he went to school.</span> <span id="s2469">He took business administration.</span> <span id="s2470">But he interrupted his education in order to leave for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">It was early in 1948 that I decided that maybe I should get some education, too, I really don’t remember exactly the train of thought that lead me to this.</span> <span id="s2472">But maybe three years after the liberation that we finally realized that we were there, and we really didn’t know when we would leave, so maybe I should use that time, too.</span> <span id="s2473">My friends were having families.</span> <span id="s2474">We just simply didn’t even think of starting a family at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">In Stuttgart in the Institute of Technology, one could take about a two-year course in some other fields of a more general nature, and I chose to take economics.</span> <span id="s2476">So I took an entrance examination, because of course, I had never finished high school except for, as I told you -- maybe you remember -- that we studied, myself and my friends, with teachers individually.</span> <span id="s2477">So as far as the material was concerned, it was there.</span> <span id="s2478">I just didn’t have a formal certificate of graduation.</span> <span id="s2479">I was admitted, and I started going to school, too -- and working.</span> <span id="s2480">And it was pretty darn hard working at the same time as going to school.</span> <span id="s2481">But I guess, maybe that’s when I became a feminist.</span> <span id="s2482">I decided that I had the right to have something to further myself, too.</span> <span id="s2483">This was a very tough period, very hard, but rewarding, in many ways.</span> <span id="s2484">And all the while we were waiting to see what might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">At that point, we really weren’t pushing emigration, because by ’49 Jules was more than half-way through his studies, and now we secretly hoped that it would drag out a little bit so we would still have the same situation that we were in, and he could finish.</span> <span id="s2486">Whether I would finish or not was really, at that point, not that important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Well, when the DP Act was passed, and people started emigrating in large numbers to the United States, Israel was declared a state, too -- at approximately the same time -- and large numbers started emigrating to Israel as well.</span> <span id="s2488">And by 1949, a lot of the DP camps had been really depleted to the point where they were consolidated, and Stuttgart was one of the camps that was liquidated fairly early.</span> <span id="s2489">So we had to look for some other arrangement, and in fact, from then on, until we were able to leave, we lived with a German family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">It’s interesting how, in those years, after the experiences we had had how we could actually function in the midst of the German population, which wasn’t even then very friendly, because what they were looking at is the Jews, whom they despised, who were suddenly better off than they were.</span> <span id="s2491">The Germans were living under conditions of hardship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: They were a conquered people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2494">Whereas we were given their place -- their homes.</span> <span id="s2495">We were fed and supported by the Americans, which meant that we had, certainly more food and better food than they had.</span> <span id="s2496">It wasn’t a very happy situation.</span> <span id="s2497">For us, on the other hand, to be with them, was to have to constantly speculate: Where were those people?</span> <span id="s2498">What were they doing?</span> <span id="s2499">What was their part in this whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: And nobody was talking at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s2502">I was the only Jewish person in that Department of Economics -- out of maybe 200 students.</span> <span id="s2503">And of course they didn’t know that I was Jewish to begin with, until the summer, when they saw the number on my arm.</span> <span id="s2504">And then the conversation would start, you know, where are you from, and…I spoke German very fluently, and so they really didn’t know that I wasn’t an ethnic German from someplace, who was expelled and came to live here, until they saw my number.</span> <span id="s2505">And then the young men, invariably, immediately started telling me that they were in France, and in Belgium, and in Holland, in Norway.</span> <span id="s2506">Nobody was ever in Poland!</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Now, since I knew that I really had no choice, I had to use their facilities, meaning their schools, and whatever I could get out of it, I just really had to forget it, and not let it bother me.</span> <span id="s2508">We got a letter from an uncle of Jules’s who lives in Argentina, and he said in his letter, “How can you sit in the same lecture hall with these murderers!”</span> <span id="s2509">Well, maybe that was a legitimate question.</span> <span id="s2510">But he didn’t know what situation we were in.</span> <span id="s2511">And for us, it was making the best use of the time that otherwise would be wasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Well, by 1950, Jules was finishing his studies, and in fact, finished his final exams in the early summer of 1950, just about the same time that the Korean war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Now my father and David had already left for the United States, you see, more than a year before.</span> <span id="s2514">And the Americans really speeded up the departure of a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2515">It looked like the war might spread to Europe.</span> <span id="s2516">It was a very uncertain time.</span> <span id="s2517">I’m sure you don’t remember this very well, but it was a very uncertain, “iffy” time.</span> <span id="s2518">And so the JDC, which organized the Jewish groups and processed the Jewish applicants for the United States, let everybody know that if they wanted to apply for an exit visa to go to the United States, they better do it fast and leave as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Well, originally, Jules and I did not intend to go to the United States at all.</span> <span id="s2520">Jules’s mother survived the war, and she remarried after the war.</span> <span id="s2521">Her husband had family in Israel -- very close family, like parents and brothers and their children.</span> <span id="s2522">So they went to Israel as soon as it was possible, because he had such close relatives.</span> <span id="s2523">He was one of the first to be allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s2524">And we really wanted to go to Israel to live.</span> <span id="s2525">But then, suddenly, I realized they came here to Minneapolis, my father and David, and I suddenly realized I’d never see them again -- ever -- because it was like the other end of the world, Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">In those years, travel wasn’t what it is today.</span> <span id="s2527">And I just couldn’t face it.</span> <span id="s2528">They were the only people in the whole world that I had.</span> <span id="s2529">And so I persuaded Jules that we should go to the United States, and we could always leave from the United States and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2530">It doesn’t quite work that way.</span> <span id="s2531">How many times can you put down roots?</span> <span id="s2532">And how many times can you be uprooted?</span> <span id="s2533">And by 1950, I was 26 years old already.</span> <span id="s2534">You don’t start life anew again and again.</span> <span id="s2535">At 26 I really didn’t think I was very old; then, I thought I was very young So then we applied for the exit visa, and received it very fast.</span> <span id="s2536">We were ready to leave within a couple of months, which really was faster than we had anticipated, and Jules didn’t have his diploma yet.</span> <span id="s2537">He had taken the final exams and he was finished, but it was the summer break, the end of July, the beginning of August, and the dean wasn’t there to sign the diploma.</span> <span id="s2538">It was so funny because we decided we weren’t going to leave without that diploma.</span> <span id="s2539">If there’s going to be a war in Europe, he’ll never get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">And I had the experience with the lady from the JDC, Laura LaVine.</span> <span id="s2541">I went to her, to ask her to postpone the visa for a couple of weeks until he could get the diploma.</span> <span id="s2542">In front of all the people in her office, she started yelling at me.</span> <span id="s2543">She said, “You think that diploma’s going to be worth anything in the United States?</span> <span id="s2544">it’s not worth the paper it’s written on!</span> <span id="s2545">He’ll have to go to school all over again!”</span> <span id="s2546">I felt like crying.</span> <span id="s2547">Not only was I insulted because she did it in front of everybody, but here five years of this incredible effort, and she’s telling me it’s really not worth anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Well, luckily the Dean blew into town for a couple of days and signed the diploma.</span> <span id="s2549">So she didn’t have to extend the visa, and we could leave -- with the diploma.</span> <span id="s2550">I hadn’t finished.</span> <span id="s2551">I had finished two years and another semester -- I had to commute about 45 miles every day to the university, because this was an institute of technology in Stuttgart, but the university was in Tubungen, a very well-known university, in fact, dating back to like the 13th century -- but we felt that now was really the time to leave.</span> <span id="s2552">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s2553">So we did.</span> <span id="s2554">And we left on a very interesting coincidence, that our transport for the United States left on September 1, 1950, exactly to the day, eleven years after the war broke out on September 1st.</span> <span id="s2555">That was a real milestone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">And we came to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s2557">We had some adventures on the way.</span> <span id="s2558">We stayed in New York for a few weeks, and then finally came to Minneapolis where, at least in the beginning, it seemed like Laura LaVine was right, that Jules’s diploma wasn’t worth much.</span> <span id="s2559">But that wasn’t really true.</span> <span id="s2560">He couldn’t get a job as an engineer, because of the Korean war, because almost all large companies were involved in some way or another in the war effort, and they required citizenship – for instance, Honeywell; in those days, Honeywell was actually the largest employer of engineers here -- and some other places where he applied, he didn’t have references, because he hadn’t lived here for any length of time.</span> <span id="s2561">He didn’t know any English, to speak of, so that first year was very tough.</span> <span id="s2562">And he did some jobs that were only remotely related to his profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">The first winter, which was a very severe winter -- that was another, that was a big surprise, was the climate here, was really hard, something unexpected; I thought I was in Siberia -- he worked putting up television antennas on roofs in that 30-degree-below-zero weather, and I think, until last year, that was the record snow year, too.</span> <span id="s2564">Something like 85 inches of snow in the winter.</span> <span id="s2565">So it was a rough winter, but then we got settled down.</span> <span id="s2566">I didn’t do anything that’s worthwhile remembering, actually.</span> <span id="s2567">My first job was working in a dress factory doing finishing work.</span> <span id="s2568">You can imagine the type of sweatshop that one reads bout in New York at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s2569">It wasn’t a sweatshop, but certainly the caliber of the people who worked there were probably people who couldn’t, because they didn’t have any other background, do any other kind of job.</span> <span id="s2570">In fact I spoke English better than many of these women whom I worked with, who had lived here for many, many years.</span> <span id="s2571">But pretty soon, I saw that this was not to be my destiny.</span> <span id="s2572">I just couldn’t see myself doing that kind of work for any length of time.</span> <span id="s2573">I was laid off shortly, maybe a couple of months after I had worked there, and I decided to find myself an office job.</span> <span id="s2574">My English was a lot better than Jules’s.</span> <span id="s2575">I could communicate quite nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">So I applied for a job at Northwestern life Insurance Company, and I got it!</span> <span id="s2577">I got a job.</span> <span id="s2578">I was so apprehensive.</span> <span id="s2579">Am I going to be able to do it with the English?</span> <span id="s2580">I had to speak English all the time.</span> <span id="s2581">Had to do my work in English.</span> <span id="s2582">I did fine!</span> <span id="s2583">After six weeks I was promoted, pretty soon I was one of them.</span> <span id="s2584">I was doing very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">And then David picked up his education again.</span> <span id="s2586">He was doing some kind of menial work, too.</span> <span id="s2587">And then he decided to go back to school, and applied to the University of Minnesota, and got all his credits from Germany.</span> <span id="s2588">And then, oh, about January of 1951, I thought maybe I should start looking into picking up my education again, and I applied to the University of Minnesota, too, and David went with me.</span> <span id="s2589">I translated my German papers, and now when I read them, it’s really hilarious, because it’s all literally translated, but I was actually admitted to graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: In economics?</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: In economics.</span> <span id="s2592">I had enough credits, concentrated credits in economics, that I was admitted to graduate school.</span> <span id="s2593">Of course, I didn’t know what I was biting off.</span> <span id="s2594">But I did.</span> <span id="s2595">I went.</span> <span id="s2596">I was working.</span> <span id="s2597">I couldn’t afford to quit working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">That was one thing I could not do.</span> <span id="s2599">I had to work.</span> <span id="s2600">And there was no night school in those days.</span> <span id="s2601">It was all day school.</span> <span id="s2602">So I took only like maybe nine credits a quarter, and the people at work were really super nice to me.</span> <span id="s2603">They made it possible for me to work the hours that were convenient for me.</span> <span id="s2604">I just had to tell them at the beginning of the quarter what my schedule was, and my hours would be arranged accordingly.</span> <span id="s2605">But it was tough.</span> <span id="s2606">That next year and a half -- actually five school quarters -- were very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: I believe it.</span> <span id="s2608">Now, as you resettled here, did you maintain contact with other survivors, or survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: Locally?</span> <span id="s2610">That’s really the only contact we had, initially.</span> <span id="s2611">There was a club of German Jews and there was a club of “others”.</span> <span id="s2612">And those were really most of the recreational activities, and social activities were amongst ourselves.</span> <span id="s2613">There really wasn’t that much opportunity to get to know other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">I have to tell you about an incident that maybe is a little revealing.</span> <span id="s2615">There weren’t many organizations -- probably in other cities, too, but here particularly -- that they tried to do something for the newcomers.</span> <span id="s2616">There were volunteers who taught English one-on-one.</span> <span id="s2617">There were classes.</span> <span id="s2618">Schools had evening classes for new Americans to study English.</span> <span id="s2619">But there were also volunteers who met with people individually.</span> <span id="s2620">Jules had a teacher like this, an older lady, who met with him and taught him English individually, and I know others who did, too.</span> <span id="s2621">I didn’t need that.</span> <span id="s2622">I took a course, an evening class at the University to improve my vocabulary.</span> <span id="s2623">But those who needed it, for those it was just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Then there were some organizations -- there was an organization called, I don’t remember the exact name, Minneapolis Council for New Americans, or something like that --that coordinated these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">And a woman called me one time, shortly after we arrived, and asked if we would be interested in going to the theater.</span> <span id="s2626">Of course we’d love to, but we couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s2627">So she offered free tickets on behalf of a local Jewish women’s organization, which we gratefully accepted.</span> <span id="s2628">And then she kept calling and offering us tickets to the University Theater, to the symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s2629">It was just marvelous!</span> <span id="s2630">And that’s really so nice, so I decided one time I should meet her.</span> <span id="s2631">I had never met her.</span> <span id="s2632">We just talked on the phone.</span> <span id="s2633">And so I called her and invited her for lunch on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s2634">I thought that would be a nice way to meet.</span> <span id="s2635">Well she couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s2636">That Sunday, she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2637">I called again the next Sunday.</span> <span id="s2638">She couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2639">She never could.</span> <span id="s2640">And suddenly it dawned on me, that I was a charity case as far as she was concerned.</span> <span id="s2641">I wasn’t her equal.</span> <span id="s2642">She wasn’t interested in meeting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">And I think that’s why it was at least five years, before we even had any American friends.</span> <span id="s2644">True, that we were very busy, going to school and working.</span> <span id="s2645">That didn’t leave much time to join organizations.</span> <span id="s2646">I finally knew, years later, that we had to make the effort.</span> <span id="s2647">I’m not being critical!</span> <span id="s2648">I think this is how it is when you come to a new community.</span> <span id="s2649">It’s really up to you.</span> <span id="s2650">People who live here have their friends, they have their relatives, they don’t need to reach out.</span> <span id="s2651">They reach out in certain ways, like this woman reached out to us.</span> <span id="s2652">But socially, they really don’t need newcomers.</span> <span id="s2653">That’s why different efforts were made with Russian immigrants, but there was no such effort with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: That’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2655">Now Elie Wiesel talks so eloquently about the silence, was it…</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: Deafening silence…</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: …of the Holocaust survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: Yes, there was a deafening silence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: That he was not able to speak or write about the experience for 10 years,</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: That’s absolutely correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: Did you feel the separation from others, because they had not gone through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Absolutely, absolutely!</span> <span id="s2663">Nobody wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2664">Nobody wanted to listen.</span> <span id="s2665">And we had a real need to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2666">That’s why we were drawn to one another, because we could discuss it among ourselves.</span> <span id="s2667">But that wasn’t the point.</span> <span id="s2668">The point was, that survival depended so much on this need to bear witness, because being abandoned, as we were, as we felt, we had to conclude that nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s2669">We had the need to inform!</span> <span id="s2670">And nobody wanted to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">I’m sure I can think of a lot of reasons that people didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2672">I want to be kind.</span> <span id="s2673">It wasn’t to hurt us.</span> <span id="s2674">I think it was to alleviate their own anxieties, and their own feeling of guilt, perhaps, that they didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2675">That there was probably, a feeling of inadequacy in not having done something, or tried, at least, to prevent what was happening.</span> <span id="s2676">Or not being unformed, although it was obvious by then that there were signs, and there was some knowledge.</span> <span id="s2677">People simply didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">I think that Americans also have an extremely keen sense of privacy, and that people thought that they were intruding on a painful subject, that they didn’t want us to get into.</span> <span id="s2679">That it would hurt us.</span> <span id="s2680">I know that I have many friends, to this day, who have been friends of mine for 25years, with whom I never discussed anything specific.</span> <span id="s2681">They know, basically.</span> <span id="s2682">They know the basics, but we’ve never specifically talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">In fact, it wasn’t until 1976, when I went to Poland, and I was flabbergasted when I came back, suddenly a lot of friends wanted to see the slides and wanted to hear me talk about Poland, which at that point, of course, having a lot of slides from Warsaw, and from Auschwitz, I would be touching upon the things that happened to us.</span> <span id="s2684">It took that long for it to come out into the open!</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: I wonder how much of that was a fear of invading your privacy, and how much of that was plain and simple denial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: Probably a combination of both.</span> <span id="s2687">I don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s2688">I can’t give you percentages.</span> <span id="s2689">I want to be kind to the people, and say, yes, the element of privacy was definitely there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: Yes, but at the same time, don’t you think that listening to the stories of the concentration camps was, in a sense, admitting to yourself that people can be pretty rotten, that there is this bestial element, which…</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: Well, I think the jury’s still out on this, and I don’t know that we’ll ever know, because these people will not be interviewed.</span> <span id="s2692">If you could interview a few people, and ask them, “Why didn’t you want to talk about it?</span> <span id="s2693">Why didn’t you want to listen?”</span> <span id="s2694">Then we maybe would know.</span> <span id="s2695">But we really don’t.</span> <span id="s2696">For many years, I used to do a program at the Adath Jeshurun on Friday evening to commemorate the Holocaust, usually in April.</span> <span id="s2697">And on that Friday night, I could look out on the congregation and not see five of my friends.</span> <span id="s2698">They stayed away in droves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: And to what do you attribute that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2701">I never wanted to come out and ask anybody point-blank.</span> <span id="s2702">Maybe I should have.</span> <span id="s2703">But I didn’t want to invade their privacy.</span> <span id="s2704">(Laughs) Maybe some day I really will.</span> <span id="s2705">I’ll just say, “Why didn’t you ever come to these programs?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: Well now having gone though all of these experiences, the experiences during the war, and then this amazing silence that followed you when you came to this country, what conclusions did you draw, and do you draw now about human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: I don’t think that there is a single human nature that one can address oneself to.</span> <span id="s2708">I can understand to some extent the shame of a civilized world, and the need to sort of put it behind.</span> <span id="s2709">I cannot understand why some people will say, “Why not just forget it and live a normal life?”</span> <span id="s2710">There is no normal life after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2711">There is no such thing.</span> <span id="s2712">We have to face the world as it is, and people are uncomfortable with that, because if they have to face the world as it is, they have to do something.</span> <span id="s2713">They can’t just sit back and pretend that life is the same way as it’s always been.</span> <span id="s2714">It isn’t.</span> <span id="s2715">It’s a different world -- a world that sowed the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">But interestingly, you only really see people concerned with the Holocaust who didn’t live through it.</span> <span id="s2717">It took a whole generation.</span> <span id="s2718">The younger people, the children of those who are my age, are now very, very interested in it, at least to some extent.</span> <span id="s2719">I can’t say that it is a general interest, but there is a much more general interest than there ever has been.</span> <span id="s2720">So there had to be some distance, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: What kinds of questions do young people ask you when you go into schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: Well, generally I speak to older students, senior high and students at the university level, and I speak to adult groups.</span> <span id="s2723">I do this by preference, because I don’t think that I’m equipped to deal with very young people.</span> <span id="s2724">I think I tend to talk frankly about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">My technique is basically one of being not too emotional.</span> <span id="s2726">I’m being very factual.</span> <span id="s2727">And so I don’t put people in an uncomfortable position of either myself being emotional, or playing on their emotions.</span> <span id="s2728">I think that if we talk on a mutual level of objectivity, that we can get a lot more across, a lot more interchange in terms of what I want to get out of this encounter, of my opportunity to speak to these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Basically, I talk to them in terms of what we can learn from the Holocaust, touching upon such subjects as direct involvement of those who would be dragged down to the kind of level, or would be the type, that would engage, actually, directly or indirectly, in this type of treatment of other human beings.</span> <span id="s2730">This is of course, the one extreme.</span> <span id="s2731">On the other extreme are the victims.</span> <span id="s2732">And of course, everybody can become a victim.</span> <span id="s2733">And you can visualize many, many situations where a group can be victimized.</span> <span id="s2734">I try to keep it in general terms, so that they could see that the applicability of what happened to the Jews is universal.</span> <span id="s2735">That it can happen to other groups, and that we have to be on guard from this happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">If you keep it strictly as a Jewish experience, in my opinion, you’re risking an attitude of, “Well, the Jews are a different group,” you know, and, “It happened to the Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: “And it can’t happen to me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: But it can, yeah, “It can’t happen to me.”</span> <span id="s2739">Or, “it wouldn’t be done to any other group.”</span> <span id="s2740">So you have to generalize this, and that’s what I’m trying to do.</span> <span id="s2741">I’m trying to universalize the problem, in terms of the human condition, of each of these different situations that human beings can find themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">And of course I direct my lesson to those who are the uninvolved.</span> <span id="s2743">The question is, “ How could it have happened?”</span> <span id="s2744">The numbers of those who were actually engaged in the effort to exterminate the Jewish people were small.</span> <span id="s2745">The numbers of victims was large.</span> <span id="s2746">But if it could happen in the midst of the very densely populated continent that Europe is…how could it have happened?</span> <span id="s2747">How could, say, half-a-million people exterminate six million in the midst of 200 million?</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">And therein is really the lesson of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2749">It could happen because 200 million turned their heads away and pretended it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2750">It wasn’t happening.</span> <span id="s2751">They didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2752">They closed their eyes and their ears and they didn’t wasn’t to get involved, because they were either afraid, or they simply didn’t want to risk the possibilities of repercussions that might come upon them, or they simply didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">And by extension, then, I try to show them that even other countries, such as the United States, were not that close to the continent.</span> <span id="s2754">They knew about it, too -- the government did, and in fact I cite examples of the fact that there was plenty of it in the press, in the American press.</span> <span id="s2755">The American people chose not to believe it, because otherwise, if they did, they’d have to act.</span> <span id="s2756">And, you know, if you don’t believe it, you simply dismiss it, then it isn’t happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">And so that’s the lesson that I show them, that in our midst, we’re playing that every day.</span> <span id="s2758">This is happening every day on a small scale, where people are abused by others, and most of us turn our heads away.</span> <span id="s2759">There are very, very few who get involved, and there were very few who did get involved then, too.</span> <span id="s2760">I point that out to them I have a slide presentation which I put together that highlights a lot of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Mostly the questions are coming from older audiences -- not meaning really older age-wise, but mature intellectually -- “What can we do as teachers?’</span> <span id="s2762">for instance.</span> <span id="s2763">I lecture regularly in the School of Education at St. Cloud State University, and so those are people who are going to be teachers.</span> <span id="s2764">And I point out to them how important -- what kind of a function they have.</span> <span id="s2765">That they have these impressionable children that they could do something with.</span> <span id="s2766">I point out to them how prejudice and stereotyping lead to an awful lot of horrible things which we don’t envision.</span> <span id="s2767">We think that voicing preconceived ideas about groups is really a very innocent pastime, but it isn’t because it really ingrains those impressions on you.</span> <span id="s2768">And therefore the time to act is when you are very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">It’s very interesting how many people react to this.</span> <span id="s2770">They would say, “Gee, that’s right.</span> <span id="s2771">My grandfather’s a real bigot.</span> <span id="s2772">He’s a real anti-Semite!”</span> <span id="s2773">Well, first I often ask them to tell me about some of the stereotypes that they’re aware of as far as the Jews are concerned.</span> <span id="s2774">And the same kinds of things always come out.</span> <span id="s2775">I could just recite them even before they’ll say them.</span> <span id="s2776">“I know this is what you are going to say.”</span> <span id="s2777">And they say it.</span> <span id="s2778">I say, “How do you know this.</span> <span id="s2779">Most of you live in rural Minnesota, probably never even met a Jew?”</span> <span id="s2780">That’s true.</span> <span id="s2781">They admit they’ve never met a Jew.</span> <span id="s2782">You get it from your parents, your grandparents.</span> <span id="s2783">You get it from your church.</span> <span id="s2784">I don’t beat about the bush, but it’s unemotional, what I’m saying, it’s not accusatory, it’s factual.</span> <span id="s2785">And I’m usually armed with sources, s that if somebody challenges me, I’m able to refer to the sources that are not my sources, that are not Jewish sources.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">We frequently get into the question of the Christian-Jewish tension, and this is all in connection with that large mass of people who don’t get involved in any way.</span> <span id="s2787">They’re not doing Jews any harm, or blacks or any other group, but they’re not doing them any good, either.</span> <span id="s2788">They’re uninvolved.</span> <span id="s2789">Detached.</span> <span id="s2790">Disinterested.</span> <span id="s2791">I say to them, it’s natural.</span> <span id="s2792">We all live in our little milieu, and we live in a fairly safe environment, and we want to please our friends.</span> <span id="s2793">We don’t want to lose our friends.</span> <span id="s2794">When somebody makes an anti-Semitic or an anti-black remark, we don’t want to rock the boat.</span> <span id="s2795">It’s the easiest thing to do, even if we don’t approve, to simply keep quiet, because we might lose all our friends if we are too outspoken in defense of minority groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">But it’s here!</span> <span id="s2797">It exists!</span> <span id="s2798">And there’s plenty of literature, and plenty in the daily press, occasionally, of incidents to illustrate the things that I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s2799">So I think that I come across as a person who doesn’t accuse, but who really tries to teach, and point out the pitfalls of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: Then you’re building toward, I gather, an awareness that something like this could happen here if we are not as vigilant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2802">Yes.</span> <span id="s2803">I don’t want them to have the idea that I’m talking about the Holocaust to have them feel sorry for the Jews.</span> <span id="s2804">It’s much too late for that.</span> <span id="s2805">The dead will not be brought back to life.</span> <span id="s2806">I don’t need their sympathy, personally, nor does anybody I know, of the people like myself, need anybody’s sympathy.</span> <span id="s2807">But we need to convey to the world what happened, and have something be done to make a little better world.</span> <span id="s2808">I feel that this is the fulfillment of my role in life.</span> <span id="s2809">That I have to do something.</span> <span id="s2810">Having been privileged to survive, I have to make an effort to contribute to a minute improvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">I set myself a very small goal.</span> <span id="s2812">I figure if I reach 10% of whatever audience I speak to, I’m very successful, and I’ve spoken to thousands upon thousands of people in Minnesota and North and South Dakota and Wisconsin, and I feel that if out of, maybe 10,000 that I’ve spoken to, if I set a goal of a thousand, I think that’s no mean accomplishment.</span> <span id="s2813">If many of those people are teachers or clergy people who have access to other people, and as a result, carry that message a little further, then I’ve accomplished my function in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: Some of the young people are hearing your message.</span> <span id="s2815">Are there particular concerns, fears, preoccupations of the young people that you have dealt with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: Well, the young people are not as outspoken, and they’re not as…very often, you find in a group only a very few who will share, or who will really deeply probe for certain problems that are involved.</span> <span id="s2817">One question that often comes up out of that, and I think it comes up with religious people who get very disturbed when the religious issue comes up, “Really, is this Christianity?</span> <span id="s2818">Can Christians behave like this?”</span> <span id="s2819">They deep-down feel that Christianity is all good, and so why is there this hatred, and why is there this inaction on the part of Christians when things like that do happen?</span> <span id="s2820">They tend to dismiss the fact that those who were perpetrating the crimes were Christians.</span> <span id="s2821">There’s often that disturbing thought in their minds, “Those weren’t Christians.</span> <span id="s2822">If they were, they wouldn’t be doing it.”</span> <span id="s2823">Well, the facts of the matter are, that the Church never expelled any of these Nazis.</span> <span id="s2824">Even Hitler was never really excommunicated from the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s2825">So whether they were Christians or not, using the small “c” in an adjective-sort of way, I don’t know whether their behavior is Christian or not.</span> <span id="s2826">But I think a lot of people are deeply disturbed by this, by the knowledge that religion really played a role in the persecution of the Jews.</span> <span id="s2827">Very often, that’s the first time they hear about it.</span> <span id="s2828">They only hear what is in the Gospels, but that’s just accepted as fact.</span> <span id="s2829">That’s not questioned.</span> <span id="s2830">What that does to your mind, in terms of resentment of the Jews, really very few people realize, and the kind of hatred that this causes, generation after generation, after generation, for some people, this is just a total revelation.</span> <span id="s2831">They say, “But Jesus was a Jew!”</span> <span id="s2832">but yet, “The Jews killed our God.”</span> <span id="s2833">So the religious aspect, this is very strong, very disturbing thought to some people.</span> <span id="s2834">And then the question comes up frequently, “What role did religion play in your life when you were in the camps?</span> <span id="s2835">and could you believe in God when all this was happening to you?”</span> <span id="s2836">Now those are really disturbing questions for some of these people.</span> <span id="s2837">And they’re really very interested to know what that did to me.</span> <span id="s2838">Am I an atheist now?</span> <span id="s2839">Do I not believe in God?</span> <span id="s2840">It’s not voiced quite that way, but they do ask that.</span> <span id="s2841">And I point out to them that from the Jewish perspective, human beings have free will, and that blaming God is not something we do.</span> <span id="s2842">We don’t expect God to be involved in our daily affairs.</span> <span id="s2843">God gave us free will to do good or evil and it really is up to human beings to carry those out.</span> <span id="s2844">And if we blame God for letting this happen, then we exonerate the people, and we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2845">So I’m not sure that a Christian actually follows this, quite.</span> <span id="s2846">They do know about free will, but I think that they feel that God is involved in every aspect of their lives.</span> <span id="s2847">But at least it sets them to thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Q: Do you feel that your adherence to Jewish values helped you in any way to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: I think it helped us all.</span> <span id="s2850">I think it may not be well-known, but I think the Jewish behavior under these conditions was far above the behavior of other groups.</span> <span id="s2851">And obviously, it was our moral and ethical framework that made it possible for us not to succumb.</span> <span id="s2852">Conditions were so horrible, that it was very easy to be dragged own to the level of the common denominator.</span> <span id="s2853">But I think, by and large, we came out very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Well you somehow, for the most part, retained your faith, didn’t you, throughout the experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: Well, I’m not sure that that’s the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: Your faith in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: Yes, I have a thorough commitment to the future.</span> <span id="s2858">Obviously having children was an expression of that commitment to the future, and a belief in a future, and not giving up on humanity.</span> <span id="s2859">I entertained the idea of not having children when we came out of the camps, with the idea of, “What kind of a world is this to bring children into?”</span> <span id="s2860">But obviously, there is a resilience in a human being that helps overcome this, and there has to be.</span> <span id="s2861">It’s a continuation of all that -- those positive expectations -- even in the worst times of the camps, when one could really give up just as easily, or much more easily, than to fight and go on from day-to-day.</span> <span id="s2862">So I think it’s just an extension of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Frequently I have to say that I’m very proud of the way we behaved.</span> <span id="s2864">Now, other cultures may look upon us as being submissive, and often the phrase was used that Jews went to their deaths like sheep.</span> <span id="s2865">This is another question that comes up very often, and that’s the question of resistance, which I’ll address in a moment.</span> <span id="s2866">But the point is that resistance involves some kind of violence, too.</span> <span id="s2867">And I guess we just were never trained to be very violent.</span> <span id="s2868">And I would rather go to my death like a sheep, than have to be responsible to myself for violence toward others, even if justified.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: So there was this ancient ethical Jewish principle that was being enacted by these people on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Also, I think in terms of the cohesiveness of the Jewish family, and you illustrated this in your account on so many occasions -- one time when you wanted to die and your mother persuaded you to live, and on other occasions when you lived for your mother or another member of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: She really mostly lived for me.</span> <span id="s2873">Well, the question of resistance is one that always comes up, because Americans are a violent people.</span> <span id="s2874">There’s a lot of violence that we live with.</span> <span id="s2875">And I guess the notion of heroism always has to do with an act of violence.</span> <span id="s2876">Now that may well be true, but I usually point out to them, we talk about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising as an example of the kind of armed resistance that there was, which happened in many of the ghettos and camps.</span> <span id="s2877">That was the case.</span> <span id="s2878">.</span> <span id="s2879">There was armed resistance, to the extent that there were arms!</span> <span id="s2880">Which of course, there weren’t very many in most places.</span> <span id="s2881">BUT, from the standpoint of now an older woman, who’s raised children, I point out that any kind of armed resistance was doomed to failure and failed.</span> <span id="s2882">And those who carried it out, invariably died.</span> <span id="s2883">Maybe they died with the knowledge, the satisfaction, that they did something, that they killed some Germans.</span> <span id="s2884">But they died nevertheless.</span> <span id="s2885">Somebody asks me, “Why didn’t you resist?”</span> <span id="s2886">And I have been asked this.</span> <span id="s2887">I say to them, “If I had, I wouldn’t be here to talk to you.</span> <span id="s2888">It was thanks to the fact that I didn’t have any means of resisting -- because I didn’t have any weapon to resist with, assuming that if I had one I would know what to do with it -- I had that chance to live.”</span> <span id="s2889">But what I specifically point out to them is the folly of calling resistance only something that’s done with your hands, or with a weapon.</span> <span id="s2890">We resisted every minute.</span> <span id="s2891">Survival was a minute-to- minute act of resistance.</span> <span id="s2892">Resisting the despair, where you were ready to give up, because you couldn’t go on any longer.</span> <span id="s2893">Living from day-to-day in those extermination camps was an act of resistance every minute.</span> <span id="s2894">It was much easier to give up.</span> <span id="s2895">So to speak of resistance is to speak of the whole spectrum of resistance.</span> <span id="s2896">Courage, courage of mothers or grandparents or brothers and sisters to follow their members of the family to death.</span> <span id="s2897">That’s courage, too.</span> <span id="s2898">The easiest thing would have been to send the child alone.</span> <span id="s2899">The young mother could have survived, probably by virtue of being young.</span> <span id="s2900">But imagine the terror of that child going off by himself or herself?</span> <span id="s2901">I think it’s just incredible courage to give up living.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">So we talk about this sort of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s2903">I prefer not to address myself to a single question.</span> <span id="s2904">I sometimes answer single questions, but mostly if a question is asked, I direct it towards a specific topic and make it a lesson in a certain aspect of human nature, of the experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: So many members of your immediate family, and even in Jules’s family survived, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: Only Jules’s mother survived.</span> <span id="s2907">His 18 year-old sister and his father perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: Okay, but especially in your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Well, really not very many.</span> <span id="s2910">There were only five of us from my whole family who survived.</span> <span id="s2911">And both my parents had brothers and sisters and they had children.</span> <span id="s2912">I had a grandmother and a great-grandmother, and they perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: But the fact that the five of you survived, you must have thought about those on so many occasions.</span> <span id="s2914">To what do you attribute your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: (Laughs) Just pure chance -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s2916">I remember once a nun asking me, and this happened, not once, but more than once, but it’s usually somebody who’s a religious person, “Don’t you think it was God’s will, and God’s scheme, that you should survive, because you’re so articulate, so that you can do the good that you’re doing?”</span> <span id="s2917">and I usually smile or even laugh, and I say, ‘I’m sorry, you can think what you want, but I’m not that arrogant.</span> <span id="s2918">I saw enough people who were much more worthy than I to survive.”</span> <span id="s2919">“Well,” they’d say, or she would say or he would say, “You can’t second guess God.</span> <span id="s2920">God has his reasons.”</span> <span id="s2921">And I’d say, “Well, I appreciate, and I’m very flattered that you’re saying that, but no, I just happen to be very fortunate to have had my mother with me -- the support relationship was very, very important, and I was also lucky that they didn’t throw those bombs into the barracks at Bergen-Belsen in that last week, and the same thing with David and Jules and my father, and we just happened to be very fortunate to be where we were when we were there.”</span> <span id="s2922">I really, I mean, I’m not metaphysical.</span> <span id="s2923">I cannot conceive of any scheme of things.</span> <span id="s2924">But then, maybe I’ll find out.</span> <span id="s2925">(Laughs.)</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: (Laughs) What do you answer to young people who say that they have no faith in the future, that perhaps there’s nothing to live for?</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: I have never really encountered that kind of a statement straight out.</span> <span id="s2928">But my answer to this is, that they can’t ask me that question, because I’m the personification of a future.</span> <span id="s2929">I mean, if somebody said that to me, I’d say, “Well, look at me.</span> <span id="s2930">I certainly had every reason…” And when I speak of myself, I always make it very clear that I’m just a representative.</span> <span id="s2931">I’m not any particularly different person.</span> <span id="s2932">Most people in the same situation that I was in, would have similar thoughts and would have similar experiences, and I just articulate them.</span> <span id="s2933">So I say, “Look at people like myself.</span> <span id="s2934">We certainly have every right to give up, and certainly not expect any future, or anything good to come of any future.</span> <span id="s2935">And look.</span> <span id="s2936">Here I am.</span> <span id="s2937">I’ve had a full life.</span> <span id="s2938">I’ve certainly been grateful for every day that was granted to me, and I still am, and there always is a future.</span> <span id="s2939">If I ever gave up believing in the potential of human beings for good -- to overcome bad -- then there’s nothing to live for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
