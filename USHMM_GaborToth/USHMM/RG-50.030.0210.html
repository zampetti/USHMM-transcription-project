Seibel retired Colonel in the United States Army.</span> <span id="s15">I was born and raised, and still live, in Defiance, Ohio.</span> <span id="s16">I was ordered to active duty from Defiance, Ohio, in 1941.</span> <span id="s17">I reported for active duty June the 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s19">Would you give us little information about your background and your childhood in Defiance?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Well, I would say that my background is that of a normal school child, if you will.</span> <span id="s21">I played, participated in all sports.</span> <span id="s22">I lived with my father and mother.</span> <span id="s23">My father was born and raised in Germany, came to this country when he was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s24">My mother is a native Ohioan from Defiance, her ancestors were some of the original settlers in Northwest Ohio.</span> <span id="s25">I spent my entire life in Defiance.</span> <span id="s26">I was the director of purchasing at a factory in Defiance when I was ordered to active duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, I have two brothers, and they are both deceased now.</span> <span id="s29">In fact, they both died in the same week.</span> <span id="s30">And so I had a funeral for each one of my brothers in the same week.</span> <span id="s31">Prior to that I had another brother and sister but they were deceased when they were very young so that I never knew them.</span> <span id="s32">They were about 2 years old, I guess, when they died.</span> <span id="s33">I spent my entire life...I joined the reserve unit and somebody said, "Why did you ever join the reserve?"</span> <span id="s34">And I said, "Well, I felt I owed an obligation to my country and my family and my God and that's the reason I was in there.”</span> <span id="s35">They said, "Yeah, but if you hadn't been in the reserve, you would have never been in combat and war two.”</span> <span id="s36">I said, "Well, that's beside the point.”</span> <span id="s37">I joined the Reserve, no prior military experience and I did it all by correspondence, if you will, and association with the Ohio National Guard.</span> <span id="s38">And I received my commission as a Second Lieutenant.</span> <span id="s39">And that was in 1934.</span> <span id="s40">And then I remained in the Reserve, which was nothing at that time, until I was ordered to active duty on June, the 9th, 1941, 6 months before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s41">I was then ordered to Fort Knox, Kentucky, which was quite an experience, I can assure you, because it was the training center for all of the selective service people.</span> <span id="s42">We trained all of these people for a period of 13 weeks.</span> <span id="s43">Then comes Pearl Harbor, and the roof fell in, if you will.</span> <span id="s44">Things changed completely.</span> <span id="s45">All the guards that had been on duty in the camp previously had only blank ammunition, and from that time on, they were issued ball ammunition.</span> <span id="s46">All civilian clothing was sent home, and the entire training was stepped up and it was changed from 13 weeks to 11 weeks because we were in a hurry, if you will.</span> <span id="s47">And that is when the entire military concept of training and combat and everything else changed, from that time on.</span> <span id="s48">I was sent on a troop train shortly after Pearl Harbor, probably 2 weeks after that to Fort Ord, California, with, as I recall, about 250 trainees who were being deployed to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s49">And the West Coast, they were scared to death.</span> <span id="s50">Believe you me, they were.</span> <span id="s51">They felt that the submarines were going to come in, but they never did, of course.</span> <span id="s52">And so that was the beginning of extensive training for combat in World War II.</span> <span id="s53">Shortly thereafter, I was ordered to Camp Poke, Louisiana, to a new division, the 11th Armored Division.</span> <span id="s54">We started training in Camp Poke, Louisiana, with all new troops and from thereon, we went to Louisiana maneuvers and from there we went to the desert for desert training, and from there to Fort Ord...or Camp Cook, California, and then from there overseas to England, and from there to Continental Europe to meet the enemy.</span> <span id="s55">That is briefly my background and our training in England was prior to crossing the channel for combat, and we were ordered in the combat...we had crossed the Channel and landed at Cherbourg, and we were supposed to go to Nancy, to come up from the south, and that's when the ball changed.</span> <span id="s56">And so we were immediately changed from going to Nancy to go through Paris and up to the Meuse River to prepare the Meuse...all the bridges on the Meuse River for demolition.</span> <span id="s57">We were not to contact the Germans.</span> <span id="s58">The Combat Command A on our left was supposed to probe, and not to meet them in any fire fight of any kind.</span> <span id="s59">So we then crossed, and we went in through Neufchateau, Belgium.</span> <span id="s60">And it was shortly thereafter that we hit that Bulge head on and we got hurt.</span> <span id="s61">I don't mind telling you.</span> <span id="s62">But we had good people in our organization, well trained, and then we caught our breath, if you will, after that first engagement and continued on, and when through Luxemburg and Belgium, France, Germany, into Czechoslovakia, a short distance and back out, and into Austria, and that's when we wound up with Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: When did you first arrive in Austria?</span> <span id="s64">A: In Austria?</span> <span id="s65">I don't know for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">01:08 It probably was the latter part of April of 45 because we were stopped, and it was May the 5th, when the restraining line stopped us which is across the river from...we were across the River from Linz, Austria, in the vicinity of Erfurt, which was Hitler's birthplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What did you say...what caused your stop at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: The international restraining line the agreement was made at Yalta between Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt where they divided Europe which Berlin Wall was a result, plus the occupation of all of Eastern Europe by the Russians.</span> <span id="s69">That, in my humble opinion...of course, that's all changed now, was that's the worst thing that even happened in Europe, was that international restraining line.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">01:09:</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: How did it come about that you came across the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: We sent a patrol out in a effort to keep in contact with the enemy or to contact the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">And since we couldn't go any further than the restraining line which was approximately a mile or so on the other side of Mauthausen that's how we found it, because we were probing and that's about the best I can say is that in our attempt to keep contact with the enemy or contact the Russians, here was Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What happened after you came across the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We had this patrol and the patrol leader called in by radio and said that we have across something that we are not sure what it is.</span> <span id="s76">It's a big prison of some kind, and there are people running all over.</span> <span id="s77">I said, "Well, is there any combat or shooting of any kind?"</span> <span id="s78">He said, "No.”</span> <span id="s79">I said, "Well, you return.</span> <span id="s80">Bring the patrol and come back.”</span> <span id="s81">And they reported into the headquarters and told me roughly what it was, and so I reinforced the patrol and I went back to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s82">And that is when I made a complete inspection and came back and reported into General Degar, our division commander and told him what it was, and it was shortly after that report that he said to me on the telephone, "Dick," he said , "You will return to Mauthausen and take command.”</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What did your patrol tell you they found?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Just a lot of people, lot of bodies, lot of people running around.</span> <span id="s85">There was no control of any kind.</span> <span id="s86">These people were strictly on their own and no one knew what was going on or what the situation was.</span> <span id="s87">Really and truly.</span> <span id="s88">They were like lost sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So you went back to the camp yourself for the inspection.</span> <span id="s90">What did you see and what did you inspect?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, first of all, all of these dead bodies piled up, like cord wood if you will.</span> <span id="s92">Sick people, dying people, starved people.</span> <span id="s93">And you take to an American such a sight as that, you can't imagine it.</span> <span id="s94">Things like that don't happen, but they did.</span> <span id="s95">And so we were actually and truly...the people that were with me, they were all dumbfounded.</span> <span id="s96">And when we went back the second time, I went in and went into the headquarters and the Russian major who had been a prisoner in the camp.</span> <span id="s97">He was sitting behind the desk and through an interpreter, I asked my interpreter to ask him what he was doing there?</span> <span id="s98">And he said well, they were in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s99">They were going to run it, and they had all ready established a tribunal for the death of certain people.</span> <span id="s100">I said, "Will you please tell him that this is in the American zone, and that we are here and we are occupying the camp and it's our responsibility and we're going to run it.”</span> <span id="s101">And he still wouldn't leave.</span> <span id="s102">So I (laughing) I pulled my pistol out and I reached across the desk and I pointed it right in his face and through the interpreter I told him to tell that so and so that if he didn't get out of there, I was going to shoot him.</span> <span id="s103">And he and his party left immediately.</span> <span id="s104">(Chuckle) And so that was our initial on the takeover of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s105">My interpreter who lives in London, England...he's a Czech.</span> <span id="s106">His name is Primisol Dovias, and he remembers that to this very, very day</span></p> <p><span id="s107">01:14: because he and I correspond rather frequently and he a short time ago was telling one of his Canadian friends about what had happened, and I had letter from this (laughing) Canadian relative to our takeover and Primisol's part of the takeover.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Did you inspect the physical surroundings?</span> <span id="s109">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Terrible shape.</span> <span id="s112">The SS, when they left they disrupted the power plant.</span> <span id="s113">We had no lights, no power, no water, no sewage, no sanitation of any kind, and that is exactly what we found and we had to get that cleared up fast because of the health of the prisoners of the camp.</span> <span id="s114">Not only that, but my own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What did you do to straighten it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I wouldn't allow any of my people to handle any of these bodies or clean up any of the feces that were around or anything of that nature.</span> <span id="s117">I had all the prisoners do it, and I got one person from each nationality.</span> <span id="s118">There were 21 nations represented in that camp.</span> <span id="s119">I got a representative from each nation to pass on my wishes and desires, if you will, to the people of his own nationality so that they knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s120">Now, I think it was the second day.</span> <span id="s121">I'm not sure about this, but a fellow came in...one of my people came in and said, "You better come quick.</span> <span id="s122">There's trouble out in the main compound.”</span> <span id="s123">I went out and here's four bodies on the street with their throats cut.</span> <span id="s124">There was fighting among people so there was only one thing to do.</span> <span id="s125">We got everybody inside the buildings by force with bayonets if you will to clear the streets, to get inside.</span> <span id="s126">We started at 8 o'clock in the morning and with a representative of each nationality, we segregated that entire camp by nationality, got them...Germans altogether, the Russians together, the Poles together, the Czechs together, the Spaniards, the Italians, all of the Slavic countries.</span> <span id="s127">That stopped the political problems that we were having with the people in the camp because they were fighting among themselves, and so we put a stop to that real quick.</span> <span id="s128">We, fortunately or unfortunately, we segregated in internal prisons inside the main compound all the Russians and all the Poles.</span> <span id="s129">We would not let them associate with anybody else because they were troublemakers.</span> <span id="s130">And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the camp and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up.</span> <span id="s131">And I said, "Well, General, ...by an interpreter.</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">, of course, I said, "You tell your people when they learn how to act, then they can get out, but not before.”</span> <span id="s134">So that's some of the problems that we ran into which we never expected because we thought we were the great white liberators you know, and we're doing a tremendous job for these people, but it took them a long time to realize that we were there to help them, not to hurt them.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How many people did you have to administer in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Eighteen thousand in the camp at that time.</span> <span id="s137">We gathered up about 700 bodies, which we had to bury.</span> <span id="s138">We had no identification of any kind, and we buried them in the old Sports Platz, which was the recreational area for the SS, playing soccer and baseball or whatever they played.</span> <span id="s139">The bodies, there were no identification on any of these people, and no one could identify any of them because some of them were in terrible condition.</span> <span id="s140">So we buried them in a mass grave, about 700.</span> <span id="s141">We put a cross up over each grave.</span> <span id="s142">Of course, they were buried without benefit of casket or anything because we had to get rid of those bodies.</span> <span id="s143">And from that time on, anyone who died in Mauthausen received a cross or a Star of David, with their names on it, and they were thoroughly and totally identified, but prior to that we couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s144">I would guess that there was something like 1300 people died while we were there, and they were all identified properly so that all records maintained their nationality and their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">01:19:00</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did you bring in medical facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: We brought in two field hospitals.</span> <span id="s148">Huge installations!</span> <span id="s149">And anyone who had to be taken care of was assigned to these hospitals.</span> <span id="s150">Our medical records show that we had hospitalized, while we were there, about 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s151">And as soon as they were able to leave the hospital they left.</span> <span id="s152">And that's what we did until until the bulk of the people in the camp had gone home.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Now when I left there and my people and I left, there was only about 3,000 or 3,500 people left.</span> <span id="s154">And they...the bulk of those people didn't want to go home.</span> <span id="s155">And there were quite a number of Jewish people left in the camp that did not wish to return to their homelands.</span> <span id="s156">In checking with these people, the older Jew wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s157">The younger Jews wanted to go to the United States, to England, or to France.</span> <span id="s158">And so those...I don't recall how many there were, but those were the ones that were left and the other people just didn't want to go home.</span> <span id="s159">Period!</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Were these Jews that didn't want to go home or were these other?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Other people that just didn't want to go back to their homelands.</span> <span id="s162">A lot of them were afraid to go because of what had just happened and what they had been through.</span> <span id="s163">Until it settled down.</span> <span id="s164">Now I don't know...I do not know the results of the 3,500 people, but I know that I was told that they had in Paris, I think it was Paris, a displaced camp for Jews, and all the Jews that were left in the camp were all sent to this displaced camp in I believe it was in Paris.</span> <span id="s165">At least it was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">01:22:00</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were there any special problems that related to the Jewish inmates particularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No.</span> <span id="s169">I had no problems at all.</span> <span id="s170">In fact as I mentioned to you previously I did not recognize a Jew as a Jew.</span> <span id="s171">He was a human being just like anybody else and therefore he was treated as such.</span> <span id="s172">We did our dead level best for him to forget his past We put all of the Jewish population in with their own nationality because I didn't feel that they should be segregated like they had been previously and so mistreated, that we put them in with their own people, all the Germans, the Hungarians or whatever they might be, whatever their nationality.</span> <span id="s173">They went in, but they didn't go in as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did any of the Jewish population have any feeling about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: They did, but then they got over it.</span> <span id="s176">I had a lot of pressure put on me from the Zionist organization from Zurich, why did I do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And I told them very plainly why I did it.</span> <span id="s178">And but they couldn't quite understand that.</span> <span id="s179">And I said, "Well, may I say that you people have been persecuted for which I am very, very sorry.</span> <span id="s180">But I don't want that to persist in this camp or have any feelings of persecution previously.</span> <span id="s181">I want your people to be a part of the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: You told me a little story about a Hungarian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Oh .</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">Yeah.</span> <span id="s186">A Hungarian came in.</span> <span id="s187">He spoke excellent English and he asked me, he said, "I want to ask you why the Jews are not kept by themselves in this camp.”</span> <span id="s188">And I told him, I said, "Well you people lived outside the main compound in tents, cold and you were treated very, very poorly.”</span> <span id="s189">And I said, "I don't want that to happen.”</span> <span id="s190">I said, "You are human beings just like anyone else," and I said, "What's your nationality?"</span> <span id="s191">He said, "I'm a Hungarian.”</span> <span id="s192">I said, "Therefore, you will be housed with the Hungarians, not with just Jews.”</span> <span id="s193">Well, it took a little time for him to let that soak in.</span> <span id="s194">I told him, I said, "Now, I want you to understand this.”</span> <span id="s195">I said, "I'm from the United States America.”</span> <span id="s196">And I said, "If you lived in the United States, you would be an American.”</span> <span id="s197">In my book, you'd be just an American.</span> <span id="s198">You're not a Jew, because this is your religion.</span> <span id="s199">Judaism is your religion.</span> <span id="s200">If you are in the United States, you'd be an American.</span> <span id="s201">Period!"</span> <span id="s202">Well, it took him a little while but he finally recognized my feelings and whether I was right or wrong, I stuck with it right down to the very end, and I would not change my position at all.</span> <span id="s203">Even though a lot of pressure was put on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Were you aware of any dissention among the survivors in the camp within each nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s206">The politics that existed between the different nationalities was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s207">I couldn't believe it and the rest of my staff, we couldn't understand why they were so-called fighting among themselves when they'd been under this horrible oppression, and here we thought we were doing them a</span></p> <p><span id="s208">01:26:00 good turn.</span> <span id="s209">We were saving them from the horrible atrocities within the camp.</span> <span id="s210">And it took us quite awhile to get that over, but finally ...finally they realized that the Americans were there to help them the very best they could possibly could.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You said when you originally went into the camp you did an inspection.</span> <span id="s212">Did you find any hospital supplies?</span> <span id="s213">What kind of food supplies did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Nothing!</span> <span id="s215">We didn't find anything.</span> <span id="s216">We found no supplies of any kind.</span> <span id="s217">No food.</span> <span id="s218">Fortunately, they were able to lead us to the potato, or the Kartoffel storage and that's the first food that we had served...was weak potato soup, the same as they've been getting, but we didn't have anything else.</span> <span id="s219">No medical supplies.</span> <span id="s220">Nothing.</span> <span id="s221">No clothing.</span> <span id="s222">Not a darn thing.</span> <span id="s223">So here we are, combat troops faced with a situation like that and it was very difficult for us I can assure you.</span> <span id="s224">In the camp was a very famous Czech surgeon.</span> <span id="s225">His name was Dr. Poloho.</span> <span id="s226">The Czechs told me that he was one of the most prominent and emminent surgeons in all of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s227">A fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s228">And they told me a story about Dr. Poloho.</span> <span id="s229">He was called into the camp commandant's office.</span> <span id="s230">He was working practically as an intern.</span> <span id="s231">The commandant of the camp said, "I have a lieutenant who is seriously ill, and I would like to have you operate.</span> <span id="s232">And Poloho told him, he said...well, he said, "Gee, I haven't done anything like that in a long time.”</span> <span id="s233">And he said, "I'd need some time to prepare myself for this operation.”</span> <span id="s234">This lieutenant had something wrong with his stomach.</span> <span id="s235">Zierice who was the commandant of the camp, told him: "Well, you have 15 minutes to prepare yourself.”</span> <span id="s236">He said, "Now, if this lieutenant lives, I will put you in the base hospital which is strictly for military personnel and you will be in charge of that, but if he dies, so do you.”</span> <span id="s237">And so Poloho operated and he was successful and the lieutenant lived and Poloho was then transferred to the base hospital which was a permanent building in the main compound.</span> <span id="s238">He's a fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s239">I remember him well.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Do you remember the conditions of the buildings that were in the camp and approximately how many people were living in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well, the main compound....the only brick were permanent buildings were those of the structure for the base personnel or the camp personnel.</span> <span id="s242">That's the SS.</span> <span id="s243">For their administrative buildings.</span> <span id="s244">The crematoria, of course, the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s245">Those were all permanent buildings.</span> <span id="s246">The rest of the buildings were all wooden and that housed the prisoners of the camp.</span> <span id="s247">Down in the...below the main camp was a placed called the Sanitaets Lager.</span> <span id="s248">Sanitation, of course.</span> <span id="s249">Sanitation camp.</span> <span id="s250">And that was terrible, just awful.</span> <span id="s251">And so lot of people who had been in there,</span></p> <p><span id="s252">01:30: we moved up into the main camp and particularly when the hospital units came in, transferred them out of there.</span> <span id="s253">Then we burned the buildings down because they were just ridden with disease and vermin and insects, everything you can imagine, so we burned them down to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s254">Because we didn't want to subject our people and the rest of the prisoners in the camp to any unnecessary disease, plus the fact that we brought in, known in military terms as, a delousing unit.</span> <span id="s255">Everybody in the camp was deloused.</span> <span id="s256">Sprayed with DDT powder to kill any bugs that they might have on them and to prevent any further disease.</span> <span id="s257">The diseases were in the camp down below.</span> <span id="s258">You can name anything that you want to, and they had it.</span> <span id="s259">It was a terrible, terrible situation.</span> <span id="s260">The main disease, the main cause of death was typhus.</span> <span id="s261">I had no idea that typhus was as deadly as it was in Mauthausen and I know that our surgeon that went with me....I took...I don't know....4, 5 doctors with me and our chief surgeon, he got ahold of me and he said, "You're going to get a typhus shot.”</span> <span id="s262">And gee he gave me a shot (laughing) about killed me.</span> <span id="s263">But he said, "I don't want you to get sick.”</span> <span id="s264">So typhus was probably the No. 1 killer of disease in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s265">Of course, there was typhoid and...and everything else you can think of.</span> <span id="s266">Tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s267">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: You mentioned that there was a gas chamber; there was a crematorium, and there was administration buildings.</span> <span id="s269">Was there any other buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Those were the only permanent buildings.</span> <span id="s271">The camp headquarters...I'm trying to recall in my mind now, as you went down the main street on the righthand side, there was a brick building and beneath that brick building was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s272">The crematorium and believe it or not, a refrigerated room, and I said, "What in the world they have a refrigerated room here for?"</span> <span id="s273">They said, "Well, they would gas approximately 125 at a time in the shower room, and of course they were all dead in 15 or 20 minutes and they brought them out and the crematorium couldn't handle them that fast.</span> <span id="s274">So they had a refrigerated room where they put the bodies so that they wouldn't spoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did you inspect the stone quarry?</span> <span id="s276">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s277">Yes, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And what did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, the stone quarry was ...they call it a marble pit (chuckle) really.</span> <span id="s280">It was a series of steps that led from the main compound down into the quarry where the people would dig rocks and then carry them out.</span> <span id="s281">And they put them on their back in what they call a rucksack.</span> <span id="s282">It's like the children carry their books in today.</span> <span id="s283">They dig these rocks, then they'd take them up the steps.</span> <span id="s284">And if they faltered up, going up, they were immediately executed and if not, they were thrown over the edge of the cliff and smashed on the bottom.</span> <span id="s285">Now, those steps are called 186 steps of death and all of the people who died on those steps, they said that the steps ran absolutely red with blood.</span> <span id="s286">And speaking of the quarry...of course, I must clarify this.</span> <span id="s287">The things I'm relating to you I did not see, but this is all official testimony.</span> <span id="s288">It's not something that I have imagined or made up in my own mind.</span> <span id="s289">At one time there were 3500 Jews transferred from Auschwitz to Mauthausen and when they arrived at Mauthausen, they shoved them all over the edge of the cliff down in the quarry and their bodies were all smashed down in the quarry.</span> <span id="s290">Now that is official testimony and it is the record of the United States 3rd Army War Crimes Commission.</span> <span id="s291">Any of the scenes that I am relating to you was all given to the 3rd Army Commission who was up there and made a complete inspection of the camp and questioned all of the...not all of them, but a lot of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s292">So that is a part of their testimony.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you talk to any of these people there who worked in the quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">There was ...well, in fact my interpreter Primisol Dobius was down in the quarry and one day they came in and some of the SS people came down and said they wanted volunteers...volunteers to go out and work on the hog farm.</span> <span id="s296">Anybody who knew anything about hogs, please step forward.</span> <span id="s297">Dobius.</span> <span id="s298">Now this, Dobius told me this.</span> <span id="s299">He volunteered to go and work on this hog farm.</span> <span id="s300">He didn't know a hog from a horse actually.</span> <span id="s301">He's a Jeweler.</span> <span id="s302">(laughing) He volunteered and they wouldn't take him.</span> <span id="s303">In fact, he showed me his leg.</span> <span id="s304">He's got a hole in his leg where one of the SS guards kicked him and badly injured his leg.</span> <span id="s305">They didn't take him.</span> <span id="s306">And he was so disappointed because he thought, "That's a way to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s307">So they took 10 of them.</span> <span id="s308">They left the stone quarry and went toward this farm.</span> <span id="s309">And they got outside a distance and the machine guns on the tower opened up and</span></p> <p><span id="s310">01:37: killed all 10 of them.</span> <span id="s311">He says, "Now, I'm glad I didn't go.”</span> <span id="s312">But the stone quarry was really a hard labor place.</span> <span id="s313">The stones were used in buildings and...and transported out of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s314">Oh, incidently, outside of...between the...the gas chamber and the crematorium was a small room.</span> <span id="s315">And that was a special execution chamber for Seereiss(?)</span> <span id="s316">, the commandant of the camp, and Eichgruber, who is a Gauleiter of upper Austria.</span> <span id="s317">When they had somebody that they wanted to hang or kill, they had it in their own private execution room.</span> <span id="s318">The guard...the fellow who is a Pole, who ran the refrigerated room as well as putting the bodies in the crematories, gave me a ring.</span> <span id="s319">It was an army ring.</span> <span id="s320">And he said it was from a lieutenant that had been executed by Seereiss and Eichgruber, and wanted to know if I would accept it and return it to...well, there was no identification, but I did take the ring and I turned it over to proper elements of the 3rd army.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Were you able to tell any difference between how the Jewish population and the non-Jewish population was treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: (Sigh) Prior to our being there, I would say that the Jewish element in the camp, they were brutalized far worse than the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s323">That would be my humble opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did you have any forewarning that you were coming upon the camp at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: None.</span> <span id="s326">None at all.</span> <span id="s327">We had no idea that there was on there, or what a concentration camp truly what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: What reaction did you have to seeing the camp for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s330">It's hard for me or any of my people who were with me to express how they felt to see man's inhumanity to man if you will.</span> <span id="s331">Unbelievable!</span> <span id="s332">As I mentioned before, I'd seen dead people, but never anything like that.</span> <span id="s333">It's absolutely and totally unbelievable that people could treat people like that.</span> <span id="s334">And I guess a lot of it's still going on today.</span> <span id="s335">I don't know why or how people can be so brutal.</span> <span id="s336">After all, we're all God's children and to treat one another the way they treated people and supposedly 6 million Jews and supposedly another 6 million non-Jews for a total of 12 million.</span> <span id="s337">That's a lot of people!</span> <span id="s338">That's a lot of people!</span> <span id="s339">And they were (sigh) I don't know.</span> <span id="s340">That...today I still do not...even after all this length of time...anybody mentions SS to me, I have absolutely no regard, respect or anything for anyone who is an SSer because you didn't have to be an SSer.</span> <span id="s341">That's a volunteer outfit.</span> <span id="s342">And they...they had strong backs and weak minds in my humble opinion.</span> <span id="s343">I have no love...I've been involved in a few things.</span> <span id="s344">In fact one time I got a call from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles wanting to know if I would, by telephone now, agree to speak to reporters from the Sun Times in Chicago.</span> <span id="s345">They had called the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</span> <span id="s346">They called me.</span> <span id="s347">I told them that I would be happy to talk to them, so they called the Sun Times back and then they called me.</span> <span id="s348">They had found a person in Chicago who had been a former guard at Mauthausen and they picked my brains, of course, over the telephone, but asked me what my feelings were and, of course, they published in the paper.</span> <span id="s349">But I absolutely have no sympathy whatsoever for any SSer.</span> <span id="s350">The German Weirmacht altogether different.</span> <span id="s351">That's a German GI.</span> <span id="s352">He was a soldier doing a job just like any American soldier.</span> <span id="s353">Not brutal, like the SS.</span> <span id="s354">I probably should mention this that in Mauthausen we needed help and lots of it.</span> <span id="s355">So we found out that there was a German POW camp outside of Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s356">So we sent back and asked for specialists.</span> <span id="s357">Electricians, plumbers, sanitation people, mechanics and all that sort of thing to send up to help us.</span> <span id="s358">We got about 400, brought them up, and we housed them, took care of them; classed them as German prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s359">Had a captain.</span> <span id="s360">I'll never forget his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Captain von Brum we started to utilize these people, and the first time that they showed they were attacked by the prisoners and therefore again we had to take some very positive action and explain to these people that they were there to help us to help them.</span> <span id="s362">That they didn't know any more about a concentration camp than we did.</span> <span id="s363">So that calmed down.</span> <span id="s364">But those German Wehrmacht...I told this Captain, I said, "Any of those people who do not behave themselves as soldiers, get rid of them.”</span> <span id="s365">So he did.</span> <span id="s366">And he sent back...I don't know, 50, 60 of them.</span> <span id="s367">The rest of them all did a fine job, and they were dumbfounded actually at what they saw in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s368">That was an experience with the German Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Do you know why the 50 or 60 were sent back?</span> <span id="s370">What they had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: They were...I don't know.</span> <span id="s372">But they were not up to the Captain's wishes and desires, so he got rid of them, sent them back.</span> <span id="s373">What they did I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Did you talk with the Captain as to what he knew about the camps before?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">They were surprised.</span> <span id="s377">And I believe them.</span> <span id="s378">They were surprised as we were.</span> <span id="s379">Q: What was there reaction to seeing the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s381">Same as ours.</span> <span id="s382">Now that's a German regular army soldier.</span> <span id="s383">And they didn't understand it all why such a thing existed.</span> <span id="s384">They'd heard of it.</span> <span id="s385">Yes.</span> <span id="s386">But not to the extent that they saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Go ahead, Sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: How long were you at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: 35 days.</span> <span id="s391">I spent in the camp right there for a solitary 5 days.</span> <span id="s392">I was not exactly a prisoner in the camp, but I was there and I knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s393">And relative to food, when we started out they have huge steam vats over in this one building, and the soup that they were serving was thin, watered soup.</span> <span id="s394">Well, my doctors told me, said, "Now look.</span> <span id="s395">These people have been on a severe diet, and you cannot feed them very much to start off with.”</span> <span id="s396">So, as I mentioned, we found the potato storage, so we started out making very thin potato soup, same as they'd had previously.</span> <span id="s397">The most precious item in their diet was bread.</span> <span id="s398">You could get your throat cut for a piece of bread so big.</span> <span id="s399">They guarded a little bit of bread with their lives.</span> <span id="s400">We found an old bakery and we got some prisoners who had been bakers before and (laughing) you won't believe this, but you know all the Hullaballoo these days about oat bread and oats and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s401">Well, I think we originated that.</span> <span id="s402">Because we didn't have any wheat</span></p> <p><span id="s403">01:47: and we didn't have yeast.</span> <span id="s404">But we started making bread out of oats.</span> <span id="s405">And we baked thousands and thousands of loaves, but, of course, when it first came out of the bakery or off and out of the ovens, was just a mass of dough, not having any yeast or any curing agents of any kind.</span> <span id="s406">So we put it in a big warehouse and let it age until it dried out.</span> <span id="s407">As soon as that happened we started giving each prisoner a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s408">Oh, my.</span> <span id="s409">The most precious thing they could have had.</span> <span id="s410">Well, we kept building up our bread supply, so finally we got to the point where we gave them two slices.</span> <span id="s411">And then a quarter of a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s412">And then a half a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s413">And (laughing) they...they came in and said, "We don't want any more bread.</span> <span id="s414">We got enough.”</span> <span id="s415">(laughing) We got a tremendous charge out of that, but then we found in Linz, Austria a warehouse of dehydrated vegetables which we started adding to the potato soup which enhanced it a great deal.</span> <span id="s416">Then the doctor said, "Well, they're coming along pretty good.”</span> <span id="s417">So we started butchering horses, and we feed them horse meat, bread, dehydrated vegetables.</span> <span id="s418">Not soup, but dehydrated vegetables, and potatoes.</span> <span id="s419">And my oh my, what a change in their diets.</span> <span id="s420">And fortunately, none of them got sick, but yours truly, I sampled every meal of food that was served in that camp to make sure that what they were getting was good because I had supervisors in the kitchen, but the prisoners in the camp were doing the cooking.</span> <span id="s421">But my mess people, they were supervising so I wanted to make sure that what they were getting was good so I had a sample of every bit of food that was served in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Where did the horses come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: The countryside where...in fact, there were a lot of German army horses that had been driven ahead of the combat.</span> <span id="s424">And I was surprised to learn that the Germans used hundreds or thousands of horses in their units for transportation.</span> <span id="s425">The first time that we found that out was when we were going toward the Rhine River and all of these horses, just hundreds and hundreds of them had come up to the river and, of course, the Germans took off and went across the river and here's all these horses.</span> <span id="s426">That was long before we got to Mauthausen, but that's where a lot of the horses came from, and plus any that we decided that we needed to take care of our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did any of the surrounding civilian population help?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: They didn't help a nickel's worth except when we started burying all the bodies that we found, we went to the people in town and around and got their services to handle these bodies and bury them.</span> <span id="s429">And oh my or my, did that create</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:51: a terrible outcry among the people and I know there was a dentist.</span> <span id="s431">One of them was a dentist.</span> <span id="s432">And my chaplain was my chief burial officer, and this dentist was giving him a bad time.</span> <span id="s433">He said he wasn't going to do anything like that.</span> <span id="s434">Now, Dave Kinsler was the Chaplain (Laughing).</span> <span id="s435">He hauled off and hit him.</span> <span id="s436">(Laughing) When Dave told me about, I said, "That's all right.”</span> <span id="s437">But some of the people objected because it was a lousy job.</span> <span id="s438">Really and truly.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: You said you were there for 35 days.</span> <span id="s440">What caused you to move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: We were transferred out from that particular part and I can't think of the name of the infantry division that came in and took over after we left, but we were moved down into the Austrian Alps to be on so-called combat occupation because the Werewolves were supposed to be starting up again down in the valley where we were going and we were to combat them if necessary, but it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: The new unit that came in, did they administer the camp as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s444">I lost all contact with it after...after we left I knew nothing of what went on.</span> <span id="s445">Q: Any final comment you'd like to make?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, except that I'm terribly sorry that it happened and I don't know how you can stop it really and truly.</span> <span id="s447">They're having miserable problems in the Middle East now and I'm a little worried as to what might happen there.</span> <span id="s448">The treatment of the Jew, I don't understand it to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Why?</span> <span id="s450">Just because a person was a Jew, why they were segregated.</span> <span id="s451">While we were there, there was a special ambassador by the name of Edward Pauling who was sent by President not Roosevelt, Truman to contact and make a survey, if you will, of the Jewish population and the elements around, and it was in Germany in particular.</span> <span id="s452">I have a letter from him at home thanking me for what...all the information and everything that went on while he was there.</span> <span id="s453">He spent a whole day interviewing the Jews in the camp.</span> <span id="s454">And he told me that in all of Germany, the best they could estimate, there were only 25,000 Jews left in the whole country.</span> <span id="s455">That's that's extermination wholesale really.</span> <span id="s456">To this day, there are a lot of people that do not understand what the Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s457">A lot of them don't want to know.</span> <span id="s458">It's not very pleasant history.</span> <span id="s459">School children.</span> <span id="s460">My goodness gracious, I have spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school children about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s461">Showed them pictures and everything else, and it's kind of hard for those children to believe that actually and truly happened.</span> <span id="s462">But somehow or other, the children of this world and the young people of this world have to be apprised of what happened so that it never happens again.</span> <span id="s463">It can't happen again because</span></p> <p><span id="s464">01:55 it...it more like...I just can't describe it.</span> <span id="s465">I..</span> <span id="s466">.</span> <span id="s467">I truly can't because until you have been involved with a thing like the Holocaust it's very difficult to explain it to people and have them understand.</span> <span id="s468">Another thing that happened at Mauthausen with the Jews.</span> <span id="s469">They brought about 700 of them in and said that they were all dirty and they needed a shower.</span> <span id="s470">So they took them in a big shower room and they all had nice, warm showers and they brought them all out into the compound, the main compound.</span> <span id="s471">Nude and squirted them with a fire hose in very, very cold weather until they all died.</span> <span id="s472">And if they didn't die from exposure and shock the first time, they took them back in and give them more showers and brought them back out until they were all dead.</span> <span id="s473">Now, again, I didn't see that, but that is official testimony and I'm sure that if you're to check with any former prisoner of Mauthausen they could verify what I have said.</span> <span id="s474">A gentleman from New York...he is a Czech by the name of Boshak, who is a prisoner in the camp, a Czech, a very intelligent man, came to Defiance to see me.</span> <span id="s475">He'd been a prisoner there.</span> <span id="s476">He was a Czech and I think he was an attorney and he had married a lady and they lived in New York.</span> <span id="s477">But I had an interview with President Benes of Czechoslovakia, a wonderful discussion with him.</span> <span id="s478">And he was talking about Hitler and all the rest of the things and they used Mauthausen...they had sent a lot of radio and press people, magazine people to Mauthausen to write about it and question everybody and they used Mauthausen as a horrible example of Nazi atrocities.</span> <span id="s479">He was rather flowing and enjoying in his admiration for the American people.</span> <span id="s480">And this I gotta say.</span> <span id="s481">Do you know that there wasn't one solitary person, except two French nurses, that came into the camp that ever lent a hand.</span> <span id="s482">Not one other country in this world never helped at all in Mauthausen with any assistance of any kind.</span> <span id="s483">That's kind of hard to believe.</span> <span id="s484">(laughing) These two French nurses came in one night about 2 O'clock.</span> <span id="s485">(Laughing) I couldn't speak French and I had a heck of a time.</span> <span id="s486">Finally, some...found somebody that could interpret, and they were there to help with the hospital and the sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: I don't have anything else.</span> <span id="s489">I trust I haven't bored anybody with what I'm speaking of, but it's a long time ago and people have asked me, "How can you remember all of these things so vividly?"</span> <span id="s490">I said, "Well, it only happens to you once in your life time, and you can't forget a thing like that.”</span> <span id="s491">People said has it affected you mentally or otherwise.</span> <span id="s492">I said, "No, I just...just one of those memories that you let go by."</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Appreciate the interview.</span> <span id="s494">You did not bore anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Well, it's my pleasure to be here and anything that I can do to further the movement of the teaching of the Holocaust, I'm happy to do.</span> <span id="s496">I didn't mention this previously, but I was on the State of Ohio Holocaust Commission where we met once a month.</span> <span id="s497">I was there but it was primarily, I think, for educators, because they were working up a curriculum for the schools in the State of Ohio, and it was adopted and we all put a hand to it.</span> <span id="s498">It will now become a part of the educational system in the State of Ohio, the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s499">Which is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: You're most welcome.</span> <span id="s502">My pleasure to be here.</span></p></body></html>
