id="s4">Q: This is Cary Kozberg speaking.</span> <span id="s5">I am conducting the first interview with Mr. Paul Leeser in my office at the Temple.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Leeser lives in Richmond, Indiana.</span> <span id="s7">This is Wednesday afternoon, August 23, 1978.</span> <span id="s8">Mr. Leeser, how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Fifty- seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: In a city in the Rhineland (Germany) called, at that time, Hanborn(spelled by PL).</span> <span id="s12">Today it is a suburb of a larger city called Duisburg (Duisburg is again spelled by PL).</span> <span id="s13">It is called today: “Duisburg-Hanborn.”</span> <span id="s14">They are both in the Rhineland tare?</span> <span id="s15">Part of the German State of Westphalia.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My early years I spent in Hanborn.</span> <span id="s18">I went to school there.</span> <span id="s19">Then, when I was not quite in high school, that was in 1927 or 1928, we left the Rhineland and moved inland because my parents bought a business there.</span> <span id="s20">I continued my education in a little town called Rinteln which is on the Weser River near the town of Hameln in the district of Minden, at the time.</span> <span id="s21">The city, today is in the district of Hanover.</span> <span id="s22">I continued my grade school education there and had my first religious training.</span> <span id="s23">That is religious school and Hebrew school, etc. which in those days was sponsored by the German government and paid for by it.</span> <span id="s24">A rabbi came to the public school where we then had the classes.</span> <span id="s25">After the fourth year, I, like most German children of means did, went to the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s26">I stayed there for five years.</span> <span id="s27">By that time Jewish children could no longer attend school and we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Was this a small town or a rural community or a city?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: It was classified as a city because it was the county seat.</span> <span id="s30">The political subdivision in those days was called Glaftschaft Schaumburg (that is what it sounds like).</span> <span id="s31">We might loosely translate this as the county of Schaumburg.</span> <span id="s32">It actually belonged to the province of Hesse, but it still was a political subdivision of its own.</span> <span id="s33">The city had, maybe 6,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s34">However it was classified as a city, rather than a village because it had most of the government offices.</span> <span id="s35">It was a vacation spot because it was one of the old walled German cities.</span> <span id="s36">We used to play on the city walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Do you know when and how your family came to this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: To Rinteln?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My parents had been married and in business in Hanborn, in the city where I was born.</span> <span id="s41">It was small, even by German standards.</span> <span id="s42">They made a living though.</span> <span id="s43">They got the opportunity to expand, to get into a little venture a larger store with the help of one of my father’s brothers who had his business, a nice going concern in a retail store in Herford (spelled by PL) which is not too far away from the place where my father’s parents lived.</span> <span id="s44">That was Buckenburg (spelled by PL, but not located by transcriber).</span> <span id="s45">Even when we were little in Hanborn, while I was still growing up, we used to visit my grandparents in Buckenburg frequently.</span> <span id="s46">So we knew approximately where Rinteln and Baue were, that means where they were located.</span> <span id="s47">I was really too young to really make the decision.</span> <span id="s48">My brother was still younger.</span> <span id="s49">My parents picked up and went to Rinteln, bought out this store.</span> <span id="s50">We lived in the dwelling behind the store and that started our career in Rinteln and, within a few years we were one of the leading establishments in the dry goods line, ladies coats and children wear, notions, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: How many members were there in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: In my immediate family there were four.</span> <span id="s53">My parents, my brother, and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Your brother’s name was Werner?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And what were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My father’s name was Louis.</span> <span id="s58">My mother’s name was Henrietta.</span> <span id="s59">That was spelled just like the English Henrietta, except that the last letter was an “a”.</span> <span id="s60">I think the English also has an “a”.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Paul is your real name?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">I did not have a middle name.</span> <span id="s64">Jewish kids in Germany had as a rule of not having a middle name.</span> <span id="s65">We had a Jewish name, of course, but it was not used in the everyday world.</span> <span id="s66">My present middle name is Jerome.</span> <span id="s67">I adopted it while I was in the U.S. military service.</span> <span id="s68">I did this mainly under the influence, not actually influence, but as appreciation of a captain who was influential for me.</span> <span id="s69">The captain’s name was Jerome and he said: “You adopt my name or I won’t go with you.”</span> <span id="s70">So I use the “J” as my middle initial.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: When did your family leave Germany?</span> <span id="s72">When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We left and arrived in the U.S. in May 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You said that your parents were selling dry goods?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: What exactly was your education?</span> <span id="s77">Your secondary education?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Starting in Germany it was the usual.</span> <span id="s79">In Germany I believe that there was no choice.</span> <span id="s80">You took everything, at the grade school, in preparation for the secondary school, the gymnasium; which I entered after four years of grade school so in 1931.</span> <span id="s81">There I took the regular pre-college course.</span> <span id="s82">In my case I was interested in chemistry, so I took what was going to, ultimately lead to a college degree in chemistry or chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s83">The courses in the German high school, of course you go to high school much earlier than you do in this country, were all inclusive.</span> <span id="s84">(The school system, even under the Weimar Republic which followed WWI was not uniform throughout Germany.</span> <span id="s85">It depended upon the German state in which you lived).</span> <span id="s86">We studied Latin, starting in our first year, then French, then English.</span> <span id="s87">We started in on the higher levels of mathematics early in the game so that when I arrived in the U.S., it was fairly easy to get into high school here.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Can you tell us about your religious life at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: There is not very much which I remember.</span> <span id="s90">We, that is my brother and I, attended synagogue regularly as far back as I can remember.</span> <span id="s91">Otherwise said we had to attend synagogue when we visited our grandparents.</span> <span id="s92">We had a visiting rabbi.</span> <span id="s93">This rabbi was hired by, and belonged to four or maybe five congregations in the district crossing state and county lines.</span> <span id="s94">His residence was in Obernhirschern (spelled by PL).</span> <span id="s95">It was not exactly centrally located but, by custom, Obernhirschern had been the rabbinical residence for, I would say decades -- otherwise said before I was born.</span> <span id="s96">The rabbi served the cities of Staethagen (spelled by PL) naturally Obernhirschern, the city of Buckenburg, which I mentioned earlier, and Rinteln, where we lived.</span> <span id="s97">His travels were either by train, or if any of the more affluent community members had the time they would take him by car.</span> <span id="s98">More often than not, he traveled with some of his students from city to city by bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you keep kosher in your home?</span> <span id="s100">And observe the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A; No, not kosher, according to the Torah.</span> <span id="s102">My father was brought up in a kosher home; my mother also.</span> <span id="s103">Her father was a butcher.</span> <span id="s104">When his business as a kosher butcher came to an end he took on regular butcher chores.</span> <span id="s105">There he cut off cuts of meat other than things really “treff” (that means those things specifically prescribed), but he did not limit himself to kosher cuts.</span> <span id="s106">My mother ran the house the same way.</span> <span id="s107">She would buy her meats in our little city from any butcher shop, but she stayed away from things considered “treff”.</span> <span id="s108">That means, no loin quarters, no pork.</span> <span id="s109">We didn’t know bacon except in restaurants but at home we had none.</span> <span id="s110">Earlier we attempted, I think, to keep meat and dairy dishes apart but, about the same time as we grew older we no longer practiced having our dishes separated that is what you call “Pesach-dicke” dishes.</span> <span id="s111">(That name comes from the idea that in many Jewish homes, even some who do not practice every day the idea of separating utensils used for meat and those used for dairy products such a separation takes place for the Passover holiday period.</span> <span id="s112">The separation is justified by the idea of not “eating the kid in the milk of his mother”, this is considered as a major religious commandment by many).</span> <span id="s113">We, as a token, still used the matzos (unleavened bread eaten exclusively during Passover).</span> <span id="s114">One of the traditional dishes, in Germany, around Passover, was matzo with warm milk.</span> <span id="s115">To eat that you needed a particularly large cup and everybody had his own.</span> <span id="s116">(It was a breakfast dish) more for utilitarian reasons than for religious ones; however we did not eat strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s117">My mother shuddered every time we went to the butcher shop and the butcher handed her a piece of sausage, she could never be sure of what it contained, but, other than that we had no specifications about eating beef, lamb or veal.</span> <span id="s118">You were talking about religious education, and we got a little sidetracked.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How were the established holidays celebrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: They were not celebrated, so to speak.</span> <span id="s121">On Friday nights we went to temple.</span> <span id="s122">On Saturday mornings we went to temple, or rather synagogue, but that was a chore, but since all our peers went, or were being made to go -- remember that in those days a father’s word was the law -- so you went.</span> <span id="s123">We went particularly later on when it became difficult for the rabbi to proceed unmolested, then my father took over as the rabbi’s stand-in and he conducted the services.</span> <span id="s124">When my father had to be on the pulpit, we better attended services or else!</span> <span id="s125">I can’t even imagine what the “or else” would have been.</span> <span id="s126">Even though we might be unwilling to go because there might be a football or a soccer game in which we would like to play, or some other important event we went every Friday night and every Saturday and all the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Did your father always lead the services?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No.</span> <span id="s129">I followed the service when I was able.</span> <span id="s130">You see the services were entirely in Hebrew, except for the sermon, and my father did not give a sermon, when there was no rabbi, but another member of the congregation was asked to do so by my father.</span> <span id="s131">We were sometimes put on the spot when my father asked one of the older boys to talk about something for five minutes.</span> <span id="s132">It was always embarrassing and the boys were hoping for the rabbi not to put them on the spot.</span> <span id="s133">(In Europe, as a contrast to the U.S., children received very little instruction and experience in talking up in a formal way when there were adults there).</span> <span id="s134">We had to do that without preparation, so otherwise we never got to lead the service, so I never learned and never could step into my father’s shoes and lead the davening (praying).</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: You and your brother were Barmitzvahed (the Jewish religious ceremony held when a boy was about 13 years of age to signify that he counted as a full member).</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: That was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: That was in Germany.</span> <span id="s139">My Barmitzvah took place in the city (Herford) where my uncle lived, and about which I talked.</span> <span id="s140">My cousin Hans was one month younger than I, but we had our bar mitzvah instructions together in Herford.</span> <span id="s141">I received my bar mitzvah instructions from our rabbi, until maybe one week before the big event, then we had a dual Barmitzvah.</span> <span id="s142">(It is traditional that, for the ceremony, the 13 year old to conduct most of the Saturday morning service.</span> <span id="s143">This means that the two cousins conducted jointly).</span> <span id="s144">In Herford.</span> <span id="s145">My brother’s Barmitzvah took place the following year.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Was German the principle language spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did your parents speak any other language?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No!</span> <span id="s150">They spoke a little broken French, because my mother had been brought up near Cologne, and that was close enough to the borders so that French was known.</span> <span id="s151">They knew a little bit of the Teutonic Hebrew.</span> <span id="s152">Just like in other ethnic languages, you know a few words which you can use for idiomatic messages, for example, the Hebrew alphabet was used to mark the wholesale prices on goods.</span> <span id="s153">They did not use the Hebrew letters, because that would have been too obvious but they rather used their German equivalents.</span> <span id="s154">There were certain Hebrew expressions used in business to denote, for instance; that you had to be silent on the subject: “Don’t speak!”</span> <span id="s155">; “The man is a crook!”</span> <span id="s156">I don’t recall all of them because it is a while since I put them all down.</span> <span id="s157">There were names like a “Ganeff!”</span> <span id="s158">(a thief or crook), “Beneven”, “Spieken” which I don’t even know what they mean, probably in Hebrew it means: “Be quiet, don’t speak!”</span> <span id="s159">I still recall that there were rather few expressions from the Hebrew, which got into every day conversation, but they did not speak the language (obviously meaning Yiddish) as a conversational language.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did you think of yourselves as rich or poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Today, when I look back, we must have been, if not rich, then very upper class.</span> <span id="s162">While we were there, however we never considered ourselves as rich because most of our peers were able to do the same thing we did.</span> <span id="s163">We knew some poor people who had nothing, but the idea of being rich never entered our minds, however we must have been fairly well to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Did your parents associate with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">Most of their social contacts were Jews, but we did have quite a few real non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: To what extent did they associate with non-Jews outside of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: There were a few members of my father’s bowling team.</span> <span id="s169">There was one non-Jew in his Skat (that was a card game played pretty much all over Germany, but only Germany) playing group.</span> <span id="s170">They used to get together once a week and played this pretty well known European card game.</span> <span id="s171">There were some non-Jews they went on excursions with us.</span> <span id="s172">These excursions meant that you packed a rucksack and you went hiking through the mountains and through the hills to some nearby resort.</span> <span id="s173">As I recall there were quite a few non-Jewish families, including children on those hikes with us.</span> <span id="s174">The parties, as you call them, where people were invited over to the house on special occasions such as high holidays and birthdays consisted mostly of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What other types of recreational or educational activities did your family engage in?</span> <span id="s176">I mean such things as theaters or politics or music, either in or out of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Attendance at movies or the theater was more on an individual basis.</span> <span id="s178">We were in mixed company there.</span> <span id="s179">In a little town, everybody there were mostly non-Jews, because that was population wise.</span> <span id="s180">For theaters, we had nothing locally.</span> <span id="s181">If you went away and could go to one of the nearby bigger cities, where they had theaters and operas.</span> <span id="s182">There they usually went alone or with the family or if we did go with close friends they were usually Jewish.</span> <span id="s183">Just because they happened to be friends.</span> <span id="s184">My parents were interested in the theater.</span> <span id="s185">My mother was an opera buff from way back, when she was a little girl, however their attendance at these functions was limited because of distances.</span> <span id="s186">The closest grand opera was in Hanover.</span> <span id="s187">They put on their own shows at the Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s188">My mother was always one of the writers and instigators and the main actors, but that drew only Jewish public.</span> <span id="s189">Concerning other educational things; no!</span> <span id="s190">My parents were too busy to participate.</span> <span id="s191">My brother and I had to attend the gymnasium and it wasn’t until much later in the Hitler period that we were given private instruction in Hebrew, English and how to cope with foreign countries.</span> <span id="s192">During our early adolescence we participated in regular sports which took place after school.</span> <span id="s193">We usually played with a mostly pickup team; we didn’t even have any questions of; are you or are you not a Jew.</span> <span id="s194">We were very proud of the fact that one of the players on our city’s soccer team was a Jew.</span> <span id="s195">We made the most of it.</span> <span id="s196">When Hitler first came in with his propaganda, we attended sports contests, but these were under Jewish auspices, and for these we had to go out of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: You mentioned the fact that you attended synagogue regularly.</span> <span id="s198">To what extent, really did the synagogue play a role in terms of other activities?</span> <span id="s199">Was it the center of Jewish life?</span> <span id="s200">Were there other Jewish activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: It was a way of life.</span> <span id="s202">Actually to us Sunday school meant more.</span> <span id="s203">It was a little bit of an adventure.</span> <span id="s204">It was something we enjoyed to be able to get about to the town, wherever it was held.</span> <span id="s205">Religious school day was one day a week.</span> <span id="s206">Later on when we went to high school (to the gymnasium) that went by the wayside.</span> <span id="s207">In order to attend Sunday school we bicycled to one of the four cities and we took turns.</span> <span id="s208">Staethagen was a little too far away so we agreed that we were not going to have Sunday school in that city.</span> <span id="s209">Rinteln was nice for the kids to get to by a nice bicycle distance but as time went by, about the time we started Barmitzvah lessons, most of our Sunday school meetings were in Buckenburg because they had the biggest synagogue with the nicest accommodations for several school classes.</span> <span id="s210">Then everybody from the surrounding cities went there by bicycle except that sometimes their parents took them to Buckenburg every Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s211">It was nice.</span> <span id="s212">We met other Jewish kids, we made friends with other Jewish boys and girls.</span> <span id="s213">The parents condoned this.</span> <span id="s214">The kids got along together well.</span> <span id="s215">Once a year there was a party for all the students and the pre-students at the rabbi’s residence in Obernhirschern.</span> <span id="s216">It could have taken place around one of the high holidays, probably Sukkot (that is the early fall harvesting festival when Jews build an outdoor open air shelter with clear view of the stars, taking place ten days after Yom Kippur, when apple and nuts are shared by all) maybe it was Shavuot (that is the early summer festival when today Confirmation takes place).</span> <span id="s217">Well, all the kids were at the rabbi’s residence, in the garden.</span> <span id="s218">I still have some photographs left of these parties.</span> <span id="s219">This was what made the kids want to get together, rather than the religious services.</span> <span id="s220">Now religious services to a nine or ten or eleven year old is, even today, a bore.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: It was the social aspect which really attracted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: It was the social aspect which made me realize that this is a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: It is difficult to pin a name on that.</span> <span id="s225">It was strictly normal until we got old enough to know what the Hitler business is all about.</span> <span id="s226">The excitement of our parents when the pre-election campaign was taking place.</span> <span id="s227">The pre-election campaign was conducted with big placards.</span> <span id="s228">List No. 32, I remember was a bad sign that Hitler was coming into the program.</span> <span id="s229">It was at that time that we first saw the anti-Semitic posters.</span> <span id="s230">The faces on the placards of the so0called Jewish stereotypes, they were later regularly publicized by the Nazis (the National Socialist Party, the party organized and headed by Adolf Hitler) party paper the “Sturmer” (translates as one who assaults) as the one was called, and the other one was called: “der Volkischer Beobackter (translates as the “People’s Observer”).</span> <span id="s231">Loosely translated it means the “People’s Watch” or maybe the “National Observer” would be close to it.</span> <span id="s232">Jews in our area did not ever subscribe to the “National Observer” here, they remembered it well what that meant, during our growing up time.</span> <span id="s233">Altogether we had a generally normal childhood.</span> <span id="s234">Some people were affluent.</span> <span id="s235">I thought that we were somewhat affluent.</span> <span id="s236">We could afford to go on a vacation every year.</span> <span id="s237">My parents were too busy in the store so they could never go on a vacation together.</span> <span id="s238">We, as boys, never questioned that.</span> <span id="s239">My mother on her vacation went with relatives, usually with my father’s brother’s family to whom we were the closest, both socially and geographically.</span> <span id="s240">When she came back, my father, my brother and I took off on our vacation.</span> <span id="s241">It might be just a bicycle tour which was a big adventure or we went to one of the more lush North Sea resorts and had a ball with my father.</span> <span id="s242">A few times our parents sent us to a Jewish children’s camp also at a North Sea resort, one which I recall was on the Island of Fohr (Pl spells the name of the island as Foehr but the atlas locates the island of Fohr and does not locate an island with the other spelling) in a city called Wyk (PL spells the name of the city as Wyek but the atlas locates the city of Wyk auf Fohr and does not locate a city with the other spelling).</span> <span id="s243">This was a fairly expensive Jewish children’s camp.</span> <span id="s244">Another time we went to a relatively inexpensive Jewish children’s camp where they wanted to bring country children to the big city and the encampment was in a large Jewish orphanage in the city of Hanover.</span> <span id="s245">My brother and I realized mostly that parents had to have a little money for this sort of thing but we appreciated it and remember things today.</span> <span id="s246">We did not realize that we had a hard time until after the Hitler years, approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Do you recall any other special events from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, events like my Barmitzvah and my brother’s Barmitzvah, other events like the death of my maternal grandfather.</span> <span id="s249">The funeral of my maternal grandfather is the first Jewish funeral I ever attended.</span> <span id="s250">For other special things I would have to sit and think for a while, your memories don’t come back at a moment’s notice, but there must have been some other special events.</span> <span id="s251">We were sent off to spend the summer with an aunt in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s252">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s253">She wanted some nieces and nephews.</span> <span id="s254">She was an unmarried lady and I spent some time there with a girl cousin.</span> <span id="s255">I got my first sex education from her.</span> <span id="s256">I must have been maybe 11 at the time.</span> <span id="s257">You know what selections there are but no really outstanding events, but wedding anniversaries of my parents, plays which we gave for Chanukah (festival of lights which occurs about Christmas time and which indicates the rededication of the Temple by the Maccabean warriors).</span> <span id="s258">Then the kids presented something.</span> <span id="s259">The older ladies of the community, we considered them older ladies, but they were probably 21 or 22 years old, wrote the script and built the scenery.</span> <span id="s260">There are things you can remember but nothing earth shaking and outstanding.</span> <span id="s261">Things you can talk about every now and then with those people who participated, but they really have no bearing on the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: You say that you attended a secular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: With Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And that your religious education was during school hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No, that was after the regular school hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: How many days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: One day and we had to take tests and pass them.</span> <span id="s270">On all our report cards there is a subject called “Religion”.</span> <span id="s271">If you did not pass your “Religion” then you got a failing grade and a “U”, and if you did you might fail the entire year.</span> <span id="s272">So there was always some negotiating going on with the rabbi, if you were, for instance, particularly bad in “beginning Hebrew”.</span> <span id="s273">The rabbi was involved with the grades, during the first four years of school.</span> <span id="s274">Children who did not go to the higher school, to the high school, to the lyceum or to the gymnasium, after the first four years of school had to continue religious training and remain in the public school system until they graduated, after eight years.</span> <span id="s275">However when you were released from there to go to the high school, then it was up to the parent to see that you kept your religious instruction up.</span> <span id="s276">When you left the public school system and went to the high school, education was no longer free.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What subjects did they start to teach you in religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: It is too long ago to really remember but I know that what we call here (transcriber can not understand the name of the subject) was taught.</span> <span id="s279">We learned a lot of history, that is not necessarily mythology, but the Biblical stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: The midrash?</span> <span id="s281">(That is the rabbinical explanations of the Hebrew Scriptures, the so-called oral tradition).</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Right!</span> <span id="s283">Exactly from the midrash, the Purim story.</span> <span id="s284">The Megillah (a scroll, especially one containing the Book of Esther, or of Ecclesiastes, the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Ruth -- but generally, without added explanations refers to the Book of Esther) was one of the things he taught us.</span> <span id="s285">Naturally everything was taught to us in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: German was used in both religious and secular education?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s288">That was the principal language.</span> <span id="s289">There were no Yiddish speaking people who lived there.</span> <span id="s290">Well, I correct that.</span> <span id="s291">There were some whom lived there, but, because of fairly stupid prejudice, the Eastern Jews, who could speak Yiddish, hid that fact.</span> <span id="s292">They did not want it to be known.</span> <span id="s293">So, German, High German, was taught in all classes and the Hebrew instructions naturally were also in German.</span> <span id="s294">In those days it was still practiced that a student had to learn a passage from the Hebrew text, word by word.</span> <span id="s295">Whether one was able to sit down and read a sentence in Hebrew and give the meaning in German was not considered.</span> <span id="s296">No, one had to know it word for word.</span> <span id="s297">The vocabulary we practiced was just like that of any other foreign language.</span> <span id="s298">We had a sheet of Hebrew words in alphabetical order, then you covered the German equivalent with a sheet of paper, then you studied each word.</span> <span id="s299">Later your parents finally asked you the same words out of sequence, and you had to know them.</span> <span id="s300">I think that the teacher thought it best that when you studied Hebrew you learned it word for word.</span> <span id="s301">Then of course when you said the sentence, it didn’t make much sense and we had to put it back in the correct grammatical order, to give it meaning in German.</span> <span id="s302">That way you learned words.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Was there anything like a Jewish day school?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Not available!</span> <span id="s305">There was none available to us.</span> <span id="s306">The closest school which I can remember was in Hanover.</span> <span id="s307">There was one in Bielefeld (spelled by PL) which was to the west of us in Westphalia, which could have been reached.</span> <span id="s308">Naturally there were yeshivas (Jewish schools) in large cities like Cologne, Berlin and Frankfurt on the Main, but they were out of range.</span> <span id="s309">I would like to backtrack here.</span> <span id="s310">My mother’s basic education was in a religious school in Cologne.</span> <span id="s311">She went there for, I believe, eight years.</span> <span id="s312">In her particular surrounding, in the city of Cologne, that was the normal thing to do.</span> <span id="s313">Jewish kids went to the Jewish school and the Catholic kids went to a Catholic school, and what the Protestant kids did that didn’t make a difference (transcriber attended primary school in a small town in the Rhineland area where the only public school which existed in town, and to which one had to go, was a Catholic and Protestant Parochial school.</span> <span id="s314">All the Jewish kids went to the Protestant school).</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: To what extent did you associate with non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: To a large extent.</span> <span id="s317">Most of our social contacts, you see we were too young to really date or to have girlfriends, as a matter of fact we were in the age where you went to great distances to keep away from saying this girl or that girl was your girlfriend.</span> <span id="s318">Our association was mostly with non-Jews, but we did have a youth group in an embryonic form.</span> <span id="s319">We used to get together for particular reasons, when that was called for, in addition to being together on Sundays for religious studies.</span> <span id="s320">We had, for instance a ping-pong club that was a real saving later on, when we were ostracized from the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s321">This ping-pong club consisted of only Jews and I still have, in my diary the place where we used to meet at individual people’s home, just by having our ping-pong games there.</span> <span id="s322">However the other sports in which we participated such as soccer we, by force, had to participate with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s323">Swimming was a big thing.</span> <span id="s324">We had to have swimming training.</span> <span id="s325">We got a certificate as a “Free Swimmer” which entitled you to swim without requiring supervision in the big river.</span> <span id="s326">You had to pass tests to show that you could swim but many Jewish kids passed.</span> <span id="s327">There may have been one or two who took classes but most of them had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Were you invited into the homes of non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Very often.</span> <span id="s330">Religion, in the pre-Hitler days did not become an issue.</span> <span id="s331">Maybe, from the standpoint of interest sometimes they wanted to know for instance what holidays it was for us, to get a passing mark in their religious subject because some of them came from a gentile community and did not pass their religion course and had to pass make-up tests afterwards.</span> <span id="s332">So they found a Jewish kid to compare religions and find out that our religion was equal to theirs.</span> <span id="s333">You know, there was nothing anti-Semitic about it, it was just a matter of interest and the question did not come up very often.</span> <span id="s334">They all knew, in our little town, that we went to religious services on Friday nights and on Saturday mornings and that they went on Sundays.</span> <span id="s335">They accepted that fact and we grew up without any personal hard feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Before the Nazi (National Socialist Party, which was the party led by Adolf Hitler) occupation (there was no Nazi occupation when Hitler was appointed German Chancellor and the legislature, i.e. the Reichstag, approved him he was the leader of Germany), i.e. the Nazi coming to power, to what degree was there anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No!</span> <span id="s338">No!</span> <span id="s339">Only from remarks our parents made did we know anything about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s340">There was some anti-Semitism because of business competition.</span> <span id="s341">We knew the word anti-Semite (said in German and English by PL) early in the game.</span> <span id="s342">We heard it used around the house.</span> <span id="s343">We heard about it from people, other than Hitler, we learned about it in religious school that there had been anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s344">Roman Emperor Titan and others were some.</span> <span id="s345">The rabbi talked about Haman.</span> <span id="s346">He mentioned other names of famous anti-Semites.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: German anti-Semites?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yes, German anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s349">We were taught things such as that one of the biggest friends of the Jews was Frederick the Great, who made it possible for Jews to be accepted in some of the professions and the businesses.</span> <span id="s350">He was not successful in allowing the Jews to become farmers.</span> <span id="s351">I recall the remarks of the rabbi who taught us this particular lesson: he said that the blame was not with the king but with the Jews themselves who, by that time, were making a good living in other professions and did mot want to regress and become farmers.</span> <span id="s352">Those who had a chance to live in the country were picked as cattle dealers and that was an entirely different profession then.</span> <span id="s353">However at the time when we were taught the term of cattle dealer had already a little derogatory meaning and was used as anti-Semitic propaganda.</span> <span id="s354">Cattle dealers were practically exclusively Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Do you recall any incidents of anti-Semitism in your school or community or the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Not prior to Hitler although the Jews were victims of the propaganda machine.</span> <span id="s357">However long before that my parents talked about anti-Semitic remarks by a firm or outfit with particularly anti-Semitic bias against hiring Jews, but no real outstanding examples.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How did they deal with that practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: They were very quiet about it, they felt that we always have some hate mongers and don’t get excited about it.</span> <span id="s360">Generally, my mother always saw black in everything that happened.</span> <span id="s361">She saw herself and the family threatened.</span> <span id="s362">She would like to taker legal action or illegal means to defend herself.</span> <span id="s363">She usually calmed down and would get talked out of it by my father, who was more calm and quieting.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Were your neighbors the same way?</span> <span id="s365">I mean were they both Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: As a rule they talked about the anti-Semitic elements as being idiots and that with despicable elements around this was something to be expected.</span> <span id="s367">There were people who didn’t know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Did you ever, or do you know if your family ever spoke about anti-Semitism to gentile associates?</span> <span id="s369">And if so, what their reactions were?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The subject came up in conversations.</span> <span id="s371">It was always treated lightly, like something you might want to talk about, something unimportant.</span> <span id="s372">It was taken like anti-religious remarks by anybody would have been.</span> <span id="s373">Like expressions such as, you know: “The Pope is a Bastard!”</span> <span id="s374">which obviously would rub the Catholics the wrong way.</span> <span id="s375">My mother used to get livid., if someone did that.</span> <span id="s376">A little German anti-Semitic song which the kids used to sing did that to her.</span> <span id="s377">I remember the little teasing song in German which translated something like the “hep-hep-hep” slogans here, which used to be anti-Semitic slogans before WWI; you may have heard them.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Can you tell us a little more about them?</span> <span id="s379">Such as why were they anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Because they were taken as such by the Jews.</span> <span id="s381">These had the effect on my mother and her peers who were sensitized to it, as if you were called a “kike!”</span> <span id="s382">The verses of the limerick went something like: “Jude, Jude, Jude.</span> <span id="s383">Hep, Hep, Hep, Steck dein Kopf in ein Wasserscheck!”</span> <span id="s384">It was something of the dialect of Cologne but freely translated into “Jewboy, Jewboy, Jewboy, Kike, Kike, Kike, Stick your head in a water basin!”</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Something like “Go soak your head.”</span> <span id="s386">(Actually it meant more like “Drown yourself”).</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, go soak your head would be good.</span> <span id="s388">It continued, but I don’t remember the lines anymore, but something like: “When you die you will get buried in a moduling box.”</span> <span id="s389">You can guess what the thing looked like; however it was a kid’s rhyme.</span> <span id="s390">That is one which my mother used to tell me they used to sing to them when they went to school.</span> <span id="s391">They got even with the gentiles and used to say it in rhyme.</span> <span id="s392">Some of the incidents like that happened to show that anti-Semitism existed.</span> <span id="s393">However, my question is: “Was it really anti-Semitism or was it just a nursery rhyme which the kids used to say, you know kids teasing each other?”</span> <span id="s394">Kids are cruel.</span> <span id="s395">I don’t know whether these kids who used to sing the ditty when they saw Jewish kids, grew up as anti-Semites or got to be Nazis.</span> <span id="s396">They may just have said it but they had learned it somewhere.</span> <span id="s397">However to her dying day I will remember that “Hep” ditty.</span> <span id="s398">It would always get my mother aroused, you know angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did you get any of this personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No!</span> <span id="s401">No!</span> <span id="s402">When anti-Semitism came there were other ways.</span> <span id="s403">“Hep!</span> <span id="s404">Hep!</span> <span id="s405">Hep!”</span> <span id="s406">had disappeared.</span> <span id="s407">Just like on the American scene, calling people “Hamon”, “Kike” and so forth.</span> <span id="s408">No, the words got worse.</span> <span id="s409">They had more contemporary meanings than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Do you recall when your town in Germany was occupied by the Nazis?</span> <span id="s411">When that came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: It was a gradual thing.</span> <span id="s413">(There was no occupation as such.</span> <span id="s414">In 1933 Hitler was called on to form a government for the Weimar Republic under President Hindenburg, when he was able to get a majority of votes in the Reichstag ,he German Parliament.</span> <span id="s415">Then all the other private armies became illegal and Hitler’s people were used as auxiliary police and even soldiers).</span> <span id="s416">We were too young to really follow all the vying for power per se.</span> <span id="s417">There was the Putch in Munich (On November 8, 1923 Hitler attempted a coup d’etat in Bavaria with himself a Chancellor and General Ludendorf as Dictator.</span> <span id="s418">The coup failed and Hitler went to prison after that he gradually built up the strength of his party).</span> <span id="s419">We were told about that.</span> <span id="s420">A lot of Jews thought that was something to talk about (as early as 1920 Hitler had denounced the Jews); but they never thought that something would come of it.</span> <span id="s421">The first scare, so to speak, we got from the reaction of the adults was when the Nazi party (These were the letters which identified the party led by Hitler) got into (by the number of members voted into seats in the Reichstag) into the number two position.</span> <span id="s422">Then in the next election (in July 1932) they were number one.</span> <span id="s423">The realization that we were going to be persecuted came about slowly.</span> <span id="s424">The first incident was when the Nazis arrested a member of the Jewish community of Rinteln, a barber by the name of Maas (spelled by PL) He was a member of the Jewish community but had married a gentile.</span> <span id="s425">His wife participated in Jewish affairs, considered herself a member but had never converted.</span> <span id="s426">They did not have children.</span> <span id="s427">It was rather a sensation amongst the younger set to talk about things like that, when we found out why the Nazis arrested this man.</span> <span id="s428">He had apparently molested a nine- year old gentile girl in a Passover incident.</span> <span id="s429">He was arrested but, after being tried locally he disappeared.</span> <span id="s430">Now, later on it was being picked on for several reasons.</span> <span id="s431">One of the biggest Nazis in town was also a barber by the name of Stroehl (spelled by PL).</span> <span id="s432">This man was a leader in the anti-Semitic action and later on he was the guy who took pictures of people who went into my parent’s store.</span> <span id="s433">Then of course there was a little plaque which was marked “Franz Stroehl, the barber replaces Maas the barber” and said that he was to get rid of this man.</span> <span id="s434">That was the first time, I think, that we heard about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s435">Maas’ wife was distraught.</span> <span id="s436">There was no word of communication.</span> <span id="s437">She didn’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s438">He just disappeared.</span> <span id="s439">The local police got to be uncooperative and told her not to bother them, that if she did she would be punished, that her husband was a criminal.</span> <span id="s440">Then they added: “You are not Jewish, how come?”</span> <span id="s441">The man just disappeared and then the community as such, was told about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s442">The second thing which bothered us was as youngsters came from the Nazi party not only anti-Semitism was the Hitler Youth Movement (the movement organized by the Nazis into which all “Aryan” youth were expected to go and which was the training ground for all future party recruits) which some of our best friends had to join.</span> <span id="s443">In the so- called “Hitler Jugend” (translates into Hitler Youth) they got to wear uniforms and got demerits or get dressed down because they socialized with Jews, if they did.</span> <span id="s444">They freely used to tell us that they are sorry, but the Gauleitung (the county leadership for the Nazis) had left directions for their youth group leaders that they were instructed that they could not associate with Jews (that was particularly easy to enforce in small communities where everyone was known).</span> <span id="s445">Kids, at that time weren’t even given a reason just that they are a lower type of life, that they had been misled (into formerly associating with Jews) that (Jews) have all nasty characteristics and that Adolf Hitler had pointed it out to them.</span> <span id="s446">Goebbels told them how bad the Jewish influence was for them.</span> <span id="s447">In order to be left out of things and not to be demoted or get demerits they would have to stop playing with us.</span> <span id="s448">However the thing which bothered us was when our parents told us where some of their gentile peers had been arrested and taken away or were arrested and fined -- even given prison sentences because their children had informed on them.</span> <span id="s449">The way we heard the stories was that the parents had made some anti-Nazi remark; maybe threatening; maybe just joking; that the kids had then told their youth leaders about this.</span> <span id="s450">It got to the authorities and the parents got picked up as anti-social, a euphemism for non-Germans.</span> <span id="s451">some of them who were not Jewish also disappeared, at least for a while.</span> <span id="s452">When they came back they had horror stories to tell about what they saw in these concentration camps, until they were released again.</span> <span id="s453">This used to bother us.</span> <span id="s454">We were afraid that if we made any remarks about Hitler being a low lifer, or cussed him with what we knew in Hebrew and in German and it got reported, that we would get into trouble.</span> <span id="s455">The next thing was that we were not allowed to go swimming either in the public pool, or in the river accompanied by non-Jewish children.</span> <span id="s456">Later on we were not allowed in at all.</span> <span id="s457">They put on signs reading “Juden sind hier unerwunscht” meaning “Jews are not wanted here” at gates and other critical places.</span> <span id="s458">I don’t know if they felt that we would pollute the water.</span> <span id="s459">Now, this was the start and also the estrangement from our soccer teams was hard to take.</span> <span id="s460">We still used to play.</span> <span id="s461">Again we rationalized that my brother and I used to win a couple of soccer balls.</span> <span id="s462">They were wanted items since not everyone had one and if we didn’t show up with our equipment they had to wait around until somebody found a ball; but as time progressed that was enough of an excuse anymore and we just weren’t allowed on the public playing fields.</span> <span id="s463">We were no longer allowed to participate in sports.</span> <span id="s464">Then we joined a Jewish sports team.</span> <span id="s465">That involved quite a bit of traveling to get to the place where we could play, where Jewish men and boys were numerous enough to form a team.</span> <span id="s466">We had to go to Hanover which was a half -day’s ride by bicycle or to Minden which was only a three- hour ride.</span> <span id="s467">However I did join a soccer team in Minden while I was still in high school.</span> <span id="s468">Most of the piece- by- piece arrival of the anti-Semitic movement is pretty well known, but to us children it was a gradual thing.</span> <span id="s469">It was one event after another.</span> <span id="s470">The time came when the Nazis made a ruling that only the children of Jewish war veterans were permitted in high school.</span> <span id="s471">So my brother and I could continue because our father had his discharge papers and all kinds of records from the German armed forces from WWI.</span> <span id="s472">Then came the point where they added other requirements, not this varied from locality to locality but in the Hanover-Minden district the high school enforced it this way that you could attend high school if your father had been a WWI veteran but only to the point that the number of Jews did not exceed one percent of the total high school population.</span> <span id="s473">It did come down to the point where either my brother or I had to quit because in those days there were no other Jewish boys who were attending our particular high school.</span> <span id="s474">There were girls in the two parts of the high school of which one was the gymnasium and the other was the lyceum…the two were separate.</span> <span id="s475">In the lyceum there were some girls.</span> <span id="s476">One family had at least three.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Can you tell us a little about what you were mentioning before, about the campaign when Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s478">Can you speak to that?</span> <span id="s479">How the election took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s481">There was radio and there were newspaper advertisements.</span> <span id="s482">At the time anti-Semitism wasn’t the main issue in this campaign although it was there.</span> <span id="s483">However the slogan: “Die Juden, die sind unser Ungluek!”</span> <span id="s484">meaning: “The Jews are our misfortune,” was utilized, as I mentioned earlier but his main campaign was on getting jobs, getting people to go back to work and “Getting the bastards out of Politics!</span> <span id="s485">Get the foreigners out of the country!”</span> <span id="s486">(Also it was a virulently anti-communist campaign.</span> <span id="s487">The private armies of the Stahlhelms -- a rightist party which used the steel hats of the militarists as a symbol and who, in 1933, allied themselves to the Nazis -- the Nazis, the Communists and others were parading and fighting in the streets during the campaign) Hitler was going to save the country by going back into hyperinflation.</span> <span id="s488">His campaign was conducted by people who even hadn’t joined the party.</span> <span id="s489">But, by the looks of things, it was a fairly conducted political campaign; no strong-arm tactics that we noted (that however was not the case all over Germany, but strong arm tactics were used by the several private armies, not only the Nazis) just propaganda such as making promised to the people who were all afraid of starving to death, of losing their jobs, of the country quickly going down the hill.</span> <span id="s490">I was really a little young to pay attention to everything, but I remember from those advertising they were not even so obnoxious.</span> <span id="s491">My mother was very concerned because the anti-Semitic foundation was there.</span> <span id="s492">It didn’t affect anybody personally, but still all that campaigning -- radio was in its big day then -- the newspaper ads were visible, but the main thing were the parades with the banners.</span> <span id="s493">The people who were going to vote for the Nazi party had banners which proclaimed that they were going to see that Germany was going to be a big power again, that everybody had a job, that everybody could buy an automobile (around 1930 automobiles were not plentiful and to own a private car used only for pleasure or for going back and forth to work was the height of luxury in Europe) that everybody would have a radio -- there was no television yet, not even telephones in every residence.</span> <span id="s494">The other parties especially the Social Democrats (a central party) countered them with equal promises.</span> <span id="s495">It was these economic promises which probably swayed most of the people to vote for the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: So the general vacation was what?</span> <span id="s497">Were the people enthusiastic?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yes, most of the people, as far as I can remember, were.</span> <span id="s499">When we said, “We don’t like them, because they are going to throw all the Jews out!”</span> <span id="s500">They didn’t want to know about that or hear about that.</span> <span id="s501">They said that it was a lot of “Quatch’ (the German expression meaning “nonsense”) that it is just a sideline, that one should pay attention to the main thing such that they were all going to be made healthy and wealthy and that they are going to make it so that Germany would amount to something.</span> <span id="s502">The children forgot what happened in WWI and in the occupation of the Rhineland and all that nationalistic stuff.</span> <span id="s503">The propaganda was particularly aimed at a nationalistic field originally.</span> <span id="s504">Germany was going to be superior and initially it was catching, but there was no distinction made between Germans of any particular racial background or religious persuasion, not then!</span> <span id="s505">It was only alarmists, such as my mother, who could see the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s506">By all means, she was propagandizing against voting for the Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: She did so publicly?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes, she did talk in the store.</span> <span id="s509">Some friends told her after a while that she had to cut that out when they did come to power because, it would lead to trouble.</span> <span id="s510">However during the campaigning she was a star public campaigner for the Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s511">She addressed people, she wrote some funny poems about the coming of the Nazis, because it should be avoided.</span> <span id="s512">They were used at Jewish gatherings.</span> <span id="s513">I don’t know anymore exactly where.</span> <span id="s514">One time she addressed a local meeting of the RJF, which means the Reichsband Judischer Frontsoldaten, the German state society of Jewish soldiers who had served on the front.</span> <span id="s515">This was a fairly large organization of which my father was secretary-treasurer of the local organization.</span> <span id="s516">The area for the local organization encompassed the same five cities which I mentioned before, when I talked about the rabbi.</span> <span id="s517">My mother addressed the local meeting of this organization concerning the danger of the coming of the Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: What were these placards?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: They were cases of Jewish caricatures.</span> <span id="s520">The long nose, the baldy head, the bulging eyes, it got to be the stereotype of what a Jew looks like in color cartoons, with slogans written underneath, such as: “They are the people that starve you!”</span> <span id="s521">“They are the people who have all the money in the country” “They are the ones who influence all the foreign countries to be anti-German!”</span> <span id="s522">“They are the criminals!”</span> <span id="s523">If you were not Jewish maybe you didn’t pay much attention to it but it hurt even the kids to see things like that on banners carried around during a parade.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: What was the reaction by your friends and peers?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Most of them were sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: To the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No!</span> <span id="s528">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Against the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yes, against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s531">Because of their parents they probably believed some of the things which the Nazis promised.</span> <span id="s532">However they were sympathetic enough so that they could play with us.</span> <span id="s533">Sometimes they looked sheepish, however it was the same story after the war.</span> <span id="s534">Then it was like a bunch of sheep.</span> <span id="s535">They said: “We had to!”</span> <span id="s536">“Remember we were not allowed to talk back!”</span> <span id="s537">“You know that if I tell them that you are my friend I will be ostracized!”</span> <span id="s538">“I can’t participate in the party’s sports!”</span> <span id="s539">They were apologetic.</span> <span id="s540">However there wasn’t any element around, at least to our knowledge, there may have been some opposition people, of course there were, who truly spoke up.</span> <span id="s541">However the people were mostly apologetic.</span> <span id="s542">There were a few who got to be out and out bad people, who enjoyed this Jew-baiting bit.</span> <span id="s543">The son of a doctor who moved across the street from us sent several messages to me that if he and his friends would ever see me swimming in the river again they would drown me.</span> <span id="s544">He got to be a captain, or at least somewhat higher up in the youth organization.</span> <span id="s545">He felt his oats and let it be known that he was a toughy.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Had he been a friend of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Oh yes, a good friend.</span> <span id="s548">He had been the guy who studied with me, and who during the summers and in school had been my special friend, but he swung exactly the other way and then enjoyed being a Jew baiter.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What was your reaction to this switch?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Mostly hatred.</span> <span id="s551">In those days I would have gladly beat him up, particularly when his messages came through that he was better than I -- you know all the nasty things he could say about Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s552">There still were enough people on my side that if there had been fisticuffs he would probably have gotten the worst of it.</span> <span id="s553">Later on it became silly to think about that because there were too many like him who were forced into it or who maybe, really enjoyed the feeling of superiority.</span> <span id="s554">However he was the first one and I remember his name.</span> <span id="s555">his father was the family physician of us kids.</span> <span id="s556">His name was Kufenberg.</span> <span id="s557">His first name was Berndt (spelled by PL).</span> <span id="s558">I tried to look him up during the war but he wasn’t around, he may have been a war victim.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: How did the Nazi coming to power affect your everyday life in more detail, for example in school, shopping, your religious life and business for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Let me see how much I can recall.</span> <span id="s561">First of all the religious training in the school had stopped for the younger kids.</span> <span id="s562">I was already out of the lower grades.</span> <span id="s563">They could have no religious training anymore.</span> <span id="s564">We could not participate in public sports, as I have stated.</span> <span id="s565">That came about gradually.</span> <span id="s566">Initially we were allowed to have Jewish clubs, Jewish groups, and so forth, which we did.</span> <span id="s567">The attacks became more vicious.</span> <span id="s568">I mentioned the fact that the barber by the name of Stroehl who was one of the party leaders, he was in charge of the little black box where all the criminals, you know the prostitutes, the no gooders, the pimps, etc. were displayed.</span> <span id="s569">He had taken photographs of customers entering the store and put them into the black box and said: “The party will take proper action concerning these Jew lovers!”</span> <span id="s570">Initially nobody thought that anything could happen.</span> <span id="s571">Then it got to the point where people got afraid to go in and there was a boycott.</span> <span id="s572">(Early in the Nazi rule of Germany on April 1, 1933, there was a one day boycott of all Jewish stores set up by the government and enforced by armed Nazi storm troopers being stationed at all doors) when people were fairly afraid to come into the store.</span> <span id="s573">My parents were fairly well known in the vicinity; if we went and ate in a restaurant and there happened to be some of the especially younger, party members present they made anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s574">There was no direct aggression.</span> <span id="s575">There were words which you heard but wished you didn’t.</span> <span id="s576">They went far in public in order to annoy you.</span> <span id="s577">Business suffered to the point where our parents were mot operating at a profit anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Did they put a star on the window?</span> <span id="s579">(The regulation of indicating Jewish homes came much later).</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No!</span> <span id="s581">No!</span> <span id="s582">The first sign of this kind of vandalism was when they did paint swastikas (that was the official sign of the Nazi party which later was imprinted on the German flag) on the synagogue.</span> <span id="s583">The city did not like it when they had to clean it.</span> <span id="s584">They cleaned it up under protest.</span> <span id="s585">This was a development that became more and more noticeable to the point where my parents had to give up the business.</span> <span id="s586">By that time we had said that because of my mother’s agitation that things were going from bad to worse.</span> <span id="s587">She was the extreme opposite from the doctor’s wife in the Holocaust TV mini series.</span> <span id="s588">(that was the four or five evening series shown on TV which showed a family of four Jewish people living in Germany who starting from an upper class existence in Berlin became victims of the Nazi drive against the Jews and gave the impetus to this oral history project.</span> <span id="s589">The doctor’s wife was brutalized and finally killed off in the TV series, one by one).</span> <span id="s590">My mother wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s591">I believe that I mentioned that one of us -- my brother or I had to leave the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s592">I did.</span> <span id="s593">In order to learn a useful trade, something which I could conceivably use in Israel (that was then, of course, Palestine) I managed to get an apprenticeship in the city of Hanover.</span> <span id="s594">I moved away from home.</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">I lived with a Jewish family in Hanover and started to work as a carpenter’s apprentice.</span> <span id="s597">That didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s598">The Nazi party got stronger, the rules and regulations got tougher (the rules and regulations as well as the territorial demands under the Nazis were increased by the sausage theory i.e. one slice at a time, each slice being tailored to what the former allied powers would tolerate).</span> <span id="s599">The carpenters guild put pressure on my employer to let me go.</span> <span id="s600">He didn’t want to so they passed a law -- actually it may not have been a law, just a local rule stating that all the Jewish boys who had come to the big city to learn a trade, whether it was myself in the carpenter trade or some of the others who were learning to be welders or metal workers; we were no longer allowed to attend the trade school.</span> <span id="s601">One of the criteria which one must meet when you accept an apprenticeship was that you had to go to trade school and learn things that go along with the trade.</span> <span id="s602">Well, two things happened; the pressure of the carpenter’s guild on my employer plus the fact that they kicked all the Jews out of the trade schools, legally cancelled our apprenticeship contract and I had to leave.</span> <span id="s603">I tried to involve that in a claim which I had against Germany.</span> <span id="s604">(After the war, in 1948, the German State established a law under which people could obtain financial restitution for things done under the laws which the Nazis established.</span> <span id="s605">There was restitution for interrupted education, loss of a job, loss of business, days of imprisonment, injuries while in concentration camp, etc.</span> <span id="s606">That is undoubtedly what PL is talking about) because I was disabled but unfortunately the way my departure from the apprenticeship was, the way in which I was fired was prior to the time when I would have established any rights under the German social security system -- so I could never collect for the few months which I did work either unemployment or as an old age pension.</span> <span id="s607">I had to strain to prove that it was not my choice to leave.</span> <span id="s608">If it hadn’t been for the Nazi pressure I could have stayed and contributed to the social Security system.</span> <span id="s609">I had the necessary tenure, but I employed some good attorneys and it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s610">In any case, because of the Nazi pressure I had to leave.</span> <span id="s611">By that time my visa with the Youth Aliyah (the young people who were to enter Palestine -- at that time only youth, below 18 could enter Palestine under the British regulations) to go to Israel (Palestine) was almost ready to go.</span> <span id="s612">You see, I had joined in Hanover, a youth movement which exists here, in the United States, it is International, it is the Habonim Nun which was to associate Jewish kids who went on trips, even after we were no longer allowed to have public gatherings of Jewish youth anymore.</span> <span id="s613">We got on our bicycles and went someplace where we camped out and had instructions in Hebrew songs and dances.</span> <span id="s614">We learned to speak Hebrew.</span> <span id="s615">We called it Evrit at that time, that is pretty close to what they call it today.</span> <span id="s616">However when I had to leave Hanover, I had to drop my membership in Habonim and come back home where in order to keep busy and make a little money my father and I got to be peddlers on our bicycles.</span> <span id="s617">An uncle of mine in a northern German city still had his business going.</span> <span id="s618">He relied a lot on the main, on catalog business.</span> <span id="s619">He gave us some samples and the catalogs and we went on our bicycles to visit our former customers in the villages.</span> <span id="s620">There were a lot of people who were very nice and friendly to us.</span> <span id="s621">They even gave us an occasional order.</span> <span id="s622">We met quite a few who had been converted to being extremely Nazi-anti-Semitic minded and kicked us out and stuck the dogs on us.</span> <span id="s623">We met others who were just careful that they might lose some benefits.</span> <span id="s624">Especially the farmers who did business with a Jew would lose out.</span> <span id="s625">So we kept busy and made a little money.</span> <span id="s626">We kept on doing this until our visa came through to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s627">I did mention that I almost got to go with a youth aliyah out to Israel (Palestine).</span> <span id="s628">We had a couple of setbacks but both my brother and I caught yellow jaundice and looking like we were sick ruled out both my going on the boat to Israel or going to the United States (probably he means on a children transport, several of which left Germany during these years although PL does not state what he means there); so we got put back on the established list.</span> <span id="s629">Both my brother and I recovered sufficiently so that we could go in front of the United States Counsel in Hamburg and to get our permits to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Were you able to shop in other stores although people were not allowed to come to your store?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s632">We left before these things became too rigorously enforced, in the small towns.</span> <span id="s633">In the larger cities some of the small specialty stores (at least that is what it looks like since the signs “Juden sind hier unerwunscht” i.e. “Jews are not wanted here” were prevalent all over in Frankfurt) which had gone completely Nazi, already had signs posted that “Jews are not welcome!”</span> <span id="s634">They made it appear, at least, that if you were Jewish and you came to the store you would be asked to leave.</span> <span id="s635">In our little city, most of the merchants whom we visited, where we did business were on our side until the day we left.</span> <span id="s636">Remember that we left as early as 1937.</span> <span id="s637">We only heard stories from our relatives after they came to the United States, how bad it had gotten after we left.</span> <span id="s638">Remember that we were no longer in Germany for Kristallnacht (that was the night of November 9-10 1938 when the synagogues, Jewishly owned stores, assembly halls, etc. were torched, Jewish homes were ransacked at will (broken crystal, glasses, etc.) and Jewish males arrested in a wholesale manner).</span> <span id="s639">No, the merchants allowed us still to purchase things.</span> <span id="s640">The recreational establishments were a little more scary.</span> <span id="s641">An incident happened in Berlin, where there was an anti-Semitic movie which the Nazis had made.</span> <span id="s642">It was shown in one of the bigger theaters.</span> <span id="s643">During some of the most anti-Semitic remarks the audience made little raspberries then they shouted against them something like “Big Lies!”</span> <span id="s644">The Nazis blamed that on the Jews.</span> <span id="s645">They got out a big cartoon which was supposed to be characteristic of the Jews and displayed it in the papers and described it over the radio.</span> <span id="s646">It read: “To be brave in the dark is a Jewish trait!”</span> <span id="s647">All the people who made that noise, the anti-Nazi remarks, had been arrested.</span> <span id="s648">As a result of that Jews were no longer permitted in movie theaters.</span> <span id="s649">That was so stupid, that the little town movies then had no one in them.</span> <span id="s650">(During the pre-World War II period all movie performances, which were the main form of entertainment in Europe, included a newsreel which in Germany always did include objectionable or favorable items to the Nazis).</span> <span id="s651">The president of the Jewish community tried to get it changed, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s652">His business was hanging in the balance so he didn’t try to buck the system because he didn’t want to get into trouble, just to buy tickets for the movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Were there any other merchants who tried to resist Nazi pressure?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: They all did, but Nazi pressure made it difficult to conduct business, but gradually they all went on the bandwagon, particularly since their youngsters and their kids were the people who were the first to be affected.</span> <span id="s655">The parents had to follow suit.</span> <span id="s656">They had to become Nazis and contribute to the party, display the party slogan.</span> <span id="s657">They had to make sure that they didn’t employ Jews or somebody who might be a Jew, maybe of Jewish descent or whatever.</span> <span id="s658">If one of your grandparents had been Jewish you had too much Jewish blood in you and you could not be accepted (it is believed that this is an error: one grandparent was acceptable but two were too many).</span> <span id="s659">Now it never got to the point where you needed to go to the third generation back.</span> <span id="s660">By that time the “Final Solution” (i.e. the killing of all the Jews) had been put on paper and the rule pretty much stayed that way.</span> <span id="s661">If you had one Jewish grandparent you were suspected (on the other hand you could emigrate from Germany only if you could “prove” that you were not an Aryan, so that became a thriving business for would be emigrants to prove your ancestry.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: How did all of this affect your Jewish religious life?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: During my time in Germany it made it a little more scary but we were determined to have our religious service.</span> <span id="s664">The rabbi had been threatened and he could no longer travel freely from Obernkirschern to our town of Rinteln so my father took over to be the religious leader.</span> <span id="s665">He was not the community president.</span> <span id="s666">He never wanted it and he didn’t have that much time.</span> <span id="s667">Remember that that was a tremendous presence and it just wasn’t possible for him.</span> <span id="s668">You know he had to make a living for us.</span> <span id="s669">For him to become an officer of the community was just unthinkable.</span> <span id="s670">That never came up.</span> <span id="s671">Now we were Progressive, as an Orthodox community.</span> <span id="s672">Long, long before I was Barmitzvah men and women started sitting together (it is traditional in truly orthodox congregations in Judaism that women and small children sat in the balcony and only men and older boys were allowed to sit on the main floor of the sanctuary).</span> <span id="s673">I remember that earlier, when I was little, women were sitting on one side and the men were on the other side.</span> <span id="s674">In Buckenburg, where there was a bigger synagogue the women were upstairs and the men were downstairs.</span> <span id="s675">This change was probably gradual but during the Hitler years when we were threatened and the synagogue was not looted, but vandalized the outside walls were painted.</span> <span id="s676">Hardly a day went by when it didn’t have slogans or swastikas on it.</span> <span id="s677">We had services and my father conducted.</span> <span id="s678">He directed the High Holiday services and he had some help from another Jew.</span> <span id="s679">This other Jew was brought to us by the Nazis and put in an insane asylum.</span> <span id="s680">That is truly what it was.</span> <span id="s681">He didn’t really belong there.</span> <span id="s682">He knew enough religion to daven (say the proper prayers in Hebrew) and such things on the High Holidays (the period of the Jewish New Year from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur) or if not the High Holidays then on any other Jewish holidays, when they would let him out.</span> <span id="s683">He would help my father.</span> <span id="s684">He kept that up until we left.</span> <span id="s685">We were some of the first of the community to leave, that is other than youngsters who had gone to Palestine.</span> <span id="s686">When they found out that we were going to get the immigrant papers from the United States so that we were going to leave they knew that they didn’t have anybody to conduct the services.</span> <span id="s687">There was another Jewish family where the husband was rather sickly.</span> <span id="s688">He couldn’t stand up anymore to conduct services, especially since we had to conduct them in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s689">We found out soon after we left that he was arrested on some trumped up charges.</span> <span id="s690">We don’t know what they were.</span> <span id="s691">We never heard from him again.</span> <span id="s692">His name was Levy.</span> <span id="s693">He had owned a nicer store than my parents did.</span> <span id="s694">He mainly sold men’s ready to wear and shoes.</span> <span id="s695">Much later we met one of his daughters in New York City where we were visiting for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s696">We found out that he died in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s697">We never found out what the charges were.</span> <span id="s698">He was just picked up.</span> <span id="s699">He was the only one left who knew enough Hebrew to conduct services.</span> <span id="s700">So it went then for a while and Levy conducted services as he had learned to, mostly in German.</span> <span id="s701">We were gone so we don’t know when it happened that they picked him up.</span> <span id="s702">Then they locked the place up, and they were prohibited from conducting services.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: You say that the place was vandalized.</span> <span id="s704">Was there any more vandalizing after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s706">I never bothered to go unto the synagogue; I never bothered with that.</span> <span id="s707">It was ultimately burned (all known Jewish Houses of Worship in Germany and Austria were ransacked and burned during Kristallnacht i.e. November 9-10, 1938).</span> <span id="s708">I can’t tell you what year that was since I didn’t find this out when I came back there while I was in the service.</span> <span id="s709">I don’t remember if I told you that story before or not, when I went there with a couple of G.I.s (this stands for Government Issue and was the slang word for American enlisted men serving in World War II) and looked around, when we had a couple of days off.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: We will have to speak about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: That burning must have occurred earlier, before the war started.</span> <span id="s712">It was burned by Nazi vandals, hoodlums.</span> <span id="s713">(Kristallnacht was actually orchestrated by the German government).</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Can you tell me what happened to you when Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s715">You were speaking about how your mother reacted in front of your father, brother and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: My brother was just a kid.</span> <span id="s717">We were used to living in the open.</span> <span id="s718">I was shocked!</span> <span id="s719">When I first lost that independence I wanted to learn a little bit more about what the Jewish community went through; how the Nazis came to the Jewish orphan’s home in Hanover and threatened all the kids, and looked around to see if they were hiding some “Aryans” (presumably all Aryans were tall, blue eyed specimens in contrast with the Jews).</span> <span id="s720">I know that they hauled away quite a few of the instructor and teachers and nurses and doctors for a service that was “more immediately needed for non-Jews.</span> <span id="s721">All the boys, it was a boys’ orphanage, were taken to some refuge haven administered by some international organization after they were taken away that was after we left.</span> <span id="s722">The Nazis took over the orphanage.</span> <span id="s723">I came back as a tourist to Hanover after the war and I found out that the larger cities suffered a lot more than those in the smaller cities.</span> <span id="s724">We could still get someone to buy the remainder of our business, of course the money offered for the goodwill and the merchandise was less than it was worth.</span> <span id="s725">The Nazis, in our town listed everything we had in cash and confiscated it except that I think that we were allowed to take 25 German Marks a piece for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes, out of the country.</span> <span id="s728">However we were still allowed to take all of our furniture with us.</span> <span id="s729">The furniture was shipped in one big box.</span> <span id="s730">Valuables such as gold, diamonds, silver plates and so forth, no, we had to leave them behind.</span> <span id="s731">They had a guy in uniform and a civilian come by to check what went into this big box for overseas shipment.</span> <span id="s732">The Germans called it a “lift” in those days (that term “lift” in ordinary language means an elevator cage and actually the box looked very much like that; today it would be called a small container shipment, about one quarter or one half the size of the present day containers; it was loaded as one piece on trucks, or onto the holds of ships).</span> <span id="s733">The inspectors made sure that we could not smuggle any incriminating documents, or forbidden valuables or such out.</span> <span id="s734">Listen, for example, they took away from me a thing I had been working on for many years, a family tree.</span> <span id="s735">This family tree was a fairly complex thing.</span> <span id="s736">The family tree went way back to the years of the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s737">I had traced ancestors, both males and females.</span> <span id="s738">It was a hobby which I had developed during the Nazi period.</span> <span id="s739">It showed where I came from.</span> <span id="s740">They felt that it was incriminating to the party and so they said that it was a lie.</span> <span id="s741">The party said that the Jews hadn’t been in Germany that long, that they came from foreign countries.</span> <span id="s742">Well, I had planned on hiding it, but my mother didn’t want to take a chance, so I gave it to the official when he asked for it.</span> <span id="s743">Some of the things which we lost was because of blanket rules which the Nazis had.</span> <span id="s744">For example they had passed a law that it was a lie that there were veterans of the World War I of the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s745">This was by an edict from Goebbels (Joseph Goebbels was one of the leaders of the Nazi party and served Hitler as Minister of Propaganda.</span> <span id="s746">He, his wife and children killed themselves by swallowing poison on May 1, 1945) that it was a Jewish invention, that there were no such veterans.</span> <span id="s747">So all the books, which had been published, were collected and burned.</span> <span id="s748">I don’t know why I got two books of that nature out of the country but through them I have the list of names of Jewish war veterans killed in action and a list of the members who had been in the German air Force, i.e. Jews in the Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s749">They may have been mixed up with other books.</span> <span id="s750">We brought quite a few books out with us.</span> <span id="s751">There were religious books such as some for the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s752">But people who left later were no longer able to take such things with them, because the Nazis collected the books right after the Kristallnacht set a big fire and burned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Do you have some copies of books which were burned on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s755">You know for certain celebrations, Thanksgiving and such, they always celebrated with big fires (Thanksgiving is not a German celebration but that is not relevant to the story, they used big bonfires at many occasions).</span> <span id="s756">For some reason or other they grabbed books with a Jewish title, or anti-Nazi books or something of the kind and threw them in the fires.</span> <span id="s757">That was great sport.</span> <span id="s758">We had already left.</span> <span id="s759">They just collected them and burned them.</span> <span id="s760">Torahs (The Jewish scrolls on which the five books of Moses are copied) were burned during the High Holidays We could take all of our German prayer books with us.</span> <span id="s761">I guess those two books which by then had been declared a lie and therefore were illegal and Jewish propaganda slipped through.</span> <span id="s762">They were not worth much, just a list of names, but I still have them.</span> <span id="s763">Historically they are of some value, but they are as stated above and I believe that I still have them.</span> <span id="s764">I am straying a little bit I got on that subject when you asked what happened to the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s765">My brother was more or less unaffected.</span> <span id="s766">He was affected only in later years.</span> <span id="s767">He knew that we had to go.</span> <span id="s768">He was just afraid that he would be separated from our parents (at that time the brother was still eligible to leave Germany on children’s transports due to his age; many youngsters were saved from camps by leaving on children’s transports -- but such departures were dramatic).</span> <span id="s769">He could have gone to Palestine in those days when my parents could not find their transportation to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: I like to ask you a question about what happened in the normal day- by- day activities to your family and to your Jewish friends, the people you knew.</span> <span id="s771">Could you get me their reactions to the Nuremburg Laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Let’s go back a little.</span> <span id="s773">The laws which were passed, I don’t believe that we knew them as the Nuremberg Laws (the actual Nuremberg Laws were passed one time, in 1935, when the Reichstag met in that city, there specifically depriving Jews of German citizenship, forbade Germans to marry Jews and made the swastika the national flag of Germany).</span> <span id="s774">I would have to do a little reading and see just why they are called that now (the above information came from the World Book encyclopedia).</span> <span id="s775">Perhaps they had a party congress in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s776">We knew about the laws (anti-Jewish laws were passed all the time from 1933 through 1945).</span> <span id="s777">At that time we did have gentile employees in the store.</span> <span id="s778">In spite of the law they all stayed until the store was closed.</span> <span id="s779">(There was no Nuremberg Law which would have forced them to quit) at the time when the business had to be given up for other reasons.</span> <span id="s780">We had maids and this; in the United States that sounds a little degrading and derogatory.</span> <span id="s781">It was not (only a few German households, in the early 30’s had such conveniences as refrigerators, gas burning stoves vacuum cleaners, etc) then.</span> <span id="s782">We had our maids from the same farm family for many, many years.</span> <span id="s783">When one of them had had enough and wanted to go back to the farm, maybe she had a boyfriend or wanted to get married, then her sister would come in and work.</span> <span id="s784">I visited this family by the way, during the war years just to see what happened to them.</span> <span id="s785">However they stayed, they stayed as long as they could.</span> <span id="s786">(In 1937 laws were passed specifically covering maids working in Jewish households).</span> <span id="s787">In our little town they were not threatened with arrest.</span> <span id="s788">Maybe because my father was looked up to a little more he had no trouble.</span> <span id="s789">There were others who were more vigorous, who had participated in politics and who were attacked personally.</span> <span id="s790">They were threatened with arrest, or maybe arrested, if they did not follow the letter of the law.</span> <span id="s791">Jewish boys in schools were no longer allowed to date and then soon they had to leave the high schools anyway.</span> <span id="s792">It was upsetting because of the things I mentioned but we had gotten used to this fact.</span> <span id="s793">It wasn’t just because of the Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s794">We had been restricted by laws even before that.</span> <span id="s795">But paradoxes existed such as Hitler and his command, in order to conserve food had already invented the modern day weekly “Eintopfgericht” (spelled by PL) (actually the difference in the cost of the food served that day was to be contributed to the Nazi party; this was not a conservation of food program).</span> <span id="s796">This means that the meal was to be served in one pot like a stew, soup, etc.</span> <span id="s797">This was to save and be just as nourishing.</span> <span id="s798">This was for the main meal of the day, it did not concern itself with breakfast and the evening supper.</span> <span id="s799">It came about that there were too many poor people who could not afford regular meals, so every citizen was assigned a poor family or could choose a poor family, a family who was disadvantaged for some reason or other and you shared your Eintopfgericht with that family.</span> <span id="s800">Jews were not allowed to participate because it was told to the general population that they would poison you.</span> <span id="s801">That was not the case I our town.</span> <span id="s802">There were certain Jewish families who were expected to share their Eintopfgericht.</span> <span id="s803">We took ours in a little carrying thing like people have lunch in.</span> <span id="s804">There were three different little buckets in that lunch.</span> <span id="s805">I remember carrying that to a family what had been assigned to be our guests.</span> <span id="s806">Our relatives in other towns, in the larger cities, were surprised that we even participated.</span> <span id="s807">One of the daughters of this family had worked in the store.</span> <span id="s808">One of the sons of this family had been one of our friends.</span> <span id="s809">The father was a blacksmith and he had gotten sick.</span> <span id="s810">They were in a bad way.</span> <span id="s811">They were not poor enough to get public support.</span> <span id="s812">We always took the food over to the people.</span> <span id="s813">Either we boys did, or our parents did.</span> <span id="s814">An incident there occurred, when a couple of Nazi bullies didn’t beat up my father but, while he was on the way to the family with the food, they took the food and threw it in the public square and told him that what he was doing was illegal.</span> <span id="s815">Now they were not officials.</span> <span id="s816">The family which used to participate in our Eintopfgericht with us were a little upset, but they were scared out of participating any longer.</span> <span id="s817">When our parents had to give up the store our family finally said, under pressure of some of my mother’s family in the north, that we had to leave.</span> <span id="s818">It was just as well because we then also had to give up the living quarters which we had, and move into a makeshift arrangement with another Jewish family which owned their home.</span> <span id="s819">We didn’t have a maid anymore because my parents no longer worked in the business and had all day to take care of their own household and so forth.</span> <span id="s820">So getting along without maids wasn’t a hardship.</span> <span id="s821">It fell right into line with the maids leaving us and going home.</span> <span id="s822">The employees in the store all got severance pay and left.</span> <span id="s823">There were some Jewish operated businesses which continued to go on in our town and still have employees.</span> <span id="s824">How they solved their problem of having female employees working for them I don’t really remember (if they were partnerships or incorporated businesses with “majority ownership by Aryans” they were not affected).</span> <span id="s825">I do remember that the law had been passed and that it was being enforced.</span> <span id="s826">For so many years they had been working for those Jewish bossed and, all of a sudden, they had to leave them.</span> <span id="s827">this law was taken relatively lightly in our town.</span> <span id="s828">The worst thing was when the kids could no longer go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: With all this happening, the personal relations between the Jewish bosses and the gentile employees were they changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: The relationships remained like they had always been.</span> <span id="s831">They were above reproaches, they were excellent as a matter of fact I can remember the employees giving a party for my father preparing for their leaving.</span> <span id="s832">They were not happy.</span> <span id="s833">They were losing their livelihood.</span> <span id="s834">They didn’t know where they were going to find work.</span> <span id="s835">These gentile people getting together and having a party, I mean singing and reading poems they had written, things like that, as a farewell.</span> <span id="s836">It was a little embarrassing in the spirit, not so much for us, but what would happen to them.</span> <span id="s837">Perhaps also, with stronger measures taken by the Nazi party, someone would accuse them of being soft against the Jews.</span> <span id="s838">The party took place, but in order to keep away from any possible adverse consequences we thanked them, we closed the store early and the next day we all left to visit relatives.</span> <span id="s839">I think that my brother and I went to the town of (transcriber can not understand the name); we spent a day or so with my aunt.</span> <span id="s840">We were concerned that somebody would come and arrest us (the principle was that if they couldn’t find you just when they wanted to make an example of you they would forget about you).</span> <span id="s841">Nothing happened however.</span> <span id="s842">I vaguely remember the thing; my mother worried that they were making too much noise so that they would attract attention to the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Were there any Jews in the town who were really affected by the Nuremberg Laws such as a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: There was no Jewish doctor in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did the gentile doctor continue to care for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: The gentile doctor continued to see Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s847">The doctor who took care of us kids did.</span> <span id="s848">I don’t know why but my father had a different doctor, my father got his first heart attack while we were living with these Jewish people, after the sale of the store.</span> <span id="s849">However he was not hospitalized and I cannot recall now whether that was because of anti-Semitism or because the doctor who took care of him didn’t think that was necessary.</span> <span id="s850">He did have a heart attack.</span> <span id="s851">A couple of Nazi hoodlums who knew about it, found out the location of the room where he was and sang loud anti-Jewish slogans; however they were both stinking drunk and the language which they used was something which would make you raise your eyebrows.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: What kind of words were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Filthy ones!</span> <span id="s854">Oh, it was odd, they were picked up by the police and arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct.</span> <span id="s855">There were no apologies.</span> <span id="s856">The parties didn’t offer to replace the broken windows.</span> <span id="s857">My mother was worried about my father probably getting another heart attack, but the doctor didn’t come over.</span> <span id="s858">Now the same doctor later on, when my father filed his claim against the German government for his “ Wiedergutsmachung” -- you probably remember that word --it is the claim for reparation, literally of “Making Well Again” (these were laws established after 1947 under Chancellor Adenauer to compensate individuals against private losses of any kind under the terms of laws promulgated by the Nazis).</span> <span id="s859">The doctor refused to testify since he was too old.</span> <span id="s860">His daughter was also a doctor testified that he didn’t have a real heart attack, that he just had some safety needs to get out from under prosecution and consequently there was no basis for injury claims for himself.</span> <span id="s861">There were some other Germans who recalled the incident, fortunately, and then testified.</span> <span id="s862">These witnesses said that he really was sick, as claimed.</span> <span id="s863">So he finished his claim against the German government for the prosecution of the claim.</span> <span id="s864">It was granted shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s865">However the doctors, both Dr. Kuppenit (that is what it sounds like), I may have mentioned his name earlier, incidentally his son got to be a leader in the Nazi movement, and the other doctor, whose name escapes me for the moment, maybe I will think of it later, did take care of Jewish persons.</span> <span id="s866">For example during the days when I was going on the bicycle, peddling with my father, I was sent out, at the request of the customer, to come and collect some money, which they owed us.</span> <span id="s867">It happened that they had a fairly vicious dog whom they kept on a leash inside, they did not stick the dog on the little Jew-boy, me, you know, as the story goes.</span> <span id="s868">I went to the door and knocked and the dog bit me in the thigh.</span> <span id="s869">The people disinfected it, but knowing about dog bites and first aid and all of that, I wasn’t satisfied.</span> <span id="s870">They gave me the money and I got back to my parents and then stopped at the office of this German doctor.</span> <span id="s871">He wasn’t my doctor, but he was closer, physically.</span> <span id="s872">I told him that I was a Jewish boy from the community and I normally went to his competitor but he took care of my wound, dressed it and sent me on my way without remarks.</span> <span id="s873">It took some time for these things to sink in, it wasn’t an overnight affair (for the anti-Semitic laws to filter down to everyday level), for the doctors to say, “No, I am not going to take care of Jews anymore!”</span> <span id="s874">(Later laws forced the doctors hands and other laws took doctors licenses away from Jewish doctors).</span> <span id="s875">That was true especially in the small towns.</span> <span id="s876">The other thing we talked about; the employees we had were not so convinced yet, in 1936, that Jews were such an abomination.</span> <span id="s877">They kind of felt a little bit awkward about the laws being passed that a Jew had to lose his rights (here the tape is very poorly audible and CK announces the end of the tape).</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: This is the second tape with Mr. Paul Leeser done Wednesday afternoon August 23, 1978.</span> <span id="s879">We are beginning with a sequel to the section of the Nuremberg laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: As a consequence of these laws many of the professional entertainers, movie stars and teachers and so forth had been able to earn no livelihood anymore.</span> <span id="s881">They could not perform in public.</span> <span id="s882">I believe that the teachers continued in the schools (that is not the case -- after these laws were passed Jewish teachers were dismissed except from Jewish schools, but that was outside of PL’s knowledge).</span> <span id="s883">There was a lot of what, in today’s language would be called moonlighting, on their part.</span> <span id="s884">The Jews in 1936 had, in existence, already an organization called: the Kulturbund, loosely translated into the Jewish Cultural Organization, where lecturers, performers and other people who were well known, such as movie idols, gave public performances to gatherings of Jews.</span> <span id="s885">These things were not outlawed because there were not that many of them.</span> <span id="s886">There were public invitations.</span> <span id="s887">They rented halls.</span> <span id="s888">They were willing to go to dues.</span> <span id="s889">They charged admissions, actually they charged in admission more than what the performers asked for.</span> <span id="s890">Actually the performers worked for very little because most of the performers, the Jewish performers, especially those who did participate, had achieved stardom and had some money which had not yet been taken away from them.</span> <span id="s891">A lot of them didn’t think that it was bad enough yet, for them to have to leave yet, although a few of them did.</span> <span id="s892">We used to go to Minden which was the closest bigger city with large enough facilities to see lots of shows.</span> <span id="s893">People would never think that we were destined to see them otherwise.</span> <span id="s894">The performers, I can’t recall all the names, but Jewish stars in the German movie industry gave quite some interesting shows.</span> <span id="s895">These shows were of a nature to which you could take the kids.</span> <span id="s896">The teachers who were not as well off, financially, as the performers got jobs in instructing people in languages of the countries which they thought they had to immigrate to.</span> <span id="s897">Now there was a rule which allowed the performers to have public gatherings of large groups, that was in 1936, otherwise groups were prohibited.</span> <span id="s898">Teachers coming to the house were very much afraid that they were doing something against the law.</span> <span id="s899">They came under all kinds of guidance, to make sure that you were secure.</span> <span id="s900">They used to instruct in English, in Hebrew, in French and in Spanish, whatever your choice was.</span> <span id="s901">They needed the income.</span> <span id="s902">They needed the meals.</span> <span id="s903">They used to come to our town.</span> <span id="s904">As I remember I had had instruction in Hebrew ever since religious school and then during my Habonim days in Hanover, but we needed instruction in English.</span> <span id="s905">I had had one year in high school.</span> <span id="s906">My parents and brother knew nothing about it at all.</span> <span id="s907">We had a young gentleman coming, bicycling, who taught in our town and surrounding ones to all those people who could afford him.</span> <span id="s908">You put him up for a night, feed him a couple of meals and gave him a little money.</span> <span id="s909">He was pretty good in instruction in basic English.</span> <span id="s910">He, himself was headed for Israel and that wasn’t too easy for someone without the means to go.</span> <span id="s911">For the kids, yes, it was easy to go to Israel, there were organizations.</span> <span id="s912">Adults had to have money of their own or an assured income, or had to find a sponsor or some way of getting the fare, so this young man was a lay teacher.</span> <span id="s913">He made a little bit of a living by teaching foreign languages and the laws and customs of foreign countries to people who planned to emigrate.</span> <span id="s914">Kotoban (obviously PL now talks about some of the lectures but the word does not mean much to the transcriber) was a big name for me.</span> <span id="s915">We never had thought it possible to listen to him in person, to see those people whom we had seen in movies.</span> <span id="s916">We were very proud of the fact that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s917">Now the star from UFA (spelled by PL), it was a big German movie house, something like MGM is in the United States, and now to have seen him in person and be in the same room, close enough to talk to him, that was something.</span> <span id="s918">However we couldn’t understand why we got to go to these meetings of the Kulturbund.</span> <span id="s919">I think that it was not until late 1938, that they were officially cancelled.</span> <span id="s920">Why we could go to a meeting of the Kulturbund, where we could hear the singing and the performances, and it was not legal to have a teacher come to the house is something I could not understand.</span> <span id="s921">We had to keep quiet about that.</span> <span id="s922">Our parents and our teacher warned us about that.</span> <span id="s923">They warned us not to let even our closest friends know about the fact that we housed an instructor.</span> <span id="s924">Maybe looking back on that through these instructors we learned quite a few more things than just the foreign language and the customs and the laws of the countries.</span> <span id="s925">They also gave us news on the side, which otherwise we would never have found out about.</span> <span id="s926">As a teacher, we had one young man who just taught English.</span> <span id="s927">He also taught us the laws of the United States that we, as immigrants should know about; what it took to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s928">What it took to get a visa to come to the United States,; who you had to contact, and so forth.</span> <span id="s929">We learned, for instance, that the only country which did not require a visa where, if you had the money to purchase the passage to go to was Shanghai.</span> <span id="s930">(That was the door of China which had been forced open after the Boxer revolt).</span> <span id="s931">We also learned that, for some reason or other, Germans had already started following up on which Jews leaving for neighboring countries like Holland, like Denmark, or France; England wasn’t so bad since it was separated by water.</span> <span id="s932">America, if you had the money, then all right, it was a good place.</span> <span id="s933">Israel, go ahead if you want to get killed (starting in 1936 Arabs in Palestine had rioted under the orders of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and massacred Jews wherever they could).</span> <span id="s934">But Shanghai, if you want to go to Shanghai, we will let you go tomorrow.</span> <span id="s935">I didn’t know until later, since this I did not learn from the English teacher, that you could go to Shanghai, even if you were in a concentration camp (actually other survivors have told that if any individual could prove that he/she would be admitted to any foreign country he/she would have their German passport validated and be released from any camp until 1939) that was still true in 1936 and 1937.</span> <span id="s936">If you could prove to the concentration camp administration, let’s say a wife, that she had the means for herself and her husband to give up their livelihood in Germany and go to Shanghai you were released.</span> <span id="s937">Now that we didn’t learn until we were in the United States, as a matter of fact not until recently, but the fact that you could go to Shanghai, even if you couldn’t go anywhere else, we learned from these instructors.</span> <span id="s938">We learned, as I mentioned before, where the concentration camps were; that some Jews who were sent there were never heard from again; that in the camps you were not beaten but that you had to work very hard and that prisoners didn’t eat too well but that you could not bring anything to prisoners unless you managed to bribe one of the members of SS (these were the Nazi so called Schutz Staffel, Protective Guard, the black uniformed elite troopers who guarded and administered the concentration camps and the secret police, amongst other duties) guards.</span> <span id="s939">Now it was perhaps for this reason that the German government in those fays frowned on the private teachers who went into the homes to teach languages.</span> <span id="s940">I don’t know so much about the aftermath of the Nuremberg laws (it is remarkable how much PL could gather so much information in spite of his youth since he was just 14 when the laws were promulgated) so we better go to the next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Mr. Leeser, can you tell us what prompted your family to leave when they did.</span> <span id="s942">What happened when they left and what sort of assistance you had in getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Right!</span> <span id="s944">We set the wheels in motion about the days of the Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s945">I remember these Nuremberg laws now because we just stated what we meant by them.</span> <span id="s946">We didn’t know them under that name then.</span> <span id="s947">We decided to leave when you could see that the business no longer was profitable.</span> <span id="s948">We knew that we would have to go someplace.</span> <span id="s949">Fortunately my mother had two sisters and a brother who had left Germany for the United States earlier.</span> <span id="s950">A maiden aunt had left in 1924, another aunt left in 1928, the first two because of the depression in Germany and of the inability to get work there.</span> <span id="s951">The other aunt left because she had two sons and that she was afraid that she could not give them the education and the opportunity in Germany and that she had all kinds of glowing reports from her younger brother in the United States who had left also.</span> <span id="s952">They had visited us again in 1932 when Hitler already was a bad word and they had promised that, if things got worse, all three of them, two aunts and an uncle, would see to it that we get the necessary sponsors in the United States to get us to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s953">When the Nuremberg laws were passed the proceedings were still in progress.</span> <span id="s954">We heard all kinds of scary rumors what was going to be happening to Jews, as far as making a living is concerned.</span> <span id="s955">My mother left no stone unturned.</span> <span id="s956">She made me contact my friends in Hanover to expedite my exodus to Israel and to find out if I could take my small brother along.</span> <span id="s957">She wired the relatives in the United States that the time had come when an immediate departure was essential.</span> <span id="s958">My aunt in Cincinnati set the wheels in motion immediately.</span> <span id="s959">The laws in the United States had not been changed but were enforced more severely (due to the unemployment, no doubt) so that the sponsors would have to show that they had the necessary funds to fully support the new immigrants from Germany, for I believe one year (it was actually for an open ended period to prevent draining Federal and State welfare funds, in case of need).</span> <span id="s960">If there was a family involved you had to have several sponsors.</span> <span id="s961">Or the sponsors had to be fairly wealthy.</span> <span id="s962">My aunt here, in the United States, found two gentlemen in New York who were in the clothing business and had no dependent children of their own and were willing to sponsor quite a few people.</span> <span id="s963">They sponsored a lot of my relatives.</span> <span id="s964">They got the necessary papers ready.</span> <span id="s965">They forwarded them to Germany to the consulate.</span> <span id="s966">Our visas were delayed, as I believe I mentioned before, because of my brother and my appearance, but around the middle of May 1937 we were given our visas and we purchased passage on the United States owned ship SS Harding.</span> <span id="s967">My parents thought that it would make a better appearance if we arrived on a United States owned ship rather than with one of the luxury liners, although they were allowed to pay for the passage before any money was confiscated (by the Nazi government as price for letting Jews leave) they could have come over on one of the big German luxury liners.</span> <span id="s968">A United States ship appeared to them to be preferable.</span> <span id="s969">So we boarded the SS Harding.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Mr. Leeser, you weren’t always sure to come to the United States, you also mentioned going to Palestine or to Prague, or different places?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s972">Most of the Jewish families who had made up their mind that things were getting from bad to worse decided to leave.</span> <span id="s973">We had several choices.</span> <span id="s974">I believe that I mentioned briefly Shanghai.</span> <span id="s975">This seemed too far removed, we didn’t know anybody there.</span> <span id="s976">The United States were always in our mind as a goal because we did have relatives here, but since the quota system (immigration to the United States was regulated by a law passed in 1921 and revised in 1927 which limited the number of immigrants to specific yearly numbers which were divided amongst the several countries of birth of family heads in proportion to the make up of national origin claimed by the United States inhabitants in 1922 and 1927.</span> <span id="s977">This favored numerically would be immigrants from the British Isles and Northern Europe) bothered us and we didn’t know how soon we could get out.</span> <span id="s978">I had also been in contact with the Habonim organization with the Youth Aliyah (that is the movement of young people to return to Palestine which was mentioned previously) to come to Palestine/Israel.</span> <span id="s979">I had had my application in with the Habonim group for a youth transport.</span> <span id="s980">The way was clear.</span> <span id="s981">The papers were in order.</span> <span id="s982">As luck would have it, if we hadn’t gotten our United States visas, as a family, I would probably have two weeks later, been on my way to Palestine through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s983">The route usually taken was through Austria, then to the Italian coast.</span> <span id="s984">Some of the Youth Aliyah groups didn’t and went through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s985">We were to pick up a contingent of young people and a ship somewhere in an Italian port.</span> <span id="s986">We did have enough time to notify the Habonim in Hanover that our papers were coming through so that they could give any reservations which I had to someone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Was there any international organization, specifically a Jewish organization which had helped you obtain your visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: No.</span> <span id="s989">Fortunately we did not have to rely on any help from an international organization, although we knew that they were active in helping people.</span> <span id="s990">I vaguely remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: That is the organization which worked for the development of land in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: They were giving all kinds of help to Jewish children, either orphans or children from families which could not get away.</span> <span id="s993">They lined them up someplace and placed them with organizations who would take them to Israel, but they were not really very open.</span> <span id="s994">I guess they were reluctant to reveal their sources for transportation and where the money was coming from because even in late 1936 and early 1937 the plan already existed that some Nazi organizations, either the SA (Sturm Abteilung -- these were the masses of Nazis, the brown shirted storm troopers) the SS or the Gestapo -- Geheime Staats Polizei -- the secret police which often used SS people as their cadres) and what have you, latched onto their things and made difficulties.</span> <span id="s995">I guess they used headlines to put their names in front of the public.</span> <span id="s996">They confiscated the money or arrested the leaders as Jewish vagrants and so forth.</span> <span id="s997">So the organizations didn’t say too much.</span> <span id="s998">They relied on your guidance.</span> <span id="s999">If you left, you had to say good-by to your family and friends, but then you went by means of transportation which they had provided.</span> <span id="s1000">They didn’t make it public.</span> <span id="s1001">(There was also active rioting by Arabs in Palestine who tried to forcibly prevent new settlers from entering the country, if they could prevent it).</span> <span id="s1002">I only learned about it later on, from news from family including a cousin who went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1003">She did get across the border also with the help of an organization which took care of transportation.</span> <span id="s1004">They had to trust these organizations that they were not Nazi agents who would take them to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: When did you say that you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Mid May!</span> <span id="s1007">I think that I remember the date.</span> <span id="s1008">It was the 15th when the ship left.</span> <span id="s1009">And it was May 27 I believe when we landed in New York harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: You would say that you had no intermediate stops?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No.</span> <span id="s1012">We left Bremerhaven on May 15.</span> <span id="s1013">The ship landed in Southampton which was the regularly scheduled stop and then we sailed to the United States.</span> <span id="s1014">I remember that trip.</span> <span id="s1015">We stayed in a cabin and had a good time, and I wanted to find out what was going on on American ships.</span> <span id="s1016">I got friendly with American people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Was there a problem getting from your home in Rinteln to the port of embarkation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: None at all!</span> <span id="s1019">However, in order to get space on the ship it took a little bribery of the officials of the shipping lines.</span> <span id="s1020">I know that there was some exchange of folding money when we met the officials of the shipping lines.</span> <span id="s1021">This man was an American.</span> <span id="s1022">(Here follows some statement as to what level the person who took the bribe was but the tape here is of such quality that it is not possible to transcribe) citizen.</span> <span id="s1023">You had to bribe to get the cabin you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Was there any anti-Semitism on the part of the consular officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1026">Maybe it was just for show, however the second time we came there at the consulate in Hamburg, I was put down by the consular personnel.</span> <span id="s1027">He asked my parents questions about my health and my being over the yellow jaundice, as it was called in those days.</span> <span id="s1028">I guess it is some form of hepatitis.</span> <span id="s1029">He told me in a fairly direct way, that I should not sound like a loud mouth little Jew-boy and that when he asked my parents questions I should keep quiet.</span> <span id="s1030">He said it in such a way that he was trying to impress any listener who might have been listening and who was a Nazi, because he stressed that “Jew boy” business pretty much.</span> <span id="s1031">Altogether he made me shut up and he continued the examination and then he put the proper stamp on the passports and other papers.</span> <span id="s1032">Then he sent us on our way.</span> <span id="s1033">The transportation between my hometown and the port was not difficult because it was beginning of 1937.</span> <span id="s1034">My uncle from Herford was still allowed to drive his automobile.</span> <span id="s1035">It came later when they took the drivers licenses away from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1036">He drove us to the port.</span> <span id="s1037">He and my aunt came to the cabin with us and we had our good-byes on board the ship.</span> <span id="s1038">I was still afraid and I didn’t breathe easily until we were out at sea, away from any German influence.</span> <span id="s1039">Then we got our first look at American newspapers with anti-Nazi cartoons and we were allowed to laugh about what it said about Hitler in public.</span> <span id="s1040">It was really a relief to be away all of a sudden to be away from the pressure and to see things from the anti-Nazi propaganda, we felt really loose after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Can you describe your arrival in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1043">For my brother and myself it was a great adventure, both on board ship and then seeing our first shoeshine boys in New York harbor.</span> <span id="s1044">It was more tedious for our parents because they had to clear customs.</span> <span id="s1045">We were called by name.</span> <span id="s1046">We expected to see our two sponsors.</span> <span id="s1047">They had sent a letter to my mother on board.</span> <span id="s1048">It was delivered to the cabin, but then for a reason which at the time I didn’t understand we were called out as a family and were transferred to Ellis Island (that was the Federal prison in New York harbor where prior to the immigration acts of 1921 and 27 all emigrants were taken off the ships and examined.</span> <span id="s1049">The laws of 1921 and 27 transferred the examination procedure overseas and only those where questions had not been straightened out in a timely fashion went to Ellis Island where they could be deported readily back to their home countries.</span> <span id="s1050">Ellis Island is within easy sight of Beloes Island on which is the Statue of Liberty).</span> <span id="s1051">Now my parents had heard about Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1052">That was the place where they took the would be immigrants when there was something the matter with them.</span> <span id="s1053">Actually it was only a fluke.</span> <span id="s1054">They had just decided to take some twenty people there for examination and we happened to be amongst them.</span> <span id="s1055">We were taken in front of a judge with a black bailiff.</span> <span id="s1056">That was the first time that we had seen a black man in action as a civilian government employee.</span> <span id="s1057">There also was a black interpreter.</span> <span id="s1058">The judge asked a simple question: “How much money did we have with us?”</span> <span id="s1059">And who was going to see to it that we were not going to go on welfare.</span> <span id="s1060">He also wanted to know what our destination was and whether we would sign a little certificate on the passports and on the immigration permit.</span> <span id="s1061">Then we were free to go!</span> <span id="s1062">Of course we did not know where to go.</span> <span id="s1063">However luckily the people who were our sponsors and who had heard from the port officer that we had been taken to Ellis Island, they met us out by the port.</span> <span id="s1064">My mother relaxed a bit, she didn’t feel so completely lost anymore.</span> <span id="s1065">However my parents were eager enough to get going and not to stick around where any one else could take us back to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1066">These people invited us to stay with them and spend a couple of days in New York.</span> <span id="s1067">We got acquainted with my mother’s sister who would take us, as fast as possible, as they could arrange for transportation to get us to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Your sponsors lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1070">They were two New York men.</span> <span id="s1071">They had a long established clothing manufacturing concern.</span> <span id="s1072">They would have liked to see us stay, but then they took us, my brother and myself, across the Hudson River on a ferry to New Jersey to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad terminal.</span> <span id="s1073">My father insisted that he pay for our own tickets.</span> <span id="s1074">My parents were truly independent and proud, they were used to taking care of their own.</span> <span id="s1075">They did not want gifts other than what was absolutely necessary.</span> <span id="s1076">My father bought our tickets to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1077">We traveled by coach.</span> <span id="s1078">We took off for Cincinnati where our relatives met us at the Union Terminal the following morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Could you describe some of the problems which you had in getting established and also some of the difficulties in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: We two boys had hardly any problems.</span> <span id="s1081">We had an aunt, actually we had more relatives than that but one aunt took charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How was she related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: She was the older sister of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1084">My mother had two sisters there.</span> <span id="s1085">One was a nurse at Children’s Hospital and the older aunt who was employed at the Jewish Convalescent Home in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1086">Another one, I believe sold insurance.</span> <span id="s1087">Her last name was Sandmel or Samuel.</span> <span id="s1088">All of them went by their maiden name.</span> <span id="s1089">I had one uncle, his name was Otto Samuel.</span> <span id="s1090">He was married, he had a wife who was a nurse and a little girl, maybe two years old.</span> <span id="s1091">We still see her.</span> <span id="s1092">The younger aunt who was at Children’s Hospital was called Hanna Samuel.</span> <span id="s1093">She later got married but divorced before she died.</span> <span id="s1094">The older aunt had two or three sons, she went also by the name of Miss Samuel.</span> <span id="s1095">She had been married and had the three children, but that is another story.</span> <span id="s1096">However she is the one that took charge.</span> <span id="s1097">She lived in a suburb of Cincinnati, in Price Hill.</span> <span id="s1098">She saw to it that we got in touch with the Cincinnati Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s1099">One part of that agency was to see to it that the newly arrived Jewish immigrants got on their feet.</span> <span id="s1100">We didn’t even want help so they enlisted us immediately in getting us a job selling papers in a downtown for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s1101">My father got a job in a downtown clothing establishment, a clothing manufacturer.</span> <span id="s1102">He didn’t care too much about it.</span> <span id="s1103">My mother was offered a job in a Jewish bookshop, through the Cincinnati Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s1104">She did not like the bookshop because all she could do was sell books.</span> <span id="s1105">She wanted to be more independent.</span> <span id="s1106">Then she worked for rooming and boarding houses.</span> <span id="s1107">She made lunches and so forth.</span> <span id="s1108">So with a little help from my relatives we got a bigger apartment in Avondale.</span> <span id="s1109">This was the Jewish suburb of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1110">(located just north of the Cincinnati zoo).</span> <span id="s1111">She advertised in the paper of the agency and got two old ladies to take care of.</span> <span id="s1112">She also established her position as being a good hostess for meetings by ladies auxiliaries and societies which wanted to have a catered luncheon and they used to come to our really big apartment.</span> <span id="s1113">However catering the luncheon got to be too much of a chore in addition to the family so she met household expenses by just having these women boarders.</span> <span id="s1114">The agency was glad to find a home for these ladies, as a matter of fact, she kept that up working through the Jewish Agency until maybe late in the 50th, providing homes for elderly people who lived there and she took care of them.</span> <span id="s1115">My father had more of a problem in finding a decent job.</span> <span id="s1116">Of course in the middle 30’s jobs were not that easy to find.</span> <span id="s1117">I don’t remember the details but someplace he ran into a friend or a man whom he thought he recognized at a function not of Jews from Germany but for ex-Germans.</span> <span id="s1118">The function was run by some of the Over the Rhine organizations of strictly gentile Germans for the newly arrived Jewish Germans.</span> <span id="s1119">They wanted to extend a welcome hand toward them that showed them that even though they had anti-Jewish activities by the German-American Bund of Cincinnati (the German-American Bund was an organization of German Americans who favored Hitler Germany and opposed the pro-allied policies of the Roosevelt administration in all aspects, it was active until the United States entry into World War II) these were not their feelings and they wanted to make it easier for these German Jews to be Jews, rather than foreigners and to get them to participate in their German activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Did the newly arrived German Jews accept that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: It was not very successful.</span> <span id="s1122">There was some acceptance.</span> <span id="s1123">There were some contacts made; however the newly arrived Jews were so afraid that these might be German spies or that there might be something later on to this special interest.</span> <span id="s1124">However my father went to them.</span> <span id="s1125">The biggest reason he saw was the possible association with the churches.</span> <span id="s1126">Exposing himself to Christianity.</span> <span id="s1127">The original Messianic Jews were participants.</span> <span id="s1128">However, as luck would have it, he ran into a party and he recognized him.</span> <span id="s1129">This social contact turned out that they had not seen one another since 1917, when this fellow was the mess sergeant of my father’s German Army outfit on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1130">My father who had been a medic had been assigned to be a kitchen helper from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1131">So my father worked for this guy in the kitchen peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s1132">So, after their meeting, they had a little reunion and talked about World War I and they found out that my father was not in a job which he particularly liked.</span> <span id="s1133">So this fellow asked him whether he would like to come to work for him since he was the chef of the Hotel Alps.</span> <span id="s1134">So my father got himself a job in the Hotel Alps kitchen.</span> <span id="s1135">He was given a job which he particularly liked.</span> <span id="s1136">He was made supervisor of the pantry.</span> <span id="s1137">He had four or five colored people, as they were called, working for him.</span> <span id="s1138">He did not know how to get along with them.</span> <span id="s1139">He made a go of it.</span> <span id="s1140">He was the man in the kitchen for years under the stewardship of the chef.</span> <span id="s1141">So my father worked there until he retired.</span> <span id="s1142">He got promoted to what you call Second Chef.</span> <span id="s1143">He worked behind the stove most of the time.</span> <span id="s1144">When the job became too difficult for him, after he had several heart attacks in 1964, I think, he left that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Was there any language barrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Not too badly.</span> <span id="s1147">The English instructions which we have had from our teachers helped quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1148">However my parents had problems with the conversational portion.</span> <span id="s1149">The only problem we had was in the first three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s1150">We had difficulties when we went to the grocery store.</span> <span id="s1151">One of the big factors was that we started speaking mostly English at home and when our parents spoke to us in German we answered them in English.</span> <span id="s1152">They did really well.</span> <span id="s1153">They were able to help themselves.</span> <span id="s1154">School was no problem, since the public schools had had such an influx of students, not only of Jews.</span> <span id="s1155">They gave classes at several of the public schools for foreigners in all kinds of things such as English, basic English and advanced courses in English literature etc.</span> <span id="s1156">My parents participated to the best of their ability.</span> <span id="s1157">We didn’t have much trouble with the language.</span> <span id="s1158">Friends of ours couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1159">It was very tough for some other people whom we knew.</span> <span id="s1160">We were just lucky to be able to make an awful lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Did you receive any type of aid from other Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: No, my parents refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: It was offered though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yes, it was offered!</span> <span id="s1165">Money was offered from our sponsors in New York.</span> <span id="s1166">My parents didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1167">They soon earned their own living, as a matter of fact the first time my parents really accepted any kind of assistance that was a scholarship in Cincinnati, after high school.</span> <span id="s1168">They didn’t consider that as charity.</span> <span id="s1169">However any other offer for help was rejected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Mr. Leeser, could you tell us something about your acceptance into the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s1171">Besides these material offers, was there a different kind of offer.</span> <span id="s1172">Were there difficulties in becoming acclimated to the Jewish community and to American life in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: No, I don’t remember any.</span> <span id="s1174">Some other people had a little more problems than my parents but there were many Jews who were phased into life totally from the social as well as the religious life.</span> <span id="s1175">Many people who came ahead of us had a social group immediately.</span> <span id="s1176">We didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s1177">As soon as we left Price Hill people were real friendly but we couldn’t understand their religious services and their religious preferences.</span> <span id="s1178">Once we were established in Avondale we were invited to come to a reception at the Jewish center near Avondale.</span> <span id="s1179">We found out immediately as a matter of fact when we were approached by one of the authorities, to form a club under the auspices of the Jewish Center for newly arrived Jewish youngsters.</span> <span id="s1180">I got to be the ringleader or the first president but it grew very quickly until we had 22 people who participated in our once a week meetings.</span> <span id="s1181">We got introduced to other Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1182">Several of them became friends.</span> <span id="s1183">Some of the youngsters were actually born in the United States whose parents saw a need to belong to a group with strictly German background.</span> <span id="s1184">Still we attended that group regularly.</span> <span id="s1185">We felt that the organization needed to have a name.</span> <span id="s1186">we called ourselves “The Vivalet” which is Tel Aviv spelled backwards.</span> <span id="s1187">Our group attracted native born American children who were generally of a strictly German background.</span> <span id="s1188">It was a membership requirement that all the kids were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Wasn’t there another organization established of German-Jewish youngsters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: There were two.</span> <span id="s1191">One of them was short-lived.</span> <span id="s1192">The other one is still in existence.</span> <span id="s1193">I can’t remember the street right now where it is.</span> <span id="s1194">It was the forerunner of the present (transcriber cannot understand the word here) congregation.</span> <span id="s1195">It is a good sized organization with a synagogue which is strictly super-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1196">When we first came, because of their own objectives, my parents did not immediately join a Jewish congregation.</span> <span id="s1197">Because of one of the tenants we had, one of the elderly ladies who had been the organist at Rockdale Temple, most of her life, we were introduced to the President of Rockdale Temple to Dr. Reichart (transcriber is not sure of the spelling) and of the Rabbi Emeritus, whose name I cannot recall right now.</span> <span id="s1198">(Here CK suggests some name to PL but it does not ring a bell.)</span> <span id="s1199">they found out who we were and, in appreciation of the fact that my mother took care of the retired organist they induced us to membership by the way of cutting our dues.</span> <span id="s1200">That means that the monetary contribution was so that we could make it without any hardship.</span> <span id="s1201">I was one of the few newcomers of Rockdale Temple who was of German origin because this type of Reform was foreign to us (Reform Judaism in post world War I Germany was relatively close to Conservative Judaism in the United States in both philosophy and ceremonials).</span> <span id="s1202">We had no reform movement.</span> <span id="s1203">The freedom to preach and the absence of certain symbols, pomp and circumstance was new to us, even the overall effect appeared to be close to a church.</span> <span id="s1204">As you probably know, this type of reform service has been modified during our lifetime at HUC (Hebrew Union College i.e. the School which was then centered in Cincinnati which alone, educated and ordained rabbis for the Reform Jewish movement).</span> <span id="s1205">This was too much like a Christian service for us.</span> <span id="s1206">It did not seem like home to us.</span> <span id="s1207">Most of our other refugee friends from Germany went to religious services elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1208">They tended to become leaders in the German congregations or they switched and they moved to North Avondale, then they became active in that congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Was there any friction between the native born American Reform Jews of German background and the German immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: No.</span> <span id="s1211">The friction existed only between Eastern European Jews and the new German immigrants.</span> <span id="s1212">(Such friction had existed in Europe between German Jews and those from Eastern Jews who had been forced to live in ghettos and therefore were less sophisticated, something which the German and other Western Jews had been brainwashed as being something to be ashamed of).</span> <span id="s1213">The Native Americans were perhaps even too paternalistic, there was no friction at all.</span> <span id="s1214">They didn’t want to downgrade us; they were perhaps even too helpful, especially those who were very wealthy, but in all cases they wanted to do for us, more than what was required.</span> <span id="s1215">Never was there any friction with the existing community of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1216">If there was any difficulty it was with the businessmen and lawyers and doctors, never with the journeymen, even that didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s1217">I had a very interesting conversation with the man who became my father-in-law on the subject.</span> <span id="s1218">I was a refugee, while he was not.</span> <span id="s1219">All in all we faced a real welcome.</span> <span id="s1220">The thing which bothered my parents the most is that when we told about our experiences of Nazi oppression and persecution and what early on we had leaned about concentration camps, we could not find anyone who would believe us.</span> <span id="s1221">We could see by the attitudes of the people we talked to that they thought that they were gross exaggerations, that that couldn’t possibly exist.</span> <span id="s1222">It bothered us how we could make those people believe that it can happen here!</span> <span id="s1223">That you can’t trust the Nazis!</span> <span id="s1224">That you can’t laugh about the very active German-American Bund, that you really have to figure then out,</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: You were trying to get people to believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No.</span> <span id="s1227">When it came around in conversation when the questions were asked something like: “How was it in Germany?”</span> <span id="s1228">or “Why did you leave from there?”</span> <span id="s1229">Then the disbelief and the smirks of the people.</span> <span id="s1230">This was not just with the Jewish population, the same thing happened in school.</span> <span id="s1231">For instance, the first few days during our civics class, the only one who believed that we were telling, literally exposing, how the Jews were faring, what was happening, was the teacher.</span> <span id="s1232">The other children failed to understand that maybe things like that could happen, they wanted to be protected, they didn’t want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: How would you compare life in the United States with that in Europe, when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: That is really hard to say, especially for boys our age.</span> <span id="s1235">Everything is a great adventure.</span> <span id="s1236">You learn something new.</span> <span id="s1237">You meet new friends.</span> <span id="s1238">German sport is mainly soccer and a type of field hand ball which is not played here.</span> <span id="s1239">We learned about baseball.</span> <span id="s1240">We even started to play at the Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s1241">Maybe that was when our uncle took my brother and myself to see a baseball game.</span> <span id="s1242">We had never even considered that as a sport in which we could participate.</span> <span id="s1243">Well then the baseball season is passed and you have to learn all about football.</span> <span id="s1244">Another consideration is that we had to earn money.</span> <span id="s1245">We didn’t mind learning in the United States high schools.</span> <span id="s1246">That seemed to be too simple for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: The amount of studying one had to do and the amount of attention one had to pay in class.</span> <span id="s1249">The relatively short hours which you spent in school.</span> <span id="s1250">They used to serve us truly luxurious lunches in school.</span> <span id="s1251">We had, as first impressions that going to school was a pleasure.</span> <span id="s1252">The studying we had to do in the high schools in Germany compared to what we had to do here was a lot.</span> <span id="s1253">It was so much easier here.</span> <span id="s1254">Being fully trained in memorizing and studying in Germany made it very easy for us, to get by without much work.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t want to give the impression that I am some kind of a genius but I finished high school in three years.</span> <span id="s1256">My brother could do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1257">He was one year younger and he was behind me.</span> <span id="s1258">He got used to staying after school to do extra curricular things.</span> <span id="s1259">I never participated much in such activities.</span> <span id="s1260">He finished his schooling in four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Did you have any problems making friends in your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Most school friends, initially were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1263">Most friends around home, the ones with whom I played baseball, went to the movies with, started dating and so forth were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1264">The group we studied with contained as many non-Jews as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: There were no difficulties of a personal nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: How do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Finding a job, going to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No!</span> <span id="s1269">I had no trouble doing either.</span> <span id="s1270">My brother had no difficulties either, he could have gone to college but he landed a job through an advertisement which he answered.</span> <span id="s1271">He had a steady girlfriend who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1272">He started dating her as a freshman in high school.</span> <span id="s1273">He needed more money for his personal appearance to impress this girl which he was trying to go out and date.</span> <span id="s1274">He finally got his degree after four years in high school.</span> <span id="s1275">I felt that I wanted to finish my education.</span> <span id="s1276">Because I was one of the better students, I got a fairly generous scholarship.</span> <span id="s1277">I didn’t need to use it up because my studies were interrupted by my military service and then I finished up on the GI bill (that was the United States law which granted benefits to servicemen from World War II who had been discharged honorably -- one of the benefits from that was to pay for an ex-serviceman’s education in proportion to the number of months he or she had spent on active military service; it paid for the schooling and the books and the fees, up to a monthly maximum and gave the ex-serviceman a monthly living allowance).</span> <span id="s1278">I went to school and I had no difficulties adjusting to meet my needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Mr. Leeser, how did you get into the military service and what were the experiences you had when you went back to Germany while you were in the armed services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: While I was in college in my sophomore year, I tried to enlist.</span> <span id="s1281">However, unfortunately in those days I was still classified as an “Enemy Alien”, so I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1282">I was in ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps).</span> <span id="s1283">I had joined the Pershing-Rifles, which is an ROTC honorary organization.</span> <span id="s1284">Then I was told that I was an -- I forgot what the section is under the Selective Service Act of 1940, and that until I was fully investigated I could not become a member of the armed forces.</span> <span id="s1285">The FBI was all the time investigating, I mean it got all the people all excited, especially when they were told that they could not tell my parents that they were asking questions about their boy.</span> <span id="s1286">Naturally as soon as the FBI agents left, all the neighbors called my mother up and told her that they were after me.</span> <span id="s1287">However I had been told in school by the ROTC instructors that this was the course of action which was being taken.</span> <span id="s1288">Towards the beginning of my pre-junior year, at the university.</span> <span id="s1289">I received my greetings (the letter notifying individuals that they were being drafted into the World War II military service started with the word “greetings” therefore that term was used for notification to present oneself for induction).</span> <span id="s1290">I didn’t make any attempts to delay my induction using continued schooling or another excuse.</span> <span id="s1291">All of us at the university wanted to serve in the armed forces.</span> <span id="s1292">So I was inducted in 1941 or ’42, and it staved off any consequences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Did you feel any sense of revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1295">I wanted to go back to Germany and get revenge.</span> <span id="s1296">Of course I had a list of what I wanted to see could be done.</span> <span id="s1297">I carried this list throughout my career and as luck would have it I was selected for Ordnance Corps and went to Aberdeen Proving Ground for basic training.</span> <span id="s1298">Oh, I had my choice, I could either have gone to OCS (Officers Candidate School) or to ASTP (Army Specialist Training Program, this was a program which the United States Army had at several colleges and universities throughout the country many of them leading to bachelor’s degree if you were allowed to stay with them; the United States Navy had similar programs).</span> <span id="s1299">My commanding officer told me that although being an officer might be fun, I would be so much better off, since I had started college, going to the ASTP program.</span> <span id="s1300">Following his advice I went, after a brief delay en route and several camps, and stayed in NYC at the billets at CCNY (College of the City of New York at 139th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan) waiting for an assignment; then I was sent to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).</span> <span id="s1301">Unfortunately the army decided after three months that they needed more bodies across the ocean, in the fighting forces, so they had to discontinue the ASTP program, as well as similar programs for the Navy and the Air Force (the Air Force was still a part of the Army until after World War II).</span> <span id="s1302">Then we were assigned to fighting units.</span> <span id="s1303">I was assigned to the 78th Division at Camp Pickett.</span> <span id="s1304">That was an infantry group.</span> <span id="s1305">I learned to be a B.A.R. man on a weapon’s carrier.</span> <span id="s1306">BAR stands for Browning Automatic Rifle.</span> <span id="s1307">On the weapon’s carrier was a fellow twice my weight and my height who had a much easier time carrying a case of ammunition than I had with the Browning Automatic weapon.</span> <span id="s1308">However before the division sailed for overseas, openings came about for personnel ordinance training.</span> <span id="s1309">So I went to the light ordinance maintenance company of the division.</span> <span id="s1310">I went overseas with that company to Germany.</span> <span id="s1311">(He actually means to Europe).</span> <span id="s1312">We landed in England, there we went to the south shore for organizational and developmental purposes.</span> <span id="s1313">We stayed near Southampton in a place called Christ Church, more for vacation than for military services.</span> <span id="s1314">From there, right after the invasion of Normandy (that was June 6, 1944) we went on a transport to Le Havre.</span> <span id="s1315">Then the division got into the normal fighting up to the Rhine River and across it to the Ruhr valley.</span> <span id="s1316">I stayed wit the ordinance company as an instrument and fire control repairman.</span> <span id="s1317">When the fighting was practically over our division went to Berlin as an occupation troop.</span> <span id="s1318">In between I had several opportunities to observe what happened to places about which I had known.</span> <span id="s1319">When we lived near Aachen, I got permission from my captain to take a truck to the city of Cologne, and to take time off.</span> <span id="s1320">That was the last known residence of my maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s1321">I went to the cemeteries and found the tombstones.</span> <span id="s1322">The cemeteries like most other cemeteries had been pretty well vandalized.</span> <span id="s1323">For two packs of cigarettes and a chocolate bar we got German masons to re-erect the stone of my grandmother in one cemetery and of my grandfather in another one.</span> <span id="s1324">We cemented it down and they didn’t want to take the little pay we had with us.</span> <span id="s1325">You know currency wasn’t any good.</span> <span id="s1326">They were so scared that people were going to execute them on the spot for the little work they did.</span> <span id="s1327">The stones, from what I hear from relatives who have been there since, were put in better than they had been put in the first time.</span> <span id="s1328">However, I didn’t find any traces of Jews or of Jewish life in Cologne since early in the fighting.</span> <span id="s1329">When I went further inland I had the opportunity to visit Rinteln, the city where I had lived most of my life in Germany.</span> <span id="s1330">I caused quite a furor when I and two of my then Jewish army buddies arrived in town.</span> <span id="s1331">We called on the Burgermeister (the mayor of the town) to tell him who we were and ask him whether any of my friends were still around.</span> <span id="s1332">I had gotten a letter from my mother out of which the censor had cut out quite a few of the words, but all the names of the Germans who had done us dirt -- with whom I wanted to get even -- were left intact.</span> <span id="s1333">Oddly enough none of those names, the big time Nazis, including the barber about whom I spoke, the one who had been the main attacker of the store, were there any more.</span> <span id="s1334">It was reported that when the barber had heard that there was a Leeser coming back to town, he left hurriedly.</span> <span id="s1335">Afterwards he was never heard from again.</span> <span id="s1336">He went to the Russian front and probably met with an accident.</span> <span id="s1337">One Jewish lady, actually this lady was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1338">She had married a Jew and then, had turned Jewish.</span> <span id="s1339">Their children were brought up as Jews.</span> <span id="s1340">Their name was Rosenthul.</span> <span id="s1341">She was the only one who had come back to Rinteln this early in the game.</span> <span id="s1342">She had been hiding.</span> <span id="s1343">She had her son, who was still being careful not to be seen around because they couldn’t be certain that there weren’t any hidden SS people, although for them the war was practically over.</span> <span id="s1344">She told me of other Jews, or half Jews (these were people not all of whose grandparents were Jewish) who had remained and had planned to come back to the town.</span> <span id="s1345">However the local authorities, the Burgermeister, who was in the British Zone (Germany was divided into Russian, British, French and the U.S. Zones in May 1945) left word with the British occupation troops that this visiting American was causing a ruckus, that he acted like a prize fighter, and that he didn’t want any trouble.</span> <span id="s1346">So the British commander invited us for dinner, the three of us.</span> <span id="s1347">They filled us full of booze and good spirits but by nightfall or early morning we were not ready to look up any of the ex-Nazis and do to them what we had meant to do.</span> <span id="s1348">We were going to find some SS people and hang them up by their heels and let the ants eat up their heads.</span> <span id="s1349">Now we had seen, not necessarily Jews, but people whom especially the SS people had done dirt to, had met their revenge that way.</span> <span id="s1350">It was not a very pleasant sight, but we thought that it was a well deserved fate for some of them.</span> <span id="s1351">Well, the Britishers, in town, with the guidance of the Burgermeister saw to it that any of those people whom we didn’t trust, who had not been caught by the de-Nazification court got out of town fast.</span> <span id="s1352">They may even have arrested them even possibly put them in jails.</span> <span id="s1353">In any case they got them out of sight because there was no trace of them in the city of Rinteln.</span> <span id="s1354">They didn’t know it but we had some friends; there was a little village, where the homestead was of the family from whom all our maids had come, a little village by the name of Wellenhamp (spelled by PL) On our bicycle rides from Rinteln we had gone there.</span> <span id="s1355">It is about ten minutes by car.</span> <span id="s1356">The three of us pulled into the farm, which was this homestead.</span> <span id="s1357">The family name was Junkers.</span> <span id="s1358">They recognized me immediately and we had a real homecoming.</span> <span id="s1359">Three of their daughters who had been our maids were married with families and were living on the parental farm.</span> <span id="s1360">The old people had died.</span> <span id="s1361">We had a tearful reunion.</span> <span id="s1362">They had to know everything that had happened to us.</span> <span id="s1363">We didn’t know how much time we had away from our base; that was unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1364">We didn’t eat with them.</span> <span id="s1365">We had heard that farm families, even though they were growing a lot of things were not too well off with foodstuff.</span> <span id="s1366">So we showed them our “K” rations or “C” rations (these rations were packaged food units which American troops carried with them).</span> <span id="s1367">While they eat their meals we spent most of the afternoon talking.</span> <span id="s1368">My two buddies didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s1369">I learned from them the fate of most of the Jewish community from Rinteln.</span> <span id="s1370">I wrote a long note about that to my parents in the morning.</span> <span id="s1371">They were interested in knowing what happened to every one of them.</span> <span id="s1372">I learned that a young lady who had been my girlfriend, so to say, in terms of 15 or 16 years old in Europe (dating was much less advanced than in the U.S.) had been drafted from a concentration camp into the service for a Berlin hospital, first for the terminally ill, and then highly infectious diseases.</span> <span id="s1373">She caught one of those diseases and died in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1374">I also learned that I had a cousin by the name of Hilde who had reportedly been back to Buckenburg looking for relatives, looking for anybody who had been in a concentration camp and that, perhaps, I could find her somewhere.</span> <span id="s1375">Well, we had to get back to camp.</span> <span id="s1376">We said our good-byes and hoped to see them again.</span> <span id="s1377">Since that time my brother had been back there, that was long afterwards as a civilian.</span> <span id="s1378">Quite a few of them had died.</span> <span id="s1379">They still remembered my calling on them.</span> <span id="s1380">I knew that some of their family had turned Nazi and had been nasty to the girls who had worked for us.</span> <span id="s1381">They had thought that maybe I would take a torch and burn the town down.</span> <span id="s1382">Well I had actually considered doing harm to the town.</span> <span id="s1383">Then I started to worry about my cousin Hilde.</span> <span id="s1384">After I got back to camp, this was before we were in Berlin, we were then near Kassel, I got in touch with the UNRA (United Nation Refugee Agency) representative to find out how I could find this cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s1385">They helped me.</span> <span id="s1386">All of a sudden my captain got a call that one of the DP camps (camps for Displaced Persons, those were the camps where all the people who were homeless and therefore wandering through Europe lived in temporary shelter for as long as several years until they could be resettled in some country in the western world) was looking for one of his soldiers by the name of Leeser.</span> <span id="s1387">I got a little worried (at that time the U.S. Army had a “Non-Fraternization Policy” where all those who talked or otherwise made contacts with Germans, except in the line of duty, received a $64 fine and possibly a court martial and the Germans were jailed); but it was a call from the Russian UNRA worker to the American Leeser.</span> <span id="s1388">Through their good offices I made arrangements to meet my cousin in Buckenburg.</span> <span id="s1389">That was not too far away from where we were, in a car anyway.</span> <span id="s1390">I got official leave from my captain, drove to Buckenburg.</span> <span id="s1391">We didn’t know where to meet so we met in the courtyard of the home where our grandmother used to live.</span> <span id="s1392">It was quite a reunion.</span> <span id="s1393">She told me her story.</span> <span id="s1394">I helped her get in touch with a DP camp where the UNRA talked to her.</span> <span id="s1395">She got in touch with my folks in Cincinnati so that she could come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1396">She had quite a tale to tell.</span> <span id="s1397">She was arrested with her parents and her young brother.</span> <span id="s1398">She did not know whether it was the Gestapo, or maybe just uniformed German police officials.</span> <span id="s1399">They were all taken to Buchenwald (this is the camp south of Berlin and west of Dresden which was liberated April 12, 1945) first and then within days were moved to Bergen Belasen (this camp was located near Hanover) on a long and painful, train trip.</span> <span id="s1400">Shortly after they arrived in Bergen Belsen came the by now well known shower scene.</span> <span id="s1401">A German soldier had already latched on to her.</span> <span id="s1402">He promised her that if she would be his servant and shine his shoes and cook his meals and clean his room and sleep in his bed he would see to it that she had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1403">From him she learned that there was nothing she could do about it but when her parents asked to get undressed and take a shower that she was not to go with them.</span> <span id="s1404">He said that he had work for her, that she should mention his name.</span> <span id="s1405">When they left in the parade, which, according to her, was very shuffling she stayed with her German soldier friend who was then a private and became later a sergeant and moved away from the concentration camp into duty on the front.</span> <span id="s1406">She went with this soldier friend and, close to the Russian front this particular unit of Germans surrendered after heavy fighting, but that is another story, and I will cut the entire story very short.</span> <span id="s1407">She was with this soldier for maybe three years, maybe as long as four years.</span> <span id="s1408">When the fighting on the Russian front got a little heavy, we, the Americans, were attacking from the other side.</span> <span id="s1409">Her sergeant and his comrades all ran for it.</span> <span id="s1410">They thought that they could make it back to the American lines, because they would rather be captured by Americans than Russians.</span> <span id="s1411">Their hired help was left behind in the camp, with no food, no clothing, no water.</span> <span id="s1412">Hilde and a few other survivors then started walking.</span> <span id="s1413">They tried to find maybe some potatoes from one of the farmers.</span> <span id="s1414">They were rescued and interrogated by the advancing Russians.</span> <span id="s1415">Both her feet were frostbitten.</span> <span id="s1416">The Russians took her to one of their hospitals or first aid stations.</span> <span id="s1417">They asked her to identify herself and maybe they believed her, or maybe they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1418">She had a language problem with them.</span> <span id="s1419">They told her that she had to sign a piece of paper which would allow them to amputate all but the big toe on one foot.</span> <span id="s1420">They told her that, otherwise she would lose a foot.</span> <span id="s1421">She didn’t have much choice but to have it done.</span> <span id="s1422">Later, as the Russians advanced, the two lines (Americans and Russians) met, they transferred her to French troops which took her to the American zone, to a DP camp.</span> <span id="s1423">She knew about her American relatives.</span> <span id="s1424">She knew that her parents were dead, but she didn’t know about anybody else in the family.</span> <span id="s1425">Later, through the efforts of UNRA, they located me, another Leeser, because of the family name.</span> <span id="s1426">Hilde is still living in NYC.</span> <span id="s1427">She is married.</span> <span id="s1428">Because of the treatments which she received from the Germans in the concentration camp, she can’t have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: I would like to get back to your life now, but before I do that let me say that I am not sure that when you came to this country how long did it take you to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1430">You talked about being investigated by the FBI.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: No!</span> <span id="s1432">My parents became citizens the routine way (eligibility for the hearing by the judge after five years) We all went and got what is called the first papers.</span> <span id="s1433">(That is a formal first application which is a notice of intention to file for citizen papers and which made one eligible for such things as the military draft) just as soon as we were allowed to do so.</span> <span id="s1434">In order to become a citizen you had to prove, to the satisfaction of the judge, a proficiency in English and in American history.</span> <span id="s1435">We all went to classes in the U.S. My parents actually became naturalized before I did because in the service, in order to become a citizen, you had to have your application transferred to the jurisdiction where it belongs.</span> <span id="s1436">After I went to Aberdeen it went to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1437">After I left Aberdeen Proving Ground and I went to New York City it went to Albany (PL is mistaken here because the judge of the Southern district Court of New York, located in Manhattan was a competent authority).</span> <span id="s1438">When I left CCNY for MIT my papers were sent to Boston.</span> <span id="s1439">The papers caught up with me.</span> <span id="s1440">The commanding officer got the letter for me, stating that I was required to appear in front of the district judge to be sworn in as a U.S. citizen and that I needed one witness with me.</span> <span id="s1441">He came himself and that is how I got my middle name.</span> <span id="s1442">His name was Jerome Browning, Captain Browning.</span> <span id="s1443">When the judge said: “Is there a middle initial?”</span> <span id="s1444">he spoke up and said: “This boy is going to be named after me!</span> <span id="s1445">It is Paul Jerome Leeser.”</span> <span id="s1446">So I was naturalized in Boston.</span> <span id="s1447">It was no big deal.</span> <span id="s1448">Everybody who was in court was wearing a uniform.</span> <span id="s1449">You didn’t get preferential treatment as a soldier except for the fact that if you were in the service they expedited the forwarding of your application to the proper jurisdiction, better than if you had been a civilian.</span> <span id="s1450">(Actually, if you were in the military active service, that means the army since the navy did not accept non-civilians, the five-year waiting period for eligibility was waived).</span> <span id="s1451">This is why my naturalization papers were made out in Boston, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Can you describe your present life now, in terms of occupation and religious practices?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: We were married in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1454">We belonged to Rockdale Temple until we left Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1455">Because of the job situation we went to Wisconsin we were in a rural situation where there was only one couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: That was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A; That was early in 1946, when we were married.</span> <span id="s1458">We left for Wisconsin in 1949.</span> <span id="s1459">We joined the temple there.</span> <span id="s1460">The temple there, because of the influence of a wealthier congregant was very conservative.</span> <span id="s1461">However the congregation was large enough to have two rabbis.</span> <span id="s1462">Actually it had both a temple and a shul, actually it was not a temple but a synagogue (Reform Judaism calls its Houses of Worship temples whereas both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism call theirs synagogues).</span> <span id="s1463">While we were there the community was challenged that whatever funds you raise we will match so they built a one million dollar building.</span> <span id="s1464">It looked like a nicely growing community.</span> <span id="s1465">For reasons which I can’t figure out they didn’t grow.</span> <span id="s1466">I got to be an officer in the congregation, the secretary, for all the years we lived there.</span> <span id="s1467">I belonged to B’nai Brith (the Jewish benevolent organization whose formal name literally means ‘son of the covenant’) My wife Becky belonged to Hadassah (Women Zionist organization).</span> <span id="s1468">In a small town you can’t avoid joining organizations if you want any social contact with other Jews and we did.</span> <span id="s1469">I was working a (transcriber cannot understand the name) concern.</span> <span id="s1470">I had been involved with machine tools all my life and I was the first Jew whom they ever hired.</span> <span id="s1471">There were several Jewish employees after I had the job.</span> <span id="s1472">We were pretty close to the Jewish community, most of our friends and social contacts were Jews, except for our neighbors.</span> <span id="s1473">In that area there are no ghettos.</span> <span id="s1474">The only people living close together might be a sister and a brother, both married, having inherited a large estate which they split, otherwise neighbors just find each other.</span> <span id="s1475">Since our neighbors were gentile, we had quite a few gentile friends.</span> <span id="s1476">We always had neighborhood parties.</span> <span id="s1477">When we had friends over from the Jewish community we didn’t think anything because the neighbors also used to entertain, every now and again for their particular church groups.</span> <span id="s1478">None of us thought that this was strange at all as a matter of fact we could mix them; if you had the church group and one of the neighbors who was pretty close to you from the favors standpoint and knew you were entertaining they helped you, and we did the same thing for them when they had their Sunday school teachers’ picnic.</span> <span id="s1479">So the minister and everything, from one of the Presbyterian group came over.</span> <span id="s1480">It didn’t make any difference what their religious background were.</span> <span id="s1481">That was much less than is the case in Richmond, today.</span> <span id="s1482">The Jews were totally integrated.</span> <span id="s1483">There were nominally anti-Semitic activities which you have anywhere, where there are some very wealthy Jews living.</span> <span id="s1484">The derogatory remarks were made which sometimes are not meant to be derogatory, For example, this expression is more predominant in Richmond than it was in Wisconsin: “To Jew someone down!”</span> <span id="s1485">Now I know what it means, however some of our friends got fighting mad about it.</span> <span id="s1486">Did they really mean to be anti-Semitic?</span> <span id="s1487">Who am I to answer that.</span> <span id="s1488">I really don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s1489">I think that we can debate that point.</span> <span id="s1490">I know that one of our students was very upset about it and said that it was an example of latent anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1491">I am well acquainted with that.</span> <span id="s1492">However in Wisconsin we had less of that than we had in Indiana.</span> <span id="s1493">There is no active Klu-Klux-Klan in Wisconsin, people are too independent.</span> <span id="s1494">Of course there also are no blacks to pick on up there.</span> <span id="s1495">The black population in Wisconsin is very, very low, there are a few in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s1496">Blacks don’t like the climate.</span> <span id="s1497">In the little town where we were there was one black family.</span> <span id="s1498">They had an easy time there.</span> <span id="s1499">There was no anti-Negro sentiment there either.</span> <span id="s1500">At least, in the past, there was very little anti-Semitism there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Do you speak English in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1503">Yes, practically exclusively.</span> <span id="s1504">Except when my daughter and I get together and we want to buffalo my wife into something, then we may speak German.</span> <span id="s1505">Becky doesn’t speak either of the foreign languages.</span> <span id="s1506">My daughter taught quite a few languages in school but otherwise we speak only English.</span> <span id="s1507">We utilize some Jewish expressions.</span> <span id="s1508">We know some people who speak Yiddish fluently and we try to keep up with them, but I had to learn Yiddish after my marriage to speak it.</span> <span id="s1509">Becky understands every word, but if you were to speak it when she would have trouble understanding you.</span> <span id="s1510">Her mother spoke it.</span> <span id="s1511">So practically only English is spoken in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: How often do you attend services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Regularly, on Friday nights and on Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1514">Unfortunately my health does not permit me to still do it now.</span> <span id="s1515">I can’t walk and I feel out of sorts readily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Do you feel that the synagogue is the center of Jewish community life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: In a small town yes!</span> <span id="s1518">In a large town I don’t think so anymore.</span> <span id="s1519">There are too many synagogues.</span> <span id="s1520">They are not the center of community life.</span> <span id="s1521">Rather the Jewish social services and the Jewish center whatever you may have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Do you mainly associate with Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: I have to think about that.</span> <span id="s1524">Most of our associations are with Jews, although in general, when we were in Wisconsin, all of our neighbors were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1525">We were good friends with our neighbors across the street and those next door and they happened to be of various Christian denominations.</span> <span id="s1526">One of them was a Seventh Day Adventist and one of them was an atheist, so we had a pretty good mixture.</span> <span id="s1527">You know, you mingle with them, they come to your house, they break bread with you and maybe you share a meal.</span> <span id="s1528">For bigger social events though the guests are usually Jewish or you are invited out somewhere in the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: When did you come to Richmond?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: In 1963.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: That is about 15 years ago!</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Do you find the Jewish and non-Jewish community life similar or different to that which you have experienced in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Oh, vastly different than what I had experienced in Germany.</span> <span id="s1535">Even before Hitler came to power that was the case.</span> <span id="s1536">There was a truly integrated Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1537">It was the exception if in your social groups, in your playgroups, in your theater groups, or your bowling team there were gentile people or when you, as a Jew, participated in public sports with a gentile group.</span> <span id="s1538">That was just the beginning of it.</span> <span id="s1539">You may recall how proud we were of our one Jew in the soccer ball team of the city.</span> <span id="s1540">Organized sports were a great thing.</span> <span id="s1541">This was just the beginning, otherwise and by your own choice you were restricted to your Jewish associates.</span> <span id="s1542">That is the way things were done.</span> <span id="s1543">There was nothing written about it, but it was a way of life.</span> <span id="s1544">Compare that to the relationships between students and teachers today.</span> <span id="s1545">When I was a kid, sassing a teacher was unheard of and today it is a way of life.</span> <span id="s1546">So, naturally the difference between the relationships of the Jewish community to a Christian community then, in Germany, and here, today, is not so much the difference of Germany versus the U.S. but of the 1930’s versus the 1970’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: What other activities did you engage in other than Jewish activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Prior to World War II I used to participate only in Jewish activities.</span> <span id="s1549">Later I participated in Toastmasters which is not necessarily non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1550">Every time I saw a Toastmaster chapter we had one or two Jews however you got there by coincidence, not because they advertised it that way.</span> <span id="s1551">I dropped out of sports activities completely, except for golf.</span> <span id="s1552">We were members of a country club in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1553">When we came to Richmond we had the choice to do it, but having been a member for some ten years we knew the advantages and the disadvantages and we didn’t think that it was necessary.</span> <span id="s1554">In the list of professional activities, since I am in the engineering field I now decided, in my old age, I could do well with a few college courses, where the students may, or may not, know that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1555">I couldn’t be less interested (whether they knew or not).</span> <span id="s1556">It was odd that one of the more subtle of the girls in my wife’s remedial class wanted to know, “What makes you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1557">I know so little about it.</span> <span id="s1558">What is a Jew?</span> <span id="s1559">Don’t you believe in Jesus?”</span> <span id="s1560">It does tax you once in a while how out there, in the middle of Indiana, actually right on the Indiana-Ohio border, there are lots of people who don’t even know.</span> <span id="s1561">They know that there are Jews, but they don’t know what a Jew is, what makes him different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Since the war, did you ever return to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Yes, once!</span> <span id="s1564">I went on a trip as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s1565">I had wanted to spend more time doing some interviewing about what had happened, along, but unfortunately business pressures and the people who were our host who was an ex-Nazi prosecutor from out of Czechoslovakia, who, I am sure was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1566">He was one of those who did not want to disturb passed history.</span> <span id="s1567">He wouldn’t tell anybody much and I didn’t have much to, again, search for the Jewish community, or to go to the cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1568">However during my trip back and the people who met me there, the lawyers several interpreters whom we didn’t need because I could talk myself, the court officers all knew that I was Jewish but they didn’t let that faze them.</span> <span id="s1569">They showed a surprised expression when I asked.</span> <span id="s1570">Then, also, we were rushed, we were strictly on a business trip where we had to have some legal reason for our stops.</span> <span id="s1571">It didn’t even surprise them, nor did they ask questions, what an ex-German was doing there.</span> <span id="s1572">They welcomed me back.</span> <span id="s1573">They relatively made me feel welcome, rather than the people who may have been puzzled by a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: How do you view your daughter’s life as different from yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: She is too Americanized!</span> <span id="s1576">Although she had all the Jewish education and training she could have had here.</span> <span id="s1577">She does not see the significance which we feel must be somewhere in a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1578">She feels that she can be a Jew without practicing the religion.</span> <span id="s1579">You know, young people like that apparently are in the plurality today.</span> <span id="s1580">The return to being a Jew, but also practicing their Jewish religion I am glad to see is on the upswing.</span> <span id="s1581">However during her generation, and it isn’t so vastly different from yours, there was a lot of kids just wanting to be known as Jews for Israel.</span> <span id="s1582">They would like to go there and help, they like to support the state, they like to live there, but don’t talk to them about God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: How do you see your experiences with the young as influenced by your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1585">Particularly since the early days when she came, she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1586">Things were tough when I got out of school!</span> <span id="s1587">Becky had to work!</span> <span id="s1588">As a matter of fact she went back from Wisconsin for a while and worked in Cincinnati, where she had a job because in Palmyra (this is a tiny town of about 1,500 inhabitants in 1985 near Whitewater, Wisconsin) she couldn’t find suitable work.</span> <span id="s1589">She could have found a job as a beauty parlor operator.</span> <span id="s1590">In those days nice Jewish girls didn’t do that kind of a job.</span> <span id="s1591">Linda, from being with my parents so long, she understands German well, hearing all their fears and seeing pictures of the Nazi years, she understands pretty well what it was like.</span> <span id="s1592">She is also a little more convinced than her peers that it can happen here.</span> <span id="s1593">She wants to be Jewish!</span> <span id="s1594">She is interested in History, Jewish History, but her Jewishness does not go into religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s1596">Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
