<p><span id="s18">A: I was born Mannheim, Germany.</span> <span id="s19">And my maiden name was Mann, M-A-N-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And how old are you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I am 79 years old.</span> <span id="s22">I was born on July 3rd, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Where were your parents born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My father was born in the Rhine region in Germany in a small town named Hannheim.</span> <span id="s25">Do you want me to spell that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: If you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: H-A-N-N-H-E-I-M.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And where was your mother born?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My mother was born in Eastern Germany, Leipzig, L-E-I-P-Z-I-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And were your grandparents born in Germany as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, they were born in Germany, but I did not know them too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did they die before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: They did not die before I was born, but you see, my parents were married in 1932 and moved to the city of Mannheim where I was born.</span> <span id="s34">And my grandparents -- my maternal grandparents remained in Leipzig, Germany, and my paternal grandmother was in the Rhineland in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So how long had your family lived in Germany?</span> <span id="s36">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Oh, I believe since -- the only thing I know, way back in the 1800s.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your home life before you had to leave in 1935?</span> <span id="s39">Can you tell me a little bit about what life was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well, what I remember, of course.</span> <span id="s41">I was born in 1933, and we left Mannheim, Germany, in 1935.</span> <span id="s42">So I was two years old.</span> <span id="s43">And I don't -- I don't remember too much.</span> <span id="s44">My father was in the shoe business and director of a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s45">My mother was a homemaker.</span> <span id="s46">And we went for walks.</span> <span id="s47">My dad carried me on his shoulders.</span> <span id="s48">And that's about what I remember except that I know at one point we had to move out of our apartment because they found out we were Jewish and had to find another apartment to move into.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about that, either from what you remember or what you've learned, why you had to move out, when you had to move out?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, as I said, I was born in 1933.</span> <span id="s51">That's when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s52">And my father was allowed to stay at the factory.</span> <span id="s53">He was managing director of a shoe manufacturing company.</span> <span id="s54">He was allowed to stay awhile because he had connections in Holland to where the merchandise was exported.</span> <span id="s55">And you see, his father had fought in World War I and never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So did that allow him certain privileges?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, until 1935 when the SS demanded his dismissal.</span> <span id="s58">And that's when we were asked to move out of our apartment.</span> <span id="s59">And we managed to find another one.</span> <span id="s60">And shortly thereafter my father left for Italy, for Milan, where he started a business with a gentleman that he knew, and my mother and I followed.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you happen to know how you found the apartment in 1935, how you got --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: -- from one place to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: No.</span> <span id="s65">I think they just -- my parents just went looking and asking, but that's all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And tell me a little bit about how your family was first affected by anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s67">You started talking about that a little bit with your father's dismissal.</span> <span id="s68">Can you elaborate on that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No.</span> <span id="s70">He was just asked to leave.</span> <span id="s71">He said that the owner said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s72">The SS is demanding your dismissal.</span> <span id="s73">We don't want any Jews working for us."</span> <span id="s74">And that's about all I can remember about that.</span> <span id="s75">As I said, I was only two years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Do you remember anything about when your father left?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I remember my father leaving.</span> <span id="s78">And he left -- I think he went to Italy through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s79">And then -- but he often went on business trips.</span> <span id="s80">He went to Sicily on business.</span> <span id="s81">He often -- and to Holland.</span> <span id="s82">And so I guess at the time, as far as I can remember, I just felt, Well, he's either going to come home -- but we did -- my mother said, "We have to leave.</span> <span id="s83">They don't want us here any more.</span> <span id="s84">We're going to Italy to meet Dad in Italy, in Milan."</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Do you have any other early memories of living in Mannheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s87">And I haven't been back there since.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What do you remember about the journey to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, I remember my mother and I taking the train.</span> <span id="s90">And I don't even remember arriving in Italy, but I just remember parts of times while we were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Well, my father, as I say, went into business with this gentleman.</span> <span id="s93">And we lived in -- we had a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s94">And I always remember going downstairs to see -- the manager of the apartment building lived downstairs with his wife, and I always remember going down there and having a few meals.</span> <span id="s95">And my mother used to get angry because I wouldn't eat at home.</span> <span id="s96">I was a very picky eater.</span> <span id="s97">And I remember having my tonsils out and coming home, being in bed.</span> <span id="s98">And I remember my father sitting by the bed, and he was crying.</span> <span id="s99">He cried very easy.</span> <span id="s100">He was a very sentimental person.</span> <span id="s101">And then I remember lots of walks we took in Milan.</span> <span id="s102">He always carried me on his shoulders.</span> <span id="s103">I remember a time being in a sort of a nursery school with a nun, and we went on a walk.</span> <span id="s104">They took us out to take us somewhere in the city.</span> <span id="s105">I don't remember where.</span> <span id="s106">And then my mother and father coming for me and taking me out of -- I was being among the other kids.</span> <span id="s107">Taking me out.</span> <span id="s108">They said, "Come on.</span> <span id="s109">We have to go."</span> <span id="s110">And that's about all I remember about Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And when were you in Milan?</span> <span id="s112">From 1935?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: From 1935 to 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism in Milan at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No.</span> <span id="s116">I just remember my parents saying that -- about Mussolini.</span> <span id="s117">They were collecting all the gold from people, even their wedding bands.</span> <span id="s118">And so they bought themselves, I think, stainless steel wedding bands andhid theirs so they wouldn't have to give them up.</span> <span id="s119">And I remember that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So how would you characterize your childhood up to this point, up to 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Up to 1939?</span> <span id="s122">Well, I suppose it was fairly normal.</span> <span id="s123">That's when we left Italy, when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Tell me about how and when you left Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, in 1939 or in 1938 -- I'm sorry -- all immigrant Jews were asked to leave Italy.</span> <span id="s126">This is when Mussolini and Hitler became close.</span> <span id="s127">And we didn't know, of course, where to go.</span> <span id="s128">And we didn't want to return to Germany, and we could not obtain affidavits to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s129">My parents had cousins and distant relatives, but they were bringing their own families over, so they couldn't do anything for us.</span> <span id="s130">So my father, who had business acquaintances in Holland still dating back to when he was working in Germany, called them, and he procured a position in a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s131">So we gave away -- we gave up all of what we had because we had to leave our possessions, most of them.</span> <span id="s132">And we took the train to Lugano.</span> <span id="s133">And there a gentleman accompanied us across the border into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s134">And in Zurich we took a plane to Amsterdam via Paris.</span> <span id="s135">We arrived in Amsterdam and we were denied entry because we had German passports which had a big J on them.</span> <span id="s136">And they wanted to send us back to Germany, but of course we did not think that was a very good idea, so my father did a little persuading.</span> <span id="s137">And they agreed to let us stay overnight at the airport and we would leave the next day.</span> <span id="s138">And from Milan we went to Paris, but there is a story in between.</span> <span id="s139">We were waiting for the plane to leave, and I had never seen a plane take off.</span> <span id="s140">This was in Holland, I mean.</span> <span id="s141">And my father lifted me onto a heat register and didn't realize how hot it was.</span> <span id="s142">He sat me on it and burned my derriere.</span> <span id="s143">And I was very badly burned.</span> <span id="s144">But we got on the plane.</span> <span id="s145">And the doctor -- a gentleman noticed that I was very uncomfortable sitting, so he approached my parents.</span> <span id="s146">And he happened to be a doctor from ViennA: And he and my parents began a conversation.</span> <span id="s147">And he apparently told them to go -- the best thing was to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s148">He advised my father that the situation for the immigrant Jews in Milan was bad, not to go back there, and to stay in Paris.</span> <span id="s149">And he even suggested a hotel there where we might stay.</span> <span id="s150">And we were there for about three weeks and then obtained permission to go to Caen, C-A-E-N, for the next six months.</span> <span id="s151">And now we go to the year of 1939.</span> <span id="s152">My father joined the French Army, and my mother and I stayed in Caen at a hotel where she was a waitress.</span> <span id="s153">And very soon thereafter the Germans occupied the city and took over the hotel.</span> <span id="s154">So my mother was supposed to be a Swiss citizen because she couldn't speak French by that time and could only speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Was she posing as a Swiss citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: She was posing as a Swiss citizen.</span> <span id="s157">And she took me aside and told me -- warned me that if any of the German soldiers approached me and spoke to me, to pretend I didn't understand them, to answer them in French or Italian.</span> <span id="s158">So lo and behold, a German soldier did approach me and asked "Wie heißen Sie?"</span> <span id="s159">What is your name, in German.</span> <span id="s160">And I answered, "Je ne comprends pas ce."</span> <span id="s161">I don't understand.</span> <span id="s162">And he persisted, and another German soldier joined him.</span> <span id="s163">And they were talking between them about the little girl who they left in Germany.</span> <span id="s164">And so after a while they let me go.</span> <span id="s165">And I was scared to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Was this in the hotel in Caen?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: In the hotel, yes.</span> <span id="s168">They were going -- I remember being at the bottom of the stairs, and the restroom was on the side and they were going to go into the restroom and they happened to see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And how old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I was six.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: So were you already enrolled in school or not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, I was not.</span> <span id="s173">I was not because soon thereafter it was time to flee again.</span> <span id="s174">And this time we went to Le Mans, France.</span> <span id="s175">That's capital L-E and then capital M-A-N-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And what caused you to flee?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well, the German occupation.</span> <span id="s178">We were running away from them.</span> <span id="s179">And we stayed in Le Mans until 1940, until the Germans approached and began bombing the city.</span> <span id="s180">So I guess my father came -- was on furlough from the Army, I don't remember which, but talked to a French citizen who accompanied us across the boarder to what we thought was the unoccupied zone.</span> <span id="s181">That was southern -- southwestern France, to the village of Castelmoron-sur-Lot.</span> <span id="s182">Did you want me to spell all these words, these names?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: If you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: It's C-A-S-T-E-L-M-O-R-O-N, and then next word is S-U-R, and the third name -- word is Lot, capital L-O-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: And can you tell me, how did you get from one place to another at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Walking.</span> <span id="s187">And all of us were walking very leisurely.</span> <span id="s188">And all of a sudden my mother asked me to go down and make pee pee.</span> <span id="s189">And I responded that I didn't have to.</span> <span id="s190">And she said again, "Sit down and make pee pee."</span> <span id="s191">And I said, "I don't have to."</span> <span id="s192">And finally she slapped me and pushed me down.</span> <span id="s193">And of course, I started to cry.</span> <span id="s194">I was hurt.</span> <span id="s195">I was -- And then later she explained to me that the Germans from the occupied zone of France were watching us with their binoculars and we were supposed to make it look like a promenade, a leisurely walk, and not an escape.</span> <span id="s196">And then the gentleman who was with us led us to the nearest farmhouse.</span> <span id="s197">And I remember hiding in the shed where tobacco was hanging, hung drying.</span> <span id="s198">And the next two days we slept in stalls and different barns.</span> <span id="s199">And I remember noises at night.</span> <span id="s200">There were rats and mice.</span> <span id="s201">We had no green card, so we were at the mercy of the farmers who did give us food and shelter.</span> <span id="s202">And we trusted them that they wouldn't turn us in to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Can you tell me for a moment what you mean by "green card"?</span> <span id="s204">Do you mean a special transit card?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I'm using that as an example.</span> <span id="s206">As we have green cards here, it was -- I can't think -- an identification card.</span> <span id="s207">Being noncitizens, we had to have identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So you were walking from one town to the next?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: We were walking.</span> <span id="s210">And we continued to make our way then to the town of Castelmoron.</span> <span id="s211">And of course, we had to find a place to live.</span> <span id="s212">And my parents did.</span> <span id="s213">It was very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s214">The entry was just dirt and had wood to burn in the fireplace, and living quarters were upstairs.</span> <span id="s215">And there was just one bedroom and a very primitive kitchen with a wood-burning stove and a fireplace.</span> <span id="s216">No bathroom, indoor or outdoor.</span> <span id="s217">We just used a bucket, which had to be emptied every day.</span> <span id="s218">And my parents got jobs.</span> <span id="s219">They acquired jobs in a belt factory, doing assembly work.</span> <span id="s220">And then I started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: When you started school, did you have to pose as a non-Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: You know, I don't -- we were the only Jews in that little village.</span> <span id="s223">The children probably didn't know, but I'm sure their parents knew.</span> <span id="s224">People were very, very good to us there.</span> <span id="s225">There was never anything that I remember said from any of the children, anything derogatory.</span> <span id="s226">And then in 1940 of course the Vichy government came into power, whose leader was Marshal Philippe Pétain.</span> <span id="s227">Capital P-E-T-A-I-N.</span> <span id="s228">And of course, he -- his bosses were the Germans, were the SS, the Nazis, even though he had fought against Germany in World War I.</span> <span id="s229">He just turned around completely.</span> <span id="s230">And from that time I guess until the end of the war, we were hunted.</span> <span id="s231">We lived underground most of the time.</span> <span id="s232">Our neighbors knew we were refugees.</span> <span id="s233">And then the next thing I remember was that my parents told me that they have to leave or they were warned beforehand by a sympathetic official from the police that there would be a house-to-house search and that they had better flee.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And this was still in Castelmoron?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s236">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s237">And they left me in the care of the French family who owned the hotel.</span> <span id="s238">And of course, they didn't say where they were going.</span> <span id="s239">I had no idea where they were or when and if I would see them again.</span> <span id="s240">So I was sent to Catholic church on Sundays and catechism after school.</span> <span id="s241">They told my parents, "Well, if she can't practice her religion, she should have something.</span> <span id="s242">So send her to church and to catechism."</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the family who you were hidden with?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, they also owned the factory.</span> <span id="s245">And of course, they gave my parents a job.</span> <span id="s246">So my parents felt that they should listen to them and send me to church.</span> <span id="s247">And they were very, very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s248">Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And how were you hidden?</span> <span id="s250">Were you taken in as part of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">I was like part of the family.</span> <span id="s253">I had no problems, except I was very homesick.</span> <span id="s254">I didn't know when and if my parents would return or when and if I would even see them again.</span> <span id="s255">It was months before we were reunited.</span> <span id="s256">And I guess my parents had gone to a different town where they knew a German-Jewish family who owned a farm.</span> <span id="s257">And this family had two daughters a little bit older than I was.</span> <span id="s258">As a matter of fact, they had their daughters converted to Catholicism so that their lives would be saved.</span> <span id="s259">They were -- Both girls were baptized.</span> <span id="s260">So they went into hiding there and I stayed with a French family.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">And when I started going to church, my father even bought me the New Testment, prayer book, and a rosary.</span> <span id="s262">He was not an Orthodox Jew, but he was fairly traditional, so that was an unusual thing for him to do, but then our lives were in question.</span> <span id="s263">So I continued attending church and catechism.</span> <span id="s264">And then one day the priest approached me about baptizing me, and he mentioned that I needed to have a religion.</span> <span id="s265">And I responded, I said, "I do have one.</span> <span id="s266">I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s267">And he said, "Well, that's really not a religion, but I have to talk to your father, and he's going to have to convert first."</span> <span id="s268">So he did.</span> <span id="s269">He spoke to my dad.</span> <span id="s270">And my dad told him, "Father, I'm very sorry," he said, "I'm not a very good Jew.</span> <span id="s271">I'd make an even worse Catholic."</span> <span id="s272">So that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: How did the priest know where your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Well, my father was -- my parents were back at that time, back from their hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And about what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: That was sometime, 1940, I think.</span> <span id="s277">1941 perhaps.</span> <span id="s278">It was a small village.</span> <span id="s279">There was one Catholic church, and he was the priest in that Catholic church.</span> <span id="s280">And we lived in that village.</span> <span id="s281">So he knew where to find my father.</span> <span id="s282">And that was before my father joined the French Underground.</span> <span id="s283">And we had no idea where he was.</span> <span id="s284">He mentioned to us after the war that their job, the Underground, called the French Forces of the Interior, their job was to blow up German ammunition trains.</span> <span id="s285">And he did come home occasionally for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s286">And then in late 1940 -- In 1942 my parents decided to have another child.</span> <span id="s287">I guess it was rumored that the Vichy authorities would not arrest a husband of the Jewish women who were pregnant.</span> <span id="s288">And of course, that was all foolishness.</span> <span id="s289">It wasn't true.</span> <span id="s290">But my mother at the time was then two months pregnant when the gendarmerie, the French police, came to arrest my father.</span> <span id="s291">And I remember clearly that they took him from the house where we lived, had him remove his belt, and handed him three safety pins to hold up his pants.</span> <span id="s292">And I heard them say to my mother, "We don't want him to keep his belt.</span> <span id="s293">He might hang himself."</span> <span id="s294">And of course, I started screaming, "Please don't take my father away."</span> <span id="s295">I was nine years old.</span> <span id="s296">And this is an episode which is in my mind always.</span> <span id="s297">And the chief of police was very nice to us, very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s298">And I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for him.</span> <span id="s299">He told my mother to obtain a letter from the town's only -- one and only doctor, stating that she was four months pregnant instead of two, and that he would try to have my father released.</span> <span id="s300">And she did that.</span> <span id="s301">And she did so.</span> <span id="s302">And my father came home a couple of days later.</span> <span id="s303">But from then on, he was a hunted man.</span> <span id="s304">So my sister and I -- you'll have to forgive me.</span> <span id="s305">I tend to be a little emotional.</span> <span id="s306">My sister Annie was born in Villeneuve-sur-Lot -- V-I-L-L-E-N-E-U-V-E, next word S-U-R, and the next word capital L-O-T -- on August 5th, 1943.</span> <span id="s307">And this was the nearest -- the town with the nearest hospital.</span> <span id="s308">And I was 10 years old and, of course, very excited to have a sibling.</span> <span id="s309">And then my dad was in and out of the woods or wherever he was with the underground.</span> <span id="s310">He would come home once in a while.</span> <span id="s311">He left his bicycle at the next-door neighbor's back yard.</span> <span id="s312">And our bedroom window would -- you would go onto the roof of the house and then you could jump into the neighbor's back yard.</span> <span id="s313">On one of his visits in the middle of the night, there was a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s314">So he quickly jumped out of the bedroom window to the adjoining yard and took off on his bicycle.</span> <span id="s315">The authority -- now, this was the French authority.</span> <span id="s316">I guess they had to do their job, or so they said.</span> <span id="s317">They came upstairs -- Oh, and what I have to preempt this with was that they had tried to warn us that they had to come and inspect the house.</span> <span id="s318">And they looked all over, under the beds.</span> <span id="s319">And my mother held my two-months-old baby sister and said, "Here, do you want to take her too?"</span> <span id="s320">So they mentioned they were under the orders of the SS and then they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Now, was your father back and forth from the forest to your home through the entire period from 1940 to 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Do you remember him coming and going?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Coming and going, yes.</span> <span id="s325">And I remember him vividly jumping out the bedroom window and onto the roof and then going down the neighbor's yard on his bike.</span> <span id="s326">So I was -- every night I laid in my bed and I was terrified.</span> <span id="s327">I knew that they -- that the Germans or the Vichy government were picking up the Jews in trucks.</span> <span id="s328">And whenever I heard a vehicle during the night I was just trembling.</span> <span id="s329">I was terribly frightened, and I knew they usually came in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s330">And then about my school attendance was of course very erratic.</span> <span id="s331">I'd go to attend class one month and then we went into hiding two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Where did you go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: In farms outside the city, the town.</span> <span id="s334">And we had one particular farm we always went to where we worked.</span> <span id="s335">And my -- when my father was not serving with the resistance, he worked on one farm while my mother and I and my sister and on another farm.</span> <span id="s336">And we worked in the fields.</span> <span id="s337">We picked tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans.</span> <span id="s338">I milked cows.</span> <span id="s339">I took them to pasture and had to tend to them so they wouldn't stray into neighbors' property because there were no fences anywhere.</span> <span id="s340">And the living conditions were also very primitive there.</span> <span id="s341">And no indoor or outdoor facilities.</span> <span id="s342">You just went out in the field and that was it.</span> <span id="s343">In the morning you went to the pump outside and you washed face and hands.</span> <span id="s344">And once a week my mother would heat water in the fireplace or on the wooden stove in the farmhouse and take -- put it into galvanized tub, and that was my bath in the middle of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s345">And that was my bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And so who was hiding you?</span> <span id="s347">Were these local farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: The farmers.</span> <span id="s349">The farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And you were moving from place to place so that your father wouldn't be found?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Well, my father was in a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s354">And of course, I still remember the chickens, the ducks, and the pigs and running in and out of the kitchen throughout the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s355">And my poor sister and I were infected with lice.</span> <span id="s356">My mother was always working on our hair with kerosene to get rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s357">And rodents were all over the place.</span> <span id="s358">And the only time I really had any fun was during harvest season.</span> <span id="s359">Harvest the grapes.</span> <span id="s360">We were in a region that's not too far from Bordeaux, which is a wine region.</span> <span id="s361">I'll spell it for you.</span> <span id="s362">Capital B-O-R-D-E-A-U-X.</span> <span id="s363">And then in a couple of months or three months when we thought it was safe, we would return to the village and I would resume school.</span> <span id="s364">I also -- my husband is reminding me.</span> <span id="s365">My fun during grape harvest was to get into the barrel with the grapes and stomping on the grapes.</span> <span id="s366">That was a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Can you tell me about what year this was that you were going from place to place?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well, this was -- we were doing this off and on until the end of the war in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So from 1943 or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: From around 1940 to 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: And of course, when I returned to school I didn't have a very understanding teacher.</span> <span id="s373">I had missed a lot.</span> <span id="s374">And she would give a test.</span> <span id="s375">And of course, I would get a bad grade.</span> <span id="s376">But truthfully, my father was not very understanding where school was concerned.</span> <span id="s377">Where education was concerned, he was extremely strict.</span> <span id="s378">And the only slap on the derriere I ever got from him was when I brought home a fail grade or a bad grade.</span> <span id="s379">And oftentimes I would come home from school and find my mother waiting with the baby carriage and off we went to hide again.</span> <span id="s380">This time my father was hiding with the underground.</span> <span id="s381">And then the word came that the Allies had landed in Normandy.</span> <span id="s382">And everyone was excited.</span> <span id="s383">We could hardly restrain our emotions.</span> <span id="s384">And my father and his group aided the American troops.</span> <span id="s385">And then when he returned from one of these missions, he'd bring us powdered milk and toothpaste and chocolate and soap.</span> <span id="s386">And by the way, during the war we had -- everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s387">We had coupons for meat, for bread, for everything.</span> <span id="s388">And my mother used to make her own soap.</span> <span id="s389">She used to save all the grease from -- I don't know what.</span> <span id="s390">Save it and use -- and cook it in the fireplace and then it became hard when it cooled.</span> <span id="s391">And that was soap.</span> <span id="s392">And then the Allies advanced into our vicinity, and the Germans and Vichy troops left the area and we were able to breathe a bit.</span> <span id="s393">And my father was much decorated.</span> <span id="s394">He got the medal of honor.</span> <span id="s395">And he got the medal of voluntary firer of the resistance as well as the commemorative medal war with clasp of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">CHK) SEE HIDDEN NOTE -&gt; And by the way, I didn't write this in my story.</span> <span id="s397">My father was in Who's Who in France in a book.</span> <span id="s398">And my father was discharged from military service in 1946.</span> <span id="s399">And he accepted the post of tax inspector in Le Saar, which is capital S-A-A-R, which is a region between France and Germany.</span> <span id="s400">During that time, of course, it was occupied by the French military, and during that time we became French citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what liberation was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well, everyone was dancing in the streets of that -- in Castelmoron, in that little village.</span> <span id="s403">It was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s404">Especially when Dad came home and he said we survived.</span> <span id="s405">And after this my dad was appointed director of police for the Saar province.</span> <span id="s406">And when his job was -- ended with that, he became a co-owner of a shoe manufacturing company.</span> <span id="s407">He had met a gentleman who had the funds, a French gentleman.</span> <span id="s408">And my father had the know-how, so they opened the shoe factory.</span> <span id="s409">And we at the time, as I mentioned before, had relatives in the United States, cousins.</span> <span id="s410">And I was really sick and tired of war-torn Europe.</span> <span id="s411">And I used to read magazines of New York.</span> <span id="s412">I thought at the time that New York was -- literally the streets were lined with gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: What made you sick and tired of war-torn Europe?</span> <span id="s414">Was it the conditions?</span> <span id="s415">Was it the way people were treating you?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: The conditions and what we went through.</span> <span id="s417">And prior to my -- that comes later.</span> <span id="s418">I just wanted to go.</span> <span id="s419">My parents agreed to send me to New York, to relatives for a year or two, where I could study, learn the language, and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: 16.</span> <span id="s422">But while I was here I met my husband whose family had -- my husband's name is Werner, W-E-R-N-E-R.</span> <span id="s423">His family fled from Germany in 1935.</span> <span id="s424">They were smart.</span> <span id="s425">But they had relatives here in the United States.</span> <span id="s426">My husband's father had a sister in Pennsylvania, so they obtained affidavits and came in 1935.</span> <span id="s427">And my husband and I were engaged in 1952.</span> <span id="s428">That same year he was drafted into the Army and was sent to Germany where he served in the military intelligence in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And I want to take you back for just a moment.</span> <span id="s430">How did you get from Europe to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: I came on a ship named capital D-E, next word is capital G-R-A-S-S-E, with a friend of the family.</span> <span id="s432">At the time she was also going to New York to visit people.</span> <span id="s433">So I came with her.</span> <span id="s434">She sort of looked after me during the voyage.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Is there anything in particular you remember about that journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: The journey?</span> <span id="s437">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s438">It was in April.</span> <span id="s439">And the waters were rough, and most of the people on the ship were sick except me.</span> <span id="s440">And it was, of course, we came tourist class.</span> <span id="s441">In those days those ships have tourist class, second class, first class.</span> <span id="s442">Our cabin was next to the engine room, I believe.</span> <span id="s443">But it was pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And can you tell me the first thing you remember about New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: New York, I was picked up in New York by a daughter of -- a cousin's son and his wife.</span> <span id="s446">And this cousin with whom I stayed for a while, the first thing she did, took me to Woolworths and bought me a Hazel Bishop lipstick.</span> <span id="s447">You're probably too young to know what Hazel Bishop was, but that was very popular back then.</span> <span id="s448">She said, "You must wear lipstick."</span> <span id="s449">My parents were very strict.</span> <span id="s450">I was not -- I had to dress -- I had to wear what my mother wanted me to wear.</span> <span id="s451">And I was not allowed to use any lipstick or anything like that.</span> <span id="s452">And I had a fairly strict European upbringing.</span> <span id="s453">You were to be seen but not heard.</span> <span id="s454">But I had very loving parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And where did you learn English in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I just learned.</span> <span id="s457">I went to school for a little while until this -- the uncle with whom I was staying, the cousin, became ill.</span> <span id="s458">In between the time, I met my husband, who was to be my husband.</span> <span id="s459">Of course I was only 16 years old.</span> <span id="s460">Nothing -- I said 16.</span> <span id="s461">I was only 16 years old when I first met him through relatives of the relatives.</span> <span id="s462">And that was that.</span> <span id="s463">But then the cousin became ill -- the cousin with whom I was living in New York -- with cancer and passed away.</span> <span id="s464">And as I said, my husband and I reconnected, my future husband and I.</span> <span id="s465">We met -- we became engaged, 1952.</span> <span id="s466">And then in 1954 I went to France with my future mother-in-law on the Queen Elizabeth I. And my husband and I were married in Saarbrücken.</span> <span id="s467">S-A-A-R-B -- I'll start over.</span> <span id="s468">S-A-A-R-B-R-U-C-K-E-N, in Le Saar.</span> <span id="s469">And my husband was still in the service at that time.</span> <span id="s470">That's why.</span> <span id="s471">And I was due for a visit home to my family.</span> <span id="s472">So we got married there.</span> <span id="s473">And then he was discharged.</span> <span id="s474">And we lived in Williamsport, PennsylvaniA: And we have two wonderful sons, Gary and Stephen.</span> <span id="s475">And after the province -- the Saar province was returned to Germany in the 1950s -- so my parents did not wish to live in Germany.</span> <span id="s476">So my parents and sister moved to Strasbourg, that's S-T-R-A-S-B-O-U-R-G, France, where my father became director of an import/export rubber distributorship.</span> <span id="s477">And my father passed away March 11, 1997.</span> <span id="s478">He was 91.</span> <span id="s479">And he was a very courageous man, a man of vision.</span> <span id="s480">Very intelligent.</span> <span id="s481">He was always self-taught.</span> <span id="s482">You could discuss with him any subject under the sun.</span> <span id="s483">And he always no matter how difficult life became, he never gave up.</span> <span id="s484">He was my mentor, my hero.</span> <span id="s485">And my mother passed away April 30th, 2011, at the age of 103.</span> <span id="s486">She resided in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s487">And my husband and I went to Europe for the last 17 years twice a year, sometimes three times, to see her.</span> <span id="s488">And then my sister was married, has one daughter, but she was widowed in -- about 11 years ago, in 2001.</span> <span id="s489">And she resides in Annemasse, A-N-N-E-M-A-S-S-E, France.</span> <span id="s490">It's near Geneva but on the French side.</span> <span id="s491">She took care of my parents all those years.</span> <span id="s492">My father started with his illness in 1997.</span> <span id="s493">And she took care of my family.</span> <span id="s494">And as I said, we made our trip twice a year to try to help out as best we could.</span> <span id="s495">But the war left scars, and in 1945 I fell ill with typhoid fever and hepatitis.</span> <span id="s496">And I was fairly sick for about a year.</span> <span id="s497">And I have chronic headaches, migraines, and tend to suffer from depression once in a while.</span> <span id="s498">And my mother suffered from chronic bronchial problems throughout her life.</span> <span id="s499">And my mother's family, now, my mother had three brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s500">Now, her sister somehow managed to escape from Leipzig to London, England.</span> <span id="s501">And my maternal grandmother -- my maternal grandparents and three uncles, my mother's brothers -- my mothers -- pardon me -- yeah, my mother's brothers, were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s502">And my father's mother, his sister -- her husband and two young boys, ages eight and six, were deported to Dachau and none of them returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No.</span> <span id="s505">I barely saw them because, as I said, my parents moved away.</span> <span id="s506">And I don't even -- I have pictures.</span> <span id="s507">And my mother -- my mother never spoke too much about her family.</span> <span id="s508">Whether it was too difficult for her, I don't know.</span> <span id="s509">I think my grandfather -- her father was in the -- was a furrier.</span> <span id="s510">And I remember her saying her mother was always ill and she had to take care of her.</span> <span id="s511">Other than that, I really -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s512">I remember seeing them once.</span> <span id="s513">And my aunt, my husband and I went to London years ago.</span> <span id="s514">She has -- she passed away about 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s515">And I met my aunt.</span> <span id="s516">I have a cousin in London named Monica and a cousin George.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And what is your aunt's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: You know, at the moment -- I knew it.</span> <span id="s519">I can't think of it.</span> <span id="s520">You must -- I can't remember.</span> <span id="s521">Monica's mother, do you remember her name?</span> <span id="s522">Oh, I know.</span> <span id="s523">Elfreide, E-L-F-R-E-I-D-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: And where did they live before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Well, before the war she was in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s526">And she managed to escape and lived in London during the war.</span> <span id="s527">And she got married in England also to a man from -- whom I didn't know from ViennA:</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I want to take you back for a moment.</span> <span id="s529">Do you remember as a child, either when you were in Mannheim or then when you were in hiding, being aware of what was going on in Germany or what was going on throughout the rest of Europe to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s531">Not in Mannheim and perhaps not in Italy, but after.</span> <span id="s532">Very aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: About when would you say did you become aware of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Well, I became aware when I heard the car or truck at night.</span> <span id="s535">I must have been eight or nine.</span> <span id="s536">And I knew they were taking Jews and transporting them to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s537">I grew up very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Do you remember how you heard about what concentration camps were?</span> <span id="s539">Did you hear your parents speaking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Probably my parents, yes.</span> <span id="s541">Uh-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Do you remember overhearing conversations from your parents or your mother talking about anything in particular during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s544">I remember my mother saying, "Well, your father is away."</span> <span id="s545">Of course we didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s546">She didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s547">"But we have to" -- and every time we had to go into hiding, I knew that we were hunted by the Vichy government or the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: What sticks out for you the most in those moments when you were traveling from one place to the next, trying to stay one step ahead?</span> <span id="s549">What do you remember the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I remember the conditions under which we lived, having to stay quiet.</span> <span id="s551">My sister was a baby.</span> <span id="s552">She wasn't even allowed to cry.</span> <span id="s553">And by the way, my sister wouldn't talk to anyone outside her immediate family.</span> <span id="s554">Not even to my husband when he and I became married -- were married.</span> <span id="s555">She couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s556">I know she went to a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s557">We're 10 years apart.</span> <span id="s558">I was already gone.</span> <span id="s559">But she had problems.</span> <span id="s560">And it was not until she became engaged to her husband that she really opened up.</span> <span id="s561">But what sticks out the most to me was when they came to get my father and have him remove his belt so he wouldn't hang himself.</span> <span id="s562">And what sticks out were the terrible -- the big rats running around all over the place.</span> <span id="s563">To this day, I'm deathly afraid of them.</span> <span id="s564">My father would set traps all over when he was home.</span> <span id="s565">The noises at night from the rats and the mice and the cars, when there were any, and being afraid of being taken away and worried about would I see my father ever again.</span> <span id="s566">I tried to put a lot of this in back of my mind and tried to forget it, and yet I consider myself very fortunate, I guess, thanks to my father's vision.</span> <span id="s567">But through the grace of God, we were never in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s568">And that's very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What do you remember the most about those people in the French countryside who you were hiding with?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, they were farmers.</span> <span id="s571">They tended to their land.</span> <span id="s572">They helped us out.</span> <span id="s573">I think they were -- they were socialists, maybe tendency towards communism.</span> <span id="s574">So they hated the Germans and they hated the Vichy government.</span> <span id="s575">And we worked.</span> <span id="s576">We got food and lodging, but we did work.</span> <span id="s577">But they took care of us, too.</span> <span id="s578">So we're very grateful to the French people.</span> <span id="s579">They saved our lives, really.</span> <span id="s580">And they saved us from deportation and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And what do you remember the most about your interactions with the French gendarmerie while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: While I was there, well, I can -- the captain of the gendarmerie was very, very kind to us.</span> <span id="s583">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s584">He felt very, very sorry for us.</span> <span id="s585">And he really tried his best, tried to warn us whenever he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Tried to warn you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: About "You be careful.</span> <span id="s588">We may have to come tomorrow night to your house and inspect the house," or "Perhaps you better flee."</span> <span id="s589">They had to go through the motions of coming and doing their job.</span> <span id="s590">So they tried to warn us whenever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: And were they warning you about your potential arrest or about your father's or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Both.</span> <span id="s593">The whole family.</span> <span id="s594">But my father was taken away first.</span> <span id="s595">And at the end, I'm sure it would have been the whole family.</span> <span id="s596">I don't remember what happened when we weren't home, when we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s597">People may have come.</span> <span id="s598">They may have been coming to look for us anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Have you been back to that region of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I was back shortly -- Let's see.</span> <span id="s601">In 1954.</span> <span id="s602">And that's the last time.</span> <span id="s603">We've gone to Provence, my husband and I, which isn't too far away from there.</span> <span id="s604">And I've often wished to go back and see what it all looks like now.</span> <span id="s605">Of course, the people who were there at that time are now gone.</span> <span id="s606">I'm almost 80.</span> <span id="s607">So they are no longer there.</span> <span id="s608">I just wish I could go back and see what the whole area looks like now.</span> <span id="s609">I still have a vision in my mind about it.</span> <span id="s610">But we both have some health issues, so I don't think that overseas travel are in our stars any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: What's the vision in your mind that you were talking about a moment ago of that region of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Oh, always very -- well, I remember there was an old castle not too far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s613">And it was a water pump.</span> <span id="s614">I remember walking over there and getting water.</span> <span id="s615">We had no running water.</span> <span id="s616">And I remember walking in the countryside.</span> <span id="s617">I remember tending to the cows.</span> <span id="s618">I remember milking the cows.</span> <span id="s619">And the village, it's a very picturesque countryside, southern France.</span> <span id="s620">The climate was fairly mild.</span> <span id="s621">We did get a few snow flurries once in a while.</span> <span id="s622">I remember walking to school.</span> <span id="s623">There was a girl's school and a boy's school.</span> <span id="s624">And I remember -- I remember seeing the girls in the Catholic church taking communion in their white gowns.</span> <span id="s625">And I remember going shopping with my mother.</span> <span id="s626">I remember her chasing me with a broom around the kitchen table when I was misbehaving.</span> <span id="s627">I remember the neighbors across the way from where we lived, they were ladies who were elderly, dressed all in black with the long skirt still, widows.</span> <span id="s628">And I remember rodents crossing from one -- from one home to the other across the street.</span> <span id="s629">They were almost as big as -- there were sewer rats almost as big as -- some of them as little cats.</span> <span id="s630">And I remember my mother taking out a box with tea bags to make tea -- I wasn't feel well -- and a mouse jumping out of it.</span> <span id="s631">I remember her getting letters from my father once in a while while he was in the Army, and she would say, "Dad is okay.</span> <span id="s632">He'll try to come home."</span> <span id="s633">I remember her having -- after my sister was born and my father had to leave again, I remember her trying to breast-feed her.</span> <span id="s634">And my sister couldn't get any milk.</span> <span id="s635">And she would -- my mother had an infection.</span> <span id="s636">Her breast was all blue.</span> <span id="s637">And I remember a doctor who came on his bicycle, was a Jewish man who made the rounds to all the regions, I guess, to the people he knew were in hiding, coming to check her health.</span> <span id="s638">And that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Were you a religiously observant family in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Well, we couldn't.</span> <span id="s641">My father always told me, "Don't ever forget you're Jewish."</span> <span id="s642">He was very observant, but we went to church.</span> <span id="s643">We had to hide the fact that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s644">And after the war I did go to synagogue, but we never kept kosher or anything like that.</span> <span id="s645">My father went to shul, to synagogue, after the war until the day he died, every Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So during the five-year period that you were going to one place to the next, you were actively hiding the fact that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Did you feel that the community knew anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Most of the adults did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: When was the first time that you told your husband your story from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I don't think he really knew up until 2001 -- bits and pieces probably, but my children didn't -- in 2001 when I wrote, to put it down on paper.</span> <span id="s652">And my sister who came to visit last January, I gave it to her to read.</span> <span id="s653">She's quite proficient in the Englis language.</span> <span id="s654">She read it and she said, "I didn't know half of this."</span> <span id="s655">So my parents after the war, as I said, my mother never really spoke too much about her family, up until the very end.</span> <span id="s656">She mentioned one of her brothers whose name was Harry.</span> <span id="s657">But she was already I think a bit of dementia had already set in.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: So what was it that made you want to tell your story now?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I heard other people telling.</span> <span id="s660">And I decided perhaps it would be a catharsis for me or it's a story that really -- the Holocaust shouldn't be forgotten.</span> <span id="s661">And my -- the temple we belong to, we're looking for a speaker every year, Yom Ha'Shoah.</span> <span id="s662">Someone comes to speak.</span> <span id="s663">So I decided, Well, I'll write my story down as best as I could.</span> <span id="s664">And that's how this came about.</span> <span id="s665">And it's still -- I don't know -- it's still some of these things still come back to me when I read them and I get all upset, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: If you were to pick one moment of your story that you think is the most important, what would it be?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: That's the most important.</span> <span id="s668">Our survival.</span> <span id="s669">The way we survived.</span> <span id="s670">What my father did during the war.</span> <span id="s671">That, I never knew until afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Well, after the war he just talked about it.</span> <span id="s674">And not everything.</span> <span id="s675">I saw he was in Who's Who, and I read his stories.</span> <span id="s676">And he really was in harm's way.</span> <span id="s677">And they liberated cities.</span> <span id="s678">He really did some extraordinary, wonderful things to fight Nazism.</span> <span id="s679">And as I said, I'm grateful for the fact that unlike a lot of our Jews, that we didn't end up in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s680">And my husband and I took a trip to eastern Europe a few years ago, and we went through Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s681">And that was -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s682">I can't find the words.</span> <span id="s683">I figured that if my grandparents, my uncles died there, that the least I could do is visit it.</span> <span id="s684">But it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s685">It's unbelievable what we saw there.</span> <span id="s686">Unbelievable that they're human beings who could inflict such things to other human beings.</span> <span id="s687">And my father also wrote a poem while he was in the Marquis, the French Underground.</span> <span id="s688">And this poem is now in the archives of Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s689">And if you like it, I have an English translation.</span> <span id="s690">We could e-mail it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Do you have it with you that you can read for the recording?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I have it here.</span> <span id="s693">This is an English translation, originally written in German.</span> <span id="s694">It's dedicated, "To my dear children, by Bernard Mann, 1943."</span> <span id="s695">I am lying on hard straw and I keep pondering over and over what could be done to alleviate the suffering of the Jews, but no solution comes to me.</span> <span id="s696">I can only describe to you, my dear children, what this or that person was doing.</span> <span id="s697">One, who did they round up?</span> <span id="s698">Who did they not allow to sleep and drive around like shepherds drive sheep?</span> <span id="s699">The Jews.</span> <span id="s700">Who do they lock up and put in chains?</span> <span id="s701">I would like to bet it would be the Jews.</span> <span id="s702">Why must they suffer?</span> <span id="s703">Why must they waste away?</span> <span id="s704">People will explain to you it is because they are Jews.</span> <span id="s705">It did not help to flee.</span> <span id="s706">It did not help to run.</span> <span id="s707">They watched them.</span> <span id="s708">They burned them.</span> <span id="s709">They are living corpses, the Jews.</span> <span id="s710">They had many friends, in quotations, but none would or could help but rather left them to the hungry Wolves, the Jews.</span> <span id="s711">There were many democratic states.</span> <span id="s712">I will tell you what they did for the Jews.</span> <span id="s713">Nothing.</span> <span id="s714">They demanded florins, dollars, and pounds.</span> <span id="s715">Whoever did not have them had to end like miserable hounds, and whoever did not have enough Swiss francs was left locked behind the border gates.</span> <span id="s716">Only the Jews.</span> <span id="s717">They wandered around, families torn apart, their homes destroyed, thrown into camps, in the grimmest cold and without bread.</span> <span id="s718">They held out until they would be redeemed by the death that they longed for.</span> <span id="s719">The Jews.</span> <span id="s720">Men worked hard and dug coal while their wives were sent to Poland.</span> <span id="s721">Where did the children stay?</span> <span id="s722">Where had they remained?</span> <span id="s723">They were frustrated, longing for their parents.</span> <span id="s724">In some instances there was a person with lots of dollars who flew over borders.</span> <span id="s725">Even America stood open to him, could help to spend the war there in security, wrote long pages with many words, spoke on the radio now and then, and so the good man believed that he was doing a lot of good for the Jews.</span> <span id="s726">Others fought in that distant land.</span> <span id="s727">They fought the enemy in desert sand.</span> <span id="s728">They merited great honor worthy of the Maccabees.</span> <span id="s729">Their graves have been covered with sand.</span> <span id="s730">For them all, that remains is to say Kadish for the Jews.</span> <span id="s731">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: When did you receive the poem?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Well, we found it among my father's -- after his death, among the papers.</span> <span id="s734">He told us that he had written a poem which is in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s735">There's a number, Register Number 7521.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to tell me about that I haven't asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: That you haven't asked?</span> <span id="s738">No.</span> <span id="s739">I would only say that my father always spoke, "You must forget or try to forget.</span> <span id="s740">Live on.</span> <span id="s741">Enjoy the future.</span> <span id="s742">We must go on."</span> <span id="s743">Our immediate family survived, and we must go on.</span> <span id="s744">But my mother never forgot.</span> <span id="s745">And she always said to us, "My heart is like a stone."</span> <span id="s746">But she said, "You have to live for the future."</span> <span id="s747">And I have to say, that's the last 52, 53 years, I had a rough childhood, but I've had a good life since then.</span> <span id="s748">And I'm grateful to be in this wonderful country.</span> <span id="s749">I wouldn't be anywhere else.</span> <span id="s750">And I think that's about all I can think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Thank you, very much, Mrs. Coppel.</span> <span id="s752">I'm going to stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
