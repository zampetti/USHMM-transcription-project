away from my street, they would call me dirty Jew bastard, you know, and things like that.</span> <span id="s203">But for some reason, I didn’t take much of that.</span> <span id="s204">I always -- if somebody would call me that, I’d let them know I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And how would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: In wo -- not only vocally.</span></p> <p><span

id="s221">But there w -- there -- there was definitely anti-Semitism, but before ’37 -- I think it was thi -- ’37 - ’36, it didn’t affect me very much.</span> <span id="s222">After that, it

your father all of a sudden is staying home and he’s not working?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh yes, it was -- I -- I remember that some business was done anyway at first, until they really clamp -- because farmers would -- they would come and wa -- wanted to do some -- some of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: -- would come and wanted to do business with us.</span> <span id="s275">Then there were some that probably owed us some money that -- that didn’t come any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Was -- was this business mainly with non-Jews, or is this a very mixed business?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: All with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: All with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: All with non-Jews,

and grandfather used to go to and I remember in the l -- the later years my -- his -- his brothers and cousins that were cattle dealers would still come to the market and they would -- they would sometimes bring the cows to our barn until the market opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: But -- but that -- the reason for that was because they couldn’t -- it was difficult for them to bring the cattle to the -- to the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: And then some of the farmers would come to us.</span> <span id="s287">I remember one in particular, he -- the -- Mr. Ebart, he was the mayor of Atsaport.</span> <span id="s288">And they had vineyards and he al -- he came on his bicycle, saw us

business stops.</span> <span id="s290">Is there a lot of talking between you and your mother and father about getting out of Ger -- do you know that they’re trying to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Oh -- oh, oh yes, I -- I remember them, my -- my -- especially my mother writing to South America.</span> <span id="s292">There was talk about going to Chile, going to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s293">We tried to come to the United States, we had relatives here that had immigrated to the United States early -- early on, and both on my mother’s side and my father’s side.</span> <span id="s294">But they made it so difficult for us, so hard.</span> <span id="s295">The United St -- especially the United States did.</span> <span id="s296">There was a quota, you couldn’t -- and -- and you -- you -- you had to have guarantees that after we -- if -- if you would -- if you would get to the United States we wouldn’t be a burden to the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: So that we had -- I remember we had -- my mother had cousins in -- in Saint Louis, and my father had cousins in Oklahoma, and they both guaranteed for us, and still we --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Still you couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: -- we couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s301">We d -- really didn’t want to go to South America.</span> <span id="s302">And as it finally turned out, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s303">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Was your mother fluent in English as well as German?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s306">She -- she took seven years of French and, I don’t know, four or five years of -- of English.</span> <span id="s307">And she worked as a -- as a bilingual secretary for this -- for this paper factory.</span> <span id="s308">They made e-envelopes as far as I know, envelopes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: And they exported all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Was your family different from other families in thinking so quickly about getting out of Germany?</span> <span id="s312">What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What do you think it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: That we thought that early to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Cause not everyb -- yes, because not everybody thought that they needed to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I -- there were -- maybe it had something to do because we had family in this country already and we couldn't do any business any more.</span> <span id="s318">I -- we were not well to do.</span> <span id="s319">We were, would say middle -- middle class people.</span> <span id="s320">We had to do something to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I know that some of my Jewish friends, their parents didn’t think Hitler would last long, didn’t -- they never got out.</span> <span id="s323">In fact, my other fr -- maybe 20 kids my age, my brother and I, we were the only ones -- well, Samuel [indecipherable] got out.</span> <span id="s324">Samuel Lintner got out, and Arthur [indecipherable] got out.</span> <span id="s325">I think those were --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: -- out of 20 some odd kids, just the four of us got out, the rest of them all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And do you recall talking with other kids about your trying to get out, that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh yes, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: -- and saying to them, you should --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: -- you should all get out too?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Well, we were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: It was an adventure for us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You weren't afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Weren’t really afraid, we were very uneasy, but we didn’t realize, until my father came back from the concentration camp, from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah, let’s talk a little bit about -- do you remember when your father was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And this is before Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s341">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: It was right around that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: -- that he -- they came and arrested him, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: And did you see that?</span> <span id="s346">Did you see people coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Who came?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: They came and arrested him.</span> <span id="s350">I remember my mother sending me down to where he was supposed to be, and I remember going there.</span> <span id="s351">I wanted to find out why, how, where he was.</span> <span id="s352">Thought -- it’s so long ago, I don’t -- the particulars I don’t remember, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Do you remember going by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: By myself, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Was this to a jail, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: To a place, yes, to -- wa -- I-I didn’t know, it was a big building.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s358">And did you go inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I went inside and I talked to somebody, yes.</span> <span id="s360">But the -- they send me -- they send me back home, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: So you didn’t see your fa -- you didn’t see your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I didn’t get to see my father.</span> <span id="s363">Now, I don’t remember that -- that he came home again and then they re-arrested him.</span> <span id="s364">I know at about that time he was sent to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: And do you remember when you found out that he was -- was there some communication, or was it a rumor that he was sent?</span> <span id="s366">Do you have an idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: My mother knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: How we found out, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s371">So that -- it must have been awful in the house when he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Was -- that was very bad, yes, it was terrible for us.</span> <span id="s373">Course we didn’t know what went on there, and we didn’t know until after he came home.</span> <span id="s374">We -- we knew somebody that my mother -- that was supposed to be with the gest -- Gestapo, with -- with -- with -- or something like that.</span> <span id="s375">They had a cigar store where my dad, he smoked cigars, so he bought the cigars, always.</span> <span id="s376">His son supposedly had connections, and I remember my mother bringing him a lot of money, how much I don’t know, to help us get my father released from Dachau.</span> <span id="s377">I remember a lot of the Jewish men at that time, maybe all of them, were arrested.</span> <span id="s378">And after a -- after, I think it was six weeks, he did come home, but that was after Kristallnacht, I remember.</span> <span id="s379">Now, Kristallnacht, we were one of the few, maybe -- I have no record of this, but they didn’t come to our house, but -- or to our Jewish friends homes, they were all -- I remember going to a close friend of my parents, to their house, and I remember what it looked like in there.</span> <span id="s380">It was, yeah, just -- they destroyed everything, even the -- they went through closets and cut the -- cut the clothes down, they -- they -- they pulled -- i-in the kitchen they pulled the cabinets down and -- and -- and it was a wreck, I remember that.</span> <span id="s381">I come back to this because I don’t want to -- I want -- want you know about that, I don’t want to forget it.</span> <span id="s382">But when my father came back, we didn’t know when or -- I -- all I remember is I looked down and he looked like a walking skeleton, like a walking dead man.</span> <span id="s383">He was quite a robust man and he had -- he ha -- was in terrible shape when he -- when he came back.</span> <span id="s384">Of course he was not -- he wasn’t supposed to tell an -- anybody, you know, what -- what happened, but the stories we heard from him, I -- I don’t remember if he told us that right away, or if he told us that later, the things that went on in Dachau, that they were -- but that time it was wintertime, they were -- the only clothes they had one was their underwear and a -- a pajama-like -- like outfit.</span> <span id="s385">They were up in the morning at -- very early in the morning and stood at attention for two hours.</span> <span id="s386">Some were not able to do that and they collapsed.</span> <span id="s387">Some had -- remember him telling us they -- they took fire hoses and stuck it in their mouth and drowned them.</span> <span id="s388">I remember my cousin Siggy was in Dachau and he was in the same barracks.</span> <span id="s389">Seems like it was num -- number -- barrack number nine, and the -- the political prisoners that were there were the -- they were the -- what’s the right word for that, they were the -- they were in command of the barracks.</span> <span id="s390">His name was Bellow, nickname, probably a nickname they gave him.</span> <span id="s391">Starved him, beat him.</span> <span id="s392">But anyway, he -- he -- he got in -- he -- he got out and came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Can I -- can I go back for a second --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: -- to Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Sure, there are a lot of things that I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Didn’t something happen with your grandfather’s -- didn’t somebody come into your house, some thugs, that they were going to do something and your grandfather somehow stopped them because he had helped --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: -- you know that -- I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Very [indecipherable] possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Cause it just seems odd that they wouldn’t -- they would not come into your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: They did -- they had [indecipherable] and I remember they had a -- they put a -- a -- a yellow plaque on our -- we had a big -- big two iron [indecipherable] big gate in front that went to the back -- into our backyard, and two SR men stood there to make sure that -- that nobody would come to see us.</span> <span id="s405">They -- they probably stayed there for several days, but they never came to the house, they never touched our furniture.</span> <span id="s406">As far as I know we -- we were the only ones.</span> <span id="s407">We might not have been, you know, but because all of my -- the home -- my friend’s homes were -- were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Do you remember that night at all?</span> <span id="s409">Do you remember being afraid, do you remember staying in your house in your -- i-in some special place in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: You don’t.</span> <span id="s412">Do you remember hearing noises?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: The next day I -- I -- no, no, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: You don’t remember screaming --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: -- I don’t remember, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: -- or beatings or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No, because we were the only Jews on that street --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: -- see?</span> <span id="s422">And the rest they were all -- there were no ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: They lived all over town, had shoe stores, furniture stores.</span> <span id="s425">Some of my friend -- my -- my fr-friend’s fathers were in, you know, ha -- couple of will lawyers.</span> <span id="s426">There were -- Goodshak, he dealt in hides.</span> <span id="s427">All different trades.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Do you remember -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Now I -- what I do remember is that my -- that my best friend, they were deported back to Poland, and I think that was in -- I’m not sure -- in ’36 to ’37, early, it was early already.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: This was your best friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Th -- my best friend, Manfred.</span> <span id="s432">Yeah, they -- he -- they had to go back to Kolomaya.</span> <span id="s433">This was a -- we were really close, and it -- those were bad, bad times, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Do you remember the day he left?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: I -- yeah -- yes.</span> <span id="s436">But then I reme -- I also remember that he -- Mr. Rabla was able to come back once, he had -- was for something, I don’t remember, all the -- and he -- he stopped in, he told us where -- where he was, but we were -- never got to -- you know, we never heard from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Never heard from them again, no.</span> <span id="s439">Of course by that time we were pretty well isolated from the -- the rest of the -- of the -- of the population, all social events were only within the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s440">But first, you know, they -- I -- I remember this because they talk about it today, the Kulturbund, we had that -- the -- we had concerts, and I remember going to a concert in Koblenz in the synagogue and the Gestapo people were -- I remember them being there.</span> <span id="s441">They -- I remember enjoying a concert.</span> <span id="s442">Of course, you know, when you’re a kid, you look at things altogether different, you know, than -- it was never -- I-I never took it all that serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Except for what happened to my --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: My father.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s448">So it -- but it must have been very strange living on your street with n -- with no Jewish -- other Jewish people.</span> <span id="s449">Did people talk with you, did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Oh yes, oh the kids all -- we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: It was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Oh yeah, we all -- we -- we played until -- until the day we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: I -- I remember when -- when we left in my -- in the ki -- children’s transport to Belgium, the -- my dad hired a -- he was -- we still had -- we -- he was able to hire a taxi to take us to the railroad station with our heavy suitcases, you know.</span> <span id="s457">Kids would run along the taxi and they waved goodbye to us.</span> <span id="s458">Of course, that was in ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: That was ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Let -- let me ask you about your father coming back.</span> <span id="s462">Did he -- did he look as if he had been starved for those six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Oh yes, he -- he was -- he -- he had lost a lot of weight, his eyes sunk back in his head.</span> <span id="s464">He -- he wasn’t the same any more.</span> <span id="s465">Was the -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I know it was the -- they were mistreated, beaten, starved.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did -- when you saw him through the window, when he walked up, cause you didn’t know he was coming, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No, we -- I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: -- I remember looking down into the -- because we lived on the first floor, I remember him standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did you run down to him?</span> <span id="s471">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I’m sure I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s476">Do you remember talking with him at some point soon after he came back into --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did he seem very different to you, not just physically, but psychologically?</span> <span

remember they wanted to get us out of Germany any way possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: That is -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Any way possible.</span> <span id="s485">And -- and

that.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: It was before that that you got out?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah, yes, before April, I think, I think -- think like it was in March, seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: February, March, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So it was cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Probably cold.</span> <span id="s495">Did -- you weren’t against leaving your parents and your grandparents at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A:

<span id="s529">They weren’t sure of being able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: As far as we knew it was goodbye for -- maybe for good.</span></p>

got.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Could they take some money out?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Uh, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s683">Did

Ernie, when we last -- when we were on the last tape, we were talking about the fact that after Belgium was occupied -- attacked and occupied, the Levys left.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: They left before that, though, before they --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: What did they say to you?</span> <span id="s721">I mean, there you are, they’re supposed to be taking care of you, so they

id="s724">Q: He wa -- but he wasn’t going to take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Why, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: They had a small car.</span> <span id="s728">He had his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s729">I understood.</span> <span id="s730">I had no hard feelings.</span> <span id="s731">I remember he made arrangements f -- I don’t even remember if Guy was there or not, that I would stay with somebody.</span> <span id="s732">And he left a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s733">Seems like it was 600 francs.</span> <span id="s734">And they were supposed to take -- that was sup -- that was supposed to take care of us for a month or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: So, you remember something a little bit differently than Guy, he recalls that you came to him with the Weinbergs --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: -- and then the Weinbergs left, and then you were alone.</span> <span id="s738">Di y-you don’t remember it that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I know I stayed with this family for a ce -- for a certain amount of time, and there were -- seems like two other children, kids my age.</span> <span id="s740">I don’t remember if Guy was there or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: But that came to an end, after the money ran out they told me that -- go.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Go.</span> <span id="s745">And then Guy and I, we -- I remember wa -- Weinbergs were gone.</span> <span id="s746">Where they went, what happened, I don’t remember, and by that time of course, the Germans were -- had occupied Antwerp, and we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s747">We found a place down towards where the Jewish section was.</span> <span id="s748">There was a house.</span> <span id="s749">If somebody told us about it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s750">We stayed up in the attic, it was a -- the house was c-completely abandoned, there was no pi -- as far as the -- there was nobody else living there.</span> <span id="s751">We stayed up in the attic, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Why did you stay in the attic?</span> <span id="s753">Did you think it was safest?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I don’t know any more why.</span> <span id="s755">I know that’s where we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Did you have anything with you?</span> <span id="s757">Did you take a little suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Oh yeah, we -- we -- we had our clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: -- yeah, we -- we had our clothes, oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s761">I’m sure.</span> <span id="s762">I don’t remember packing my stuff, but I’m very sure we -- we had it.</span> <span id="s763">And I’m sure I was looking out for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Were you frightened?</span> <span id="s765">You’re 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Did you feel like a grown-up kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I felt like I had to survive somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Didn’t ma -- didn’t make much difference how.</span> <span id="s771">And I didn’t feel sorry for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: No.</span> <span id="s774">I didn’t see how anybody could.</span> <span id="s775">There was no point in it.</span> <span id="s776">I know there was some Jewish organizations left there because I know we went there often, and -- to eat.</span> <span id="s777">Like they had li-like a soup kitchen, like.</span> <span id="s778">I know every once in awhile we would -- there was a man, a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s779">I o -- it seems like his name was Rabinowitz or something like that [indecipherable] that would bring us a loaf of bread off and on.</span> <span id="s780">He wouldn’t bring it, we would meet him someplace and he would give us a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s781">Don’t remember much about that time, but I know we lived there for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And how -- how is Guy doing?</span> <span id="s783">Does he take on your attitude, or is he, because he’s five years younger, which makes him --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well about that time I was how old, 13, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: I -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: 13 - 14 --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: 13 - 14 --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: You were 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yeah, 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Cause it’s 1940, it’s after May of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Right, right, yeah, right, yeah, ’40.</span> <span id="s793">Yeah, I was 14, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: But he is nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: And he is nine.</span> <span id="s798">We -- it must have been at that time too, the Germans were bivouacked in a park, and they have all kinds of food and we would go and talk German -- I -- I know we -- we stayed up nights thinking of stories to tell them.</span> <span id="s799">We told them that by -- that we were in Belgium with our parents, and that they were interned by the French.</span> <span id="s800">We must have heard that someplace, sure we didn’t fish it out of the sky.</span> <span id="s801">They believed us anyway, and we were -- we were left alone in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s802">Look, there was food.</span> <span id="s803">That’s what we went for, we wanted something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Did you have I.D. cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So they didn’t ask for anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s810">They were run of the mill soldiers, you know, they didn’t really care.</span> <span id="s811">We didn’t had -- they -- all they knew is we spoke German with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: -- and told them we were Germans and -- and they gave us food.</span> <span id="s814">And that’s how we met Madame Marian in the park --</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: -- just out of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Right, and so this is the same park where the German soldiers are.</span> <span id="s818">So you go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Maybe [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: -- daily, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I don’t know any more.</span> <span id="s822">We wer -- went there, I know that.</span> <span id="s823">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Wa -- if -- let me just ask you now, before we talk about Marian, when you went to the soup kitchen -- to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: -- where the Jewish organization was --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: -- did you ask them to get in touch with your parents in England?</span> <span id="s829">Did you know where your parents were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: You knew where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s833">I know it today yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Where were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Eight Mornington Terrace.</span> <span id="s836">Ask me [indecipherable] this morning and I won’t know it, you know, or yesterday, or the day before.</span> <span id="s837">Yes, we knew, and at that time were we -- did we correspond with them?</span> <span id="s838">I don’t see how, because we didn’t have a permanent address.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Right, but I’m wondering if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: There must have been some ti -- time that we did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: -- correspond with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Which must have frightened them terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Oh, I’m sure that this -- sure it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: But I don’t know how -- don’t remember how long we were like that.</span> <span id="s847">Then one day we met this -- this Belgian lady, and she saw where we got -- that we were able to get along with the German soldiers there, and then -- and she took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: And you trusted her?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well, trust, no trust, didn’t have much to lose.</span> <span id="s850">Was going to be better on -- than where we were.</span> <span id="s851">We went home with her and we stayed there for some time.</span> <span id="s852">She -- of course, she took advantage of us because we were able to get -- people were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: People would go on bicycles into the country to get food, scrounge food.</span> <span id="s855">We found a place there, it was a German barracks not too far from the -- where we lived, and we got food there.</span> <span id="s856">We got the -- I remember we got the potato peels, we got all the potato peels.</span> <span id="s857">They were -- they make great pancakes, the -- just the peels.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh, great pancakes, yes.</span> <span id="s860">You know there’s a -- beside the peel, there is -- there’s -- there’s some potato left on it, or -- yeah, we lived well.</span> <span id="s861">And I got a job in the military bakery, as a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: As a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: As a --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Nobody asked you whether you were -- did they ask you are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s865">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s866">They didn’t assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: They know a Jew wouldn’t dare do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Therefore, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Tell me a little bit about Marian before you get this job.</span> <span id="s871">What is she like, that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: She -- I don’t think they were married.</span> <span id="s873">Maybe they we -- I -- I don’t really know, to Pierre.</span> <span id="s874">He worked for the -- he worked for the trolley cars.</span> <span id="s875">Wasn’t a conductor, he took care of the -- of the rail and so on.</span> <span id="s876">And they lived in a -- in a -- in -- which is very common in -- in -- in Antwerp, in a below ground apartment they had.</span> <span id="s877">And -- forgot the name of the street now.</span> <span id="s878">And they fixed up a room upstairs for us --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: -- somehow, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s881">What?</span> <span id="s882">There -- there was a bed, and I remember a window that I looked out of, I remember looking out, and I would see the airplanes coming back from raids over Germany that -- looked at the wings, there were ho-holes in them this big, they look right through the wings and you wonder how they could fly.</span> <span id="s883">They were always -- I -- I had a -- a thing there that I would remember some days th-that I [indecipherable] forget this day.</span> <span id="s884">I’ve had days before that that I -- I’m -- I’m thinking, you know, that -- that there will be a time that I will think back on this, that we would, you know, survive it, you know.</span> <span id="s885">I remember looking out that window wa -- one night and maybe one day, watching those planes coming back.</span> <span id="s886">But anyway, we -- we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Was she kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s889">She was good to us, yeah.</span> <span id="s890">Course she had a lot of advantages, too.</span> <span id="s891">When I worked at the military bakery I would bring home flour every day in my thermos, fill it up with flour.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s894">And the guys that I worked with, they thought I was German.</span> <span id="s895">Some of them -- there were a couple of sailors there, hated me.</span> <span id="s896">And I know we got into a tussle at one time and these sailors, they wa -- they -- they were tough, you know, I remember one of them throwing me [indecipherable] seems like it was 15 feet behind them.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s899">And still I got along with them, you know, I just couldn’t let on --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Why were they fighting with you, you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I was a German, though, th-they thought I was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Oh, oh, I see, that was a Belgian soldier, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Not Belgian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Not Belgian sol --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: They were people working there for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: -- for -- for the German soldiers, for the military bakery, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: So did this put you in a funny sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: -- I don’t know, feeling, here you are Jewish and against what these people are doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Of course, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: -- and yet you’re working for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yeah, yeah, but I couldn’t let on, except for one time.</span> <span id="s916">And I worked there for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s917">And that [indecipherable], the guy that ran the -- the German officer that ran the place came from Hamburg, I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s918">But that time I was 15 and supposed to get a passport and he helped me write a letter and -- we were so -- we had a lot more luck than brains, that they didn’t find out.</span> <span id="s919">Yeah, at the Christmas 1940, I -- I’m sure I told this story to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Now, by that time the -- th-that we stayed with the Madame Marian, we were in touch with my parents.</span> <span id="s922">And my parents by that time were in the United States already.</span> <span id="s923">They figured they could help us, at least as well from the United States as -- better then from England.</span> <span id="s924">If it would have been anybody else but my mother, we would never have made it.</span> <span id="s925">She -- of course this I found out later, you know, she ran and ran and wrote and wrote and -- and -- and -- and she was in touch with Senator Wagner, she came to Washington several times to get -- to get us visas for the United States.</span> <span id="s926">Where was I?</span> <span id="s927">Where Marian --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: [indecipherable] Christmas party.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah, we went -- yeah.</span> <span id="s930">At the -- the Germans invited us to a Christmas party, the soldiers did, in 1900 and -- was that 1940 -- ’41 -- no, ’40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: -- ’40 -- ‘40</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: I think ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yeah, for -- had to be 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s937">Couldn’t refuse, you know, so we went.</span> <span id="s938">Big long table, one side was Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s939">People came in, mostly soldiers, some civilians.</span> <span id="s940">The guy sitting right across from me -- now, we -- I told you I’m -- we were in touch with my parents, we tried to get papers to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s941">Had to get a German passport.</span> <span id="s942">We went to the German au-authorities that -- at -- in -- in -- in -- in Antwerp to get this German passport, legitimate, as Jews.</span> <span id="s943">The guy that was -- handled our -- some of our [indecipherable] sat right across from me.</span> <span id="s944">I thought my heart was going to stop right then and there.</span> <span id="s945">Never -- did -- didn’t he recognize us?</span> <span id="s946">Did he know?</span> <span id="s947">There were no -- they weren’t all bad.</span> <span id="s948">Ninety-five percent were bad, you know, 95 percent I can swear to it, they were bad, you know.</span> <span id="s949">But there were five percent were good.</span> <span id="s950">Because things happened in -- in -- in -- in Berlin that I didn’t tell you about, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Well, we’ll get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So he does not say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Never said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: And he knows that you’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Right.</span> <span id="s957">There we sat, and the commandant of the -- of the garrison there, made a speech, I’ll remember the words that you know, we -- we don’t celebrate the birth of a dirty Jew bastard, he probably said.</span> <span id="s958">We celebrate the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s959">And I always say to myself, that son-of-a-gun, he would have known what’s sitting right next to him there.</span> <span id="s960">That I remember well.</span> <span id="s961">I remember that this guy never said anything, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Were other things said that were very uncomfortable, or wa-was this mainly a -- that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: That’s the only thing that I remember about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: That you remember.</span> <span id="s965">And is Guy with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Guy was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Was he working with you in the -- in the bakery?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: He wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: -- he was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: He was too young.</span> <span id="s972">But they knew him.</span> <span id="s973">Did he come -- cause he wasn’t going to school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No, no, he came with me to get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Course we’ve always had our bicycles nearby, thinking you know that if they catch us, we’re going to run.</span> <span id="s977">And we had the routes all mapped out, that we would take.</span> <span id="s978">We knew the port of Antwerp very well, that we -- we thought we could lose them and we would get away.</span> <span id="s979">There was a article one day in the German newspaper in Antwerp [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s980">And they never caught the -- believed our story.</span> <span id="s981">In other words now, there was some people that knew the real stuff, and the military and the newspaper never did catch on.</span> <span id="s982">So we were just lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Do you think Marian and Pierre were in danger because they were keeping you, if they found out you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: No, no, not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s987">So like I said, you know, we -- things get mixed up in my head, there’s a lot of things that I -- that happened while we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s988">Among others, they -- I was supposed to be deported, and that must have been after, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s989">Anyway, one -- one day while I was working in the military barrack and we were cleaning socks.</span> <span id="s990">There was a machine there that cleaned the socks, with Alphonse [indecipherable] him and me, we were cleaning socks.</span> <span id="s991">And the Gestapo, you know, you -- you could spot them a mile away, you know.</span> <span id="s992">A car came in, a convertible car came in -- in -- into the -- this military bakery was in a -- in a fortress that was built by Napoleon.</span> <span id="s993">Very old fashioned, very old -- th-this car pulls in and there’s a -- a -- they caught on with me.</span> <span id="s994">And if they catch me, I want somebody -- I want Guy to find out, I want Guy to know.</span> <span id="s995">So I took Alphonse [indecipherable] that was working with me there in confidence, I told him, listen here.</span> <span id="s996">I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s997">I’m really -- and I told him -- told him the truth, told him, hey listen, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s998">He -- he wouldn’t believe it, you know, and then -- but I told him, I said, if they catch -- please let -- let my brother know.</span> <span id="s999">It was a false alarm.</span> <span id="s1000">But after tha -- after that day, I didn’t dare go back.</span> <span id="s1001">I didn’t know if he was -- if I could trust him or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: But he didn’t know where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Must have.</span> <span id="s1004">He was going to let my brother know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: But anyway, he -- I never went back to work there after that, I never went back.</span> <span id="s1007">And I -- apparently they didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: They didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: They -- they didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Was Marian upset that you stopped working, because [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Oh yeah, yeah, because that was a big deal for her, that -- you know, we’d bring flour every day.</span> <span id="s1012">She was upset about it, and I know it was before -- must have been before that already.</span> <span id="s1013">They called off -- I don’t know who did they c -- the authorities told me to report to the railroad station, pack my stuff and -- the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1014">And I -- I said to -- you know, that was one of the toughest days, I said -- you know, I had to leave my brother.</span> <span id="s1015">I didn’t think I was -- for some reason I didn’t think I was going to come back from that.</span> <span id="s1016">Well, I got to the railroad station and -- and Madame Marian went with me, and that -- the Belgian that had -- organized that, probably under the authority of the Germans, I guess, I don’t -- I wo -- and she talked to one of the policeman there, one of the cops there, and he went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Do you know what was said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: You don --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: How come Guy -- I’m a little confused about something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: If you’re not in -- if you’re not -- if you’re not known as Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: -- so how is there a notice that you were supposed to go down to the railway station --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Well the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Well, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Because you had apply --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: The authorities knew that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Because you had applied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yeah, the -- well, the authorities are -- the Belgian authorities also knew I -- knew I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: They knew I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: When I went to -- to Levys already, they knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: The only ones that we had buffaloed were the soldiers, the military a-authority there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1040">Okay, that makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Because I got -- I got the Belgian papers th-that they -- they’ve got them, the -- they got most of my stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Was there a J on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: -- [indecipherable] passport.</span> <span id="s1047">There was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: On the -- J on the German passport --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: -- and on the Belgian passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: They put it on too.</span> <span id="s1055">Well anyway, I -- I -- but then, shortly after that, I -- I know that -- that summer we were both barefoot, we [indecipherable] but that wasn’t all that uncommon in -- in Antwerp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: -- you know, that felt good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: So what happens in terms of staying with Marian, Madame Marian and Pierre?</span> <span id="s1059">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: That -- that petered out after that.</span> <span id="s1061">St -- don’t remember any more just how it came about.</span> <span id="s1062">Anyway, my brother stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Sure we met them through Mr. Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s1065">He was the cantor of the -- of the Hallenser shul there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So he knew you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Somehow we went be -- we went to him, got to him, and -- but that time there were no services any more, there were no -- and he put me up in the shul.</span> <span id="s1072">There was a room there that I st -- that I stayed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: With Guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: And where’s Guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Guy stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Ah, ah, I see, right, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Now, Mr. Best was Jewish, Mrs. Best was not, and I guess nobody knew that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1081">And they had a little girl Guy’s age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: And he just f-fit right in and they were extremely good to him.</span> <span id="s1084">Nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Did you want to stay there, or that was not possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Well, it wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s1087">I didn’t really care where I stayed, as long as I had a place to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: And he got me a job in a -- in a p -- as a plumber, and I got to -- to -- the work papers yet.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t know if you got them or not.</span> <span id="s1091">I think I -- I still got ‘em, anyway.</span> <span id="s1092">I didn’t know anything about plumbing.</span> <span id="s1093">All I remember is the f -- the first job I got that th -- that they gave me there was I had to split a piece of steel in half with a hammer and a chisel and I remember that thumb was this thick.</span> <span id="s1094">I hit my thumb more often than I hit the -- hit the chisel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: So did anybody train you, or they just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: That was part of the training, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: That was part of the training --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: -- that was -- yes.</span> <span id="s1099">And that was the time we went down to -- there was a Mrs. Arum down on Kebitsplatte, one of the main thoroughpare -- fares where they -- right next to the railroad -- near the railroad station where the -- where the diamond [indecipherable] was -- where the diamond -- the exchange was.</span> <span id="s1100">We would go there periodically to the rest -- she still had a restaurant there, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and Jewish -- th-the Belgian Jews would come there, and she would -- we would eat there off and on.</span> <span id="s1101">And on Shabbas, I know I went to Mr. Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s1102">What the connection between the shul and him was at that time, I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s1103">I know there was a Mrs. Kleinman that helped us get papers.</span> <span id="s1104">I remember going to the American consulate, the -- an America [indecipherable] for our visa.</span> <span id="s1105">Guy and I both went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: You saw Guy very often?</span> <span id="s1107">Were you living wa -- was the synagogue where you were staying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Not very far apart, yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Not very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yeah, I saw him.</span> <span id="s1111">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Both of you were optimistic, aren’t you, in some way, as kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I don’t know what we were.</span> <span id="s1114">I don’t know what we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Well, you weren’t pessimistic, you didn’t get depressed and stop moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: You’re always -- you’re always adjusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1119">There were other people that -- there were other people that were -- Mrs. Dessaur, Mrs. Dessaur and -- forgot his name, and her -- her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1120">We -- I -- I went there every once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1121">I’ve got -- I’ve got his picture in -- in a note, in back of it, someplace.</span> <span id="s1122">But when the time came that we were supposed to go to -- to Berlin for our span -- we needed a Spanish transit visa, we had to go -- we had to be in a neutral country to get our American visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: And I think it was this Mrs. Kleinman that -- and it was impossible to do, to go -- you know, get to Germany and -- and -- and -- and get this Spanish transit visa.</span> <span id="s1125">She got us a paper from the commandant of Belgium, Antwerp, who supposedly had a Jewish girlfriend

id="s1225">So I -- I -- I th -- explained to him that we just got off a train and we didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1226">Well, he told us again, you know, which way to go and somehow got there.</span> <span id="s1227">There were not many people there, but I -- I don’t -- don’t know if they expected us, they didn’t expect us.</span> <span id="s1228">I think they did, I ma

18 - 19 - 20.</span> <span id="s1234">I remember there was one man there, he was a -- a furrier.</span> <span id="s1235">And I know he was working on some fur, and he were there for much longer than I

wouldn’t have reminded me of that, but I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Lost the papers.</span> <span id="s1269">I mean, that’s what -- everything hinged on that, that was getting out and not getting out.</span> <span id="s1270">I always kept them with me.</span> <span id="s1271">Somehow I left them laying someplace.</span> <span id="s1272">Called the police, they found them.</span> <span id="s1273">I got them -- got them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: All of them.</span></p> <p><span

frightening to even see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1284">I never thought we’d get them back.</span> <span id="s1285">So there were times, you know, that -- that I

rotten.</span> <span id="s1412">Spoiled to the p -- you know, they were just brought up wrong.</span> <span id="s1413">I understand why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: I shouldn’t say this, but people have to be more self-reliant.</span> <span id="s1416">It’s not -- it’s not like that with everybody, I know that, but there too many that -- well, they’ve lived at -- the different times --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: -- different times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Different times.</span> <span id="s1421">We knew we -- that is wasn’t -- wasn’t going to be easy.</span> <span id="s1422">We expected the worst.</span> <span id="s1423">We expected the worst and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: -- then if the worst didn’t happen, it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: It was good, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: That I didn’t get deported that time in Belgium, oh, it’s a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1430">What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Well, why don’t we take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: And

Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Ernie, before I ask you about your trip out of Berlin, I thought of something a few minutes ago.</span> <span id="s1439">What language we-were you speaking in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Flemish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: So did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Flumps, flumps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Flumps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Flumps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Did you know Flemish before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: No, no, nobody -- when we left there we spoke it as -- perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Both of us, yes.</span> <span id="s1449">It’s not that much different from German, but the pronunciation of it, it’s got to be -- if you don’t want to be detected, it’s go to be just so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: And I -- I think both of us had that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1452">It was so much easier for Guy, I think, than -- but he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Because he was that much younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1458">Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: But that time when we -- when we came to -- to the United States, when we came to New York, Guy couldn’t speak to his parents, all he knew was Flemish, he forgot his German altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Oh, you’re kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: And you hadn’t forgotten German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1464">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So that must have been really upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1467">Well, I wouldn’t say he completely forgot it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: -- but it was hard for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1473">All right, now you have your papers and you’re going to l -- now leave Berlin, and you’re heading for Spain, I gather, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1475">They put us on this train, this one car, we were only with -- was four refugees, but all older people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: They were all older people, and as far as I know we were the only kids, yes.</span> <span id="s1478">I know we were the only kids on the train.</span> <span id="s1479">There were no other kids on the train.</span> <span id="s1480">I remember they pulled the shades down at the station so nobody could look in.</span> <span id="s1481">Maybe they did it because so we couldn’t look out, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: And you had tickets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Don’t remember anything about tickets, but we -- we were on that train for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Did these adults, were they -- did they pay attention to you, did they talk with you, or were the two of you isolated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Well, we -- I’m -- I’m sure we talked.</span> <span id="s1490">I don’t really remember this, but I’m sure we were -- we all talked.</span> <span id="s1491">We were all -- whatever it was, as it were -- we were all afraid.</span> <span id="s1492">We all -- there wasn’t that much talking going on.</span> <span id="s1493">We all knew it was our last chance, because we -- we knew the -- the deportations had started, and we were very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Did you think the Germans would go back on these visas, on these permissions?</span> <span id="s1495">You didn’t -- you had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: We had no idea what -- what to expect.</span> <span id="s1497">We were anxious to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: And couldn’t wait until we would get to Spain.</span> <span id="s1500">Don’t remember how long it took, the -- these trains didn’t go very fast at that time.</span> <span id="s1501">Took quite awhile until we got to -- through France, until we got to the -- to the Spanish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Did you have food with you, did you take food with you?</span> <span id="s1503">Some bread, some cheese, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1505">We must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: You must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: We must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: -- cause they didn’t feed you on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: They didn’t feed us, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: And again, you have no money.</span> <span id="s1511">You have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No, no, we had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1515">Our papers, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1516">No money, no.</span> <span id="s1517">We got to -- to the Spanish border and we had to get off the train and get our -- our baggage.</span> <span id="s1518">I know there were German soldiers there that went through our baggage, through our papers.</span> <span id="s1519">And we had to leave this -- the train and get on -- it seemed like we -- it seems like there was a -- a special car for us there, just the car, not -- not -- not th -- a complete train, and now that I start talking about it, I remember these anxious feelings to get out of German occupied country, into -- anxious to get to Spain.</span> <span id="s1520">And it -- after they tif -- they load us onto this car, they -- they backed us in -- in -- on-onto another -- on -- on another railroad track so that we could get hooked onto the Spanish train.</span> <span id="s1521">It seemed to take forever til they finally hooked us on, and it was just a little ways into -- into Spain.</span> <span id="s1522">And we were so relieved, you know, I mean, that -- wh-when we got to San Sebastian that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: So all th -- all the people go all th -- everybody was going with this train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Everybody was on this -- this car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Now, it -- when you switch the trains, is this the time when your brother ripped off his --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: -- yellow star and hid it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: He had -- this is bef -- before we got to the border, he had this -- we didn’t -- we didn’t wear the Jewish star any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Uh-huh, you tol --</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: In fact, we were not all -- nobody was supposed to have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: No.</span> <span id="s1533">I don’t think we had to choo -- we wore a Jewish star when we got on the train in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: You didn’t have one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: No.</span> <span id="s1536">I think we were told to take it off, and -- and Guy, my brother, packed it into his suitcase, and he wasn’t supposed to.</span> <span id="s1537">I guess the Germans didn’t want anybody to know about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Do you remember giving it to somebody?</span> <span id="s1539">Yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: I don’t remember that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: So you didn’t -- did you know that your brother had packed this in his suitcase, or did you only find that out afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1545">I don’t -- I don’t think I would have allowed him to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1547">Right.</span> <span id="s1548">When did you find out that he had it?</span> <span id="s1549">In San Sebastian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Sometime afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes, sometime afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Were you angry at him?</span> <span id="s1554">Or was there no point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Di-Didn’t matter at --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Didn’t -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: -- that time, even though after we -- well it -- we stayed in a -- in a hotel, in a very nice hotel in San Sebastian, and I remember we got rolls with real butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1559">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1561">And I think we stayed there for a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: And who put you up?</span> <span id="s1563">Was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: That’s all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: -- by your

and the -- the bun -- the bandits came on the train with us, I remember, and -- and they -- the Spanish police were on the -- on the train.</span> <span id="s1591">They wore these funny, black hats.</span> <span id="s1592">I remember a -- a young -- a young guy getting out of the train that got into our car, and I didn’t know Spanish.</span> <span id="s1593">Somehow we made each -- h-he made us understand that he w -- that he’s hiding from the -- from the police, and the -- as they came through we made like he was one of us so he wouldn’t be bothered, yeah, so I remember that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: So now you became a protector of somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yeah, I -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Because you

if you know, I don’t know whether you know or whether you remember, were most people trying to get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Yes, I think they -- I -- I don’t really know, I don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: I don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Someone might have -- I’m -- I’m sure someone went to San Domingo , maybe landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1639">So they may have stopped there, but they -- you think they were all going to the same ship that you were going to, or trying to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Or you don’t know?</span> <span id="s1642">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: No, no, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Was anybody taking care of you?</span> <span id="s1645">Two kids amongst all these adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Did you feel the need for that, or you didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Well, I know we -- we -- we got together with two more kids, one or two more kids in Barcelona, because I remember going on sightseeing trips with them.</span> <span id="s1651">I remember there was a -- up on the hill there was a cross, it’s still there, you know.</span> <span id="s1652">I remember we -- I don’t know if I should tell this in -- but why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Why not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: In -- in -- in -- in Spain, in Barcelona, we had no money.</span> <span id="s1655">What made me think is we went on this excursion with these kids, you know, we -- we bought bananas to take along.</span> <span id="s1656">We had money -- because we had money.</span> <span id="s1657">We knew some of the people that were with us, and -- a-and -- and we wanted to visit them in the -- these other hotels on the [indecipherable] de Cataluna, that’s where this hotel [indecipherable] the Hotel Laurette.</span> <span id="s1658">And I sat in a chair like this, I want to try that here, too, maybe it happen here.</span> <span id="s1659">And for some reason, you know, I -- I reached back here and I came up with a handful of change.</span> <span id="s1660">I said, that’s not bad, you know?</span> <span id="s1661">I went to all the chairs in the hotel, you know, and -- and it seemed like every once in awhile the -- people would -- it would fall out of their pockets, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: -- in the -- and then -- and I had enough money to buy bananas, because f -- Spain was a very poor country at that time, extremely poor.</span> <span id="s1664">Food was very scarce, what we mostly ate was cabbage, that was our -- our main -- main -- how do you say that, staple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Meal -- staple, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1667">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: So you took an excursion, you bou -- you bought the bananas and went on this excursion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Right, you know, we st -- we were there for si-six weeks, in -- in -- in Barcelona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: So what in heaven’s name did you do for six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Walked all over Barcelona, we walked.</span> <span id="s1672">Waiting for -- well, we missed one boat.</span> <span id="s1673">Something happened that -- I don’t remember what, that we didn’t get onto this boat and then the -- I know there were -- this Joint Distribution com -- Committee did all that to get -- get us onto another boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Which finally left from -- from Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1676">But I didn’t -- we didn’t know how long we will be in -- in -- in -- in Barcelona.</span> <span id="s1677">And, guess there was nothing to do for us, we -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: So how did you get an appointment with the American consulate?</span> <span id="s1679">Did you just keep trying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: I know we got appointments, we had an appointment, we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: He wasn’t very nice to you, was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No, no, he wasn’t, no.</span> <span id="s1683">And I’ll never forget, he -- we were asked to come to see him and into his room.</span> <span id="s1684">Yeah, I remember he had -- he put his feet up on the desk, you know, and -- and he didn’t believe us that we got out of Germany, I don’t know why not.</span> <span id="s1685">And he was -- he -- he refused to -- ou -- give us our visa, but we had a -- we had a f -- was it a letter

<p><span id="s1686">Q: What did he think you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1688">Like he -- he was not very cooperative, he didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Your brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: -- he hated -- he hated to -- to give us a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Your brother thinks he was very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1692">Do you remember him that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: It’s all possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: It’s possible.</span> <span id="s1696">I don’t -- don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: So did you have to go back more than once for him to agree or did you just stay with him until he finally agreed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Well, we -- seems like we went there several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: We finally did get it, you know, we -- we did get it, and -- and one day they told us, you know, we -- we have to go to Lisbon, and they put us on a train to Lisbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: So this is the Joint who is telling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Because you missed the last boat from Barcelona --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yes, yes,

remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: What I do remember is, that there were several Gestapo agents on the train with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Like I told you, that you can spot these guys a mile away.</span> <span id="s1720">All -- well, something else, being in -- in -- in Spain at that time, we were not that secure anyway.</span> <span id="s1721">There were a lot of German soldiers there that came -- that s -- on -- on -- on leave, the -- the Germans had -- they went to Spain because Franco was -- was allied with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: And after we finally settled down in -- in Barcelona, we -- we were ill at ease seeing all -- quite a few German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1724">We didn’t expect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: And how were the Spanish to you?</span> <span id="s1726">Were you -- were you able to pick up some Spanish so you could speak a little bit, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Oho, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Quatta, questa, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1731">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: And -- and -- and -- and -- and a few -- a few words.</span> <span id="s1733">The Spanish, very little contact, a few people where we stayed in the pensionne.</span> <span id="s1734">Don’t -- don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s1735">We had -- we -- we-we stayed mostly by ourselves and with -- with this -- with the group that we were with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Did the Joint warn you about walking around and staying away from Germans if you see them?</span> <span id="s1737">German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: They didn’t warn you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1741">In fact, I don’t remember anybody in particular, how we were notified th -- where to go, where not to go, when our appointments were with the -- with --with the authorities there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: But somebody must have, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Oh, I’m sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: -- yes, yeah, somebody did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1746">Somebody -- but I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: So you didn’t make the appointment --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: No.</span></p>

yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: It’s a little surprising to me that no adult went with you.</span> <span id="s1754">If they were making these appointments, why wouldn’t they go?</span> <span id="s1755">You’re -- you’re children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Maybe they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Doesn’t that surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Maybe they did, I don -- I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s1759">All I remember is -- is talking to a -- to the people at the -- at the consulate there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Nobody seemed to talk for us, or at least I don’t remember anybody talking for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Were you nervous going to see the American consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Yes, oh yes, we were always.</span> <span id="s1764">There was always tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Did you and Guy talk beforehand as to what you would say, and what you thought might happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Oh yeah, yeah, we always --</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: -- well, we -- we did most of that in Belgium, but at -- during the German occupation, we -- we practiced at night what -- what -- what they would ask, what they -- the questions they could ask, and what would be an answer that -- that they could believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: So there was -- of course there was tension, but see, the tensions went away after we were on the boat, and as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: In li -- in lisb --</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: -- and I’ll -- I’ll never forget looking back at the harbor and then -- and then Lisibon -- Lisbon, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Did you cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Did you smile, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: I am [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: Must have, yes, must have.</span> <span id="s1779">But there

were hammocks in the -- in the hold of the boat, but Guy and I, we slept on top -- on -- on deck all the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Did you have blankets?</span></p> <p><span

forget.</span> <span id="s2431">Basic training at first was tough and then it was easy, but there were a lot of German prisoners there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: In -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: In -- in Camp Hood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: -- Camp Hood?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Camp Hood, yeah, they brought them from -- from North Africa, with the

boy, he went in the -- I don’t -- either the 82nd or the 101st, you know, and I -- and I -- I -- I always thought I could do as well as him, and then I said no, not because it would have been too dangerous for me, I -- I -- I didn’t want to hang off the -- and have somebody shoot at me without being able to shoot back at them.</span> <span id="s2582">I says, I’m not going to -- uh-uh.</span>

Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: And I was gonna sell it in -- in -- in Belgium, but then they -- they caught me twice and they send me back.</span> <span id="s2670">And I parked it -- I still got the address, I parked it in Acha with a five gallon can of gas in it.</span> <span id="s2671">But that was on my way, I had to leave for an -- for Antwerp, but I went through Koblenz -- went through Koblenz, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: -- through -- Koblenz was in the -- in the French sec -- sector, and I don’t -- I don’t know, I -- you know, nobody wore in-insignias, or -- you couldn’t tell a -- sure, a general you probably could have, but you couldn’t tell a captain from -- from anybody else.</span> <span id="s2674">Well, of course this was after the war already again, so they did wear -- anyway, I had a ma -- a major’s cap on.</span> <span id="s2675">Twen -- I was all of 19 -- 20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: But got away with it.</span> <span id="s2678">Didn’t shave for a few days, and -- but I did get -- I went to Koblenz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: And you saw your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2681">That wasn’t -- well, it was -- the only wall that was still standing was in -- in -- in -- in -- was at the hou -- our house.</span> <span id="s2682">One, the front wall was good, everything else was flattened.</span> <span id="s2683">That whole town was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Was -- was completely flattened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Was pretty well flat, yes.</span> <span id="s2686">I went to see Hillis Hyam Stoney, a friend of my grandfather’s.</span> <span id="s2687">He was a horse butcher, and he had a -- a klipa, a bar.</span> <span id="s2688">I remember where he lived, you know.</span> <span id="s2689">I went to see him.</span> <span id="s2690">There was nothing standing there, and he invited me into his kitchen, there was no roof to his kitchen, you know.</span> <span id="s2691">He -- he had bought our house before my parents left Germany, he bought the house with the -- that my -- m-my grandmother was supposed to -- she kept her -- her -- the first floor was hers until she would die a natural death, of course.</span> <span id="s2692">And I heard from Mrs. Teale, that’s the lady that I studied the history of Jews in Koblenz now, what -- that she had to leave there, even though the man, hillas -- hillas -- this Mr. Hillas Hyam fought tooth and nail, she said, you know, that she should stay.</span> <span id="s2693">They wouldn’t let her stay.</span> <span id="s2694">They brought all the remaining Jews together in one -- one place.</span> <span id="s2695">But anyway, I -- I saw him, and then I tried to -- I asked, you know, are there any Jews left, and he told me about a -- a Mr. Pollak that had married a non-Jew, that survive -- that they never caught.</span> <span id="s2696">I went to see him.</span> <span id="s2697">I ha -- just had a short conversation with him, don’t remember what -- all I can ima -- I would imagine I must have asked what happened to everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2699">Di -- had you known this person before, or was he a stranger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: I -- I -- no, I didn't know him, I heard the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: Heard the name, but I -- I -- I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s2703">I didn’t see anybody else in Koblenz.</span> <span id="s2704">That was shortly after the -- after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: -- ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: So you were discharged in ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: And then you go back to your parent’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: Went back home, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q: So you’re now 20?</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: And Guy is 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Guy is sort of the age you were when you first became --</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: Right, yeah, right, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2719">Yeah, I -- I [indecipherable] when I went to sc -- when I went to school, first I went to George Washington high school, which was an academic school, and did a -- I wanted to learn a trade, and everybody thought it was a good idea.</span> <span id="s2720">I went to machine and metal trade high school.</span> <span id="s2721">I had a job after school, worked for Atlas Recording Machines, very all -- well known [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2722">Mr. Kutner, a -- a German and a Syrian owned that place.</span> <span id="s2723">Mr. Kutner, not -- he was not Jewish, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2724">He was a teacher at -- in -- in Berlin at the -- some technical institute.</span> <span id="s2725">Very smart guy, and I went back there after the war, after I came home from -- from -- from the service, I went to work with them again, and I -- I was -- I liked it, and I wa -- I was probably pretty -- I was good at it.</span> <span id="s2726">And there were several guys there, this -- this old guy, he was in his 40’s, he asked me to go into business with him, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: This old guy in his 40’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: This old guy in his for -- in his 40’s.</span> <span id="s2729">I didn’t -- by that time my father was not well any more, he had heart problems.</span> <span id="s2730">Wanted to get out of the city the worst way, you know, and he wanted to do the same thing my uncles in Connecticut did, he wanted to be a farmer, a cattle dealer.</span> <span id="s2731">And that’s -- he eventually, you know, bought a farm in upstate New York.</span> <span id="s2732">First we looked in Pennsylvania, couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s2733">At that time a lot of German Jewish refugees bought farms in -- in Vineland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Chicken farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: So by war’s end the -- the val -- the land value was already more than w-we could afford.</span> <span id="s2738">We had -- we had saved 5,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s2739">That’s a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: That’s a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: And then we started to look in Pennsylvania, then we moved to -- further, further and further up.</span> <span id="s2744">We finally wound up in -- in Norwich.</span> <span id="s2745">I got a G.I. loan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Did your mother want to move also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: So everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2752">Yes, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: But you didn’t get into cattle trading, you did something else in farming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: Yes, I d -- I -- I -- I -- I dealt in cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: But, for milk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: Well, yes, yes, I did -- we did both, we did both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: We -- we -- we bought the farm.</span> <span id="s2761">I -- I was the farmer, because from -- from New York, knowing that we were gonna buy a farm, I got a job on a farm in Monticello from Max Yasgur, and he taught me well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: How did you get that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: Through the Jewish agricultural society.</span> <span id="s2764">They got in touch with Yasgur, apparently they knew him, you know, and he -- he hired me.</span> <span id="s2765">I worked for him for three-quarters of a year and we were interested in several farms and he asked me to stay with him, he wanted me to go in business with him.</span> <span id="s2766">I -- I worked hard, I wa -- I was young, and -- and I wasn't afraid to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: And I took to the work good, but we wanted to have our own farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: Have your own, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2771">And we saw several places that we were interested in, we finally bought the place in -- in Norwich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Norwich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: It wasn’t just what we wanted.</span> <span id="s2774">We’ll s -- I always said, well, we’ll stay here for three, four years, and then I’ll buy a real farm.</span> <span id="s2775">That’s 54 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Well, what’s the difference between Norwich and a real farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: And a real farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: Well, Norwich is -- is a little hilly.</span> <span id="s2780">There’s in a -- N-Norwich itself is in a valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: So we have valley land and we have some hill land.</span> <span id="s2783">I wanted one that was all in the valley --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: -- because when I worked for Max Yasgur, that was -- in Monticello, that’s all in the hills and -- and I knew that wasn’t the -- that wasn’t a way to farm it.</span> <span id="s2786">But we -- the first year we -- we just milked cows the first year.</span> <span id="s2787">And then my f -- my father, of course, knew -- I didn’t know the cattle business.</span> <span id="s2788">I knew -- by that time I knew how to work the land, how to milk a cow, how to raise crops, but after the first year my father started dealing in cows.</span> <span id="s2789">One of the reasons we bought the farm in -- in -- in -- in Norwich is because it had a small Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: And there were several Jewish cattle dealers there that my father knew from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: -- from -- from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: And so we started dealing in cows, my brother and I. I -- I ran the farm, my brother helped.</span> <span id="s2796">He was still in high school, but you know, he -- it -- it’s from 4:30 in the morning until -- until you’re done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Which might be nine o’clock, 10 o’clock, whatever time it is, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: It’s tough work, isn’t

then after he graduated school, he -- he was on the farm.</span> <span id="s2803">We would go on the road every day, buy cows, sell them f -- make -- an-and milk cows.</span> <span id="s2804">We started -- there were 20 -- 23 head on the farm, 23 head.</span> <span id="s2805">I think eight -- 18 milkers and -- and five head of young stock, yeah.</span> <span id="s2806">Within -- and -- and he didn’t cut a -- this guy that had the farm, Donald Davis, he didn’t cut enough hay -- didn’t cut enough hay for what he had.</span> <span id="s2807">Within three or four years, we had 40 - 50 head, and then -- and we had more hay than -- than we needed, we sold hay.</span> <span id="s2808">And -- but too bad my dad didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s2809">He died in fift -- he bought the farm in ’48, and he died in ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: That’s too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A:

her, and came to see a couple of times in New York, and got engaged, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: After a couple of times?</span> <span id="s2835">So fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: After -- well, I don’t know, after -- no, more.</span> <span id="s2837">Probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: Three or four times, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Better -- better than six months, you know the -- but of course, I couldn’t come to New York that often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: Yeah, within a year we -- I think a year later we got married, yes.</span> <span id="s2844">And it’s quite a change for a city girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A: -- and I wasn’t -- I was ill -- ill at ease.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: About whether she would adjust to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: That she would -- right, oh yes.</span> <span id="s2849">And was quite a change for her.</span> <span id="s2850">But I couldn’t marry al -- I had to marry the Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s2851">There was just no two ways about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: So you lived on this farm for over 50 years, you still have the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: But it’s now a driving range?</span> <span id="s2857">Part of the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: Well, I -- I sold the cows, yeah, sold the cows.</span> <span id="s2859">Well, my brother left in -- my brother left the farm in ’69 -- ’68 -- ’69.</span> <span id="s2860">He a -- he had back problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: And he went to live in New Jersey, and I stayed on and I milked cows, dealt in cows, both, and raised a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2864">How many children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: Three boys and a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: And they decided not to follow in my footsteps, even though they -- they helped while they were going to school.</span> <span id="s2868">They know all about farming, and all about cows.</span> <span id="s2869">In fact my -- one of them wanted to become a veterinarian, my -- my Joe, but [indecipherable] he’s not -- he’s not going to st-stick around school that long, he’ll never do it.</span> <span id="s2870">He would have made a -- you know there are veterinaries and there are veterinarians.</span> <span id="s2871">This guy can look through an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">A: Yeah, he can look through an animal.</span> <span id="s2874">But it didn’t -- he -- he di -- he -- he get sa -- he’s doing something else, yeah.</span> <span id="s2875">My oldest one, he liked farming.</span> <span id="s2876">They -- they all like -- they all like farming, they just don’t want to make a living that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: Because it’s -- it’s -- it’s too hard, there’s no money in it.</span> <span id="s2879">Hard to raise a family, but my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: Is it hard to raise a family, why?</span> <span id="s2881">Because you s -- have to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: Be-Be-Because you don’t have -- you -- you -- you ki -- don’t have the means to do what -- what the city kids do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: I mean, you know, with TV today, they -- they know how -- how easy it is f-for some people to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: And they all like for -- they like to be gentleman farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: They like to have farms, and -- and -- and -- and land and -- and animals, and have somebody else do the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: Else to the work, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">A: And they might get that chance yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: But you’re glad you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: I have no regrets, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2893">I could have very well -- I might have done something else --</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">A: -- but as it turned out, I raised a great family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: And Norwich was a nice place to live.</span> <span id="s2898">The farm has still got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: They ask me if I’m still on the farm, and I always tell them, the farm has got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: With a -- with a 200 year old house, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: [indecipherable] 200 year old house, yes, and new roads.</span> <span id="s2903">When I moved there it was a dirt road, then in 1951 or two, they blacktopped it, and then they made it a little bit bigger a couple of times and they just finished it now, I got a superhighway now out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: Which I don’t like.</span> <span id="s2906">Didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s2907">But the government’s got so much money they got to spend it someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: I know when we talked throughout the last few hours, you said you really don’t know how this experience in Europe changed you.</span> <span id="s2909">Do you -- do you ever feel surprised when you think back on what you did, you and your brother, that you were able to maneuver through all of this, or that’s not how you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: Makes me think like -- like not -- I’m not very religious, you know, I -- I’m very Jewish.</span> <span id="s2911">I would say that’s my -- that’s my politics.</span> <span id="s2912">God takes care of his fools, maybe.</span> <span id="s2913">We were lucky somebody -- something, you know, when you realize what happened to all the rest over there, and -- and that we were so vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: And -- and -- and still we -- we got out, so I’m -- I got a lot to be thankful for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2917">Your mother was a kind of guardian an -- this amazing guardian angel, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: She --</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: -- she -- oh yes, she did -- if anybody else I’d -- I’m -- we would not -- I don’t know if we would have survived it, but I know we wouldn’t have gotten to the United States when we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: I know that.</span> <span id="s2923">So, between -- between her and God --</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">Q: And a few nice people who [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">A: -- and that -- and the -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: -- and -- and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: And you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: People [indecipherable] people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Remember, you and your -- you and your brother are part of this, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: Well, we -- we -- we -- we did save our skin.</span> <span id="s2932">But it’s a great country anyway, the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: You think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: Oh yeah, great country.</span> <span id="s2935">Nobody complains more than I do, but a great country, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: Let me ask you a more contemporary question.</span> <span id="s2937">Somebody who’s been through the experiences you were during the war, when you think about what’s happened here in the last six weeks, what happened on September 11th, do you feel different than other Americans who never experienced anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: I -- you know, I -- I -- I thought I did.</span> <span id="s2939">I thought I’d -- that I feel differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: But I listened to a couple of congressman the other day, I-I watch C-Span a lot, he feels just like I do.</span> <span id="s2942">I think we make -- we make so many mistakes that I -- I say to my -- all -- all this didn’t ever happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: -- if they would have just done it right.</span> <span id="s2945">If they only would have listened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s2947">Are you frightened now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">A: No, I’m not frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: No, you’re not frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: I’m -- I am -- I don’t know what -- what would be the word for that?</span> <span id="s2951">Apprehensive, is that the word for it?</span> <span id="s2952">Maybe.</span> <span id="s2953">Yeah, I mean, it’s a crazy world, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2956">But I’m -- I’m -- I’m not afraid, no.</span> <span id="s2957">I watch my step, maybe, you know.</span> <span id="s2958">But I -- I know my kids aren’t.</span> <span id="s2959">I don’t -- I don’t think Davina is afraid.</span> <span id="s2960">I don’t know anybody that’s afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: But everybody’s apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: You should be.</span> <span id="s2965">And I -- I -- I -- I -- I think we should be on guard a lot more than -- than we have been.</span> <span id="s2966">Maybe now -- maybe now we sh -- Of course [indecipherable] fault -- fault our government.</span> <span id="s2967">It’s easy for me to fault the government now, but it -- but I can understand too, why -- why we -- because we c -- got away with it all these years, too.</span> <span id="s2968">Got away with it, and -- an-and -- and people lived -- don’t like to e -- use that word free.</span> <span id="s2969">Everything was lax, you know, easygoing.</span> <span id="s2970">But we found out we can’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: It’s not what’s wrong with the United States, it’s not -- it’s wrong with what everybody else is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: Everybody else is doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: Is there anything you’d like to say about your experiences during the Holocaust that you haven’t talked about?</span> <span id="s2976">Have we missed something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: Oh, I’m sure we’ve missed lots.</span> <span id="s2978">We missed lots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: I know we missed a lot of the -- the horrible things that -- that happened in -- in -- in Europe, that the -- the -- the Germans and the Poles committed.</span> <span id="s2981">And that it’s almost unbelievable, the things they did -- that they -- that they did.</span> <span id="s2982">I realize that you can’t hol -- hold it against the -- against the -- the -- today’s generation, but what -- what they did in -- in -- in -- in between the years of ’33 and ’45, for a ci -- a civilized country to do that is unforgivable.</span> <span id="s2983">Yeah, people -- people shouldn’t forget it, the -- the -- the things that human beings are capable of doing to other human beings.</span> <span id="s2984">That’s all we still are is human beings, you know, and -- and -- and I think -- I think we should always watch out for that, we should keep on having that -- that kind of government that I always complain about here.</span> <span id="s2985">But -- oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2986">Because that’s what makes the difference.</span> <span id="s2987">Atrocities that today that happen in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- sometimes that you hear about in Africa, terrible, and eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s2988">But this -- this was government sponsored.</span> <span id="s2989">It’s the government that was behind it too, not just by groups of -- just groups of people.</span> <span id="s2990">Not that they can’t be -- can’t be just as cruel, these groups can be, but when a whole country, a government does that, it’s not good, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: Not good.</span> <span id="s2992">Well, I want to thank you very much --</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: -- for being willing to talk with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Thank you for doing that.</span></p> <p><span
