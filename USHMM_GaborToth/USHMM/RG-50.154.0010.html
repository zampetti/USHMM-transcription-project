id="s221">They were all jealous about his making his money, because, in ’38 already, Hitler took power in ’33, they were all working for the war machine, so the steel was a very big business, and he made quite a lot of money, and he tried to bring 10,000 mark over________Germany to Belgium, and he did hide it in his car, but there was one man in the company who was always jealous about his, my husband’s job, and wanted to have, naturally, Mr. Gottshalk, my name was Gottschalk when I was married, and my maiden name was Goldschmidt, I forgot that…and he always wanted to have the job, my

would have been in a regular concentration camp.</span> <span id="s288">.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: …Because he was in.</span> <span id="s290">.</span> <span id="s291">in a prison.</span> <span id="s292">The prison is not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s293">Otherwise, if I would not have had.</span> <span id="s294">.</span> <span id="s295">could show that he had the emigration to Belgium, then, they would have put him right away in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: So, but we had this because his relatives, Gottschalk, are mostly Belgium descent.</span> <span id="s298">So, I picked him up from the prison…the emotional things…I say I picked him up from the prison.</span> <span id="s299">.</span> <span id="s300">the emotional things, picking up the husband, who did nothing at all, just bringing his own money, that we could live and not going over the ____________ of his ten marks, it is…for a young

ready to emigrate…would have been ___________ experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: It was just awful and, so, .</span> <span id="s310">.</span> <span id="s311">eh.</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">now.</span> <span id="s314">.</span> <span id="s315">I picked him up and we went right away over the frontier with all the papers, and nothing.</span> <span

id="s410">The other sister was.</span> <span id="s411">.</span> <span id="s412">it is not worth to breathe and sound about her.</span> <span id="s413">And, this sister was hiding my father in Cologne.</span> <span id="s414">.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: How did she hide him?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: In her apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: In her attic, in an attic, or ?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, no, no…in her apartment.</span> <span id="s419">.</span> <span id="s420">in her regular apartment.</span> <span id="s421">.</span> <span id="s422">So Father came back to Dortmund after everything was passed by, and, you heard it certainly several times.</span> <span id="s423">At this time, they took a lot of Jews to Oranuborg.</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">you heard about that…that was a concentration camp, naturally,.</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">not something like Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s428">And, uh…lets turn it off for a moment, I have to concentrate.</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">The Crystal Night was in November, and I stayed partly with my parents and partly with my mother-in-law and my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s431">My mother-in-law got.</span> <span id="s432">.</span> <span id="s433">uh.</span> <span id="s434">.</span> <span id="s435">uh.</span> <span id="s436">.</span> <span id="s437">you see the most of them.</span> <span id="s438">.</span> <span id="s439">the very little words are missing now because I am very excited.</span> <span id="s440">She got a stroke and passed away from that stroke.</span> <span id="s441">While she was lying dying, that night, Crystal Night, they did throw a stone into the bedroom window where my mother-in-law was lying dying.</span> <span id="s442">We were all together.</span> <span id="s443">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s444">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s445">…It’s a joke… {LISTEN TO THE VOICE HERE}</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Was she aware of…there?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s448">She was unconscious.</span> <span id="s449">So, then, later on she was cremated…not cremated...she went…can you imagine, I can’t find the words…</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: That’s all right.</span> <span id="s451">Take your time.</span> <span id="s452">You don’t have to worry about that.</span> <span id="s453">.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Buried.</span> <span id="s455">Can you imagine, she was buried and uh.</span> <span id="s456">.</span> <span id="s457">then I stayed with my father-in-law and my husband had two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Was there a problems in having a Jewish funeral in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: _______________ No, wait a minute…my.</span> <span id="s460">.</span> <span id="s461">my grandmother passed now.</span> <span id="s462">There was not problem at this time.</span> <span id="s463">No, there was not problem.</span> <span id="s464">My grandmother passed away in ’36.</span> <span id="s465">So, at this time there was not problem.</span> <span id="s466">In ’38, when my mother-in-law passed away, I really can’t remember.</span> <span id="s467">.</span> <span id="s468">But, there must be nothing because she was buried in Eberfeld on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s469">Every time I went to Europe, I visited her and everything…the stones were there…and she was buried regularly.</span> <span id="s470">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s471">Uh…and then, so, at this time from November till February, I was preparing the emigration from Germany to Brussels for my husband, late husband.</span> <span id="s472">And.</span> <span id="s473">.</span> <span id="s474">don’t let me say .</span> <span id="s475">.</span> <span id="s476">always say “My late husband.</span> <span id="s477">.”</span> <span id="s478">.</span> <span id="s479">I’ll say Herbert, ya.</span> <span id="s480">.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Right, we’ll understand.</span> <span id="s482">.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Ya</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: You present husband is Ernest and Herbert was your first husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Ya</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: ____________________</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: It’s nice to have such good memories.</span> <span id="s489">.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Oh, I only have such memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Naturally, we had little arguments, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Well, ________to appreciate the good times even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: So,…and then, we prepared the emigration of my parents and my sister from Dortmund to Brussels, which was not very easy, but the relatives of my husband were very helpful.</span> <span id="s495">The war started in September, I guess.</span> <span id="s496">No.</span> <span id="s497">The war with…No, there was a war between Poland and Germany already before.</span> <span id="s498">.</span> <span id="s499">It was…</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: They had just invaded it.</span> <span id="s501">.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: They invaded it.</span> <span id="s503">They invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s504">I don’t remember the date and the month, but in October, my parents came…had the visa to come over from Dortmund to Brussels.</span> <span id="s505">In Aachen, what is Aachen in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Aachen.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: In Aachen, is the frontier where you go from Germany to Belgium, or from Germany to Holland.</span> <span id="s508">In Aachen, they were taking out all three out of the train, and, they were put in a small room.</span> <span id="s509">Father in a different room.</span> <span id="s510">Mother and my sister in another room.</span> <span id="s511">And, Mother did not had the passport with Sara.</span> <span id="s512">You know we Jews always.</span> <span id="s513">.</span> <span id="s514">all had to have a passport with name of Israel Herbert Gottschalk oder Sara Isle Gottschalk.</span> <span id="s515">That was the sign that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s516">Mother didn’t had it because she was not born Jewish.</span> <span id="s517">She had on “Elizabeth Gottschalk”.</span> <span id="s518">And my sister had the Sara Margaret Gottschalk.</span> <span id="s519">And Father, naturally did.</span> <span id="s520">So,.</span> <span id="s521">.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: I had never heard that.</span> <span id="s523">I had just heard that the passports were stamped with a large letter “J”.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Ya, “J” too.</span> <span id="s525">That was a large “J”.</span> <span id="s526">But this is something new for me…ya</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: {comment not understood}</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: So, I was Sara, which is a beautiful name.</span> <span id="s529">They didn’t anything do to my sister because she was 12 or 13 years old.</span> <span id="s530">And they came out of the room…that is, I didn’t see it…that is what Mother told me…and you have to realize Mother was like a curasier.</span> <span id="s531">She was alike a Brunhilde…can you imagine Brunhilde in a Wagner opera, tall and .</span> <span id="s532">.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: statuesque</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: statuesque…very strong…and.</span> <span id="s535">.</span> <span id="s536">but when she said something that was said.</span> <span id="s537">So then she heard next door, like somebody hit somebody and chairs were falling off…and Mother opened the door and there was a small man…(I have to watch my language).</span> <span id="s538">.</span> <span id="s539">There was a small man…Father was on the floor and he…</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: kicked him?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: …kicked him, in his head and all over, and Mother took that man and she grabbed him, and said, “You will not hit my husband.</span> <span id="s542">That is my husband, and I am Gentile…She was not Gentile, but she said that.</span> <span id="s543">So, he let go, and said, “Get out of here.”</span> <span id="s544">So, my father was dizzy.</span> <span id="s545">He could not, almost that they had to carry him.</span> <span id="s546">And people out of the train came and picked him up into his compartment.</span> <span id="s547">So, he came three quarters dead to Brussels and we had to have an ambulance to bring him to the hospital, but he came out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: The train that you came out on—was it a normal passenger train?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Normal passenger train.</span> <span id="s550">First class.</span> <span id="s551">Yes, if you had the money.</span> <span id="s552">At this time, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And my parents, too.</span> <span id="s555">So, then they were in Brussels.</span> <span id="s556">That was in October.</span> <span id="s557">And we all lived together.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: How did people manage financially under these conditions when you weren’t allowed to bring out money.</span> <span id="s559">.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: They brought out 30 marks.</span> <span id="s561">But they brought out, before I came here, I did ________________a little doggie, stuffed doggie, and Mother took out all the insides from the doggie and she stuffed it with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s563">30 marks would be what?</span> <span id="s564">30 dollars?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yah, and my husband, he worked for a long time, because they question is legitimate.</span> <span id="s566">My husband, before Hitler, he always brought his money he earned to Belgium or to Holland, so he had different accounts in Belgium and in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Did he suspect that there was going to be a problem?</span> <span id="s568">Is that why he did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No, no, he was just .</span> <span id="s570">.</span> <span id="s571">he thought the situation in Germany is not so stabil and it is better to have money in another country than in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: That was very far-sighted of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Ya, he was very far-sighted.</span> <span id="s574">So, when…I forgot to tell you when we came to Brussels, there was a cousin from Holland.</span> <span id="s575">He arranged quite a lot for my husband in Belgium with the family, with the Gottschalk family.</span> <span id="s576">.</span> <span id="s577">and he succeeded to get the money my husband had in a safe with an aunt.</span> <span id="s578">Ach, that is such a long story.</span> <span id="s579">My husband’s aunt was in Holland, married .</span> <span id="s580">.</span> <span id="s581">eh.</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">to a professor, in Masterick, and, but is that interesting for you hear all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Well, I am going to let you decide how much is relevant to your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Only to show you how .</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">uh.</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">how people.</span> <span id="s590">.</span> <span id="s591">how relatives can be to other relatives.</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">that I like to mention.</span> <span id="s594">.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s596">.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Maybe it’s not good.</span> <span id="s598">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s599">.</span> <span id="s600">But he doesn’t live any more anyway.</span> <span id="s601">So, and …he succeeded to get ¾ of the money my husband had in Holland from my aunt to help Herbert to come out of Germany.</span> <span id="s602">This money was lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: In what way, lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: He took it!</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: He took it.</span> <span id="s606">So, relatives are not always good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s608">Relatives are not always good.</span> <span id="s609">That is what happened.</span> <span id="s610">But, anyway, there was still a little bit left, and, before the 10th of May, my husband, with, what did you say, what he was, very far.</span> <span id="s611">.</span> <span id="s612">what did you say before, he was very.</span> <span id="s613">.</span> <span id="s614">?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Far-sighted.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Far-sighted.</span> <span id="s617">He, from Belgium, he took the money to America, so, but and left a little bit for us here.</span> <span id="s618">We did not know what would come, but that was 2 or 3 days before the 10th of May.</span> <span id="s619">The 10th of May was the start of the war with Belgium and France.</span> <span id="s620">I don’t if you have heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: It really wasn’t much of a war.</span> <span id="s622">It was more of an invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Especially with Belgium and Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Sure, Belgium, Holland and France.</span> <span id="s626">It was like an invasion.</span> <span id="s627">Ya, but they were in war with France.</span> <span id="s628">But it was just a little bit playing here and playing there.</span> <span id="s629">It was not a regular war.</span> <span id="s630">Eh…On the 10th of May, they arrested Jew or not Jew--all the Germans in Belgium.</span> <span id="s631">Because the Phipps Color-- I don’t know if you heard about it--the Phipps Color -- that was that what Hitler did behind the front here in Holland and Belgium and France.</span> <span id="s632">There were these were Germans.</span> <span id="s633">There were working against…for…for the German Reich, but everything was done this way that it was not possible for the Belgium, Holland, and French army to have all the munitions they needed to fight the German invasion.</span> <span id="s634">So, that was why they arrested all the Germans in Belgium.</span> <span id="s635">How they did it in Holland, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s636">So, my husband, was between them because he was on the street and everybody could see that he…the immigrants looked not like Belgians.</span> <span id="s637">____that you could see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: But you said that he took a great deal of his money to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And then he came back?</span> <span id="s641">How did he get ….</span> <span id="s642">?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: He did sent it from one bank to another.</span> <span id="s644">I’m sorry….</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So he remained in Belgium and that’s why he was__________</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: He stayed in Belgium.</span> <span id="s647">Yes.</span> <span id="s648">He should have gone to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And what about the rest of you?</span> <span id="s650">Were you also picked up because you were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No, not the women.</span> <span id="s652">We were not picked up.</span> <span id="s653">And Father was lucky.</span> <span id="s654">He was at home.</span> <span id="s655">Nobody asked for him.</span> <span id="s656">But Herbert was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Again.</span> <span id="s659">And he was sent to South of France to Saint Supriel.</span> <span id="s660">Did you ever hear about that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: I do have a Mercur.</span> <span id="s662">Uh, but it doesn’t show that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No.</span> <span id="s664">That is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Almost on the French Riviera.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: It was on the French Riviera.</span> <span id="s667">But not in this section.</span> <span id="s668">It was near Spain.</span> <span id="s669">Near Paquinon.</span> <span id="s670">Paquinon is the frontier between Spain and France.</span> <span id="s671">That runs here.</span> <span id="s672">And, in his condition.</span> <span id="s673">In his health condition, it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s674">He was under doctor’s care.</span> <span id="s675">He got injections for the t.b., but it did not help very much before, you know, before the camp, it did not help very much.</span> <span id="s676">His testicles stayed swollen and he was in very deplorable condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: This is what year now.</span> <span id="s678">May 10 of 19.</span> <span id="s679">.</span> <span id="s680">?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Did you know where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No.</span> <span id="s684">I didn’t know anything where he was until months later.</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">it’s getting late…</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: No, I’m just watching because the tape is going to run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s689">Until months later, letters came from friends and they saw Herbert Gottschalk, and they wrote to me that he is fine and that he was trying to reach me.</span> <span id="s690">I went to the Swiss consulate to go over the diplomat mail.</span> <span id="s691">Maybe I could get a letter from my husband.</span> <span id="s692">It was not possible.</span> <span id="s693">But then I got one letter.</span> <span id="s694">One single letter, I had.</span> <span id="s695">And, he wrote to me that he is quite in good condition.</span> <span id="s696">That he lying in the sun nude, which is very good for t.b., but the food was not the best, I shouldn’t worry.</span> <span id="s697">That is all he wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: What were the conditions of your lives at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I was with my parents, and the condition was very…how you mean “condition”?</span> <span id="s700">You mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did you have enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Ya, we had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s703">Oh, sure, we had enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: You could buy food?</span> <span id="s705">You could buy clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: At this time we could buy enough food.</span> <span id="s707">The hunger came much, much later.</span> <span id="s708">There, we had enough to eat and we.</span> <span id="s709">.</span> <span id="s710">not that I remember…maybe I like to block it out.</span> <span id="s711">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s712">I don’t remember having seen one German soldier in Brussels.</span> <span id="s713">Maybe I like to block it out.</span> <span id="s714">.</span> <span id="s715">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s716">.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What were you doing with yourself on a daily basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Just keeping house.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Just keep…I was with my parents at this time, and with my sister, and I had my Jewish friends, even from Dortmund a Jewish friend, and we went in the park.</span> <span id="s721">We walked around and we tried to get contact with the husbands.</span> <span id="s722">She was lucky.</span> <span id="s723">She got contact with her husband, and, if I would tell you all the little situations we will sit here for a year.</span> <span id="s724">It’s impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s726">Were you afraid during that time?</span> <span id="s727">Personally afraid for your safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No, not yet.</span> <span id="s729">Not yet.</span> <span id="s730">We knew it will not stay this way all the time.</span> <span id="s731">We knew that it will not stay this way all the time, but we were not afraid.</span> <span id="s732">So, then, through, that is, you see, I told you, I cannot tell all the stories.</span> <span id="s733">For instance, there are things which play into your life, like, during the good time, we had Swiss friends who lived in Saint ________, and through them, I got a letter.</span> <span id="s734">My husband wrote a letter to the Swiss friends, and they wrote to me.</span> <span id="s735">And then I wrote to the Swiss friends and they wrote to Ernest.</span> <span id="s736">And that were very, very wealthy people.</span> <span id="s737">And they did send him money.</span> <span id="s738">They did send him things to wear, because he just had his shirt and a pair of slacks on his body, and, when he, I guess it was in October, .</span> <span id="s739">that the camp was not guarded, or, I don’t remember….</span> <span id="s740">He did fly….</span> <span id="s741">flew…flee….</span> <span id="s742">how do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: He flew, or he did fly.</span> <span id="s744">Whichever way you want…</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: He did not fly.</span> <span id="s746">He went out of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Escaped.</span> <span id="s749">He escaped with two or three other friends out of this camp and they walked, I don’t know how many miles, through the…through the vineyards…and they lived for two or three days, from…just from grapes, which is not a bad….</span> <span id="s750">very bad…</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Diet</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Diet.</span> <span id="s753">And, with the money he had from the Swiss bank, he came to…uh…they came to a station, where they found there were trains, and they took a train to Lyon.</span> <span id="s754">So, now he was in Lyon, and .</span> <span id="s755">.</span> <span id="s756">uh.</span> <span id="s757">.</span> <span id="s758">how this all went, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s759">Maybe, he certainly told me, he found a couch…he found an apartment with a Jewish woman…a Jewish family, and they rented to him a couch in the living room for nights.</span> <span id="s760">So, he wrote to me, “I am in Lyon and, if you can, it is better you come, but, I guess you had better stay with your parents.</span> <span id="s761">Luckily, I went.</span> <span id="s762">In, on December…</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So, these people who were renting him the couch, were really running a risk because they were harboring an escaped prisoner.</span> <span id="s764">.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s766">That’s right.</span> <span id="s767">But, I guess they had no books or anything else to uh.</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">uh.</span> <span id="s770">.</span> <span id="s771">know all the names of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s772">There were thousands and thousands Germans, Gentiles and …and Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s773">I don’t think he was ever missed there.</span> <span id="s774">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s775">Eh.</span> <span id="s776">.</span> <span id="s777">, but they was running a risk because he was not…he was not announced at the …at the Surete, that is the .</span> <span id="s778">.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Police</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Police.</span> <span id="s781">So, that he did not do.</span> <span id="s782">Everything you can buy with money.</span> <span id="s783">Some way he paid for his .</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">uh.</span> <span id="s786">.</span> <span id="s787">card.</span> <span id="s788">.</span> <span id="s789">identity card.</span> <span id="s790">.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Identity card</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Identity card, but not a French one.</span> <span id="s793">That he is escaped from Germany, and he is a Jew, and so on.</span> <span id="s794">He had to fill that out and he got a card from .</span> <span id="s795">.</span> <span id="s796">uh.</span> <span id="s797">.</span> <span id="s798">from the French…from the French government that he can stand for the next four weeks or the next months.</span> <span id="s799">But it always had to be…</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Renewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Renewed.</span> <span id="s802">So, my parents were absolutely against it that I went to France to see my husband.</span> <span id="s803">I said I have to go to Herbert and I have to stay with him and uh.</span> <span id="s804">.</span> <span id="s805">that is the thing I will do.</span> <span id="s806">So, I went from Belgium to Lyon.</span> <span id="s807">But that was not very easy because I knew he had no money, and I had a little.</span> <span id="s808">I guess it was maybe two or three hundred dollars in Brussels.</span> <span id="s809">So, I asked a friend.</span> <span id="s810">I had a small suitcase.</span> <span id="s811">To make a double, double bottom and he put those two or three hundred dollars into this suitcase.</span> <span id="s812">And, with this suitcase I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s813">In Paris, I had to get… Now, that was not as you go from here to New York, believe me.</span> <span id="s814">It was.</span> <span id="s815">.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Much more complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: (laughter)Complicated and dangerous.</span> <span id="s818">But with my uh.</span> <span id="s819">.</span> <span id="s820">punim--you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Head?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: No, not head, my punim--my face.</span> <span id="s823">With my face, I was maybe a little lucky and nobody suspected that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s824">So, in Paris, I needed it…Oh, yah, I had a letter from his doctor that he is critical sick and I had to go to see him (not that I would stay, you see)…I had to go to see him.</span> <span id="s825">And, with this letter I went to the German embassy, or German Gestapo.</span> <span id="s826">I really don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s827">But, I got the permission to go from Paris to Lyon.</span> <span id="s828">There was a demarcation.</span> <span id="s829">I don’t know how should, how I should explain it.</span> <span id="s830">That was a partition between the North of France and the South of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Say that word again, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: De-ma-DEMA.</span> <span id="s833">.</span> <span id="s834">maybe R .</span> <span id="s835">.</span> <span id="s836">KRATION.</span> <span id="s837">Demarcation.</span> <span id="s838">.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Oh, demarcation.</span> <span id="s840">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s842">And, uh.</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">, when I would have passed that, then the danger for me to get caught as a Jew was a little less.</span> <span id="s845">Because this part was not as dangerous.</span> <span id="s846">The South of France was not as dangerous as the North of France.</span> <span id="s847">Not yet.</span> <span id="s848">So, during the ride from Paris to this part.</span> <span id="s849">.</span> <span id="s850">to the demarkacion ____________________ I was standing…You know the German uh…uh.</span> <span id="s851">.</span> <span id="s852">trains.</span> <span id="s853">.</span> <span id="s854">There they have this walk from the…You sit in the compartment.</span> <span id="s855">.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: So then there is a hallway on the side…</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: A hallway.</span> <span id="s858">I was standing outside and next to me was standing…I’ll never forget it…a German officer.</span> <span id="s859">High placed person.</span> <span id="s860">And, we came in conversation, and he was a very nice gentleman.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t know what was his name.</span> <span id="s862">And he said, “Why are you going to Lyon?</span> <span id="s863">What are you travelling here?”</span> <span id="s864">I said that I am going to Lyon to see my husband who is a very sick man and, uh, I wanted to know how his feelings were.</span> <span id="s865">I said my husband is Jew.</span> <span id="s866">“Ach”, he says “That is terrible what they are doing _____________________________________.”</span> <span id="s867">I did not tell him that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s868">Uh.</span> <span id="s869">That is really terrible.</span> <span id="s870">And he really did feel for them.</span> <span id="s871">How he was later, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: At that time, how much did you know about what they were doing to the Jews?</span> <span id="s873">You know, that was not… (overlapping)</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: We knew they would do something.</span> <span id="s875">We did not know anything about extermination.</span> <span id="s876">We only knew that they wanted to take the Jews out of Germany and we only knew that there will be a time where we will come in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s877">That we knew.</span> <span id="s878">But, when it would be, we did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: How did you know about concentration camps, then?</span> <span id="s880">They were already taking.</span> <span id="s881">.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: That word.</span> <span id="s883">.</span> <span id="s884">concentration schlage.</span> <span id="s885">.</span> <span id="s886">that was a word which was constantly used.</span> <span id="s887">That was a word which was constantly used.</span> <span id="s888">Uh…so we came to the demarkation ______ and my little suitcase.</span> <span id="s889">.</span> <span id="s890">If he would have taken out all the things of the suitcase, he would have found the money, because it was done very badly.</span> <span id="s891">So, as I was talking with this German officer, he was my big help, you know.</span> <span id="s892">They saw him.</span> <span id="s893">They talked to him, and they thought maybe I am his girlfriend, or whatever, and we were passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: What a lucky break!</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: It was a very luck break.</span> <span id="s896">So, I</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Where should.</span> <span id="s899">.</span> <span id="s900">When I came to the house where my husband was?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s903">I did uh.</span> <span id="s904">.</span> <span id="s905">ring the bell and the lady opened the door and “You must be Ilsa”.</span> <span id="s906">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s907">“Your husband is waiting for you.”</span> <span id="s908">And, I, uh.</span> <span id="s909">.</span> <span id="s910">she opened the door to the living room where he was lying on the very small couch and, uh.</span> <span id="s911">.</span> <span id="s912">so.</span> <span id="s913">.</span> <span id="s914">I told him that.</span> <span id="s915">.</span> <span id="s916">He said, “Ille, Ille, how.</span> <span id="s917">.</span> <span id="s918">how could you come here?</span> <span id="s919">We have no money.”</span> <span id="s920">I said, “Ernest.</span> <span id="s921">.</span> <span id="s922">(laughter).</span> <span id="s923">.</span> <span id="s924">Herbert, I brought money and I did show him the little suitcase.</span> <span id="s925">When he saw the suitcase, he almost fainted, because he said, “Ille, if they had found it, you.</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">you would have been dead because they would have found it right away.”</span> <span id="s928">And I told him the story.</span> <span id="s929">So, in this, on this very, very small couch half of this here, I was sleeping with him for two weeks.</span> <span id="s930">.</span> <span id="s931">And when he turned around, I had to turn around too.</span> <span id="s932">(laughter) But that did not matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s934">You were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No.</span> <span id="s936">Oh, my God, we were together!</span> <span id="s937">And, so, right away, we went to a doctor, a specialist for this, as I told you, epididymitis, and he said he has to be operated, so that at least the pus is going to be taken out.</span> <span id="s938">So he was operated, and,if I remember, I guess he didn’t take anything for this operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: No anesthesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No, he did not take no money.</span> <span id="s941">No money.</span> <span id="s942">He did not take any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: He didn’t take any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Money.</span> <span id="s945">He did not take any money of .</span> <span id="s946">.</span> <span id="s947">of.</span> <span id="s948">.</span> <span id="s949">uh this operation, and he was a wonderful, wonderful doctor.</span> <span id="s950">So…but we could not stay in Lyon.</span> <span id="s951">We only got the permission to stay in Lyon for such and such time.</span> <span id="s952">And then we had to go in the vicinity from Lyon and we found, in a village, which is, you will hear later, very important village, Chapon.</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">how far are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: CHAPON.</span> <span id="s956">.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: ost.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: That’s the village near Lyon?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Near Lyon, about .</span> <span id="s960">.</span> <span id="s961">uh.</span> <span id="s962">.</span> <span id="s963">by streetcar maybe an hour.</span> <span id="s964">We found a very small apartment and, uh.</span> <span id="s965">.</span> <span id="s966">, oh, yah, our friends from Switzerland had a friend with, by the name of Monsieur Kornier.</span> <span id="s967">He was an officer in the French Army and he was .</span> <span id="s968">.</span> <span id="s969">uh.</span> <span id="s970">.</span> <span id="s971">and he was working in the French underground.</span> <span id="s972">And, we met him in Lyon, while we were still in Lyon, we met him in Lyon, and, uh.</span> <span id="s973">.</span> <span id="s974">, he was very, very nice to us, and he said, “Whenever you need me, let me know.”</span> <span id="s975">My husband, who was a very suspicious man, said, “Ille, be very careful.</span> <span id="s976">This Monsieur Kornier is a German spy, and his name is Koerner.</span> <span id="s977">.”</span> <span id="s978">So, I said, “That’s not true.</span> <span id="s979">You are (can I say mishuga?)</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Yes, you can say mishuga.</span> <span id="s981">.</span> <span id="s982">crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yes, you are mishuga.</span> <span id="s984">You always are so suspicious, and he is so wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s985">And he says “Don’t ever tell him where we are going.”</span> <span id="s986">So, he knew nothing from, of Chaponost because Herbert didn’t want it, so I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s987">So, we were in Chaponost in 1941 and we met there other Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s988">And, he was married to a Gentile girl.</span> <span id="s989">But, she stayed Gentile and the children were not converted either.</span> <span id="s990">One day, in ’42, September ’42, he came to us and he said, “We have to go away from here.</span> <span id="s991">The situation is getting terrible.</span> <span id="s992">We cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s993">They will come and take us.</span> <span id="s994">We have to try to go to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s995">So, Herbert said, “How can be go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s996">We cannot take a train.</span> <span id="s997">We have to go to the frontier by train and from there we have to go over the mountains into Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s998">That is a terrible part that I tell you now.</span> <span id="s999">So we had very little money, and we found as guide who would us taken over the mountain into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1000">You were never in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Yes, I have been in Switzerland, and I am envisaging you crossing the mountains.</span> <span id="s1002">It sounds almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1003">Those are very steep mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Where were you in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: In Basil, in Zurich and</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Not Laclimond…in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Ya, there is Laclimond.</span> <span id="s1009">That is the, what is the lake?</span> <span id="s1010">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1011">Uh…Montre?</span> <span id="s1012">You were in Montre?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1014">I was not in Montre.</span> <span id="s1015">In Lucerne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Lucerne.</span> <span id="s1017">O.K. eh.</span> <span id="s1018">.</span> <span id="s1019">This __________ because the name was dark Dutch.</span> <span id="s1020">Let me start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1021">We went by train to the frontier.</span> <span id="s1022">There we found this guide, this French guide.</span> <span id="s1023">We gave him the money.</span> <span id="s1024">It was almost all we had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: There were just the two of you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Ya, there were the other family, but that takes too long to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: They were lucky to stay in Switzerland, but we were not lucky.</span> <span id="s1029">It takes too long.</span> <span id="s1030">And, it was just with them…but we found this guide,and he took our money and he said, “I bring you up to the Dondorsch.”</span> <span id="s1031">I don’t know how high the Dondorsch is.</span> <span id="s1032">Let’s say like Mt. Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: In New Hampshire?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: In New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s1035">Maybe a little higher.</span> <span id="s1036">It was in October already snow on top.</span> <span id="s1037">My husband had a certificate and a letter from the doctor that he was operated and his health in a very bad condition.</span> <span id="s1038">This letter he had with him for the Swiss to.</span> <span id="s1039">.</span> <span id="s1040">uh.</span> <span id="s1041">.</span> <span id="s1042">in the frontier to ___________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: The border guards?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: The border guards.</span> <span id="s1045">So…we went the whole night.</span> <span id="s1046">We walked up the mountains.</span> <span id="s1047">It was bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s1048">And, you know, we didn’t had the right shoes for things like that, and for an hour or two we went into a stable to get warm, and then we went further to the mountains.</span> <span id="s1049">On top of the mountains, were a little…how you call…hut, and in this hut were two or three men who make cheese, and there we should find the guide who would take us to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Was this on a paved road, or a trail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s1052">That was over stones and, uh.</span> <span id="s1053">.</span> <span id="s1054">, and.</span> <span id="s1055">.</span> <span id="s1056">stoney.</span> <span id="s1057">.</span> <span id="s1058">and not paved roads.</span> <span id="s1059">It was through.</span> <span id="s1060">.</span> <span id="s1061">first through the woods and then later on through the stones, and there, on the top of the mountains, there are no trees.</span> <span id="s1062">So, we stayed a whole day.</span> <span id="s1063">He never came.</span> <span id="s1064">He was gone and the money was gone.</span> <span id="s1065">So, my husband said…And that…Those men said, “Now you go down.”</span> <span id="s1066">We had to go down again to go into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1067">The name of the… We should have gone to Aguna.</span> <span id="s1068">That is already in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1069">But the frontier was .</span> <span id="s1070">.</span> <span id="s1071">there are two Saint Gan Gall.</span> <span id="s1072">One Saint Gan Gall is French.</span> <span id="s1073">The other Saint Gan Gall is Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: I don’t understand the word, Saint Gan Gall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Saint Gan Gall is a village.</span> <span id="s1076">St. Gingolph, I suppose, but I can look it up…So, there are two St. Gan Galls.</span> <span id="s1077">One is Switzerland, and one is French.</span> <span id="s1078">It’s a lake.</span> <span id="s1079">We walked and we walked and suddenly we see a Swiss guard, and he came to us.</span> <span id="s1080">We showed him our passports.</span> <span id="s1081">We showed him that we are Jews, and my husband showed his letter.</span> <span id="s1082">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s1083">“Come with me.</span> <span id="s1084">We go to my higher place.</span> <span id="s1085">.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Commandant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Commandant.</span> <span id="s1088">We came to Saint Gan Galls to the commandant.</span> <span id="s1089">The room was.</span> <span id="s1090">.</span> <span id="s1091">uh.</span> <span id="s1092">.</span> <span id="s1093">Oh my God!</span> <span id="s1094">{listen here} The room was a little bigger than this one here.</span> <span id="s1095">So, the commandant, heavy, Swiss, like the Swiss are cursing, he said, “We don’t want you here.</span> <span id="s1096">The time has passed where we accepted the immigrants.</span> <span id="s1097">We just…maybe two or three days later where they opened the frontier to the immigrants.</span> <span id="s1098">You know, that they go from France into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: But now it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I said to him, “Please read this letter.</span> <span id="s1101">My husband is such a sick man.”</span> <span id="s1102">He didn’t even read the letter.</span> <span id="s1103">He said, “If he can go over the Dondorsch, and he is not sick.</span> <span id="s1104">That is a fake.</span> <span id="s1105">.</span> <span id="s1106">it’s a fake letter.</span> <span id="s1107">And he had there three or four guns.</span> <span id="s1108">I said to him, “Please don’t send us back.</span> <span id="s1109">Kill us here.”</span> <span id="s1110">And he hit me so terrible.</span> <span id="s1111">{Listen here} He gave me seven .</span> <span id="s1112">.</span> <span id="s1113">how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Slaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Slaps.</span> <span id="s1116">________________________________________.</span> <span id="s1117">And then they took my Herbert, two officers took Herbert under the arm and I went with him to the frontier.</span> <span id="s1118">They opened the…there is such a …how can I say…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Barricade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Barricade.</span> <span id="s1121">They opened the barricade and on the other side was the French Gestapo, and there we were…Three years ago, I witnessed my husband, with ___________________________and I saw exactly the same

id="s1125">This is really hard on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: They took us and naturally, many other people tried to go over the frontier, from France to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1127">They caught them all.</span> <span id="s1128">They caught them all.</span> <span id="s1129">There were maybe three hundred fifty people.</span> <span id="s1130">Some stayed in the prison, in Saint Gan Gall, and some, who had money, could stay in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1131">We had a few dollars, a few francs left, and we said we wanted to stay in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1132">So, we …oh, no, oh, my God, we came to the gendarmerie…</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: To the police station.</span> <span id="s1134">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: To the police station, and they took all.</span> <span id="s1136">.</span> <span id="s1137">Herbert’s name and all the things what you have to take if you have a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1138">And, then, they started with me and, you know, what I did.</span> <span id="s1139">I said, “You have nothing to do with me, I am Gentile.”</span> <span id="s1140">So he said, “O.K.</span> <span id="s1141">You are free.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Just like that.</span> <span id="s1144">It was.</span> <span id="s1145">.</span> <span id="s1146">I will tell

she did that.</span> <span id="s1151">So, he says, “You are free, I don’t need you.”</span> <span id="s1152">I said, “I’ll stay with my husband, but I have to go to the toilet, and another man came with me outside, and, in a little box, I had the jewelry from my mother-in-law and from my old jewelry.</span> <span id="s1153">And I gave him the box.</span> <span id="s1154">I said, “Please, take all this, and let my husband come out with me.”</span> <span id="s1155">He says, “I can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s1156">He couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: So, he was imprisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: With me, in the hotel.</span> <span id="s1159">We were in a hotel, but in front of the door were policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: You just had to stay in the hotel room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: We stayed in the hotel room until the next train would go to Redersad.</span> <span id="s1162">Did you hear about Redersad?</span> <span id="s1163">It is near Saint Prien, near Perion, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: That was a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: That was a camp.</span> <span id="s1166">It was the camp for going to Drancy.</span> <span id="s1167">From Drancy to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: So we stayed in the hotel and I washed .</span> <span id="s1170">.</span> <span id="s1171">I washed my husband’s things that he would look clean because you told me about people who kept themselves clean.</span> <span id="s1172">That was the only thing I _________ took care of, to be clean.</span> <span id="s1173">To look clean and to be clean.</span> <span id="s1174">So, uh.</span> <span id="s1175">.</span> <span id="s1176">and.</span> <span id="s1177">.</span> <span id="s1178">in front of us was the lake.</span> <span id="s1179">Herbert couldn’t swim, and I am a good swimmer.</span> <span id="s1180">If I would have been alone, I would have swum through the lake to the other side to Montreux.</span> <span id="s1181">We saw on the other side of the lake, Montreux.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Why would you have gone there?</span> <span id="s1183">Would it have been safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Montreux?</span> <span id="s1185">Montreux is French.</span> <span id="s1186">.</span> <span id="s1187">is.</span> <span id="s1188">.</span> <span id="s1189">is Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1190">Montreux is Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1191">.</span> <span id="s1192">So, but I couldn’t leave him here, so we.</span> <span id="s1193">.</span> <span id="s1194">I stayed with…Will you believe me, we made love there.</span> <span id="s1195">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: That’s a reaffirmation of life, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Ya, I guess it was.</span> <span id="s1198">So, the next day, we were 350 people, women, children, men.</span> <span id="s1199">A family Friedman, whom I recall from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1200">My husband is from Czechoslovakia, but no relatives were with us and we came in.</span> <span id="s1201">.</span> <span id="s1202">all.</span> <span id="s1203">.</span> <span id="s1204">in those few hours very close.</span> <span id="s1205">So, we went into the train, and the whole night,…oh, yah.</span> <span id="s1206">.</span> <span id="s1207">and the people next to the window on the train, to the window which went outside…they were all on chains…can you imagine.</span> <span id="s1208">.</span> <span id="s1209">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: They were all…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: On chains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: On chains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yah, it’s unbelieveable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: This was what kind of a train, now?</span> <span id="s1215">_____ cars or passenger trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh, no, regular passenger trains, French, French and the guards were partly German and partly French.</span> <span id="s1217">So.</span> <span id="s1218">.</span> <span id="s1219">Yah, and then one came and said, “What is this woman doing here?”</span> <span id="s1220">(me) And he said, “She, …she accompanied her husband into the camp.</span> <span id="s1221">.”</span> <span id="s1222">What I would do there, I don’t know, but everything what I tell you now was guided by God.</span> <span id="s1223">You can think I’m michuga, but everything what you will hear.</span> <span id="s1224">.</span> <span id="s1225">it’s like being guided by God.</span> <span id="s1226">What I did, I was not a ________________ to do that, really…I was guided by God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">So, the whole night through, we drove, and, uh, and I guess we had together one slice of bread with us.</span> <span id="s1228">Now the hunger started, you know.</span> <span id="s1229">And, we came to Bibezat and we came out of the train and then, what you see in the movie, rush, rush, rush, rush, rush, in the camion in those trucks.</span> <span id="s1230">And, I was constantly standing next to my husband and we came into the camp, and…Men right, women left.</span> <span id="s1231">____________________________________.</span> <span id="s1232">“What is this woman doing here?”</span> <span id="s1233">“She accompan.</span> <span id="s1234">.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Accompanied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Accompanied her husband.</span> <span id="s1237">“What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1238">I said.</span> <span id="s1239">.</span> <span id="s1240">uh.</span> <span id="s1241">.</span> <span id="s1242">“I am Gentile and I am with my husband.”</span> <span id="s1243">“Out, out!”</span> <span id="s1244">“I will not.</span> <span id="s1245">.</span> <span id="s1246">”“Out, out.</span> <span id="s1247">.”</span> <span id="s1248">I have to tell you, my husband told me before “Ille, you believe in everything and in everybody.</span> <span id="s1249">For once, listen to me.</span> <span id="s1250">Don’t have confidence in your money.</span> <span id="s1251">Don’t tell them that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1252">Don’t tell them that you have…” I guess I had 10 or 20 dollars.</span> <span id="s1253">.</span> <span id="s1254">that was about all the fortune I had.</span> <span id="s1255">.</span> <span id="s1256">“Don’t tell them anything.”</span> <span id="s1257">So I went out and I was crying my heart out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Did you still have your box of jewelry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yah, I had the box of jewelry.</span> <span id="s1260">This little box, I had until we came here.</span> <span id="s1261">Then, I did throw it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: I would have thought you would have kept it as a remembrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Well, I have no children.</span> <span id="s1264">I couldn”t have children on account of Herbert.</span> <span id="s1265">That was the worst thing for him.</span> <span id="s1266">________it happened that he couldn’t produce any children.</span> <span id="s1267">I have to mention that all the time he was sick, he always…he could …we could love each other, but he could not produce children.</span> <span id="s1268">So, he was in the concentration camp_____________________________.</span> <span id="s1269">That was not…i was a camp where they gathered all the Jews together, children, women and men, for transportation to Drancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: I think they called those “transit” camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Transit camps…and from Drancy, there were two Auschwitz ________________.</span> <span id="s1272">Uh.</span> <span id="s1273">.</span> <span id="s1274">while I was going to leave there, to take a train, I did not know where to, a man came behind me, a tiny man, I forgot his name…a Jewish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: They made you get off of this train?</span> <span id="s1276">They made you leave your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: I left my husband.</span> <span id="s1278">I went out of the camp, and while I was going toward the station, Revesald station.</span> <span id="s1279">.</span> <span id="s1280">this train station, somebody went.</span> <span id="s1281">.</span> <span id="s1282">came behind me and saw that I was crying and he said to me, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s1283">I said, “I brought my husband into the camp and.</span> <span id="s1284">.</span> <span id="s1285">uh…”But why aren’t you in the camp?”</span> <span id="s1286">I said, “I am Gentile.</span> <span id="s1287">I am not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1288">“Oh, I have the same thing with my wife.</span> <span id="s1289">My wife is Gentile and I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1290">But, your husband will come out.</span> <span id="s1291">They will let him out here in Revesald.</span> <span id="s1292">If you are not Jewish, they will let him out, and if you would be pregnant, that would be even better.”</span> <span id="s1293">So, for three months, I didn’t had my menstruation, with all the commotion going on.</span> <span id="s1294">.</span> <span id="s1295">but, I knew I couldn’t be pregnant.</span> <span id="s1296">I went right _______________________.</span> <span id="s1297">So, I went, ….</span> <span id="s1298">he said, “You know what you have to do?</span> <span id="s1299">You have to go to Perignon.</span> <span id="s1300">There is a Jewish committee and they help a lot.</span> <span id="s1301">And they know what they can do for your husband.”</span> <span id="s1302">So, I said, “How do I go to Perignon?”</span> <span id="s1303">He said, “You take the train from Rivesad to Perignon.</span> <span id="s1304">I take a train to Perignon, too.</span> <span id="s1305">I live in Perignon.</span> <span id="s1306">And, do you have money?</span> <span id="s1307">I say I have a few francs.</span> <span id="s1308">I will see how far it can go.</span> <span id="s1309">I almost told him that I have dollars.</span> <span id="s1310">We went to Perignon.</span> <span id="s1311">He asked me a few questions, but, as Herbert told me “Be careful!”</span> <span id="s1312">I was very careful with him, you see.</span> <span id="s1313">So then, he said to me “The Committee is there and there.</span> <span id="s1314">I forgot the street.</span> <span id="s1315">It has been so long ago.</span> <span id="s1316">And you go and ask for Mrs. Blass.</span> <span id="s1317">Her name was Blass.</span> <span id="s1318">I said, “Please, as you know everybody here, do me a favor, come with me and introduce me, so it is much better to have somebody,.</span> <span id="s1319">.</span> <span id="s1320">to be introduced.”</span> <span id="s1321">So, he didn’t want to come.</span> <span id="s1322">But, finally, he came with me.</span> <span id="s1323">He opened the door, and just across was Mrs. Blass.</span> <span id="s1324">She said….</span> <span id="s1325">He said, “There is Mrs. Blass.”</span> <span id="s1326">I was in the room and he closed the door.</span> <span id="s1327">I went to Mrs. Blass and I told her, and I gave her all my heartaches I had.</span> <span id="s1328">I told her in Jewish, and I said, “I am not Jewish, and my husband is in the camp, and if she could do something for me, and I have very little money.</span> <span id="s1329">I..</span> <span id="s1330">If she could help me.</span> <span id="s1331">___________________________________.</span> <span id="s1332">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1333">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1334">I said, “Is there nothing what you could do for my husband?</span> <span id="s1335">Maybe you can bring him a letter.”</span> <span id="s1336">She said, “Nein, I can’t do anything for you.”</span> <span id="s1337">That was all in French, nit Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: This was a Jewish lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: That was the Jewish, Jewish committee, for people from Riversad to Drancy.</span> <span id="s1340">That was the committee who did everything they could to help from the nebish… from Riversad to Drancy.</span> <span id="s1341">That is maybe a night or two or a day or two trip.</span> <span id="s1342">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: So you were terribly disappointed because you were counting on her to do something.</span> <span id="s1344">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1346">I told you, listen to me, you will hear how God was with me.</span> <span id="s1347">You will not believe.</span> <span id="s1348">You ____, you laugh,:</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: No, no, I told you.</span> <span id="s1350">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Maybe you think I am a little meshugah…So I went out and I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1352">At this time I was still….</span> <span id="s1353">it’s a small story, but I must tell it to you.</span> <span id="s1354">.</span> <span id="s1355">I was a very heavy smoker.</span> <span id="s1356">And, there was a small café, a bistro, and I went into this bistro to have a cup of coffee, and, uh, and while I was sitting there, I saw half a cigarette sitting there, unsmoked.</span> <span id="s1357">And, from somebody else, I took the cigarette and smoked it.</span> <span id="s1358">But, I took something, and there asked for a telephone book.</span> <span id="s1359">And, through this telephone book, I went through all Jewish names--from A to Z--Abanzol, Ezaksol und.</span> <span id="s1360">.</span> <span id="s1361">and all the Jewish names.</span> <span id="s1362">I went further and further.</span> <span id="s1363">I couldn’t find the right name.</span> <span id="s1364">Finally, I came to a name, Weil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: What was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Weil.</span> <span id="s1367">Weil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: W E I L?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: E I L..</span> <span id="s1370">I don’t know why I used it, but I used that name Weil and I wrote down the address and I asked there and they told me it’s about half an hour,three quarters of an hour a walk.</span> <span id="s1371">So, I walked to Mr. Weil.</span> <span id="s1372">It was a hot day.</span> <span id="s1373">Perignon, down in the South, it’s like here.</span> <span id="s1374">It was very hot.</span> <span id="s1375">And hungry.</span> <span id="s1376">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1377">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1378">So, I did ring the bell and Mrs. Weil opened the door and, I guess, for the first time in my life, I collapsed.</span> <span id="s1379">I collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: .</span> <span id="s1381">.</span> <span id="s1382">just on her doorstep.</span> <span id="s1383">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: On her doorstep.</span> <span id="s1385">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1386">.</span> <span id="s1387">my knees…I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1388">So she brought me into her living room, and the first thing they gave me was a cognac.</span> <span id="s1389">That was not what…what I needed--a cognac.</span> <span id="s1390">And I asked her if she has a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1391">And I told her my story and Mr. Weil was with her, too.</span> <span id="s1392">And,…uh…she was Catholic, and he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1393">He was.</span> <span id="s1394">.</span> <span id="s1395">They were married and she was Catholic and he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1396">And, uh.</span> <span id="s1397">.</span> <span id="s1398">until bread I could talk, I could collect myself.</span> <span id="s1399">He says, “Didn’t you go to the…in Perignon to the consulate?”</span> <span id="s1400">I said I was at the consulate to Mrs. Blass, but she was so reluctant to do nothing…she did not want to do anything for me.</span> <span id="s1401">So, he said, “I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1402">.</span> <span id="s1403">She is doing for everybody something.</span> <span id="s1404">I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1405">Maybe she didn’t believe you, as we, in the beginning, didn’t believe you.</span> <span id="s1406">Sometimes the Gentile face is not good either.</span> <span id="s1407">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Well, all right.</span> <span id="s1409">But go ahead.</span> <span id="s1410">I think it is remarkable that you chose a name almost at the end of the alphabet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: I told you.</span> <span id="s1412">HE was.</span> <span id="s1413">.</span> <span id="s1414">HE with big letters, HE was guiding me.</span> <span id="s1415">So, he took his bicycle, and I walked next to him, and we went back to this Committee, and he opened the door.</span> <span id="s1416">He must have been a very well-known person with the Committee.</span> <span id="s1417">Maybe he was a donor.</span> <span id="s1418">He was French.</span> <span id="s1419">So, I was sitting next to Mrs. Blass and she looked at me and she said, “How do you.</span> <span id="s1420">.</span> <span id="s1421">did you meet this man who came with you.”</span> <span id="s1422">I said “It’s…_______________at the camp back where I brought my husband.”</span> <span id="s1423">“What did you tell him?</span> <span id="s1424">Did you tell him that you are Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1425">I said, “No, I didn’t tell him anything.”</span> <span id="s1426">“That is the biggest spy we have here in Pergignon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Mr. Weil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: No, this man who brought me into the committee.</span> <span id="s1429">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: So, that’s why she was so hostile to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Yah, that is why she was so hostile.</span> <span id="s1432">Now I was introduced and now the whole committee was working for Herbert Gottschalk, but they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1433">They could have brought him something to eat and they brought him a fold cot __________________, but there was nothing they could do for him.</span> <span id="s1434">And.</span> <span id="s1435">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Were they allowed to go in and out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yah, yah, they were allowed to go in and out of the camp at this time.</span> <span id="s1438">Maybe half a year later, they had to fly to…not fly.</span> <span id="s1439">.</span> <span id="s1440">they had to go away…</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Escape from Pergignon to…into Spain.</span> <span id="s1443">So, but at this time they could do that.</span> <span id="s1444">.</span> <span id="s1445">and, uh…, and they gave him money.</span> <span id="s1446">The committee…I didn’t want to have the money.</span> <span id="s1447">I said, “I have here a few francs and I have a few dollars.</span> <span id="s1448">You take the money, and after the war, you’ll give me the money back and they have found er.</span> <span id="s1449">.</span> <span id="s1450">a room for me where I could sleep during the night without being.</span> <span id="s1451">.</span> <span id="s1452">because I couldn’t go to sleep because I couldn’t go to the police.</span> <span id="s1453">Everything was clandestine.</span> <span id="s1454">How you could say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: uh.</span> <span id="s1456">.</span> <span id="s1457">Secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Secret.</span> <span id="s1459">Yah.</span> <span id="s1460">Everything was secret.</span> <span id="s1461">Uh.</span> <span id="s1462">.</span> <span id="s1463">uh…The

id="s1472">I said to them to do something--he should not go.</span> <span id="s1473">Whatever_______ maybe he can help himself as he cannot…as he is not the type to do that.</span> <span id="s1474">“Come this afternoon.</span> <span id="s1475">I bring him bread.</span> <span id="s1476">I bring him the last greetings.”</span> <span id="s1477">They brought me his ring, you know.</span> <span id="s1478">.</span> <span id="s1479">“.</span> <span id="s1480">and come this afternoon and I tell you the last words.”</span> <span id="s1481">I went away.</span> <span id="s1482">I went home to my room.</span> <span id="s1483">Now, I tell you something what nobody can understand.</span> <span id="s1484">Never, never ever in my whole life I would be able to pray like I prayed this afternoon.</span> <span id="s1485">{Listen here} I don’t know what I prayed, but I did not pray loud.</span> <span id="s1486">I had to pray…</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: .</span> <span id="s1488">.</span> <span id="s1489">that was all there was left to do</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yah, but I gave him the strength.</span> <span id="s1491">I gave Herbert the strength.</span> <span id="s1492">With my praying, I gave him something that he came out of the train.</span> <span id="s1493">He didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1494">When I came to the ….</span> <span id="s1495">I would have died…_________I would have died.</span> <span id="s1496">I wouldn’t have stayed alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: He did not have to go to Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: No.</span> <span id="s1499">When I came to the Committee…oh, yah.</span> <span id="s1500">.</span> <span id="s1501">the people who did the most for these desperate people who were in the train for the Drancy.</span> <span id="s1502">.</span> <span id="s1503">it was Rabbi Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1504">Please I would like that.</span> <span id="s1505">.</span> <span id="s1506">if I could find him--this Rabbi Fuchs--Rabbi Fuchs and I guess he had a brother, Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1507">But he was a Rabbi, and he knew Herbert very well through me, and he did most.</span> <span id="s1508">.</span> <span id="s1509">mostly the conversation between Herbert and me, und me and Herbert, you know.</span> <span id="s1510">I mean, he brought what he said.</span> <span id="s1511">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: He carried messages back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: He carried messages.</span> <span id="s1514">So, Rabbi Fuchs went with, I don’t know how many loaves of bread to this train, where Herbert was inside.</span> <span id="s1515">He was…Herbert was standing in the window, and Herbert…I tell you know what Herbert told me…I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s1516">That is what Herbert told me how he came out of the train.</span> <span id="s1517">Uh.</span> <span id="s1518">.</span> <span id="s1519">He went to the window, Herbert, and he took the bread, and he had.</span> <span id="s1520">.</span> <span id="s1521">Herbert always had such a green hat he looked like a Gestapo man when he was wearing that hat.</span> <span id="s1522">.</span> <span id="s1523">I always said, “Don’t wear it.”</span> <span id="s1524">“And, how is my wife?”</span> <span id="s1525">he said.</span> <span id="s1526">Impitoriable.</span> <span id="s1527">What is impitoriable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Imperturbable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Not upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Very upset.</span> <span id="s1532">Yah.</span> <span id="s1533">Very, very.</span> <span id="s1534">Untrostlich auf Deutsch.</span> <span id="s1535">In German.</span> <span id="s1536">You can’t give her any comfort.</span> <span id="s1537">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Inconsolable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Inconsolable.</span> <span id="s1540">________________.</span> <span id="s1541">So, he said to himself, “I cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1542">That’s why I have to go out.</span> <span id="s1543">They should kill me here.</span> <span id="s1544">Instead…then she knows where I died.</span> <span id="s1545">.</span> <span id="s1546">instead in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1547">So, he took his hat, and, uh.</span> <span id="s1548">.</span> <span id="s1549">, he went to the through…these were trains like all the other trains with this walk on the outside.</span> <span id="s1550">He went on the outside and just when he came to the door, two Gestapo men came in and said, “You are not (I have to translate from German) you are not going out!</span> <span id="s1551">My husband said, “No, not at all, I have to help here.</span> <span id="s1552">They have to have bread.</span> <span id="s1553">So he went to Rabbi Fuchs and hollared to him, “How did you come out here?”</span> <span id="s1554">“I just went out here.</span> <span id="s1555">I told them I had to help with the bread.”</span> <span id="s1556">But, as you see, we have no bread.</span> <span id="s1557">We have to go in the village for bread.”</span> <span id="s1558">So Rabbi Fuchs said, “I understand.”</span> <span id="s1559">And he took Herbert.</span> <span id="s1560">And there were on both sides, uh, with the, uh, I don’t…I only know it in French.</span> <span id="s1561">.</span> <span id="s1562">there were on….</span> <span id="s1563">they had to go through, through…you see the Gestapo on the right and the left side and you have to go through this.</span> <span id="s1564">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Turnstile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: No, not a turnstile.</span> <span id="s1567">Like a way, where you go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: A walkway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: A walkway.</span> <span id="s1570">They were standing on both sides with the gun on their shoulder, just ready to shoot.</span> <span id="s1571">One asked, “Where are you going with this man?”</span> <span id="s1572">“We have to buy bread in the village.”</span> <span id="s1573">So, they went out.</span> <span id="s1574">They took the car.</span> <span id="s1575">They went to Perpignan, and he did hide Herbert in his hotel and when I came into…into the committee, he was waiting.</span> <span id="s1576">So, he winked to me and he said, “Come, come.”</span> <span id="s1577">I said, “Where is my husband?</span> <span id="s1578">Where is my husband?”</span> <span id="s1579">“He is here.”</span> <span id="s1580">“Where, where?”</span> <span id="s1581">“Well, I bring him.”</span> <span id="s1582">And I had him back.</span> <span id="s1583">I had him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: How long did that last?</span> <span id="s1585">How long did you stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: From there on, we stayed all the time together until we were liberated, but that is not the end of my story.</span> <span id="s1587">This story, yes.</span> <span id="s1588">Yah, from there they gave us forms, identity cards as French people and we went from uh.</span> <span id="s1589">.</span> <span id="s1590">from Perpignan to Lyon to a little, but a little, not a little.</span> <span id="s1591">.</span> <span id="s1592">like a chateau.</span> <span id="s1593">.</span> <span id="s1594">to a house, a chateau.</span> <span id="s1595">Herbert met a gentleman in Chaproneau, who had a very, very big estate and they were very close.</span> <span id="s1596">He was a very old man and he liked Herbert.</span> <span id="s1597">Herbert knew that he knew that Herbert was a Jew and that we both were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1598">So, we went to him and we asked him if we could stay with him in a small room.</span> <span id="s1599">Uh.</span> <span id="s1600">Maybe until the war was over.</span> <span id="s1601">That was in ’42, October ’42.</span> <span id="s1602">We married the 4th of October in 1936, and the 4th of October, I had my Herbert back again.</span> <span id="s1603">Can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: That’s quite a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: That was the 4th of October.</span> <span id="s1606">So, yah, I have to tell you a little story from this train.</span> <span id="s1607">We went from Perpignan to Lyon.</span> <span id="s1608">We were sitting very .</span> <span id="s1609">.</span> <span id="s1610">uh.</span> <span id="s1611">.</span> <span id="s1612">I have to say that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Timid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Timid.</span> <span id="s1615">Very timid.</span> <span id="s1616">We were sitting in the corner of the train and on the other side, on the window side, were a mother with her daughter, and next to Herbert was a good-looking young man.</span> <span id="s1617">And this was the daughter and this young man, they were flirting.</span> <span id="s1618">And it was such a…you see, I never forgot that, it was such a lovable thing to see, the innocence.</span> <span id="s1619">There, we were sitting there fighting for our lives,…</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: A bit of normalcy in the midst of all of this __________</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Of all…yah, yah…</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: This was in 1942.</span> <span id="s1623">The war didn’t end until 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Yah, but there is a lot of stories.</span> <span id="s1625">.</span> <span id="s1626">Should we stop it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Mrs. Friedman, will you go on and tell us the rest of what happened to yourself and your husband after you two got back together again.</span> <span id="s1628">You described how he and the rabbi had left the camp, ostensibly to get some food, and made their escape that way.</span> <span id="s1629">So, you go on now, and tell your story, whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Again.</span> <span id="s1631">.</span> <span id="s1632">I told you already about it, that I..</span> <span id="s1633">my husband came out of this train.</span> <span id="s1634">Who went to this train was destined for going to uh.</span> <span id="s1635">.</span> <span id="s1636">now what is the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Drancy.</span> <span id="s1638">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Drancy.</span> <span id="s1640">.</span> <span id="s1641">and from there, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1642">I guess I told you, so that’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Go ahead, that’s O.K. with me.</span> <span id="s1644">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Ya, to repeat myself.</span> <span id="s1646">So, the Rabbi Fuchs told me that, after three days, my husband had to.</span> <span id="s1647">.</span> <span id="s1648">was on the list to go to this camp and to go into the train, and, naturally, I was very devastated, and, uh, he told me….</span> <span id="s1649">um.</span> <span id="s1650">.</span> <span id="s1651">the day the train should leave.</span> <span id="s1652">.</span> <span id="s1653">in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1654">He told me in the morning, “Come in the afternoon, when the train has left so I can give you the last words of your husband.”</span> <span id="s1655">And, uh.</span> <span id="s1656">.</span> <span id="s1657">, I left and, there was this little room where I could live without any cards.</span> <span id="s1658">.</span> <span id="s1659">identification cards and, uh, I was praying, as I never could and never will in my whole life.</span> <span id="s1660">What I was praying, I do not know, but I begged God to give me my husband back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">So, I guess the last time I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s1662">.</span> <span id="s1663">this.</span> <span id="s1664">.</span> <span id="s1665">I told you about this Mr. and Mrs. Weil who were so good to me.</span> <span id="s1666">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: The people whose names you got from the phone book.</span> <span id="s1668">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: From the phone book, yes.</span> <span id="s1670">This Mrs. Weil said to me, uh.</span> <span id="s1671">.</span> <span id="s1672">“Before you go to the.</span> <span id="s1673">.</span> <span id="s1674">uh.</span> <span id="s1675">.</span> <span id="s1676">to Rabbi Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1677">.</span> <span id="s1678">before you go to Rabbi Fuchs, come to me and have a cup of coffee with me.”</span> <span id="s1679">So, I went to her before I went to Rabbi Fuchs, and, uh, we talked.</span> <span id="s1680">Naturally, we talked about my husband.</span> <span id="s1681">I told her about our marriage.</span> <span id="s1682">We were still young, because we married in ’36 and this was in ’42.</span> <span id="s1683">.</span> <span id="s1684">so it was only six years.</span> <span id="s1685">And, when I left, she said, (I’ll say it in French now) “Embrace-moi.</span> <span id="s1686">Je vous acouche voleur.”</span> <span id="s1687">That means, “Take me in your arms.</span> <span id="s1688">I’ll bring you luck.”</span> <span id="s1689">And, she really did.</span> <span id="s1690">She brought me luck.</span> <span id="s1691">So, I went to the.</span> <span id="s1692">.</span> <span id="s1693">uh.</span> <span id="s1694">.</span> <span id="s1695">to the Rabbi Fuchs and to Mrs. Blass, and when I came into the…I opened the door…the Rabbi Fuchs winked at me and I said, “Where is my husband?”</span> <span id="s1696">And he said, “He is here.”</span> <span id="s1697">I say “Where?”</span> <span id="s1698">“He is here.”</span> <span id="s1699">And he took me by my hand and he brought me into his hotel, in his room, and there was my husband.</span> <span id="s1700">He was all eaten up from …from.</span> <span id="s1701">.</span> <span id="s1702">bedbugs, which was not very important and he was hungry.</span> <span id="s1703">He was so hungry.</span> <span id="s1704">And, he got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1705">In a way, it was…this moment…it was very unimportant to be hungry, because we were together.</span> <span id="s1706">We had each other back.</span> <span id="s1707">And, it was the first of October…the same day we married, six years ago.</span> <span id="s1708">So, then, the next day…he slept with me in this one bed.</span> <span id="s1709">I only had one bed.</span> <span id="s1710">It was a small…very small room…and he nothing…because everything went, naturally, with this train to Drancy, and, so, I had a pajama.</span> <span id="s1711">So, I don’t remember any more if he was wearing the upper part, and I, the lower part, or he, the lower part, and I, the upper part.</span> <span id="s1712">But, at least, we were together.</span> <span id="s1713">And, the next morning, we went back to Rabbi Fuchs, and to Mrs. Blass, and they gave us uh.</span> <span id="s1714">.</span> <span id="s1715">false.</span> <span id="s1716">.</span> <span id="s1717">you say “false card identities?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: False identification cards.</span> <span id="s1720">I don’t know what my name was.</span> <span id="s1721">.</span> <span id="s1722">Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s1723">.</span> <span id="s1724">no, Isabel…my name was Isabel during the war time, and Isabel Gebart.</span> <span id="s1725">.</span> <span id="s1726">once I was Isabel Girard.</span> <span id="s1727">.</span> <span id="s1728">and I had so many names…we had both so many different names because we changed constantly our domicile…you say, “domicile?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Residence.</span> <span id="s1731">So, they gave us money and we bought tickets for the train to Lyon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: You were in Perpignon at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: In Perpignon at this time.</span> <span id="s1734">And, so, we took the train.</span> <span id="s1735">But, if I tell you now, we took the train, it is not like you take the train here at Grand Central station, or somewhere else in America.</span> <span id="s1736">.</span> <span id="s1737">you take the train, and you have your heart beat in your throat, because, any time, somebody could come and ask your.</span> <span id="s1738">.</span> <span id="s1739">to show your identification card, and then, you are so nervous that everybody knows and feels right away something is wrong.</span> <span id="s1740">Right?</span> <span id="s1741">So, but we went into the train.</span> <span id="s1742">Nobody asked us, and, I told this story with mother and daughter and this gentleman in the same compartment, which was really so innocent and so very nice.</span> <span id="s1743">And, there, Herbert was sitting across of me and we looked at each other with such heavy hearts and with so much pain to see these young people, who had a whole life of them.</span> <span id="s1744">.</span> <span id="s1745">and for us, any minute it could be finished, you know.</span> <span id="s1746">That somebody, the control came into the train.</span> <span id="s1747">It could be French control, or German control.</span> <span id="s1748">Some control could come and take us out of the train.</span> <span id="s1749">But nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1750">Thank God.</span> <span id="s1751">I told you last time that God was always with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Where was this train headed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: For Lyon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: That’s right, you said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: For Lyon.</span> <span id="s1756">So….</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Lyon was where you had tried to cross the border before.</span> <span id="s1758">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: There is no border.</span> <span id="s1760">There is no border.</span> <span id="s1761">Perpignon and Lyon is France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1763">But, wasn’t it from Lyon that you had tried to cross into Switzerland??</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Oh, that was…that was uh.</span> <span id="s1765">.</span> <span id="s1766">much before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: But in the same place??</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1771">How can…</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Why were you going to Lyon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Because, we lived in Lyon before.</span> <span id="s1774">That is a good question.</span> <span id="s1775">And my husband make friends with one elderly gentleman.</span> <span id="s1776">He must have been in the seventies, and he lived there with his.</span> <span id="s1777">.</span> <span id="s1778">what you call.</span> <span id="s1779">.</span> <span id="s1780">the lady who takes care of the house…</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Housekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1783">Elderly housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1784">And, he was an engineer, and, as Herbert was before the war, he was in the steel line, so, they had a lot to talk about, and, uh, Herbert was a highly intelligent man, so they had really some conversations.</span> <span id="s1785">.</span> <span id="s1786">so we did not know….</span> <span id="s1787">You asked me where we want to go.</span> <span id="s1788">We had only one place to go, that was Lyon, Chappaneau and we wanted to ask him to stay in his house which was like a little chateau.</span> <span id="s1789">Uh.</span> <span id="s1790">.</span> <span id="s1791">It was an ….</span> <span id="s1792">how you call those big houses?</span> <span id="s1793">Uh…a mansion.</span> <span id="s1794">Uh.</span> <span id="s1795">It was a mansion, but village style.</span> <span id="s1796">You know, there was a big garden, and with chickens…and little…</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: It sounds like a place where you can hopefully escape being noticed.</span> <span id="s1798">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: That’s right.”</span> <span id="s1800">So, that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Ilse, was there, in France, like there was Vichy, France, and then, there was another…there were like two parts, and one was more controlled by the Germans…</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: That was when I talked to you about the demarcation lingen…that was the north of France which was more controlled by the Germans, and then, the south of France, which was, at this time, the south of France was at this time controlled by the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: In the south of France.</span> <span id="s1804">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yah, there was still.</span> <span id="s1806">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Lyon was in the south of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: It was in the south of France.</span> <span id="s1809">It was behind the demarcation lingen.</span> <span id="s1810">And, so we went to Lyon, and then we went to Chappaneau.</span> <span id="s1811">This place I told you before, and we asked, and Herbert asked this friend if it would be possible to stay him and, but nobody should know about it.</span> <span id="s1812">The mayor of this village was for the Jews and for the Jewish people and for.</span> <span id="s1813">.</span> <span id="s1814">uh.</span> <span id="s1815">.</span> <span id="s1816">yah he knew that we were Jewish people from Germany.</span> <span id="s1817">And, he gave us…So, the engineer said, “Sure, you can stay with us.</span> <span id="s1818">The whole house belongs to you.”</span> <span id="s1819">But I didn’t want to have that.</span> <span id="s1820">We slept in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1821">We had a bunker where the two people who worked for him were sleeping, but there was nobody anymore because he was an old man and he let everything go very slowly.</span> <span id="s1822">He had a big vineyard, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Uh, huh</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And we slept there.</span> <span id="s1825">It was very primitive.</span> <span id="s1826">Very primitive…no water.</span> <span id="s1827">I had to carry the water from the brunnen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: From the well.</span> <span id="s1830">That was in October, and, his house…what did you say, what she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Housekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1833">The housekeeper, she.</span> <span id="s1834">.</span> <span id="s1835">you could have killed her.</span> <span id="s1836">She would not have told nobody about us.</span> <span id="s1837">.</span> <span id="s1838">That was fine till December.</span> <span id="s1839">December, there came an invasion from German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1840">They had to live in this chateau and with horses and so on…So we were full of fear.</span> <span id="s1841">If they would find out that there lived there and there were German Jews they wouldn’t have made a long story with us.</span> <span id="s1842">So, .</span> <span id="s1843">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: You stayed there despite the fact that they occupied the chateau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: We stayed there.</span> <span id="s1846">We didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1847">We just spoke French and they never found out.</span> <span id="s1848">They stayed about 8 or 10 days.</span> <span id="s1849">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: You didn’t stay in hiding.</span> <span id="s1851">You just spoke French so they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s1853">And, then we worked, naturally we worked for him…for this engineer.</span> <span id="s1854">My husband worked for him in the garden, and I helped the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1855">I scrubbed the floor.</span> <span id="s1856">I washed the linen, and so on and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1857">What you have to do, like a maid.</span> <span id="s1858">But, in a way, I was with Herbert and besides the fear we had that somebody could find out, we were happy.</span> <span id="s1859">You know, we were happy.</span> <span id="s1860">We didn’t had…We were not hungry, because this engineer, he got a lot.</span> <span id="s1861">.</span> <span id="s1862">people brought him something from the farm.</span> <span id="s1863">And, this housekeeper, she was so nice always something came to us, a little piece of butter or another piece of bread or something like that.</span> <span id="s1864">So, that was quite a good time and then, in 1943, the 20th of February, there was, I don’t know how you call that in English, somebody who takes care of the village, who goes around and tells people what is going on and so on.</span> <span id="s1865">Maybe that does not exist here…in</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Like the town crier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s1868">Like a town crier.</span> <span id="s1869">And, if he did it by himself, or if the Gestapo came to him, we never found out, but he got some money for.</span> <span id="s1870">.</span> <span id="s1871">to tell the people where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: So, one morning, the 20th of February, this housekeeper, she came to us.</span> <span id="s1874">We were still in bed.</span> <span id="s1875">.</span> <span id="s1876">it was early, maybe 7 o’clock, or 6:30.</span> <span id="s1877">The housekeeper came and said, “Madame, you have to…there are two policemen, French policemen.</span> <span id="s1878">.</span> <span id="s1879">you have to come and show your cards.</span> <span id="s1880">.</span> <span id="s1881">the identification cards…” And I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s1882">So, I said, “Herbert, you stay.”</span> <span id="s1883">I was young, and I was very pretty at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: You still are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1886">I was young.</span> <span id="s1887">And, you know, a young woman, if she looks good, she has an influence on gentlemen.</span> <span id="s1888">So, I came with my card.</span> <span id="s1889">One of the policemen said, “Your cards are not in order.</span> <span id="s1890">You have to come with me to the gendarmerie, to the office and to have it checked.”</span> <span id="s1891">I said, “Listen, that is not possible.</span> <span id="s1892">They are good and they are fine, and there is nothing wrong.”</span> <span id="s1893">And, so I talked them out of it.</span> <span id="s1894">They left.</span> <span id="s1895">And I came…went to…should I go into details?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s1897">As much as you need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1899">I went to Herbert and I said, “Listen, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s1900">We have to leave.</span> <span id="s1901">By the way, we always had a small suitcase.</span> <span id="s1902">We called this the Polish suitcase.</span> <span id="s1903">It was a suitcase with pajamas and things you need for the first night or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: So you can make a quick getaway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Quick getaway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Why did you call it the Polish suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Because we always thought we have to go to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: We did no know where all the concentration camps were, but we knew we come to Poland.</span> <span id="s1910">That is what was said.</span> <span id="s1911">You know, there is, in such a situation, there is a lot of talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: That would have been the worse place to go in the world, wouldn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1914">So, I said to Herbert, “You know, you can work in the field.</span> <span id="s1915">Nobody sees you there.</span> <span id="s1916">And I go to a friend.</span> <span id="s1917">These were Jewish people, too.</span> <span id="s1918">Under another name.</span> <span id="s1919">And I tell them that they have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1920">If I talk this language and my vocabulary is very limited, it’s first of all, I don’t know how to say all those things in which way.</span> <span id="s1921">In French, in English, and then I am very nervous, and I have sometimes a blackout…</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: I’m sorry that you are nervous.</span> <span id="s1923">But, you are really doing very well.</span> <span id="s1924">I am having no difficulty understanding it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: So, I..</span> <span id="s1926">it was around ten or eleven o’clock and I went to this friend.</span> <span id="s1927">Naturally there is no car.</span> <span id="s1928">There is no.</span> <span id="s1929">.</span> <span id="s1930">yah there are bicycles, but I didn’t had a bicycle, so I had to walk about half an hour to them, to this other farm.</span> <span id="s1931">They had a farm.</span> <span id="s1932">I warned them.</span> <span id="s1933">And, he said, “Nothing will happen to us.</span> <span id="s1934">I work in the French legion and they will not do anything to me.”</span> <span id="s1935">He came from Frankfort, and she, too.</span> <span id="s1936">Nebish… He was weak.</span> <span id="s1937">I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s1938">He was taken.</span> <span id="s1939">She lives.</span> <span id="s1940">She is in New York.</span> <span id="s1941">And he was taken.</span> <span id="s1942">Even so, he was in the French legion.</span> <span id="s1943">They didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1944">Wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1945">So, when I came back, Herbert said…Herbert was……no, he was not there.</span> <span id="s1946">And the housekeeper came to me and said, “Something terrible happened.”</span> <span id="s1947">(Sound of hands clapping) I say, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s1948">“They were here again to take you both, and they were behind Herbert, and Herbert was springing over hedges and into the woods and I don’t know…” He told me that later, that they didn’t catch him.</span> <span id="s1949">They were very gay to catch him because of this village crier, or whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Town crier</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Town crier.</span> <span id="s1952">So that was…I said Herbert, “You know what we do.</span> <span id="s1953">I make us something to eat now, coffee, and we are going to leave here.</span> <span id="s1954">We cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1955">Oh, the main thing I forgot, oh, I have to go back…I have to go back to October.</span> <span id="s1956">I went from Chappaneau one afternoon.</span> <span id="s1957">I went to Lyon and I said before that we met this Monsieur Conier, who was in the French underground, and my husband was so afraid of him.</span> <span id="s1958">I told you about him.</span> <span id="s1959">And, he was so afraid of him.</span> <span id="s1960">I went to Lyon for some reason, and on the way back, I just catched the last tramway.</span> <span id="s1961">And, I just catched the last seat in the tramway, and who was sitting next to me?</span> <span id="s1962">Monsieur Conier.</span> <span id="s1963">And he was very happy to see me and he said, “How is everything?”</span> <span id="s1964">I said, “It is very dangerous.”</span> <span id="s1965">He said, “Please, please, if ever something happens to you, I have a farm.</span> <span id="s1966">I can hide you.</span> <span id="s1967">Between Lyon and Grenoble.</span> <span id="s1968">Please have confidence and don’t be afraid, and we have to find a way if you are in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Did you say your husband was afraid of this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Yah, I told you that before.</span> <span id="s1971">He always said, “Monsieur Conier.”</span> <span id="s1972">He looked.</span> <span id="s1973">.</span> <span id="s1974">he went very straight.</span> <span id="s1975">He was an officer of the French army.</span> <span id="s1976">And he went always very straight.</span> <span id="s1977">And Herbert said, “Ille, Ille, he is a spy.</span> <span id="s1978">His name was Koerner.”</span> <span id="s1979">Koerner is a German name.</span> <span id="s1980">I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Yes, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: You remember now.</span> <span id="s1983">So, I told him where we lived.</span> <span id="s1984">Even so, Herbert said to tell nothing at all.</span> <span id="s1985">And, so, I make with him an appointment to come to our home.</span> <span id="s1986">And, when I came back, I told my Herbert about this…that I met Mr. Conier, Monsieur Conier, and he was furious.</span> <span id="s1987">I said, “Herbert, please believe me, he is such a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s1988">I am sure he works instead for Germany, he works in the underground.”</span> <span id="s1989">That he worked in the underground, we later knew that.</span> <span id="s1990">So, he came to us and he, where we lived very…I told you very primitive, and he stayed a while, and in the conversation he said, “It is such a dangerous life for you.</span> <span id="s1991">It’s getting worse.</span> <span id="s1992">If ever something happens to you, let this woman write a telegram, “Aunt in danger.</span> <span id="s1993">Come right away.”</span> <span id="s1994">And that tells me that you are in danger, and I have to do something for you.”</span> <span id="s1995">That is what I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s1996">So, now that was the situation.</span> <span id="s1997">So, Herbert said we have to go.</span> <span id="s1998">We have to leave.</span> <span id="s1999">I just had the coffee on the table.</span> <span id="s2000">The outside bell was ringing.</span> <span id="s2001">We looked through a little window, and there were not two from the gendarmerie, there was three or even five.</span> <span id="s2002">That is…I don’t… They came with a big truck to catch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">When we moved in this little chateau.</span> <span id="s2004">Herbert…You said before when I talked to you last week…he was very far-sighted.</span> <span id="s2005">He went all the way up into the little tower they had.</span> <span id="s2006">You know like the chateaux have towers.</span> <span id="s2007">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: And he went up into this tower, and there was a little window high up.</span> <span id="s2010">And he said, “Ille, if ever something happens, we go here in this little room and maybe we can go on the roof from there.”</span> <span id="s2011">And so, we …when we saw that they were standing in front of the door to catch us, he said, “Let’s go on the roof.</span> <span id="s2012">Let’s go in this little tower.</span> <span id="s2013">Let’s go in this little tower.”</span> <span id="s2014">And this housekeeper, she was running behind us.</span> <span id="s2015">“What will happen to you, what will happen to you (hands clapping).</span> <span id="s2016">We say, “Don’t tell nobody what we are doing.</span> <span id="s2017">Don’t tell nobody.”</span> <span id="s2018">So, they came in.</span> <span id="s2019">We were not there.</span> <span id="s2020">They saw the hot coffee on the table.</span> <span id="s2021">They said, “They must be in the house.”</span> <span id="s2022">In the meantime, we went into this very small room.</span> <span id="s2023">It was not bigger than oh, how can I say, half of this room here.</span> <span id="s2024">And this window, the wall was straight like this straight wall, and this window was not open.</span> <span id="s2025">Somebody had to go in.</span> <span id="s2026">So, Herbert was standing so on my, with his foot on my hand, and then he went on my shoulder, and there was a little hook, and he opened the window.</span> <span id="s2027">And he went outside on the roof, the 20th of February.</span> <span id="s2028">And I was standing there.</span> <span id="s2029">He leaned out.</span> <span id="s2030">He gave me his hand, and I was going up straight the wall, into the window.</span> <span id="s2031">Sweethear, how I did it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2032">How I could carry my husband, who was about 160 lbs.</span> <span id="s2033">at this time, and how I could go up the straight wall…</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Fear gives you strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: .</span> <span id="s2036">.</span> <span id="s2037">gives you strength.</span> <span id="s2038">So, there we were on the roof, sitting there.</span> <span id="s2039">I was shaking so much, that the tiles were making noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: The tiles on the roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: .</span> <span id="s2042">.</span> <span id="s2043">on the roof were making noise.</span> <span id="s2044">So we could overlook the whole village.</span> <span id="s2045">.</span> <span id="s2046">part of the village.</span> <span id="s2047">And what I tell you now I tell you because it is very important.</span> <span id="s2048">This, .</span> <span id="s2049">.</span> <span id="s2050">this was a faint village.</span> <span id="s2051">It was a very small…it was not a paved street…it was like…</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: An alley?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: No, not an alley.</span> <span id="s2054">Like, uh, uh, ….</span> <span id="s2055">not…earth, it was earth, you know,…</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: An unpaved road.</span> <span id="s2057">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: .</span> <span id="s2059">.</span> <span id="s2060">unpaved road, like in a village, and to turn a car, you had to go farther out, where there was a round, like a curve, to make a turn to go back into the village.</span> <span id="s2061">The chateau was a little bit outside of the village.</span> <span id="s2062">So, they even came into this little room.</span> <span id="s2063">The window, we could close from the outside, and we heard, when one of them, I don’t know who it was, said, “They must be here.</span> <span id="s2064">If I find them, I have no pity, I kill them right away.”</span> <span id="s2065">That’s what we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: That’s very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s2068">They left.</span> <span id="s2069">And they asked this housekeeper.</span> <span id="s2070">She said she did not see us.</span> <span id="s2071">She did not see us.</span> <span id="s2072">She does not know where we are.</span> <span id="s2073">That we must have left.</span> <span id="s2074">So, they left in this car…not car.</span> <span id="s2075">.</span> <span id="s2076">in this…</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Van?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: .</span> <span id="s2079">.</span> <span id="s2080">van.</span> <span id="s2081">They made the turn.</span> <span id="s2082">They didn’t see us.</span> <span id="s2083">They didn’t see us.</span> <span id="s2084">That is why I told you before--that God made them blind, or he made them think we were not there.</span> <span id="s2085">(crying).</span> <span id="s2086">I don’t know what happened because we went in ’57 or ’58 we went there, Herbert and I.</span> <span id="s2087">We walked there.</span> <span id="s2088">We looked at the roof.</span> <span id="s2089">It was impossible not to see us.</span> <span id="s2090">The doctor from the village came with his bicycle to visit a sick person.</span> <span id="s2091">He saw us, he saw us on the roof, but, they didn’t see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: You really were being watched over.</span> <span id="s2093">Were the housekeeper and the engineer in danger because you had been living with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2095">We did not live in the house.</span> <span id="s2096">That is what we didn’t do.</span> <span id="s2097">We lived next…we lived in the bunkers, you know.</span> <span id="s2098">And the engineer, he was an old man.</span> <span id="s2099">He was at this time feeble, with 70 years, living in a village, are old people, and he was a little bit senile, too, so he didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: How long were you up on the roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Well, may be a half an hour, or three quarters of an hour.</span> <span id="s2102">So, we went down.</span> <span id="s2103">She came already up the stairs and said, “What shall I do, what shall we do?”</span> <span id="s2104">I said, “You write a telegram to Monsieur Corier, and write him, “Aunt very sick, come right away.”</span> <span id="s2105">So then, we went, with our little suitcase and Herbert with knapsack, out of Chappanon.</span> <span id="s2106">We walked into the next village where we knew somebody who could let us stay overnight.</span> <span id="s2107">Now, I don’t remember any more was this address through the housekeeper or through somebody else.</span> <span id="s2108">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2109">It’s so long ago.</span> <span id="s2110">But, it was.</span> <span id="s2111">.</span> <span id="s2112">we had somebody there.</span> <span id="s2113">.</span> <span id="s2114">I feel a little nauseous.</span> <span id="s2115">.</span> <span id="s2116">My husband should give….</span> <span id="s2117">The good thing was that we were together, Herbert and I, so we could help each other mentally.</span> <span id="s2118">Physically, we were very strong, but mentally, sometimes, we were very upset.</span> <span id="s2119">either he or me.</span> <span id="s2120">Uh…We walked out of Chappaneau, and, not to be seen, we went, uh.</span> <span id="s2121">.</span> <span id="s2122">through.</span> <span id="s2123">.</span> <span id="s2124">uh a mine, where they were cutting stones, and it was very high, and I fell,…the hole…it was like a little mountain.</span> <span id="s2125">I fell down and I hit myself very much.</span> <span id="s2126">To this day, I have trouble with my back on account of that.</span> <span id="s2127">But that is so.</span> <span id="s2128">.</span> <span id="s2129">we got very scared, but we managed, and we walked about two hours to the next village, and there was this house.</span> <span id="s2130">This shed where we should stay until Mr. Conier would come to pick us up and…further, when he would come, we did not know but we knew he would come to pick us up.</span> <span id="s2131">We had a bedroom.</span> <span id="s2132">I have to tell you this detail.</span> <span id="s2133">I don’t know if you remember things like, if there is no toilet, there was a thing where you uh…turn it off please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">So, the next night, I said to my husband “I will not stay here, in this bed, anymore.</span> <span id="s2135">I sleep in the.</span> <span id="s2136">.</span> <span id="s2137">in the…can you imagine, I can’t find the name of the…rabbit.</span> <span id="s2138">We will sleep with the rabbits.</span> <span id="s2139">There was straw, and we could sleep there, and, if we had to go, we could go outside.</span> <span id="s2140">Right?</span> <span id="s2141">But we still had nothing to eat, and this peasant, who lives there, or maybe he sold his rabbits, but he was very poor.</span> <span id="s2142">He asked a lot of money compared.</span> <span id="s2143">.</span> <span id="s2144">a lot of money for this night we were there.</span> <span id="s2145">The morning, he gave me three potatoes, three small potatoes, and a small head of cabbage and he said, “With this you’ll make a soup.”</span> <span id="s2146">Oh, yah, and then he brought me bones--veal or beef bones with a little bit of meat on it.</span> <span id="s2147">.</span> <span id="s2148">Unbelieveable what little you had.</span> <span id="s2149">So, I had three potatoes and a head of cabbage and I said, “Oh, I can make a nice soup for each dish with that bones, it would be very nice.</span> <span id="s2150">So, I put the soup on the stove.</span> <span id="s2151">It was a wooden stove.</span> <span id="s2152">We had no coals.</span> <span id="s2153">And, I went out doing something, I don’t know… And, I came back, and the pot, who was so big was filled up with water.</span> <span id="s2154">So, I said to him, “Listen, Mister, what did you do?”</span> <span id="s2155">He said, “We are tonight six people.</span> <span id="s2156">We have to have…everyone has to have…</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Three potatoes and a head of cabbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: It was more water than potatoes and cabbage.</span> <span id="s2159">They had the bones.</span> <span id="s2160">We didn’t had the bones.</span> <span id="s2161">They ate the bones off and we had, naturally, it was not enough for him, for Herbert, it was not enough for me.</span> <span id="s2162">It was very little to eat.</span> <span id="s2163">I was very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s2164">Very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s2165">The next day Monsieur Conier came.</span> <span id="s2166">I don’t know how many kilometers.</span> <span id="s2167">It was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s2168">He made.</span> <span id="s2169">.</span> <span id="s2170">he walked.</span> <span id="s2171">How many kilometers he walked to see us.</span> <span id="s2172">He came in and said.</span> <span id="s2173">“Tomorrow, I meet you in Lyon.”</span> <span id="s2174">I said “How can you meet us.</span> <span id="s2175">How can we come from here to Lyon?”</span> <span id="s2176">“You take a bus.”</span> <span id="s2177">“Yah, how can we take a bus?</span> <span id="s2178">Every minute, somebody can halt the bus and ask us for identification cards.</span> <span id="s2179">They are not valuable any more.”</span> <span id="s2180">And he says, “Will you stay here and be catched?</span> <span id="s2181">So, here you have the opportunity…he was very rough, you know, which was very good for us, because, at this time, we were very much in the dumps.</span> <span id="s2182">“So, you take the bus to Lyon and in Lyon there is such and such church.</span> <span id="s2183">You go in the church.</span> <span id="s2184">You pray, and I will meet you there.”</span> <span id="s2185">So, we went with the bus, and everything went fine.</span> <span id="s2186">We met him in the church.</span> <span id="s2187">He had already tickets to go from Lyon to, I guess the name was Verdier, but I don’t.</span> <span id="s2188">.</span> <span id="s2189">it could be any other name, too.</span> <span id="s2190">I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s2191">Where we had somewhere in the woods, where he had two or three cows and little animals, which were taken care of from another young man from the underground, who did not go to…it’s O.K.?</span> <span id="s2192">...</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Yes, I’m just checking.</span> <span id="s2194">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: …who did not go to Germany to work for the Germans…the French.</span> <span id="s2196">So, he went with us and from the train station, we had to walk another two hours.</span> <span id="s2197">We were constantly walking, in terrible hunger.</span> <span id="s2198">We didn’t had really, really, really for two or three days, almost nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2199">So, we came to his shed, and he showed us where we could sleep.</span> <span id="s2200">It was one bed.</span> <span id="s2201">No water.</span> <span id="s2202">And, it was straw.</span> <span id="s2203">No water to wash.</span> <span id="s2204">And nothing at all.</span> <span id="s2205">It was a kitchen with one stove, and it was three chairs…I don’t remember…it was…but we were, as he told us, “Here you are hidden.</span> <span id="s2206">Nothing can happen to us.</span> <span id="s2207">Or to you.</span> <span id="s2208">We stayed with him--that was the end of February.</span> <span id="s2209">We stayed with him until the middle of March…</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Of ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: …of ’43.</span> <span id="s2212">In the meantime, this Monsieur Conier got contact with a priest, a Catholic priest, Pierre Challiet.</span> <span id="s2213">This Per Challiet, not only that he gave us false card identity--he saved, I don’t know how many Jewish children in France.</span> <span id="s2214">He brought them over to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2215">His work was underground.</span> <span id="s2216">It was terrific.</span> <span id="s2217">Absolute terrific.</span> <span id="s2218">So, Monsieur Conier got with Pierrre Challiet in contact, and he got other French cards, identification cards, and he came to his.</span> <span id="s2219">.</span> <span id="s2220">Monsieur Conier came to his farmhouse, whatever you call that.</span> <span id="s2221">.</span> <span id="s2222">and he brought us his false card identity and he said, “You can’t.</span> <span id="s2223">.</span> <span id="s2224">After two weeks you can’t stay here any more.”</span> <span id="s2225">By the way, there was no water, but there was a brook, and, in March, the brook was ice cold, and we.</span> <span id="s2226">.</span> <span id="s2227">I find my way to wash myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Please turn off that…I have to tell you….</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Even so, everything was so primitive, and I had no water, but I could wash myself.</span> <span id="s2230">The legs, I would let hang in the brook and I brought the water in and had it warmed up a little bit and I could wash myself.</span> <span id="s2231">That was very, very important, to keep the body clean.</span> <span id="s2232">If the body is clean, the whole person is clean, you know, the mind, everything is clean.</span> <span id="s2233">So, yah, he came with this identification card, and he said, “You can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s2234">The German feld gendarmerie, (that means.</span> <span id="s2235">.</span> <span id="s2236">feld gendarmerie means field gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s2237">.</span> <span id="s2238">field control of the…how can I say it?</span> <span id="s2239">... around the neighborhood) it’s looking around here and it is too dangerous for you, it is too dangerous for my boy here.</span> <span id="s2240">We have to close up and we have to leave.”</span> <span id="s2241">“But”, he says, “I have this contact with Pierre Challiet.</span> <span id="s2242">I went for you to Grenoble, where… which…Grenoble is occupied by the…excuse me…by the Italian.</span> <span id="s2243">.</span> <span id="s2244">uh.</span> <span id="s2245">.</span> <span id="s2246">Italians, and nothing there…they don’t deported the Jew to any camps.</span> <span id="s2247">You are safe there.</span> <span id="s2248">And, I went to the .</span> <span id="s2249">.</span> <span id="s2250">uh.</span> <span id="s2251">.</span> <span id="s2252">Mayor of Grenoble, which is a very big city, so he has an entrée all over with his background of being officer and being working for the French people.”</span> <span id="s2253">And, so we packed again, and he went with us.</span> <span id="s2254">He, Mr. Conier, went with us to Grenoble in the train.</span> <span id="s2255">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2256">Sometimes the train has to stop,.</span> <span id="s2257">.</span> <span id="s2258">you know.</span> <span id="s2259">.</span> <span id="s2260">as…it happened, if you take the train and the train stops for any reason, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2261">It doesn’t bother you.</span> <span id="s2262">But, when…if the train stops there, in the middle of the road, you got scared…</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: .</span> <span id="s2265">.</span> <span id="s2266">you know something will happen.</span> <span id="s2267">And still, now, if this happened, the first thought is, “Ah, it’s like in France.</span> <span id="s2268">.”</span> <span id="s2269">You know, you never get rid of that.</span> <span id="s2270">.</span> <span id="s2271">never…ever.</span> <span id="s2272">So, we came to Grenoble, and we stayed in a small hotel with a lot of bedbugs.</span> <span id="s2273">They did not go to me, but they went all to Herbert.</span> <span id="s2274">And, we had an audience with the Mayor of Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2275">German German, German Jews and refugees.</span> <span id="s2276">And, the Mayor was like a brother to us.</span> <span id="s2277">It really was wonderful, marvelous.</span> <span id="s2278">So, he says, “I give your two weeks.</span> <span id="s2279">You cannot stay in Grenoble because you have to go around Grenoble in uh…maybe thirty kilometers around Grenoble, you have to look.</span> <span id="s2280">.</span> <span id="s2281">for a way to stay.”</span> <span id="s2282">And, so, every day, we went to another village.</span> <span id="s2283">Did you ever hear of Oradur-sur-glon…</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: .</span> <span id="s2286">.</span> <span id="s2287">in France.</span> <span id="s2288">.</span> <span id="s2289">During the last month or two, before the war was over, that was in ’44, some officer or some soldier was killed there… German soldier was killed there.</span> <span id="s2290">The whole village was burnt down, Oradur-sur-glon…the whole village was burnt down… and there was not one person who came out of this village alive.</span> <span id="s2291">We were there, not to the town, but we were looking there for a stay…for apartment.</span> <span id="s2292">.</span> <span id="s2293">apartment…a room and kitchen to stay.</span> <span id="s2294">.</span> <span id="s2295">and we found something which we liked.</span> <span id="s2296">It was a little hidden and nobody in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2297">So, we begged this woman to give us this room.</span> <span id="s2298">She says, “I cannot, it’s promised, and I cannot give it to you.”</span> <span id="s2299">Again, a sign from God that we couldn’t get this.</span> <span id="s2300">So, finally, I will make this long story short--because we were looking every day and every day somewhere--we came to a place, St. Pierre de Chartreuse.</span> <span id="s2301">That is the place where they make this beautiful liqueur--the green chartreuse and the yellow chartreuse.</span> <span id="s2302">And, in this village, St. Pierre de Chartreuse, we went to a hotel and we asked the owner if there is an apartment where we could live.</span> <span id="s2303">He says, “I have here, across the street, it’s very primitive there, if people come and bring their car or their horses, there stay the kutchak, what is a kutchak?</span> <span id="s2304">the chauffeur?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Chauffeur.</span> <span id="s2306">The person who drove the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Chauffeur.</span> <span id="s2308">The person who drove the car, he stays over there.</span> <span id="s2309">So, we looked at it.</span> <span id="s2310">It was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2311">For us, it was luxury, and we asked him if we could have it, and he gave it to us.</span> <span id="s2312">We got this in April and we lived there.</span> <span id="s2313">.</span> <span id="s2314">for.</span> <span id="s2315">.</span> <span id="s2316">as Belgian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Belgian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: Belgian people.</span> <span id="s2319">We… The Pierre Challiet brought us another card identity.</span> <span id="s2320">And he was searched by the Gestapo in the train because somebody must have found out that he was working for the underground.</span> <span id="s2321">And, while they were searching the train, he hid, under his…how you call this in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: His robe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: Under his robe.</span> <span id="s2324">He let these two cards slip down and he pushed them underneath the seat.</span> <span id="s2325">So, when they came and searched him, he didn’t had our card identities.</span> <span id="s2326">He brought them to us, and I always had them…all this I threw away before we came here.</span> <span id="s2327">And, you could still see the scratches where he pushed it with his foot.</span> <span id="s2328">So, we lived there from April till September quite quiet, and Herbert worked with me.</span> <span id="s2329">Even had something to eat there, because I worked in the farmer’s house.</span> <span id="s2330">I even learned to give injections because my husband needed every day and every day injections for his t.b. (tuberculosis) how you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: Tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2333">Uh….</span> <span id="s2334">so with this, we didn’t want money, so they paid us here a potato, there two or three pieces of bread and once we got a rabbit.</span> <span id="s2335">I wouldn’t eat it now, but I ate it there.</span> <span id="s2336">So, and…Herbert worked in fields.</span> <span id="s2337">He knew how to cut.</span> <span id="s2338">.</span> <span id="s2339">uh.uh.</span> <span id="s2340">.</span> <span id="s2341">to cut the trees.</span> <span id="s2342">.</span> <span id="s2343">uh.</span> <span id="s2344">.</span> <span id="s2345">from his father’s farm, when he was a young boy.</span> <span id="s2346">So, we really had a…it was not a bad time from May to September.</span> <span id="s2347">Uh…We made contact, at this time, the next village.</span> <span id="s2348">St. Pierre Chartreuse was on a…on a..</span> <span id="s2349">in the mountains, and further down, the next village, further down to the valley, was another village, St. Laurent du Pont.</span> <span id="s2350">We made…That was a little bigger village, and we made contact with the mast…post-master, and the gendarmerie, who know exactly what was going on with us.</span> <span id="s2351">And, they knew, were hearing during the night, England.</span> <span id="s2352">You know, the Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Da, Dat,Da, Da….</span> <span id="s2355">And, one day, they came up, the gendarmerie, one Monsieur Perret, and he said, “You have to hide.</span> <span id="s2356">Something is going on.</span> <span id="s2357">.</span> <span id="s2358">We don’t know what, but something is going on.</span> <span id="s2359">You had better go in the woods.”</span> <span id="s2360">so that night.</span> <span id="s2361">.</span> <span id="s2362">it was Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s2363">.</span> <span id="s2364">that night we slept in the woods.</span> <span id="s2365">It was already quite cold, but, who cares?</span> <span id="s2366">Eh…There, the Gestapo and the German soldiers….</span> <span id="s2367">eh… In St. Pierre Chartreuse was one very nice hotel.</span> <span id="s2368">Not that one from where we had the apartment.</span> <span id="s2369">There was another hotel and there the Jews from Grenoble celebrated Rosh Hashanah in this hotel.</span> <span id="s2370">The Gestapo and the German soldiers, they came to this hotel and they arrested all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: I was wondering how they could do that without being conspicuous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: They arrested all the Jews.</span> <span id="s2373">What became of them, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2374">So, Herbert said, “Ille, this is…we cannot stay here any more.”</span> <span id="s2375">And.</span> <span id="s2376">.</span> <span id="s2377">uh.</span> <span id="s2378">.</span> <span id="s2379">so we went to the butcher with whom Herbert worked out.</span> <span id="s2380">.</span> <span id="s2381">worked to…in the fields and that night, we slept, not in the rabbit.</span> <span id="s2382">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Hutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: …hutch, we slept with the horses.”</span> <span id="s2385">(laughter) We were so used to those little fleas, that really, we didn’t feel them any more.</span> <span id="s2386">So, the next night, it was almost…October, we went down to St. Laurent du Pont.</span> <span id="s2387">And Pierre Challiet came again and brought us anther card identity, and we got another apartment there and we stayed there from October, over Christmas, New Year’s ’44, till August.</span> <span id="s2388">It was….</span> <span id="s2389">Herbert did not leave this room for ten months.</span> <span id="s2390">When we rented this small apartment, the kitchen was very small.</span> <span id="s2391">The The bedroom--there was only one bed, and uh.</span> <span id="s2392">.</span> <span id="s2393">armoire (a very big closet), an armoire, not a closet.</span> <span id="s2394">And, wherever we went, we started to clean first.</span> <span id="s2395">To get rid of all the little box which were there.</span> <span id="s2396">So, we, Herbert and I, we took apart the bed.</span> <span id="s2397">We cleaned the bed, and then, Herbert said, “Let’s clean behind the armoire”.</span> <span id="s2398">I said, “Herbert, you are crazy.</span> <span id="s2399">It is so heavy, what can we do?”</span> <span id="s2400">He said, “Let’s clean behind the armoire.”</span> <span id="s2401">We opened…we pushed the armoire aside and, behind the armoire, was a niche…</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: A niche.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: …a niche where one or two persons could stand, and Herbert said, “Ille, whenever something happens, we will go behind this niche.”</span> <span id="s2404">And, he made a hook on this armoire….</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: So you could pull it toward you.</span> <span id="s2406">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: He was very very invent…</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Inventive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: …inventive.</span> <span id="s2410">And I had to lift up the armoire.</span> <span id="s2411">Underneath the armoire, he put little rollers, you know, so that we could close.</span> <span id="s2412">So,…but anyway, he did not leave this….</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: hiding place</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: …hiding place for ten months, and uh.</span> <span id="s2415">.</span> <span id="s2416">I went out, b`ut this ten months were….</span> <span id="s2417">.</span> <span id="s2418">nothing happened to us, but it was very, very difficult to find something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: Everybody, or just because you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: We were in hiding.</span> <span id="s2421">But the other people, they didn’t had a lot to eat either.</span> <span id="s2422">Uh.</span> <span id="s2423">.</span> <span id="s2424">sometimes we had one piece of bread to eat for the whole day.</span> <span id="s2425">And, another time, we had two or three potatoes.</span> <span id="s2426">It depends.</span> <span id="s2427">You know…I went from.</span> <span id="s2428">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Who would bring you…how would?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Nobody brought us anything.</span> <span id="s2431">I just wanted to say.</span> <span id="s2432">We went…I went…he did not go…from one peasant to another.</span> <span id="s2433">For a whole day.</span> <span id="s2434">I left at nine o’clock and I came back at four o’clock.</span> <span id="s2435">Sometimes, I had one piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2436">Sometimes I had three…three potatoes and two eggs.</span> <span id="s2437">While we were in St. Laurent du Pont, we got news that from Gers.</span> <span id="s2438">.</span> <span id="s2439">you know Gers--Gers, it’s a camp--concentration camp, from Gers came about twenty elderly women.</span> <span id="s2440">If there .</span> <span id="s2441">.</span> <span id="s2442">men were.</span> <span id="s2443">.</span> <span id="s2444">no.</span> <span id="s2445">.</span> <span id="s2446">there were no men, just women.</span> <span id="s2447">Eh…maybe seventy, seventy-five, eighty years and they were accepted in the hospital in St. Laurent du Pont.</span> <span id="s2448">How this happened, I don’t know, but it was this way.</span> <span id="s2449">I went up once a week, to this hospital to greet these German Jewish women, who came mostly from the South of Germany, Mannheim, Frankfort,.</span> <span id="s2450">.</span> <span id="s2451">Carls…it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2452">Carolina Dreyfuss--I mention the name.</span> <span id="s2453">If ever somebody hears it, was my darling.</span> <span id="s2454">When I had two eggs, one I gave to my husband.</span> <span id="s2455">The other, I gave to Caroling Dreyfuss.</span> <span id="s2456">But, I did not tell her that I was German.</span> <span id="s2457">I was speaking German, but with mistakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: She thought you were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2460">So, after we were liberated, I went up with my husband to this hospital and I said to Carolina, Carolina Dreyfuss, and to all the other ladies, “ I am a German Jew like you.”</span> <span id="s2461">and Carolina said, “I always knew it.</span> <span id="s2462">I always knew it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Tell me what when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s2464">How did you know the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: I tell you…would you like to know…it was the most beautiful…</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: …that is the most beautiful thing in my life.</span> <span id="s2468">So, the middle of July, one morning, we each…we hear shots all around.</span> <span id="s2469">A company of German Gestapo and German soldiers came to St. Laurent du Pont, because that was the center of the underground.</span> <span id="s2470">I…through the Postmaster, we knew quite a lot what was going on, and, he gave me sometimes the order to…if somebody from the underground was hurt, to bandage him and to give injection, so, if they would have found us, really they would have made chop meat out of us.</span> <span id="s2471">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2472">So, it was.</span> <span id="s2473">.</span> <span id="s2474">there was.</span> <span id="s2475">.</span> <span id="s2476">there were shooting all over, without looking.</span> <span id="s2477">They were shooting people in the field.</span> <span id="s2478">In St. Laurent du Pont was a farmer.</span> <span id="s2479">His name was Monsieur Bosier.</span> <span id="s2480">Write it please down.</span> <span id="s2481">His brother was a Monseigneur in Lyon and working 115% for the underground in Lyon.</span> <span id="s2482">This Monsieur Bosier was the brother of this Bosier, the farmer Bosier.</span> <span id="s2483">The Germans took.</span> <span id="s2484">.</span> <span id="s2485">the Gestapo took.</span> <span id="s2486">.</span> <span id="s2487">the Nazis they took about ten or twelve.</span> <span id="s2488">.</span> <span id="s2489">now, what is the name of geisel…people what you catch and you hold them until something happens, then shoot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Hostages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: .</span> <span id="s2492">.</span> <span id="s2493">hostages.</span> <span id="s2494">From our…We had a small little window.</span> <span id="s2495">From this window, we could see how they were standing against the wall.</span> <span id="s2496">The others went from house to house to look for under…people from the underground.</span> <span id="s2497">They came into our house, too.</span> <span id="s2498">I was there.</span> <span id="s2499">Herbert was behind the wall.</span> <span id="s2500">.</span> <span id="s2501">behind the armoire.</span> <span id="s2502">There were three or four rooms on this floor.</span> <span id="s2503">They went in every room.</span> <span id="s2504">They did not go into our room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: You were very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: I told you, if you hear the story, it is like He was holding his hands over us.</span> <span id="s2507">We.</span> <span id="s2508">.</span> <span id="s2509">It was not the time for us.</span> <span id="s2510">Absolutely not the time for us.</span> <span id="s2511">So, uh…there…after.</span> <span id="s2512">.</span> <span id="s2513">uh…that was in the morning….</span> <span id="s2514">it going until three or four o’clock and they left with the geisel.</span> <span id="s2515">.</span> <span id="s2516">with the hostages and this farmer, Bosier, was killed right away in St. Laurent du Pont.</span> <span id="s2517">Because, on account of the brother.</span> <span id="s2518">.</span> <span id="s2519">who was… And he was working in the underground, too, on account of the brother who was in Lyon and a Monseigneur.</span> <span id="s2520">I don’t know how you say that in English.</span> <span id="s2521">.</span> <span id="s2522">an Excellence.</span> <span id="s2523">.</span> <span id="s2524">high placed….</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Monseigneur would still be the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: .</span> <span id="s2527">.</span> <span id="s2528">high placed person, in __________________________.</span> <span id="s2529">Herbert said to me, “Ille, that is it.</span> <span id="s2530">That is it.</span> <span id="s2531">Now we will see the liberation.</span> <span id="s2532">Now we will see the liberation.”</span> <span id="s2533">So, that was the middle of July.</span> <span id="s2534">The Germans took, in Grenoble, every pound of flour, every potato, every sugar, everything what was there.</span> <span id="s2535">There was nothing to eat, except what the farmers made for themselves.</span> <span id="s2536">The last three, four weeks were horrible.</span> <span id="s2537">And, turn this off, please.</span> <span id="s2538">Now, so, the 25th of August, we went to this, I told you before, this little brook, where we went to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s2539">We went …on the 25th of August, we went to this brook That was our day where we washed ourselves, and the underground was standing around and sitting around, and when we came back, we.</span> <span id="s2540">.</span> <span id="s2541">it.</span> <span id="s2542">.</span> <span id="s2543">was such an excitement.</span> <span id="s2544">And, we said to the underground, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s2545">“Everything is going well.”</span> <span id="s2546">So, we didn’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s2547">We came to the village.</span> <span id="s2548">All the French flags were out.</span> <span id="s2549">They were playing the Marseilles.</span> <span id="s2550">.</span> <span id="s2551">(crying) and it was such a wonderful day.</span> <span id="s2552">We were celebrating the whole night through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: You thought the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Yah, we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2555">We were liberated.</span> <span id="s2556">But, Paris was liberated two or three days later.</span> <span id="s2557">So, now came the time where we had to go back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s2558">We wanted to see our parents.</span> <span id="s2559">We had everything in Belgium.</span> <span id="s2560">And, in…we stayed the winter over in St. Pierre Chartreuse.</span> <span id="s2561">We went back to St. Pierre Chartreuse where we had real vacation.</span> <span id="s2562">We skied and it was really wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: But the war was still on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: No.</span> <span id="s2565">Not for us.</span> <span id="s2566">We were liberated.</span> <span id="s2567">France was liberated.</span> <span id="s2568">But…No, not France.</span> <span id="s2569">The North of France was not liberated.</span> <span id="s2570">They still had the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s2571">But…</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: The war didn’t end until May 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: Yah, but we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2574">And the Germans were no more.</span> <span id="s2575">They were all prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: .</span> <span id="s2578">.</span> <span id="s2579">they were all prisoners and uh…there are little situations I can tell you without that we have that thing on.</span> <span id="s2580">So, on the…we went to …from St. Pierre Chartreuse, we had no money.</span> <span id="s2581">They lent us the money to go back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s2582">We went to Paris.</span> <span id="s2583">We went to the Belgian embassy.</span> <span id="s2584">And they said, “I am very sorry.”</span> <span id="s2585">We told them that we are German Jews and that we spent the war in France.</span> <span id="s2586">“Yah, we cannot let you into Belgium.</span> <span id="s2587">You need a visa.”</span> <span id="s2588">I said, “We don’t have a visa.”</span> <span id="s2589">And Herbert was talking.</span> <span id="s2590">So, he says, “Go to the frontier.</span> <span id="s2591">If the man has a good mood, he will let you in.”</span> <span id="s2592">So, we came…we were in the train towards …from France.</span> <span id="s2593">.</span> <span id="s2594">to the frontier.</span> <span id="s2595">.</span> <span id="s2596">Belgian frontier.</span> <span id="s2597">.</span> <span id="s2598">in the train were American soldiers, and I said to Herbert, “You know, I speak a little English.</span> <span id="s2599">I ask the American soldiers if they can help us.”</span> <span id="s2600">I did not know how, but maybe they could help us.</span> <span id="s2601">And, then I talked to one, and he understood me.</span> <span id="s2602">Maybe he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2603">He understood a little bit of German.</span> <span id="s2604">And he asked all his friends.</span> <span id="s2605">What he was talking, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2606">It was a big __________, a big hello in the train.</span> <span id="s2607">So, we came to the frontier, and Herbert and I showed the Belgium surete, that is the …</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Police</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: .</span> <span id="s2610">.</span> <span id="s2611">police our cards.</span> <span id="s2612">And he said, “No, you can’t go in and I said, “But we are under the protection of the American soldiers.”</span> <span id="s2613">They were all standing behind us.</span> <span id="s2614">And, he made this movement, “So, go ahead, go ahead.”</span> <span id="s2615">And you can’t imagine, they were carrying me on their shoulder, and they were Herbert carrying on their shoulder.</span> <span id="s2616">It was such a geschrei.</span> <span id="s2617">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2618">But it was such a lucky geschrei.</span> <span id="s2619">And so, we came in the train, and we went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s2620">And my parents did not know if we lived or not.</span> <span id="s2621">And, we had here and there a letter from them and they had a letter from us.</span> <span id="s2622">How it came, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: That must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: And, then we came up the street, and I was standing in front of the house.</span> <span id="s2625">I couldn’t breathe any more.</span> <span id="s2626">And I was yelling so much.</span> <span id="s2627">But I do not know that then.</span> <span id="s2628">My mother said to Father, “Get out, get out, somebody maybe is taking…the car was running over him.”</span> <span id="s2629">And it was nebish, me.</span> <span id="s2630">(laughter) And so, I had them back.</span> <span id="s2631">My parents, too.</span> <span id="s2632">My sister, my little doggie.</span> <span id="s2633">The dog did not left my knees…my leg…did not left the leg.</span> <span id="s2634">So, then we tried to go.</span> <span id="s2635">.</span> <span id="s2636">that was in ’45, because we stayed in St. Pierre Chartreuse until the whole… everybody was liberated and we had peace…armistice.</span> <span id="s2637">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Armistice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: And then we tried-that was in ’45-and finally in ’48…It’s a lot of story in between but I like to make it short.</span> <span id="s2640">It was very, very hard to come to America.</span> <span id="s2641">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s2642">In ’48, we got the visa.</span> <span id="s2643">My parents left in ’47.</span> <span id="s2644">We had no.</span> <span id="s2645">.</span> <span id="s2646">nobody was giving us affidavit.</span> <span id="s2647">Herbert had a brother here.</span> <span id="s2648">He was negligent to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: In those days you had to have someone who would agree that you would not become dependent on the Government for support.</span> <span id="s2650">They had to agree to take care of you until you could take care of yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s2652">But he neglected all this.</span> <span id="s2653">We could have been here before the War, and Herbert could have been a healthy man with penicillin.</span> <span id="s2654">But he was not here, so….</span> <span id="s2655">And, in ’48, we came here to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: By boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: By boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: So you came into New York Harbor and saw the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: .</span> <span id="s2660">.</span> <span id="s2661">And, I saw my parents again which I didn’t see for seven months.</span> <span id="s2662">But, that was not as bad as during the War time, and we started in one room.</span> <span id="s2663">With cockroaches with us.</span> <span id="s2664">I did not used to them.</span> <span id="s2665">I was used to bedbugs and fleas but not to cockroaches.</span> <span id="s2666">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Was this in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: That was in New York City in Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: At least cockroaches don’t bite people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: No, they don’t bite people.</span> <span id="s2671">And, so we started really…so far, we started from nothing.</span> <span id="s2672">And from this one room, one year and a half later.</span> <span id="s2673">.</span> <span id="s2674">I mean I cannot tell you all the stories, how we started.</span> <span id="s2675">We really started with almost nothing, and we rented a very nice, tiny, tiny apartment, but it was adorable.</span> <span id="s2676">We were very happy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: Was the United States the way you expected it to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: I was…I tell you the truth, I was very unhappy in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2679">I loved Belgium.</span> <span id="s2680">I lived in Belgium before the War and I lived three years after the War, and I loved Belgium.</span> <span id="s2681">But, we couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s2682">And, Herbert could have gone back to Germany.</span> <span id="s2683">His old company was still there, because it was Gentile.</span> <span id="s2684">But, he went to Cologne, but I said, “I can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s2685">I am going to die here.”</span> <span id="s2686">And Herbert couldn’t have done it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: You could not stay in Belgium because the Belgians would not allow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: It was the…We could have stayed it he would have worked for this German company, we could have stayed in Holland or Belgium at the frontier, or in Brussels, or wherever.</span> <span id="s2689">We could have done that.</span> <span id="s2690">But, I did not feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s2691">Maybe I should have done it on account of that sick man of mine.</span> <span id="s2692">He wouldn’t have worked so hard here, because, with tuberculosis, it is not good to work hard.</span> <span id="s2693">You know…</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: That’s right.”</span> <span id="s2695">It is constantly undermining your strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: What kind of work did he do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: He.</span> <span id="s2699">.</span> <span id="s2700">uh.</span> <span id="s2701">.</span> <span id="s2702">he.</span> <span id="s2703">.</span> <span id="s2704">was travelling.</span> <span id="s2705">First, he was…he always said, “Ille, if somebody gives me old nails, I am going to sell them.”</span> <span id="s2706">He was a terrific salesman.</span> <span id="s2707">Terrific.</span> <span id="s2708">He couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s2709">He had Latin, Greek, French--he spoke a fluent French, much better than me, and German.</span> <span id="s2710">But not English.</span> <span id="s2711">So he had to learn English.</span> <span id="s2712">And, I went to.</span> <span id="s2713">.</span> <span id="s2714">I was working in a shipping room doing what I had to do to make a little money, and, uh.</span> <span id="s2715">.</span> <span id="s2716">then he learned English, and one day, he met a friend of his…an acquaintance of his from Cologne, who was in the same company, steel company where Herbert was in, but he couldn’t succeed because he was very dumb.</span> <span id="s2717">But, here he was not very intelligent either, and he did not do very well.</span> <span id="s2718">And, Herbert said, “What are you.</span> <span id="s2719">.</span> <span id="s2720">are we still in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: Herbert, what are you doing?”</span> <span id="s2723">And Herbert said, “I have nothing.</span> <span id="s2724">I have to learn English.</span> <span id="s2725">I cannot…” You know, at this time, he made application to go …by the way, you find out how much easier I speak now than I spoke when I had to speak about my time during the war…He said, “uh” He tried to go into the steel line, but in ’48 they did not accept Jews.</span> <span id="s2726">What is your religion?</span> <span id="s2727">And Herbert wrote, “Jew.”</span> <span id="s2728">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s2729">So, he met this friend.</span> <span id="s2730">And he says, “You know, Herbert, I am selling something nobody heard about.</span> <span id="s2731">Glove rings.</span> <span id="s2732">I don’t know if you heard.</span> <span id="s2733">That was a ring where you put the gloves in and you did hang on your pocketbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: …Instead of losing them.</span> <span id="s2736">But, so they lost the ring and the gloves.</span> <span id="s2737">But it was very good.</span> <span id="s2738">So, Herbert said, “You think I could sell them?”</span> <span id="s2739">“Yah, he says, I’ll sell you a few, maybe two dozen or three dozen.”</span> <span id="s2740">It took half a day.</span> <span id="s2741">Herbert sold two or three dozen, with not knowing English in New York.</span> <span id="s2742">But, then, he found out…and he gave him always more, always more.</span> <span id="s2743">And then Herbert said, “You know, we make that half and half.</span> <span id="s2744">And, what about if we have now, after a while, after half a year, I have now nice customers.</span> <span id="s2745">He travelled by bus.</span> <span id="s2746">We didn’t had a car at this time.</span> <span id="s2747">By bus he travelled to New Jersey, and there he sold the glove rings and he made nice customers and the orders came in.</span> <span id="s2748">And so, they made half and half, and Herbert said, “Now you have my customers, what about your customers?</span> <span id="s2749">Give me a few of your customers.”</span> <span id="s2750">“No,” he says, “that is a long established friendship, and I can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s2751">So Herbert said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s2752">So, he bought a car.</span> <span id="s2753">Herbert.</span> <span id="s2754">And he said, “Listen, I bought a car.</span> <span id="s2755">(I guess it was $500 an old car.)</span> <span id="s2756">And he said, “Listen, at least help me out and pay half the expenses for the car.”</span> <span id="s2757">“No.”</span> <span id="s2758">So, Herbert said, “Listen, if you can’t do anything for me, I have to do it by myself.”</span> <span id="s2759">“You have no credit.</span> <span id="s2760">You will never get merchandise.”</span> <span id="s2761">He said, “We will see that.”</span> <span id="s2762">So he took,.</span> <span id="s2763">.</span> <span id="s2764">Herbert took a few hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s2765">He went to the company from where he got the glove rings.</span> <span id="s2766">He bought a few dozen glove rings and he paid cash.</span> <span id="s2767">So, he had glove rings and the whole…the whole…he did it by himself now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: He established credit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: He established credit and so, it went always up and up and ever up and with this we started our business and then we had wholesale in novelties.</span> <span id="s2770">First the glove rings…glove rings was gone.</span> <span id="s2771">Then, we had powder boxes and pill doses… .</span> <span id="s2772">.</span> <span id="s2773">pill boxes and eyeglass cases and cosmetic bags, and I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s2774">It was a nice established business when he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">Q: So you really prospered in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">Q: That’s a nice ending to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: Yah, it’s a nice ending.</span> <span id="s2779">And, when he passed away, I took over his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: In what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: ’69.</span> <span id="s2782">We just came back from Florida.</span> <span id="s2783">I told you this…</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: You were still living in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s2786">We were still living in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: Well, I have asked you a lot of questions and you have told us many things.</span> <span id="s2788">Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: Yah, I..</span> <span id="s2790">I thought when you left, I thought over…I forgot to tell you something from 1938, after the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s2791">That the next morning, I went in Dortmund I lived with my parents.</span> <span id="s2792">.</span> <span id="s2793">during.</span> <span id="s2794">.</span> <span id="s2795">my husband was arrested in Germany I lived with my parents, and the next morning, I went to the place where the synagogue was standing where I was confirmed, and I married in this synagogue, too.</span> <span id="s2796">And, all the Hitler Jugend and the high placed SR and SS people were standing in front of the synagogue and then they give a sign and the whole Hitler Jugend went into the synagogue and there was a lot of going on in the synagogue, and the Hitler Jugend came out of it with the prayer shawl around their heads,.</span> <span
