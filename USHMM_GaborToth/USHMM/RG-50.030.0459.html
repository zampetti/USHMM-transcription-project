what?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: About the city you were born in.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well, the city, the city’s quite beautiful, and I think made in the 1800, and the city has been totally destroyed during the war, and rebuilt in the old style now, so the city still exists.</span> <span id="s31">It is bigger, more traffic, more life than so many years ago.</span></p> <p><span

your grandparents, on both sides?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, I never met my grandfather, because he died two years before I -- bef-before my birth, and -- and the mother of my mother, called Vilma, V-i-l-m -- m-a Meisel, maiden name, M-e-i-s-e-l.</span> <span id="s40">The other grandfather, Krauth Theojef -- Krausz Jószef -- Jószef -- J-Joseph, and his wife Emma, E-m-m-a Kohn, K-o-h-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And what did you know about your father’s father?</span> <span id="s42">Where was he from, what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, my father’s father sold -- so he was a s-s-salesman, I think [indecipherable] salesman, coal and other mat -- other material to heat.</span> <span id="s44">And my grand -- my grandmother, who was angel, she -- she wanted to -- to somehow to -- together the family, and she was a very good point -- meeti -- meeting point, not only because she was so nice, but because her cooking was so fantastic.</span> <span id="s45">And my grandfather was not very kind, so -- but, he was terribly religious.</span> <span id="s46">He went every day to the synagogue, and regularly, and Yom Kippur afternoon, the mincha, he was the maftir.</span> <span id="s47">You understand what I am ta-talking about?</span> <span id="s48">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, th -- you know that S-Saturday in the Jewish holy -- Jewish -- th-the mo --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: In the Jewish week?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No, no, no, no, no, not the Jewish week, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s55">The -- The -- The Jewish feast of a -- and I think this is one of the best sides of the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s56">The Torah will be read, and according to the importance of the day, seven plus one, or three plus one, are called to the Torah.</span> <span id="s57">The last, or the plus one is the maftir, whose role is -- whose -- whose role is – beaucoup - much more important than the -- than the rest.</span> <span id="s58">And, so usually he was the maftir, and he was ex-extremely proud of it.</span> <span id="s59">It’s a pity that he lived private life, he was completely different.</span> <span id="s60">William Blake says somewhere, “Humble to God, haughty to man.”</span> <span id="s61">And well, so was he.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: This is your maternal grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, th-the paternal --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Paternal?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">My -- My father was exactly the contrary, more than the contrary.</span> <span id="s67">He was a doctor, M.D., and a very good doctor, and an extraordinary man.</span> <span id="s68">Absolutely honest and generous.</span> <span id="s69">And his story is a little bit the story of many Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s70">He was born in 1902, and -- and 1920, he wanted to start his studies, the university, but just in 1920 has been int-introduced the numerus clausus, so it means that, I don’t know, three percent of the students could be Jewish, or four, I -- I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s71">S-So h-he had to emigrate, and he went to Germany, and in Gieβen [Giessen], not far from Frankfurt, am Main, he -- he became a doctor.</span> <span id="s72">And as he came back, the Hungarian authorities didn’t recognize his diploma, and he had to start again.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: He left Hungary to study in Germany because Hungary had more -- at that time more restrictive laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, the numerus clausus has been introduced, and there was no place, because they had I don’t know how many Jews, and he -- he has been refused.</span> <span id="s75">So he had to -- he had to look for somewhere -- somewhere else.</span> <span id="s76">And -- And so he -- he made his studies, I don’t -- seven or eight years in Gieβen, in Germany.</span> <span id="s77">I think he’s -- he finished in 1928, yes, it was before my -- my existence, and -- and he ki -- then he went back to Hungary, and he tried to -- to use his diploma, it was no -- it was not possible.</span> <span id="s78">So for family reasons, because my grandfather whom I didn’t know, he was a dentist, and this cabinet had to be continued, and he agreed to be -- to become a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, under the supervision of a -- of a-another dentist, who made his studies in Hungary.</span> <span id="s81">So I -- I -- I think it’s very confused -- very confusing, but it is -- it was very confusing.</span> <span id="s82">He had a complete diplome -- doctor, M.D., in medicine, from Gieβen.</span> <span id="s83">And as he came back eight years later, he couldn’t practice alone because he had no Hungarian diploma, and he -- and so the family had to engage a Hungarian dentist -- a Hungar -- a dentist having a Hungarian diploma.</span> <span id="s84">Meanwhile, he started -- he -- he tried to organize hi -- this Hungarian, a-uh conification.</span> <span id="s85">It wasn’t possible, and somehow, I don’t know who helped him, he has -- he obtained the authoriz -- authorization to frequent the Hungarian University, with was Pécs ab-about 200 kilometers south from Budapest.</span> <span id="s86">So he started again, and he made all this ev-everything, so the -- all eight or seven years in Pécs, and I think I was the -- probably the unique case.</span> <span id="s87">I assisted in hi -- that he was officially made doctor.</span> <span id="s88">And it was -- I think it was quite late, sa -- like -- something like ’38.</span> <span id="s89">Two years, then he be -- he became independent of the other -- other dentist, because he had a Hungarian diploma.</span> <span id="s90">1940, he has been called to the army, but the army -- I have the picture -- I have the picture for you.</span> <span id="s91">I don’t know if you can reproduce it.</span> <span id="s92">This is the complete misery, this picture, the complete misery of a man who -- who was a double doctor, and -- and wear this horrible uniform.</span> <span id="s93">It took three month, his absence, and he came back, well 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: And -- And the place where he was is Éradony although I do -- I don’t think it’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Well where -- where in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And today -- toda -- today it belongs to Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: And so he started to build up his own life as a doctor, but two years later, the -- I -- I don’t know who made it, how, who decided, but the -- the four best going Hungarian doctor -- doctors from my native town, Székesfehérvár, have been ordered to go to the army again.</span> <span id="s100">But it was not, this time, without uniform, and we had to send cloth and coat, and -- and whatever, underwear, to somebody who was in the -- not in the army, but i-i-i -- called working -- I don’t know what working, teams.</span> <span id="s101">All Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s102">And it finished by -- by the union -- the Soviet Union, the whole thing finished in the -- in the soviet -- the u -- Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s103">1943 was the -- the big change in the Soviet Union, they started really to attack the Germans, until -- and then -- which -- which continued until May, ’45, until th-the end of the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s104">But he -- as I -- and I know him from one of his colleagues who came back, he didn’t, died because he couldn’t support working for Ukrainian farmers in the -- as a prisoner, to be -- he didn’t want -- accept better life conditions than the others.</span> <span id="s105">So ex --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Y-You’re saying your father refused to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: -- better li -- better living conditions --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: -- than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Because -- Ok -- He -- He would have gotten those because he was a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I told you at the beginning, that he was an extraordinary honest man, and he didn’t see any reason to have better food and better treatment than his colleagues, because the colleagues -- or just because he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s114">And so he -- he became sick, and his legs were frozen, and he thought that they could be amp-amputated -- amp --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Amputated.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Amputate -- amputed -- but it -- it didn’t take place, because he died.</span> <span id="s117">Very probably he du -- he didn’t know how sick -- how sick he was, and he died.</span> <span id="s118">So this was -- this was -- means that practically, I -- I lost my father as I was 13, and [indecipherable] I -- I -- I never seen him any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How did you find out, at what point did you find out what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Because we received a -- an official paper from the Hungarian army, that he disappeared.</span> <span id="s121">[indecipherable] disappeared or dead, or -- but in this case, because they didn’t find him, of course because he was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s122">On the other hand, he -- there was a -- there was a possibility dur -- that there -- the Moscow radio gave every day, messages.</span> <span id="s123">And my aunt -- [indecipherable] his -- his -- his sister received a visitor who told her, that you are Miss -- Mrs. Almásy, yes.</span> <span id="s124">Because I heard in the radio that your -- your f -- brother is alive, and is a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s125">It was quite at the beginning of f -- f -- ’43, and according to this -- this friend, whom I saw later, he died probably May 22nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: I want to go back to when you are a young boy, and I wonder if you can tell me what your home life was like?</span> <span id="s127">What -- What did your house look like?</span> <span id="s128">What was it like to be inside of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Well, I think as nothing extraordinary.</span> <span id="s130">At the end of my peerin, before the deportation, I had two very good friends, both died, I will tell you about, as far as Auschwitz concerned.</span> <span id="s131">And I have -- I -- I ha -- I was considered as a musical phenomenon.</span> <span id="s132">I had a very good voice, and -- and I -- I -- I could s-sing very properly.</span> <span id="s133">It went so far that I -- the accompaniment has been made by my mother.</span> <span id="s134">The executing of [indecipherable] was by Mo-Mozart.</span> <span id="s135">The -- The queen of the night, she -- who has two terribly difficult airs in the magic flute.</span> <span id="s136">And I could sing it.</span> <span id="s137">Famous -- Famous singers couldn’t.</span> <span id="s138">And so they -- everybody was very, very [indecipherable] how.</span> <span id="s139">So, and I don’t know whose idea it was, I went in September ’37, to Vienna, to the Wiener Sängerknaben Chor, which is the -- the little singers.</span> <span id="s140">I -- I don’t -- I don’t know how they call.</span> <span id="s141">The institution exists still today.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: The Vienna Boy’s Choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Vienna Boy’s Choir, yes, the Vienna Boy’s Choir, yes.</span> <span id="s144">And the reception was very friendly from a certain Rektor Schnitt, and a Hungarian ha -- did -- the conductor was a Hungarian named Gombos.</span> <span id="s145">And they wanted to take me immediately, and then I try -- I -- I -- I -- I sa -- I cried that I want to go home to my -- my -- me mum, etcetera.</span> <span id="s146">And the -- the bottom line was an agreement between them that I come -- I go home, I learn German, and in May ’38, I come back.</span> <span id="s147">But in March, somebody else took the place, really, so in April we -- we received a letter that due the -- to the events, of course, you understand that your son will not come to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: If it was stated that subtly, that -- no more specific reference to what happened, just due to the events, your son will not come.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: So you ask little bit too much.</span> <span id="s150">It was 1938.</span> <span id="s151">How do you -- How do you want me to know in which terms they -- they told -- they wrote to my mother that there was no place for me any more?</span> <span id="s152">Of course, because -- because I am Jewish, and howa -- you know what happened in Austria.</span> <span id="s153">So I -- I stayed at home, and I went to school, and -- and as I finished the -- the -- the grand -- the elementary school, I wanted to go to the -- go to the gymnasium lyceo the gymnasium, eight years.</span> <span id="s154">The day I, by inscription, came, in 1939, the official dec-decree -- dec -- decree of the government, concerning the numerus clausus in the -- in the grammar school -- not grammar school in -- in the college, but the director of the school was eight year -- during eight years, the main professor of my father, and I had been in it -- I -- I -- I got my inscription immediate, without any question, so -- so I went to school, and I could continue until ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Let -- Let me clarify.</span> <span id="s156">You’re saying that when you were about to go to gymnasium, restrictive clause limiting the attendance of Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: -- were implemented.</span> <span id="s159">But you still were allowed to go, because of a family friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No, somebody else.</span> <span id="s161">I saw -- I -- I -- I imagine they had six places.</span> <span id="s162">They had six places, and they gave me one place without any -- any further examination, or whatever.</span> <span id="s163">I think the director was a very good man, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No.</span> <span id="s168">No, Jewish teachers have been prohibited, later.</span> <span id="s169">And -- And so he couldn’t -- he couldn’t do anything else, because he was in a -- a very honest man.</span> <span id="s170">And somehow he -- he -- he was not obliged to do it, but morally, yes.</span> <span id="s171">Because he knew -- he -- he -- he knew my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I know that you were a young boy before the war, but I still want to go back and see what things you do remember.</span> <span id="s173">C-Can -- A-A-And now you’re just mentioning your father.</span> <span id="s174">Can you talk a little bit about your father’s standing in the community?</span> <span id="s175">Did people know your father, did he take on any community tasks?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, I don’t know exactly his -- you want to know his social position, or something like that is your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Social, or i-i-if people knew him in the community.</span> <span id="s178">If they did, what did they turn to him for?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: [indecipherable] or the Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: The Jewish community.</span> <span id="s181">Well, or the -- or your -- or your larger community, if it was a more mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, I think the way he -- so I -- I -- I’m -- I’m not sure -- I’m not sure to -- to be able to -- to give you a -- a correct answer, because this happened very long time ago, and as a child I never analyzed his social, or community, or whatever position.</span> <span id="s183">He -- He didn’t want to live in a Jewish ghetto, and he -- he didn’t want to -- to reduce his interest on Jewish interests.</span> <span id="s184">He -- He made his work extremely honestly, you saw the M.D., and I n -- what I positively know, that he treated people having no money at all, and he never asked them to pay, because he knew that they -- they was un -- they were unable to pay.</span> <span id="s185">He considered the -- this profession to do something necessary for -- for his -- he -- colleagues, for his -- not only for his friends, but for -- for human beings, and he -- I remember of a certain Marinka, who was a Gypsy lady, and who -- who didn’t wear shoes, and -- but who had -- he was -- she had problem with hi -- with her teeth, and so she -- she knew that he will -- she will not pay, and my father -- my father knew that he had -- can -- he cannot require -- cannot ask any money because she hadn’t.</span> <span id="s186">And so in -- she -- I think this -- this -- this was his -- his -- his exampler -- exemplary, and extraordinary side, that he considered his profession as really a profession for human beings, independently of their social level.</span> <span id="s187">She had for in -- He had a -- a patient who couldn't hear at all.</span> <span id="s188">She was sewing underwear and -- and then these kind of things, and sh-she couldn’t pay.</span> <span id="s189">She [indecipherable] a little bit underwear for the family, and you -- you couldn’t -- you couldn’t speak with her, because she didn’t under -- she didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s190">So her only answer was, “Jó van, jó van” It’s all right, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s191">But she didn’t know what was all right, and we didn’t know what she underst -- wh -- what she understood.</span> <span id="s192">[indecipherable] it became a sort of phenomenon, a -- a part of the -- of our lives is a [indecipherable] time, she arrives to sew, to -- to repair, because she couldn’t -- she couldn’t pay.</span> <span id="s193">So, I think this -- it is a very good thing.</span> <span id="s194">I have been told that he -- he has stolen something, it is the once only, but he has stolen what her -- his mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: End of side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: -- ition of tape one, with George Kadar, April 24th, year 2000.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: He knows that his mother, every morning, went out looking for eggs, because she had chickens.</span> <span id="s199">And he went to see if there is -- the eggs are already here, and one egg was missing, and to not deceive his mother, he has stolen an egg from the -- from the kitchen, put in the place of the -- of the ch -- of the chicken to -- so -- so this is the only time he -- he is -- he has stolen.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: What can you tell us about your mother?</span> <span id="s201">What was it like to -- to be in the house with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: She was a victim of the society.</span> <span id="s203">She was beautiful and intelligent, but her mother -- so my gr -- my -- my grandmother -- and I don’t know which -- what was the position of her father, but they didn’t want to -- they didn’t want her to study, because a woman doesn’t need it.</span> <span id="s204">And -- And so she -- she spoke two foreign languages, German and French, and she read a lot, and she was very interested by plenty of things.</span> <span id="s205">And it -- it couldn’t bring anything, because -- because she -- she had to finish her studies at 18.</span> <span id="s206">What for, I don’t know, because there was not too much to do.</span> <span id="s207">And I think that my grandmother was very limited.</span> <span id="s208">I don’t want the -- I don’t want any -- I -- I don’t want to say anything bad of somebody who finished his -- his -- his -- her -- or somebody -- her -- she -- who finished his day in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s209">But I think that she had a great responsibility for the family what arrived, because my father was on the uni -- the U.S. quota, and I think that she didn’t want to move because of the house.</span> <span id="s210">There was a house, built by her husband, the house was very beautiful, and -- and somehow I think that she didn’t understand any problem.</span> <span id="s211">Meanwhile, she spoke very well, German, less well French, and she read and she -- she -- she -- she was a -- an accepta -- I think an acceptable person, was -- very probably she didn’t understand anything from the world, but -- and I don’t -- I don’t know, seeing her example, how we could imagine th-the n -- n-n-north and east, south and west, the Nazi regime, or German occupation alre -- already has been made, and Hungary will remain independent.</span> <span id="s212">I think it was a very -- a very naïve e -- idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did -- Did your mother’s mother live with you?</span> <span id="s214">Did you live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So did you live in this beautiful house?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, she didn’t -- she didn’t have a beauti-beautiful place in the beautiful house, because -- and particularly since my father started with -- went to the army once, and a secon -- a second time.</span> <span id="s218">So we had to -- we had to have money from somewhere, so we had a -- we took a small apartment in the -- in -- in the same beautiful house, and the two big apartments have been rented -- hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So, are you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Do you know why your parents didn’t have other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I think it is -- I think it’s better not to -- not to imagine a second or a third chi -- child, because in 1944, I was 15, and I was just the -- the -- the category of age who had the possibility to survive.</span> <span id="s223">17 - 18 year old boys have been sent to work, and particularly in a -- in a mine in Yu-Yugoslavia bor.</span> <span id="s224">And I think from this mine, nobody came back.</span> <span id="s225">So I think -- I-I didn’t see anybody coming back from there.</span> <span id="s226">And younger brothers or sisters could have been eliminated immediately in Auschwitz, the first day.</span> <span id="s227">So -- So I have just the age -- just the age you were permitted to exist, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Do you think that your parents decided not to have more children because they saw trouble brewing in -- in 1932 - ’33?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I have absolutely no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Can you talk a little bit about the role faith and religion played at home?</span> <span id="s233">Did your family observe the Sabbath, and in -- and in what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s235">It’s -- I mentioned two friends, and religion was an obligation in the school, as mathematics, or physics, or Hungarian literature.</span> <span id="s236">And we had a marvelous rabbi, really a marvelous man, and -- who -- who died the first day in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s237">He wasn’t -- He wasn’t old, I think he -- he was born 1906.</span> <span id="s238">So he was 30 -- 38, and -- and so somehow, he arrived to -- to invite us to the synagogue, and we went regularly to the synagogue, and we observed -- we really observed everything, even I think -- even the -- the day of Gedarea [indecipherable] thing -- thing of less importance.</span> <span id="s239">And my -- my parents didn’t say anything, so they considered it very probably as-- it’s something which comes and goes, which really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: By that -- What do you mean by that?</span> <span id="s241">Wa -- Were your parents not religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: They were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No.</span> <span id="s245">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s246">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s247">And I think my -- my father had a very bad reaction against his father, who reg -- who went regularly to the synagogue, and on -- and on the same time, a man who -- who was quite brutal and tasteless.</span> <span id="s248">Very -- Very probably, but we -- we never spoke of this, so I -- I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What did your parents teach you about being a Jew?</span> <span id="s250">I mean, how did you learn about that as you grew up, or what things do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh, I didn’t need my parents, because to be a Jew, and learn in Hungary, in that period of -- of Horthy, h-o-r-t-h-y.</span> <span id="s252">It wasn’t -- It was not very difficult, cause i-it -- it started with the fact that my father couldn’t study, so -- so the -- and -- and in -- in the school, different remarks, that you have killed our Jesus, etcetera, and -- and to -- finally, the children in the s -- in the school were products of their parents, and -- and I think that if you -- if you are a -- if you are a -- a salesman, and -- and you are not honest with your -- with your clients -- they say that Mr. Meyer was not honest, but if the Mr. Meyer is a Jew, then the Jewish -- the Jewish salesman, Mr. Meyer, etcetera.</span> <span id="s253">So, to be -- to be a Jew, it belongs to the profession of the -- to the person, to -- to the imagination of people.</span> <span id="s254">And, you know, I don’t know who -- who is -- who -- who said that the anti-Semitism doesn’t need any Jews, and you can’t be a ga -- you can’t be an anti-Semite if -- if never, never in your life, you never have seen one single Jew.</span> <span id="s255">It’s all -- I don’t know if you remember, it happened long years ago, kind of a Gallup question in Austria, it was long time before the present regime -- the actual -- regime -- how many Jews are in Austria, and people, certain people said 1,000,000, and in fact, I think 7,000, because the Austrian Jews have been -- have been killed in the meantime.</span> <span id="s256">Or, do you want a nay -- a Jewish neighbor?</span> <span id="s257">30 percent said no.</span> <span id="s258">Or, do you want to shake the hand of a Jew?</span> <span id="s259">30 percent or 31 percent said no.</span> <span id="s260">And they really, they ca-cannot know a lot of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: So then how, as a young man, did you regard being Jewish?</span> <span id="s262">I mean, you didn’t have a lot of input in a religious way, it was an in -- it was a burden in terms your father was.</span> <span id="s263">How did you think about it as your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: As -- I -- I think I -- I told you what I could, because I don’t know what -- what could have been added to -- to these outside remarks, criticisms, and -- and so I think you -- you can, and you must accept the fact.</span> <span id="s265">So, as -- if you see somebody who, he only has one leg, so he -- finally he accepts the fact, it vee -- to live with one leg, is still better than not to live at all.</span> <span id="s266">So, there is a s-simple fact for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You’ve talked a lot about your father being very generous, and honest, and you’ve talked about your mother being very bright.</span> <span id="s268">Would -- What things did your parents teach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: This is extremely difficult to say, because as I lost my father, I was 13, my mother, 15.</span> <span id="s270">And -- And if you th-think of general teaching, I think that -- that my father was more important in this domain I think, even if he left earlier.</span> <span id="s271">My mother, it was -- she was different, because we did all the daily light -- th-the -- the -- the daily life.</span> <span id="s272">The preparation of the next -- the next -- the next day, to -- to ask questions of history or -- or literature, or whatever, because the next day, I had these lessons.</span> <span id="s273">And she learned with me piano -- piano playing, so she -- she sat down and spent hours at the piano with me every day.</span> <span id="s274">So, I didn’t become a pianist, this is -- this is not the question, but -- but her participation in the -- in the daily life was l-longer and more important.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So you had a piano at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Di-Did you also have anything else.</span> <span id="s278">Perhaps a gramophone, or maybe--</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Well, it was a rarity, but I -- I -- I had a very old gramophone, and later an electric one, with mechanic in it.</span> <span id="s283">And -- And I had a couple of -- a couple of records.</span> <span id="s284">The Beethoven Violin Concerto I remember.</span> <span id="s285">The Bach double Concerto i-in D minor.</span> <span id="s286">The Eine Kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart.</span> <span id="s287">I think this was -- I don’t know what else, and a record by myself, because I have been recorded ma -- by my parents.</span> <span id="s288">They wanted to -- They wanted to -- to her -- to ge -- to save -- safeguard the -- the -- my -- to -- my voice, and I -- I s -- I sung the second air of the Queen of the Night, and the Halleluia by Mozart, which was a very important thing.</span> <span id="s289">At this time, went the movie, were a hundred men, one girl with Stokowsky and Deanna Durbin sung the ca -- the Halleluia.</span> <span id="s290">And of this record, five examples have been pressed in five different houses, and all the five houses have been destroyed.</span> <span id="s291">I couldn’t f -- I couldn’t find my -- my voice.</span> <span id="s292">I -- I -- otherwise, I could prove that I really sung this very difficult ple-pieces.</span> <span id="s293">It’s will play another -- another role, not the Halleluia, but the Grieg Solveig -- Solveig song in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: What did you -- What were you thinking you might be when you grew up?</span> <span id="s295">Let’s say when you were 10 and 11 and 12, maybe before the war seems very real.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, earlier --</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: I -- bus driver.</span> <span id="s299">I -- I think it’s, you know, my dream, or a controller of -- of -- on the bus, you know, who sell -- who sells the tickets, who is selling tickets.</span> <span id="s300">And then I wanted to -- to become a teacher of Latin and Hungarian literature.</span> <span id="s301">It was -- Which is a little bit more related.</span> <span id="s302">And so I really, I -- I -- I didn’t know, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You -- You mentioned Hungarian literature, and we’ve mentioned that once, and he-here’s a -- a variation, I suppose, on a question I’ve asked you, which is what were your thoughts about being Hungarian?</span> <span id="s304">Did you know a lot about Hungarian history --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Oh, we learned it, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did you feel Hungarian?</span> <span id="s307">Did you identify with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Oh, you know, this is a -- it’s a very funny question, because I think of the answer, the first -- first three years of the elementary school, I made, in the Jewish elementary school in hu -- in Hungary, in Budapest -- in -- in Székesfehérvár.</span> <span id="s309">The fourth year I couldn’t, because of my grandmother, maternal -- ma -- the mat -- on maternal side, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: She wouldn’t let you?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s312">At the -- At the end of the -- of the third year, a-and every year there was a -- a -- in the court of the school, a gymnastic, and I don’t know what series on music, upon music, organized by a teacher who called Köves báci, and -- and this man was a gu -- big hero of the Hungarian army, a Jewish man, who had I don’t know how many medals from the first World War, and who -- who every year, I think December 10th or 11th, every year we had to listen to his history story in the first World War, beca -- the -- the -- the -- the Battle of Limanowa.</span> <span id="s313">Nobody knows where Limanowa, it’s somewhere in Poland, or in -- and -- and he -- and then the year of the s -- the end of the s -- this school year, who he played his piece, a Hungarian resurrection.</span> <span id="s314">And in this piece, the end of the play, I -- I don’t remember exactly what the -- how it was, because I know that the -- at the end of the piece, two angels -- two angels presented the -- the -- the -- not the cart -- the geographical cart of great Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: The map.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: The map.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The map of great Hungary, before having lost two third of the Hungarian territories.</span> <span id="s319">This man, March 15th, arrive in the synagogue, which was the -- everybody went to this, according to his religion, to synagogue, or church, or Temple, because it was th -- t -- th-the day of the Hungarian revolution, 1848.</span> <span id="s320">He arrived in Hungarian uniform, as a lite -- a lieutenant, and -- and we prepared Hungarian flags with the Magen David in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: So this man, he was the teacher of you know, the gymnastic, and in the -- in this schoolyard, only three ranks of -- of -- of -- of chairs, and my grandmother sat down in the first li -- the first row -- line, or wh-whatever.</span> <span id="s323">And he started to cry that the first rang is reserved, please take another one, and my grandmothers went out furious, and didn’t tolerate that I continue this school with the Jewish l -- teachers.</span> <span id="s324">And well, I had goo -- good relationship with the -- with my old teacher, whose wife was my pi-piano teacher for a moment -- for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s325">And he was the religion teacher as well.</span> <span id="s326">And was the issue to -- to understand, so the example of this -- of this Köves báci, Uncle Köves, K-o -- double poin-point, v-e-s, he was a Hungarian patriot, and he tried to educate the -- this Jewish children in the -- i-in Hungarian patriotism, and of course it was grotesque.</span> <span id="s327">It was ridiculous, the whole -- the -- the -- the method of Limanowa, the Hungarian resurrection, so all these ils -- and the Magen David, there is this hor-horrible ideas, and he finished exactly as the others.</span> <span id="s328">Later, the Jewish officers lost -- lost their military rank, and on a -- every man had a militar -- a military book, and with an enormous stamp ZS, zsidó -- Jewish: out.</span> <span id="s329">So of -- of course it was -- it was horrible that -- that the Hungarian authorities did it, because even i-if somebody who -- who -- plenty of enthusiasm, struggled -- struggled and -- and -- and wanted to -- and wanted to -- to -- to underline his first: Hungarian, second: Jewish si -- situation.</span> <span id="s330">So this perhaps the answer.</span> <span id="s331">My father and my mother, there was absolutely no question about that, but we had to put out the flag for several anniversaries, and then the -- and so on.</span> <span id="s332">Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Ca-Can you talk a bit about your family’s political ideas?</span> <span id="s334">Did you know what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: The family’s political ideas?</span> <span id="s336">My father had not -- I -- I don’t think he had particular political ideas.</span> <span id="s337">My mother was more active.</span> <span id="s338">A great part of the Hungarian -- of the -- of the Hungarian Jews in -- in this town went to the -- to the left side.</span> <span id="s339">They thought that the situation is so horrible, it only can be resolved otherwise, not in -- to a -- just to leave, just to resort -- to have the opportunity to leave, to learn, to teach, to -- which, these opportunities have been -- have been slowly excluded.</span> <span id="s340">It -- In Hungary there was two series of Jewis -- so-called Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s341">In 1939, and then 1941, and many professions -- many professions, Jewish, were eliminated.</span> <span id="s342">And this will give you an example, the publicity.</span> <span id="s343">There was a -- a glass mirror, I don’t know what salesman, a big shop in Hungary called Schnetzler, and in -- in -- in -- in Székesfehérvár, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s344">And Schnetzler made a publicity in the movie, sh -- buy glass mirrors in the shop of Schnetzler.</span> <span id="s345">Schnetzler is the only non-Jewish salesman in this -- in this rubrique.</span> <span id="s346">Of course I wouldn’t I-I wouldn’t buy something fr -- because he is Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s347">The idea, to -- to make a publicity, these are the only non-Jewish salesman, is all -- it’s -- in this profession, I think is horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: You’ve talked about the two laws, and you just gave that story.</span> <span id="s349">Things begin -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: This is an interview with George Kadar, conducted by Katie Davis, on April 24th, in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s351">This is tape number two, side A. I’ll begin asking that question again, which is, can you describe how things began to change in your life, as the new laws were passed, and restricted the ability of Jews to be in professions, or -- and just as things begin to change in Hungary, and perhaps you were hearing also about other parts, other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: No, no, i-it is -- it i -- this thing -- I was not too much concerned, because I went to school before and after.</span> <span id="s353">What really happened, that in Hungary, there was so-called Levente-mozgalom, Levente, old Hungarian name, and it was in Germany the old -- old names came -- came up with these different Fascist or semi-Fascist movements.</span> <span id="s354">In Hungary, Levente, and -- and it meant that in the school, one -- once in the week, three hours of patriotism, or -- and the Jews couldn’t be Levente, because they were Jewish, and -- and -- but to -- to make certain works -- this is absolutely no -- no reason, just to -- just to have an occupation parallel to the Levente movement, with -- with yellow armband, because it was yellow, the Jewish colors, you know, and baptized Jewish who -- so who racially were Jewish, but administratively not, they had a white armband.</span> <span id="s355">And so it is -- it is -- this was diff -- it was different, because the -- this -- the sure friends of -- comrades did something completely different, so it was a -- the first -- the first place, the Jewish children were ousted.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Ousted?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: School-wise?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s360">No, not from the school, from the movement, so they -- cause they -- the not Jewish peop -- the not Jewish colleagues made -- made something different.</span> <span id="s361">The second thing was deportations started from other countries earlier than in Hungary.</span> <span id="s362">And once, in Friday evening, the -- this famous rabbi made a great speech, and par -- and it was, I think, about -- about Christmas.</span> <span id="s363">Christmas -- the Christmas tree apparently has been invented by Martin Luther.</span> <span id="s364">And Luther propose also to send out the Jews to work.</span> <span id="s365">And in connection to this, he said that he positively knew that locked trains trasversed -- traversed the gare -- the railway station of our town.</span> <span id="s366">He didn’t know where they were going, but he -- he knew that they came from Italy.</span> <span id="s367">And -- And he suggested that Jewish families forget about the Christmas tree this year.</span> <span id="s368">I don’t know, I -- how we reacted in this time, but -- but we -- but he knew the deportation was in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s369">He didn’t n -- He didn’t say that the next victim, ou-ou-ourselves, but he warned us against something.</span> <span id="s370">So this was -- this was nothing in relationship with the hung -- with the law, but it was in relationship with the time of the law, approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Do you remember what your thoughts were when you heard that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I think that we reacted as people who do not g -- do not want to -- to accept the fact of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s373">It was a kind of -- of a fly away from the -- from the reality, and to unde -- and to understand that Hungary will continue t -- a-as I told you, as independence, as far as -- as possible.</span> <span id="s374">I didn’t hear any reaction, say that if it is so, then we have to go.</span> <span id="s375">Everybody should have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Was there ever earlier -- or ever, that you remember, any talk of your family leaving Hungary, perhaps trying to go to a neutral country, just out of Europe, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I see -- I told you that my father was in the quota, so h-he -- he knew why he did it, and -- but somehow, I think that in the family, he wasn’t taken very seriously because -- because he -- he said several times that this is the train, which he will ta-take to go to see Italy.</span> <span id="s378">There was a dear -- a direct train between Budapest and -- and Venice, and I don’t know where it -- I think Buda-Budapest -- Venice, with beautiful Italian cars, beautiful.</span> <span id="s379">And -- And he couldn’t realize this dream because he had no money, and perhaps because he couldn’t realize one project, perhaps the second project has not been taken seriously.</span> <span id="s380">I don’t know, I don’t remember, I -- I just imagine an answer on your -- on your -- on your question, I don’t know whether I’m right.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: You mentioned that you heard the rabbi give a speech, and that was in synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: I wonder if you can talk a little bit more.</span> <span id="s384">I know we’ve touched on this, but I understand that your father and mother weren’t very religious, and you went, but what did you take from there?</span> <span id="s385">Did you have -- I mean, what was attractive about going, to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: This is what I told you, that these -- these three friends went everywhere, and -- and it belongs somehow, the -- to the daily life, and I don’t know if they are more or less convinced, as I was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s387">But we were together, we wer -- we went together, and we liked the rabbi.</span> <span id="s388">And -- And we had a -- so -- so common moments, reactions of happenings in the synagogue, and so kind of -- of complicity.</span> <span id="s389">There was a very old man, he’s Goldberg.</span> <span id="s390">And Mr. Goldberg was very old, and very sleepy, and -- and everything went I th -- I think th -- slowly for him, because he -- he knew everything by heart, and -- and then he -- he manifested in a very funny way aaaahhhhh, aaaaaayy, and a -- and of course he -- he was -- the rabbi was smiling, and we smiled together, because -- because the poor -- the poor old man expressed his -- his -- his sentiments very f -- very curious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What were the names of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: beide, two, both – hieβ Pista, Stefan, Stern and Hermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So three friends, and you made four?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Oh, three together.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Three -- Three -- Three together.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: You were the third?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s400">That’s what I --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: And -- And then the two Pista -- the two -- the two Stefans, Steves.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Do you remember when you first heard about Hitler?</span> <span id="s403">Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: How about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: The war, oh I think we didn’t understand too much of the war, and -- and we didn’t understand particularly na -- the general catastrophe of the -- of -- of the attack against the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s407">And the war was [indecipherable] was fascinating, because they advanced, they went until Moscow, and it is a phenomenon, it was extremely -- plenty of tension, and -- and -- and -- in-interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: H-How would you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Oh, oh, I don’t -- I don’t understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: H-How would you keep up with the news?</span> <span id="s411">Was it through newspapers or other ways?</span> <span id="s412">Was it the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Newspapers, radio, and then -- and simple -- simple human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s415">So -- So was sitting around listening to the radio something that your family did?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes, a wa -- so, the radio has been confiscated by the police, because we were supposed to listen to the -- to the BBC, and -- and -- which we did.</span> <span id="s417">And one day I came from school, a policeman was sitting in our apartment, radio control, but th-the radio was not open, so nobody -- nobody listened to anything, which didn’t change he -- and th -- to -- in his attitude.</span> <span id="s418">You know, you don’t need the Jews to be an anti-Semite, you don’t need to listen to something, or to not to listen to something to be caught with that, that you did it.</span> <span id="s419">And so the radio has been confiscated, we had to -- to give the radio to a -- kind of a -- a radio shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Do you remember about when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I think ’43, I’m -- I’m -- I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Can you just talk a little bit about how the town changes, if it does?</span> <span id="s423">Is there any more open anti-Semitism, you know, in addition to the story you just t-told, and to -- to other things you’ve mentioned, but is the atmosphere in your town changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: The atmosphere in Hungary, there was an excellent German paper, which called Pester Lloyd, a paper which has been made entirely in Hungary, and entirely by Hungarian Jews, who -- who knew German, who knew really German.</span> <span id="s425">And it went so far into parliament, an interperlation happened, or happened li -- has been done a question to the government, how is possible that this paper is still -- i-is still made by a Jew?</span> <span id="s426">So nobody was interested to know why, why, really why, becau-because -- because he s -- he -- he -- he spoke German.</span> <span id="s427">He was perfect in German, a Hungarian journalist re -- making a German paper.</span> <span id="s428">You know, to these extreme events belong -- belongs the reign of ignorance, and it happened after the war, just to illustrate it, after the war, a couple of years after the war in Hungary, the -- the Soviet regime has been introduced by Hungarians, and it has been declared a -- th-the -- the worker’s class should take over the main -- the -- the most interesting, the most important places.</span> <span id="s429">And so, they found a tramway conductor who the m -- who’s a very nice man, has a beautiful voice, but he wasn’t a good announcer because he -- he has not the necessary culture, and -- and they announced, ladies and gentleman, you are listening to the excerpts of “The Miserables,” by Hugo, the fifth.</span> <span id="s430">Because Victor Hugo, the V point Hugo, and Hugo -- Hugo the fifth wrote this piece.</span> <span id="s431">And for me, it is a -- it is after the wa -- it was after the war, but this kind of -- of solid ignorance, I know that my -- I -- I -- I -- I called them since I knew this -- this tramway conductor.</span> <span id="s432">This is also Hugo the fifth.</span> <span id="s433">And Hugo the fifth arrived every time when a -- when a regime changes, and the old -- the old professionalists -- professionalists h-have been changed by people knowing nothing, and which -- which -- which always meant a kind of Hugo the fifth.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: As things began to really tighten up, and as you said, as ignorance arrived, a solid ignorance re-emerged --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: This is hopeless.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: I know you were young, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: It is hopeless.</span> <span id="s438">This is hopeless.</span> <span id="s439">So the -- the end of the Hungarian regime I didn’t see, because I wa -- I was in Auschwitz, but this is exactly, you know, somebody -- somebody’s trying to -- to burn the Jewish -- the synagogue in Lübeck for instance.</span> <span id="s440">What do you do?</span> <span id="s441">You -- You go to these people and say, “Listen, this is not correct.</span> <span id="s442">You shouldn’t burn the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s443">So this is -- this is not possible.</span> <span id="s444">How do you want to -- to speak with them?</span> <span id="s445">About what?</span> <span id="s446">Based on what?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So what happens, though?</span> <span id="s448">Do you just become --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s450">We waited.</span> <span id="s451">We -- We had a very good newspaper, who -- in this paper, you could read very interesting things, a little bit hidden, of course.</span> <span id="s452">And until the -- until the very day, the March 19th, ’44, when the -- when the country was officially occupied by the Germans, and it was the -- and that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the days leading up to that?</span> <span id="s454">Did you expect the country to be occupied by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, we didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s456">The -- The Prime Minister who called Kállay, K-á-double l-a-y, he wanted to establish a certain balance between -- between east and west.</span> <span id="s457">And I think they played with the idea to -- to -- to jump out on the whole thing.</span> <span id="s458">And Kállay announced a great speech, for the 19th of March, in the evening.</span> <span id="s459">On the 19th of March, the Germans were priso -- were there.</span> <span id="s460">So the -- the -- the speech did not happen, and the Germans were in Hungary March 19th.</span> <span id="s461">On March 22nd, government has been formed, and the first -- the first Prime Minister was the -- the ex-ambassador in Berlin, of the Hungarian kingdom.</span> <span id="s462">We didn’t -- We didn’t have a king, but this is another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Do -- How do you remember seeing Germans arrive into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: This was horrible.</span> <span id="s465">This was horrible.</span> <span id="s466">This is something where my -- I -- I really remember.</span> <span id="s467">I was sick, and -- and the news, I -- I -- I heard the news, by my mother, grandmother, paper, etcetera.</span> <span id="s468">And -- And we knew that it was somehow the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Can you -- Can you describe what happened on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: On the streets, nothing.</span> <span id="s471">More German soldiers.</span> <span id="s472">But they-they-they didn’t happen on the street, it happened everywhere.</span> <span id="s473">The street -- The street didn’t react, nobody reacted hor -- but the critical position of the new government was quite clear, and the extreme right government, with this prime minister, it was absolutely evident that they -- they will do what -- what the Germans command.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you have any face to face interactions with German soldiers?</span> <span id="s475">Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s477">No, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t speak German, and I -- I had no reason to speak to the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You know, I wonder if you could just describe what was going on.</span> <span id="s479">Did -- Did you stay in the -- the home for a little bit?</span> <span id="s480">Was -- Was your mom still going out to go to market?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: What ay -- ay --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Was your mother leaving the house to buy food at all, or what was going on in those first few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: A few days -- in the first days, nothing so it was March 19th, but they worked very, very quick, very fast.</span> <span id="s484">The main person in charge was Eichmann, and it went so fast that he -- within two weeks, the -- the yellow s-star was oblig -- oblig -- ob --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Obligatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Obligatory, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Can you tell us how you learned about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: By decree, the papers, radio, of the April 5th on.</span> <span id="s489">April 5th was the last day the school, the -- the year has been shortened, and then the --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: At this point, what are your mother and grandmother saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s492">They probably -- They manufactured the yellow stars for -- for the coat, for I don’t know whatever things, we had a couple of yellow stars.</span> <span id="s493">But without inscriptions, so not as in Holland Yud, or France Ju-Juif, nothing.</span> <span id="s494">It happened so quickly that probably they had no time to -- to manufacture the letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: A-Are there any preparations going on in the household of your -- is your mother hiding anything?</span> <span id="s496">Are you talking about the future in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: On the future, you know, I think was better not to notice, not to think on the future, and the events came -- the ones after the others, so we were -- we were very occupied, and it then appeared the -- the -- the menu of the whole thing, first that we had to go, end of May, in the Jewish house, the s -- with the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: T-Tell us what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Fr -- Fi -- In certain houses, you only had Jewish people, with a yellow star in-indicated th-the Jewish house, until June 6.</span> <span id="s500">June 6 is, you remember, the sh -- the -- the day of the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: C-C-Can I stop you before -- I’m wondering if you could tell me about leaving your home, your apartment, and going to the Jewish house, h-how did you know that you had to do it?</span> <span id="s502">How did you get there, what did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: By feet.</span> <span id="s504">So, we had no choice, we learned it by papers, posters, radio, and -- and it a -- it i -- it i -- it happened, so we had to follow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: But, can you describe the day that yo -- that you actually went?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I think it was May 30th, or -- and the -- the house was not too bad, the house was unfinished, but habit-habitable somehow, and of course, I don’t know how many -- how many square meter has been done to -- by -- by person, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s507">Later, two, but here, I -- I don’t know, so it was quite -- it was not -- not so horrible.</span> <span id="s508">But it did -- it had only a week -- e-existence of one week, until June the 6th, and the June -- June 6th we had to go, it was the first march, this was no-not the Death March, but something very lugubre , horrible, because you had to go to the -- to the brikfabrik, and the brikfabrik was the camp, on the railway, waiting the deportation.</span> <span id="s509">But we didn’t know, of course the deportation was coming, but we learned it in t -- on time.</span> <span id="s510">And we have been a c -- supervised by Hungarian gendarmes, and this was an only -- their only human moment, and a young man went to my -- say to my mother, and said, “Madame -- Madame, if something horrible will get you way -- you -- you arrive, it -- it -- it -- it will be our end as well,” said the Hungarian gendarme, a very nice man.</span> <span id="s511">And -- And during this march, we traversed th-the -- the whole town, and in every di -- tow -- in every door, people.</span> <span id="s512">Nobody said anything, nobody -- nobody said hullo -- hello, and nobody asked why.</span> <span id="s513">It was normal, it is the end, or the -- the transportation of Jews.</span> <span id="s514">Point.</span> <span id="s515">[indecipherable] to the brikfabrik, there we had two ques -- square -- square meters by -- by person, until June 14th.</span> <span id="s516">On June 14th, the train was there, and we had to -- to take this train, and this train went to Auschwitz, arrived June f -- 17th, in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s517">Beautiful weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Beautiful?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Weather, beautiful weather, blue skies, sunshine.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What had you been able to take with you on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Oh, whatever we wanted, luggage or whatever we wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: [inaudible] family?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Because they -- they perfectly knew, which we didn’t know, that whatever we -- we -- we’re carrying, it -- in a couple of days it has di -- completely disappear, and go there -- and goes right into Germany, and we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s526">We got -- We could take a luggage and sa -- bag or -- or whatever, but the -- and which we used in this brikfabrik.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did your mother pack anything particularly valuable fr-from the family house?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: [indecipherable] End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: -- stamp collection of my father, oriental rugs.</span> <span id="s531">I thou -- Everything remaining in ou -- in our original house.</span> <span id="s532">So we didn’t -- and -- and completely the pe -- nobody wanted to know about, and I think they were very surprised as I arrived, and I -- and I came back, and wanted to know what -- what remained.</span> <span id="s533">Of course, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Can -- Can you describe the days where you are at the brick factory, and you are waiting.</span> <span id="s535">D-Do you know what you’re waiting for at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s537">What we -- My mother had a -- a cousin, Oswa Endei, who worked in -- in -- in the univer -- university in Pécs, so the same place where my father made his studies the second time.</span> <span id="s538">And -- And she said to my mother, “Ilonka,” -- Ilona -- “if we survive this, then it will be good.”</span> <span id="s539">So she -- she had a very solid feelings of the -- various solid feelings of the end, and it happened she disappeared as well -- she was a marvelous person.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Had you -- you yourself, or perhaps your mother, had you heard anything besides what the rabbi had said about Jews being loaded and deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yes, so far that people from my town, wanting tha -- to take the train, have been arrested by the Hungarian police, before the deportation.</span> <span id="s542">And nobody -- nobody knew what happened.</span> <span id="s543">The day arrived a post -- a postcard from Am Waldsee, and Waldsee this is the Forest Lake, and Forest Lake was Auschwitz, which I learned later, because I -- I -- I had the same card in Auschwitz to -- to write home.</span> <span id="s544">It called Waldsee, so, you can imagine a -- a German sanitorium with the sun, and -- and -- and beautiful water.</span> <span id="s545">This a --This has been made with such a cynism, which is -- which were I think, which was at the ex -- at the same level as the -- as the -- the ki -- the killing organization.</span> <span id="s546">This is Waldsee, it -- c-called Waldsee, there is such a place, oh yes.</span> <span id="s547">So we knew that they disappeared, we didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s548">And we knew -- only -- only knew that it was Waldsee, but nobody -- nobody knew what is Waldsee, we learned it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: In the factory, did you have any -- ho -- what did you do for food and water?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: There was food and water.</span> <span id="s551">I don’t know -- I -- I -- I don’t know which kind of water we had 56 years ago.</span> <span id="s552">I -- I don’t know, but I -- but I -- I do know that we are no -- we are not -- we -- we are not starving.</span> <span id="s553">The problem was not this, the problem was this -- the -- it was very, very hot, and -- and -- and this is a very little place, very hot, and nobody knew what -- what -- what is happening.</span> <span id="s554">Of course, we had different informations that the -- the committee of I don’t know what decided, and the committee, and the -- the -- the -- the president of I don’t know, that the -- you know, in -- in -- in -- in such a situation, you have a lot of -- of news, gossips, and the fact was, was I -- that I -- what I’m telling you about the dis -- of couple -- a couple of days in the -- in the brick factory, we had the -- we had -- we -- we came this train, and 76 person -- no, no, 67 -- 67 persons were in one -- this car for -- for animals, locked and of course we -- during the -- the travel, the Germans tried to blackmail, and if -- y-yeah, you can get water, if you give -- if we -- we can get a -- a -- a gold watch.</span> <span id="s555">Or, you can get, I don’t know what, if.</span> <span id="s556">So -- And it has been known by the SS, [indecipherable] by the SS, because they know, they only knew -- they also knew that in Auschwitz, they d -- they -- they won’t get anything.</span> <span id="s557">They didn’t get anything, Auschwitz was a complete different organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: S-So, when you were in the train, and it’s locked, are your mother and grandmother with you, or were you s -- had you been separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, no, families were together, generations were together, and you can’t imagine, for instance, the -- the toilet situation between people of 10 weeks old, or 73 years.</span> <span id="s560">So -- So organizes with the -- with the towels, and I don’t know, this was ve-very, very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Do you remember any of your thoughts at that time, or conversations perhaps, with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">No.</span> <span id="s564">On there -- there -- you know, I o -- I wouldn’t say that I -- I was a child in the -- 15 is a little bit more, but I was always terribly interested by trains and bus.</span> <span id="s565">You know, it bi -- I wanted to become a bus driver, and -- and I -- for instance, I al-always wanted to go to a certain Hungarian town which I never seen, and -- and when -- when the -- this -- the train stopped in this ware -- in this -- this town, and behind the station there was a -- a tramway, I was very interested by the tramway, the color of the tramway in this town, and -- and I learned, for instance, the water, drink water in s -- Slovakia, which called pit nawoda, and I learned this word dur -- in this -- in this locked train, because it -- because it di -- it was also interesting.</span> <span id="s566">Or the -- in the blue light of trains, or of other trains, or all the -- in the -- the -- the kind of -- of running, it was -- it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s567">So, you -- you cannot consider it like a death march, pure -- pure death march, A, because we didn’t know it, B, because the life is so colored.</span> <span id="s568">And so if you -- if you -- if you -- if you are in a horrible situation, and you see something else, you hear a bird whistling, or what, so the -- you -- your attention is spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: C-Can you remember what it sounded like to be in that car?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: A car?</span> <span id="s571">A train.</span> <span id="s572">A train.</span> <span id="s573">But, of course, you’re right, because it was a train only of two axis and a -- and a -- an express train had Pullman cars, four axis, and -- and it -- it goes more smoothly than this two axis animals -- best -- an-animal trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: What about the people inside, were they quiet or noisy?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Oh, I think it was a mixture of -- of -- of sadness, history, fears -- well, you can imagine that 67 people during three days in such a car, I think there is -- it -- itself very disturbing, but it was not that bad, it -- later, because we -- in the -- we had -- we could eat before, and the starving period ex -- started later, and the deaths -- the deaths in this quantity, this -- this started much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Co-Could you sit down in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Sit down on what?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Or were you a -- were you standing or seated in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: [indecipherable] Well, of course we can sit down everywhere, so we -- th-they didn’t give beds and then the -- well, you know we had to -- we had to sit on -- on -- on the luggage, or -- or stand a little bit and sit down later on, so what you can, and what you can’t do if you are -- if -- if 67 persons are on co -- a couple of -- of square meters.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Can you describe arri -- your arrival at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s581">I mean, what does the train do, and how are you let out of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Jumping.</span> <span id="s583">Jumping.</span> <span id="s584">And men and women have been immediately separated, so I never -- I never s -- I never seen any more my mother.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t know what she wa -- what happened.</span> <span id="s586">I didn’t know, I ma -- of course I know.</span> <span id="s587">But, I went to the man, and -- and -- and we saw that the women went with the women.</span> <span id="s588">And I suppose that she didn’t want to leave alone her mother, and as I understood later, the doct -- Dr. Mengele, you know who he was, Dr. Mengele didn’t care if somebody wanted to die, he was much more nervous if he selected somebody for death, and -- and the [indecipherable] tried to -- to get out.</span> <span id="s589">This is -- So if he -- she wanted to follow her mother, okay.</span> <span id="s590">One -- One person more, or less.</span> <span id="s591">The first day was quite terrible, because -- at first because we didn’t know anything, and then we had to go to the -- to the -- to different places, disinfection, barber, shaving, the shower, and -- and this uniform, you know, this -- for prisoners, which went approximately.</span> <span id="s592">So we had a -- a jacket, pant, a h-hat -- hat, and shoes.</span> <span id="s593">Shoes, wooden shoes, with some textile, and -- but th -- but you are -- you were marching on the -- on the -- on the wood -- on -- on the wood.</span> <span id="s594">I -- This my -- One of my most horrible souvenir, the shoes, because of -- because of the death march, between January 18th and 21st, day and night, on the ice, and the snow.</span> <span id="s595">I think this was one of the most horrible points of -- of the -- of this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And in fac t, when you arrived here today in Washington, before this interview, we went to the museum, and you wanted to see a pair of those wooden shoes, and a -- I just wonder if you could explain why that that was so --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Because I went to the Shoah Museum in -- in Los Angeles, and -- and I was frightened by -- everything was very clean, and everything you know, in boxes.</span> <span id="s598">So if you go to a normal museum, and in the box you see a Rembrandt, or a Dürer, and here you said -- you f -- you saw, I think, My Kampf -- “Mein Kampf,” by Adolf Hitler, and -- and in another box was a shoe.</span> <span id="s599">And -- But the shoes, yo -- on ya -- on one hand, you cannot expl -- you cannot expl-explain what they were, and on the other hand, you should do it, because -- because shoes -- shoes is not very beautiful, but -- but your -- but si -- approximately 60 kilometers, so nearly 40 miles in these shoes, under those circumstances, in -- this is -- these -- something so horribly inhuman, and if you -- if you want to understand this -- this story of -- of Auschwitz, then you -- and this is one of the main points.</span> <span id="s600">So, you know, the whole thing is so that I’m sure that the time -- time will make its job and it -- and y -- if the -- the -- the exhibition of these objects is not convincing, [indecipherable] enough, in -- in -- in a couple of years, people will speak of these horrible things, as they mention today, the history of the three year -- th-thirty year war, 1618 and ’48, between Protestants and then Catholics.</span> <span id="s601">And everybody knows that it was horrible.</span> <span id="s602">A great German writer, Grimmelshausen, wrote a book calling Simplicissimus.</span> <span id="s603">S -- It means the most simple one.</span> <span id="s604">And if you read this book, this is not ma -- he is not better or worse than the deportation.</span> <span id="s605">I think the huma -- humanity always found fantastic things to -- to make suffer other people.</span> <span id="s606">Unfortunately, we had such a treatment, with much more perfection, weapons, and possibilities.</span> <span id="s607">Da -- In the times of Grimelhau -- Grimmelshausen, there was no gas, and they couldn’t kill as many people they wanted.</span> <span id="s608">But now, the technique was at a very high level, and the organization permitted to kill so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Do you remember when you -- how did you realize that people were being killed with gas at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s610">When and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: It’s not the gas, but the -- the -- the fire.</span> <span id="s612">Because the fire came out, and very often you heard a horrible -- you smelled something horrible, which was between burned meat and fat, and so which was in fact, a human body.</span> <span id="s613">And this -- it came out, this fine, black rain.</span> <span id="s614">So it -- it was n-no doubt that people have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Did people talk about it?</span> <span id="s616">The pr -- other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s618">In there we had nothing else to -- yes, we had, because the -- the food was very poor, a kind of artificial jam, and margarine, and we always -- we had a dream, this -- with the three, that after the war, when it will be finished, we will mix margarine with this kind of jam, and to eat it together.</span> <span id="s619">Never happened.</span> <span id="s620">They died, and I never did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s622">Are -- You’re saying that your friends were with you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay, where did you meet up with them, were they on the same train with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes, yes, of course, because they -- they were [indecipherable] they were from the same town, the same town had the same train.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Were they in the same car?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Were they in the same car?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, not necessary, in the same train.</span> <span id="s630">The train had I don’t know how many cars.</span> <span id="s631">So -- And -- And we -- we -- we met [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Do you remember where you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: After the shower.</span> <span id="s634">And where we meet together.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Were you in a -- Were all your towns -- Were all the townspeople from your town, the men, I guess, let me rephrase that.</span> <span id="s636">Were the men from your town housed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: What for the men?</span> <span id="s638">I don’t understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: When you were given bunks, were you housed with other men from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: [indecipherable] I think yes.</span> <span id="s641">I think yes, but it di -- di -- didn’t bother us, and no-not necessarily in the train.</span> <span id="s642">The train all -- all in Auschwitz we didn’t know about.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s644">So you met up with your friends, were you able to sleep in the same space?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I don’t remember if we slept in the same place.</span> <span id="s646">Maybe yes, or from time to time.</span> <span id="s647">Sleeping on the same place, it was very adventurous because we had nothing, no -- no beds, and absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s648">We had only a - how do you call the “planche”?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Mat?</span> <span id="s650">A plank?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, a plank.</span> <span id="s652">Not a plank, but planks.</span> <span id="s653">And on the planks, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t lay down, because y -- so many people, and no place.</span> <span id="s654">So it’s called this sitting -- marine sitting.</span> <span id="s655">You know what it is?</span> <span id="s656">It -- It -- I was sitting so, so the -- the two legs -- in between the two legs, another one.</span> <span id="s657">Between his legs another one.</span> <span id="s658">Six or seven persons, so -- and -- and so -- so if you -- it was -- I don’t know where it -- where it -- why it called marine sitting, or sitting à la marine, or I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s659">And the planks became more and more rare, because the commander of the -- al-also a prisoner, who distributed the food, has stolen a lot, and he needed something to make fire, so not only has he s -- stolen a part of the margarine and the -- and the -- and these things, but he has stolen also the planks, and the -- the -- as the planks were -- became more and more rare, and you -- you found yourself between two planks, it was very -- very dolorous.</span> <span id="s660">So -- So --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Very uncomfortable, not uncomfortable, really bad.</span> <span id="s663">And the situation was so that I -- I will try t-to show you something that you can describe.</span> <span id="s664">Wait a second, I -- it needs time.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: You’re taking off your shoe.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: And your sock.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Where is it?</span> <span id="s669">Right the -- I think it is here.</span> <span id="s670">Here, do you see it?</span> <span id="s671">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Yes, I see a deep scar, like a puncture wound almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Somebody -- Somebody -- Somebody went on my foot with his ho -- wooden shoes, and -- and in Auschwitz the situation was so, you have the -- the -- if you was -- if you were hurt a little bit, it couldn’t -- it -- it -- it couldn’t be healed, because of the -- of the -- of the extremely poor quality of the food.</span> <span id="s674">I had a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Oh, it wouldn’t heal.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: So it is just wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: How was your health in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: You know -- thank you -- it’s a good question.</span> <span id="s681">You know, as e -- I’m still here, I was quite resistant, but I was very surprised, it was quite -- oh, it was quite at the end of -- of this deportation time, I s -- found somewhere a piece of mirror, and I looked in the mirror, and I says how, that’s it, completely a kind of a -- a goat.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: A ghost?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No, a goat.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Oh, goat?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: A goat, a goat.</span> <span id="s686">And so I -- I was very surprised.</span> <span id="s687">Nothing, absolutely nothing on, just bones, and -- and is this very funny expression, not funny, but a very -- there’s a new expression in the eyes, with fears and -- and astonishment, and some kind of not understandable way ca -- for -- way of -- of looking.</span> <span id="s688">This is -- This was a sur -- a very big surprise.</span> <span id="s689">Well, the food is -- makes no sense, e -- I -- I think you -- you heard this several times.</span> <span id="s690">The food was always and everywhere the same, and the f -- there’s nothing to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Except for that you f -- you did remember dreaming about good food, that was something you thought about a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: No.</span> <span id="s693">I don’t think so, I -- i-it only concerned the margarine and jam.</span> <span id="s694">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s695">Like the b -- the bus driver shipule, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: At this point are you trying to find out about your mother?</span> <span id="s697">Are you trying to contact people on the women’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Contacts were not possible, so you --people leaving the camp to make work somewhere, and having met women, of course they sto -- th-the -- they so -- Mrs. So and So, and Mrs. So and So, but my mother never had been mentioned.</span> <span id="s699">And my mother, after the war, when different lists circulated in the camps, I never seen the name of my mother, so I -- I think the -- this -- my supposition is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Wh-Which is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Th-That she followed her mother, and -- and disappeared the same day.</span> <span id="s702">The day of the -- of the arrival.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Wh-What do you remember about the guards, and any contact you had with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Now, there are different forms --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: I think I’ll stop -- end of tape two.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: This is an interview with George Kadar, conducted by Katie Davis, on April 24th, in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s708">This is tape number three, side A. I was just asking you, at the end of that tape, about what you remember about the guards that guarded you, and also about interactions with Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: So, you were asking -- I -- I don’t know, 10 questions.</span> <span id="s710">It is -- It is not so easy.</span> <span id="s711">I think that the -- the social order of Auschwitz of the time -- of this time, was that of course the SS commanded, executed by a lot of horrible Polish people, absolutely horrible, and I don’t -- this is not a question of racism, because they had a position, and they were s -- horrible.</span> <span id="s712">Then, Gypsies, who had the right to -- to run with the -- with the -- stock, and -- not the stock, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: The livestock?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: The animals?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, with the baton, fr-from French, bâton.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: A baton?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: A baton, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s721">And then came the Jews at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Were the Gypsies Hungarian Gypsies?</span> <span id="s723">A: I don’t know, no matter.</span> <span id="s724">I remember of a scene I -- I went somewhere, between two barracks, and behind me, a Gypsy with a baton.</span> <span id="s725">And instead of avoiding me, he struck me on -- on my -- on my back, because he wa-want -- he wanted me to go out of his way.</span> <span id="s726">This was the Gypsy, later he died, very probably.</span> <span id="s727">Then came the Polish kapos, an absolutely horrible, horrible part of humanity.</span> <span id="s728">They had the right, for instance, to -- apparently, because they did it, to exchange people selected for the -- for the gas, because they knew somebody, or -- in the meantime, I profited somewhere of this attitude.</span> <span id="s729">And -- And then the -- the SS, it was -- the contact with the SS was not direct.</span> <span id="s730">The contact was every day, the so-called appelle, you know re -- what it is -- what it was.</span> <span id="s731">And -- And so, if -- if one person was missing, they had to start again, to count again, but it took hours, and you can imagine then, it happened to me, that th-the food was so horrible that I became a very gr-great diarrhea, and I couldn’t go out, because we had to stay there, and I -- I -- I had no solution, so it went.</span> <span id="s732">And very bad sign, flies were coming -- is wa -- by the way, flies were the only animals we saw, plus the SS dogs, but there was no butterfly, nothing, no birds, just flies.</span> <span id="s733">And -- And so i-i-i-it was a extreme -- extremely bad, the appelle, and the -- but this has been ordered by the SS.</span> <span id="s734">I -- What I don’t understand, the logic of the whole thing, because if somebody was missing, it was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only minus one, and -- and they had to find out where it -- where he was.</span> <span id="s735">So it -- it took time.</span> <span id="s736">The Jewish commanders, or the sous-commanders were also quite bad because -- because they -- they -- they regularly stole the -- the -- the food.</span> <span id="s737">You know, I had a couple of times, contact with Mengele, because he came several times to select.</span> <span id="s738">And the selections, which you know what it was, first the -- the cynism, because the first selection took place on September 15th, which was Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s739">The second for Yom Kippur, so they -- they apparently knew the Jewish calendar.</span> <span id="s740">And then I -- I think that nobody spoke of the smiling side of Mengele.</span> <span id="s741">Mengele could smile, and he selected the deaths smiling, with rapture, a little bit.</span> <span id="s742">And if somebody didn’t obey, then he became very angry.</span> <span id="s743">But he -- But otherwise, he was smiling, and -- to make this job.</span> <span id="s744">You know, there is something very perverse in the whole thing.</span> <span id="s745">For instance if the -- the Gauleiter, or I don’t know, the commander -- not commander, was something like that, commander -- I -- I -- I don’t know [indecipherable] the military, or [indecipherable] the man who -- Frank, a very, very famous and a horrible man of Hitler, who was the commander of Poland, after having finished his job, he went home to play Bach on the piano, because this is German culture.</span> <span id="s746">I could tell you something else, which is perhaps not a direct answer but the -- to understand this mentality, a -- a -- excuse me, but I -- I think I -- I will say it, if you don’t want it, leave it out.</span> <span id="s747">I had a -- I have a sister-in-law in Berlin, and we -- we went very often to Berlin, and I know a -- a -- a good friend in north Germany, who is a chor -- chorus -- choir -- choir conductor, and a man who -- with incredible knowledge.</span> <span id="s748">And his first wife, or the daughter of a lady who is living -- the lady lived in Bielefeld, and the daughter said, “You know, Paris and Berlin is so far.</span> <span id="s749">Go to my mother, the house is big, and you can -- you can take a rest -- a night.”</span> <span id="s750">And we did this several times.</span> <span id="s751">In 1977, when our si thi-third boy was born, I -- I examined the boy, of course, as a good father, and I considered that his ears were a little bit different of the other ears of the family.</span> <span id="s752">It wa -- He was born in September, and a couple of months later, we went to Christmas, to Berlin with this station, she -- Madame S..</span> <span id="s753">And do you know, after dinner, kinder -- the children went to bed, and after dinner nobody in Germany will sit down with a -- with white wine to gossip, and to [indecipherable] and on this day, Mrs. S. said, “You know, it was in the period with my -- my husband was in prison.”</span> <span id="s754">“Your husband in prison?</span> <span id="s755">How?”</span> <span id="s756">“My daughter never told you?”</span> <span id="s757">“No.”</span> <span id="s758">And, “He was in prison.”</span> <span id="s759">“Why?”</span> <span id="s760">“Because he was a very high SS officer, and his specialty was to examine Jewish n-noses and ears.”</span> <span id="s761">And Madame -- Madame S., when we arrived, I told her that this is very different from the others, and she examined very carefully the ears, but I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s762">And after dinner, I learned that not only her husband was a high officer for racism, but his brother as well.</span> <span id="s763">In the meantime, this friend and -- divorced.</span> <span id="s764">And it was 1988, I -- I made recordings in Israel, with the Israel symp -- Philharmonic Orchestra, and we called each other.</span> <span id="s765">“Now what di -- what -- what did you do the last time?”</span> <span id="s766">“Oh, I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s767">I went to do recording, I -- Mozart flute concertos.”</span> <span id="s768">“Oh, I know very well the Mozart flute concertos, because my -- my father-in-law played it very often.”</span> <span id="s769">“Who?”</span> <span id="s770">I said, “The -- The Nazi?”</span> <span id="s771">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s772">And he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s773">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s774">He called Martin, a very, very, very nice man.</span> <span id="s775">I said, “Martin, how is it possible to -- to -- to examine Jewish racism, and -- and -- and Mozart?”</span> <span id="s776">He answered with one word.</span> <span id="s777">“Deutsch.”</span> <span id="s778">German.</span> <span id="s779">So this Frank played Bach, they played Mozart, and in the meantime they killed millions.</span> <span id="s780">Isn’t it beautiful?</span> <span id="s781">Of course, it happened after the war, but the -- but I think that you -- you should examine all these problems in da -- in the -- it’s totality, and not -- not only the margarine in Auschwitz, because it was bad in then -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- and very little.</span> <span id="s782">But they -- the -- there is something more.</span> <span id="s783">Well, to come back to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: When Mengele came in to do a selection, did you have a strategy for not getting selected?</span> <span id="s785">Did you try to --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Of course, of course, because I had to -- I had to present me as a strong man, and in the first selection, I made a mistake, because we had twice five lines, and as he came in smiling, he selected only for the gas, but then he -- he had enough, because it was too long, and -- and had -- had not enough patience, and for the five others, he took -- he -- he made the contrary, he selected for life.</span> <span id="s787">And I yi -- And I remained, you know, in my place, to -- si -- thinking that it was the same matter, and then I went to the -- to the selecting -- to the selected barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: You were selected?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I -- I was selected, of course, I -- I -- I auto selected myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: In a very stupid way.</span> <span id="s792">And one of the Pistas is a -- was -- he was selected, and this is something else, something which you cannot reproduce, on a -- in a picture or describing, this is the -- the last days of young people waiting for the death.</span> <span id="s793">And there was a -- an -- an incredible ambiance, very slow, pianissimo everything.</span> <span id="s794">Nobody -- Nobody -- Nobody s-spoke loud.</span> <span id="s795">In the meantime, of course, we said yes, we will be transported, and we will make something light.</span> <span id="s796">But there was a b -- there was a big quantity of hi -- of prisoners, strong, who didn’t do anything at all.</span> <span id="s797">So, it was a same -- the same human reaction that Hungary will be an exception, that -- that it was inimaginable that they -- they choose the -- the -- the -- the -- the weak -- the weak prisoners to make something light, which means the others don’t do anything, so it -- it didn’t correspond to any logic, of course.</span> <span id="s798">Three tin -- days later, Mengele returns, and selects the selected, and I ra -- “Oh, you are healthy, come out.”</span> <span id="s799">And so Mengeles -- Mengele saved my life.</span> <span id="s800">So you know, so the second selection, it was more cynical, because with the second selection, plenty of -- of Polish prisoners arrived, Polish Jews from Polish ghettos, and they knew that -- the food was so bad that they all remained small, very small.</span> <span id="s801">And then they put I don’t know what it is, a kind of no -- I don’t know, I don’t know the n -- I don’t know what it is, so -- gymnastic, you can use it if you -- if you -- if you spring two -- two feet, three feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Oh, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: What is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Sort of barricades?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Ah yeah, a kind of barricade, and if you pass below, you are selected, because you are n -- you are not -- not -- not big enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Oh, so -- okay, so they -- they put some wooden bars, and if you pass below --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Bar, bar, bar --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: But this was -- this was the -- the highest degree of cynism, to let them starve, and because they were starving, and th -- and -- and remained small: out.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: How -- How was your mental health at this point?</span> <span id="s811">What -- How were you staying strong, inside your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: This a bad question, I cannot answer, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s813">I don’t know, it happened.</span> <span id="s814">I don’t -- I really don’t know, because I had the same -- the same food, and -- and everything the same, so it’s -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: W-Was there anything that you were able to do that allowed you to at least mentally escape, with your friends, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No, I really d -- I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s817">I -- I don’t know, and finally nobody escaped.</span> <span id="s818">You have to -- Did you -- Did you read sri -- Primo Levi?</span> <span id="s819">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: So, his descriptions is goo -- are correct.</span> <span id="s822">And if you want -- If anybody want to understand the -- the human side of -- of the concentration camp, [“it’s just a cramp” George telling Katie about a cramp somewhere] camp, then this is the -- this is the literature number one, from an absolutely honest man who by chance, is a great -- a great writer, and who -- whose view is so interesting, and so diverse, and so colored.</span> <span id="s823">So this is -- whether -- whether -- whether “he is still a man”, or something like this is the title, se questo un uomo, in Italian.</span> <span id="s824">And I don’t know the answer.</span> <span id="s825">I don’t know the answer, if -- if he remained a man or not completely, or just a little bit.</span> <span id="s826">I don’t -- this is your question, but I can’t answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What did you do all day?</span> <span id="s828">At this point in Auschwitz, are you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s830">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s831">We -- We played mil.</span> <span id="s832">It’s a -- a play.</span> <span id="s833">We can -- We couldn’t -- Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s834">We had to stor -- stand up very early, either five or six o’clock, for no reason, and then came this so-called breakfast, which was some coffee or tea, but anyway the same taste.</span> <span id="s835">And we could use it to wash our face, and then waiting time, lunch came between 10 and one, and supper, approximately six o’clock.</span> <span id="s836">But I -- I -- I don’t want to come back, because you -- you -- you’ve heard several times how we ate, so I -- I think it -- it -- there’s no interest, to repeat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Can you tell us, were you tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s839">Oh, yes I shall show you.</span> <span id="s840">Yes.</span> <span id="s841">But don’t ask if it means [indecipherable] I don’t know.</span> <span id="s842">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s843">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And the number is?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: The number, B -- B14715.</span> <span id="s846">But I don’t know why in December, ’44, re -- and why not before, and why not after.</span> <span id="s847">I don’t know the significance, and very logical German explanation, that a couple of weeks after, we landed in Dora, which was another concentration camp in Thüringen, and we became completely other numbers.</span> <span id="s848">So nobody cared off.</span> <span id="s849">Here I had a number, and I had another one here.</span> <span id="s850">So, don’t ask, because it is -- it is terrible, so they -- the lack of logic is terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Ha-Have you ever considered having it removed?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: No.</span> <span id="s853">No.</span> <span id="s854">Why?</span> <span id="s855">It is so beautiful, and I -- and this is something that you really -- which -- which is an excellent thing to -- to remember.</span> <span id="s856">Well, I -- I could remember without, but is very aggressive it is -- is pertinent.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: What -- When you were in Auschwitz, were -- were there any ways that you had sort of clandestine cultural activities, maybe telling stories, or singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s859">No, no.</span> <span id="s860">No, really, it was a year lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: What did it sound like to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Sound?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What did it sound like?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Now, I t-told you there was no birds, and -- and nothing, so is a kind of desert.</span> <span id="s865">You ca -- I were -- Imagine a concentration camp in -- in Arizona, what does it sound.</span> <span id="s866">Cactus.</span> <span id="s867">There were -- There are no cactus there, nothing.</span> <span id="s868">Nothing, really nothing, so it was in the -- there’s a Hungarian word, like the back of God.</span> <span id="s869">It is -- It -- It is behind the back of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: That’s a good expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Isn’t bad.</span> <span id="s872">The expression is good--</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: I mean it’s -- it’s -- it’s a good expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s876">And -- And this is another sense, but what -- what did it smell like?</span> <span id="s877">You were all so cramped together.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Well, from time to time this -- this black rain.</span> <span id="s879">And we had a soap also, and I don’t know, because I ha -- I have been told the soap has been prepared with human bodies, of a certain parts of human -- human bodies, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s880">Maybe.</span> <span id="s881">Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Di-Did you ever pray, or thing about God, at -- when you were in Auschwitz, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s884">But there was a split between Orthodox and Neologues because we accused each other to be there, because the ones of the pius pe’ot, and -- and Yiddish, and all these Jewish appearances.</span> <span id="s885">Meanwhile, they said that we were not religious enough, and now this is the punishment of God.</span> <span id="s886">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s887">I’m sure that I was in the same camp as Elie Wiesel, but we didn’t -- we didn’t know each other, and nobody knew that in this camp was somebody later noble.</span> <span id="s888">So, this we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s889">But he -- he was deported from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Was anyone who was in a position of power over you, a kapo, or an SS man, or even a Gypsy, was anyone ever kind to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: No.</span> <span id="s892">No, and finally relationship with these persons, human relationships couldn’t exist.</span> <span id="s893">Could exist between -- between other p -- other people, and I like to -- I’d like to, if you -- if you agree, I -- I like to -- to speak of a couple of people who -- who were really excellent, particularly doctors, Hungarian or German doctors.</span> <span id="s894">For instance, there was a hospital, which is a -- which was a barrack, of course, but in this hospital, he knew that the selection will start in the camp, and the next day in the hospital, and he told me, today you come to the hospital, you are sick, and tomorrow, I -- you are -- you’ll go out.</span> <span id="s895">So, meanwhile, the selection, I was not available, because in the hospital.</span> <span id="s896">And for the -- the selection in the hospital, I was -- I was out.</span> <span id="s897">So, there were a lot of excellent people di -- the, di -- the -- during the --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: During the long march -- the long -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: During the march, I -- in the shoes, a German prisoner, I think it was a German Communist, who -- there was a kind of -- of -- of -- not an -- not an alto, but something which is a kind of a coach, and he gave me, during the longest hour -- long hours, place in the interior of this coach, which I -- this wa -- not -- not only that I didn’t march, but I -- I -- I -- I didn’t -- I -- I -- I wasn’t si -- not frozen any more.</span> <span id="s903">So they were excellent people, and as far -- I -- I -- I want to jump a little bit.</span> <span id="s904">After the liberation, Bergen-Belsen, I was together with a German Communist and two German, y -- Witness of Jehovah, who --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Mm-hm, Jehovah’s Witness?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Jehovah’s Witness, yes.</span> <span id="s907">The situation was telle, that a writer, as Dürrenmatt for instance, should have written a piece.</span> <span id="s908">You can’t imagine German Communists, resistant number one, German Jehovah’s Witnesses, who didn’t fight because they do -- be-because they -- they don’t fight, and a Hungarian Jew, 16 year old, and all this conversation, because they accused each other, of course, because the -- the Communist said that there is nothing, what you are doing, and they were -- they were convinced if they refuse -- refuse to say Heil, Hitler, because Heil only concerns Jesus, and not Hitler, and because they didn’t want to -- to take -- to -- to -- to take weapons in their hand, in either hand, they -- so as it was -- it -- it was not a serious resistance.</span> <span id="s909">They -- They didn’t kill anybody, and they wouldn’t ha -- they wouldn’t have killed anybody, so it wa -- in no danger, but they have been in -- closed down, and the Hungarian Jewish -- Jewish boy, 16 year old, knowing little of the world, having lost his parents, and with these three other men, there’s -- the Jehovah’s Witnesses were fantastic.</span> <span id="s910">You -- You -- This is something which is -- there -- which I -- I -- I really cannot forget, that in these very hard times, when we recognized after all that, what happened, and what have you -- what it lost, who is lost.</span> <span id="s911">And I -- I went with Villy, I think he called, Villy, one of both, went out to collect blackberries.</span> <span id="s912">So, what a contradiction.</span> <span id="s913">Well, I -- I’d like to tell you about Solveig.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Solveig?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s916">Grieg Solveig’s Lied, the -- the chant -- -- the chanson of Solveig.</span> <span id="s917">You do with -- You do with it what you want, but I think this is a special -- very special thing.</span> <span id="s918">At the end of Auschwitz, you can read in this -- in Levi, Primo Levi, that the Germans didn’t realize that the war was in Auschwitz for -- before Auschwitz, and a British plane [indecipherable] it went around -- he wanted to open a -- a factory, on February first.</span> <span id="s919">They did everything to open the factory, so they -- the prisoners organized cultural evening for the 21st of January, Sunday.</span> <span id="s920">And one week before, I arrived from Auschwitz to Fürstengrube, wich is a coal mine, and I don’t know why, but I arrived, and the first day I was in the mine, it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s921">These small electric trains -- it’s the trains again, you know -- and this activity, it was absolutely fantastic.</span> <span id="s922">But I said that I was a musician.</span> <span id="s923">“Oh, you are a musician, yes, so you can -- you can clean the -- the room -- the music room.”</span> <span id="s924">I did it, and we started to repeat the Solveig’s Lied by Grieg, you do remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: [indecipherable] verse?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Da de de de de de de [sings].</span> <span id="s927">Do you know it?</span> <span id="s928">And we started to rehearse, and this is something which I -- this is a -- a question of me, and I never will have the answer, because I wanted to know who should be -- who should have been the public.</span> <span id="s929">SS people, with or without wives and dogs.</span> <span id="s930">How th-the room should be arranged, and -- and anyway, how was such a -- such a cultural evening?</span> <span id="s931">I didn’t -- I never her -- I n -- I never knew it because three days before, the 18th, started this death march, and so I lost it completely from my -- from my life, from my life.</span> <span id="s932">You know, this is the same.</span> <span id="s933">One day I was in ams -- and in Den Haag, in the Mauritshuis, where is a fantastic painting of Rembrandt, the painter, th-the person is Homer.</span> <span id="s934">And suddenly arrives a Hungarian group, four persons, and apparently one who led the whole -- the whole group.</span> <span id="s935">And the lady asked, “Ah, could you tell me who is this man?”</span> <span id="s936">And he said, “Oh, very probably a --an old Jew.”</span> <span id="s937">And I couldn’t bring out this gentleman, this is not an old Jew, this is an old Greek, and -- and [indecipherable] these is the -- the same human problem, something which I -- which is -- which is lost for the vie -- for the life.</span> <span id="s938">Well, just for -- in brackets.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Just for chronology, so you were transported to F-F-Firstenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Fürstengrube.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Firstengruberg.</span> <span id="s942">And then, very quickly, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Very quickly to Gleiwitz by this march.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: So look, s-so maybe you can tell us --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Date by date?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: -- about the march, a little bit about the mar -- I mean, more than a little bit, cause it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s948">January 18, Death March.</span> <span id="s949">21st, arrival and start by train from Gleiwitz to Nordhausen Dora -- lager dora.</span> <span id="s950">28th, arrival in Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s951">I, right away ra -- you -- you know that we have been transported by -- in -- in January, in opened coal cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: H-H-How are you able to remember the dates so well?</span> <span id="s953">Didn’t things get fuzzy when you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No, I can -- I can -- I can give you other dates.</span> <span id="s955">So if you -- if -- if you -- if you ask me, my profession obliged me to learn dates, and I learned dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Can you describe what you were told when we you were taken on the beginning of this march, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s958">Nothing, really nothing.</span> <span id="s959">So just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Were your friends with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Were your friends with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: No, he was dead, because he -- he -- he -- he disappeared, th-the second Steve disappeared in the second selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Oh, you -- can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: So, he wa -- he wa -- he was not more available.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Was this the selection that you escaped through the Hungarian doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No, no, no, no, no, the wa -- the Hungarian doctor was the third selection, and the -- and the -- he u -- he u -- went with the second selection, and the Steve one, the first Steve, went with the first selection, so we -- we were together for a moment in this barrack, during -- I selected myself, and many others told me that you are healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: But not your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: No.</span> <span id="s970">No, no, these -- he was my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: No, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: -- but he didn’t say that he was healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No, no, he was not -- he was not very famous as a -- caza -- his body was not very strong, but in -- in norm -- in normal life, he never was so healthy and strong as he could have been.</span> <span id="s975">Of course, he -- he became -- he became much worse in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: So by now you’ve lost both of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s979">And can you describe what the march was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: So the march was what it -- what it was, it’s not about how the march was like -- I never seen such a march, other -- so -- like, this is -- this is not the word.</span> <span id="s981">So, the march was one of the -- of the deepest point of -- of -- of human misery, and not comparable to any other phenomenon.</span> <span id="s982">Perhaps in Cambodia, perhaps Pol Pot, or something like that, but in normal life I think this is -- this is -- this is really a -- a Première.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Were people collapsing during the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: I think yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: How did you keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Also -- First, I have been -- he and I have been helped by this man, but not the whole time, he couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s987">And -- And so I -- I made a great part of this march with -- in the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Speaking about the shoes, and we were talking earlier that you really wanted to see them, have you seen a pair since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Here not.</span> <span id="s990">I went to the Shoah Museum in Los Angeles, but I told you.</span> <span id="s991">And I think that this is the comment, and the exposition of this whole thing, too smooth, too delicate for this -- for this horror, which has been represented by the shoes.</span> <span id="s992">So therefore, I think that what we are doing -- what you are doing, I am doing now, is finally, this is hopeless, and th-th -- it is not -- because I cannot tell you -- you -- you ask what was it like.</span> <span id="s993">The question is -- has been made in such a way that I understand that you will -- you cannot imagine what it was.</span> <span id="s994">In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know -- I know no human being capable of imagining such a horror.</span> <span id="s995">So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level, you know.</span> <span id="s996">So this experience is not transferable.</span> <span id="s997">I made this experience, and now I -- it belongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of life.</span> <span id="s998">But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find two hundred actors, and to -- to lock them, and let them lose the weight.</span> <span id="s999">So this -- you can’t -- you cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1000">So if you can’t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the reality.</span> <span id="s1001">So this is not feasible.</span> <span id="s1002">Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went into the camp, but I d -- I don’t wish you to go there, so these a -- it’s an initial contradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to live with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum, this is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death, and the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it’s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16.</span> <span id="s1003">It’s horrible to die, to -- I -- I knew a lady whose child, I don’t know, three or four weeks old, have been -- have -- have -- have been taken away and killed, and not the lady.</span> <span id="s1004">And the lady came back from the camp during this -- during her entire life, hi -- she lived with this -- with this dead baby.</span> <span id="s1005">So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you, and you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it’s still a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1006">So this is not imaginable, you -- you are -- you are asking concrete questions, and this is okay, but as I am not -- you -- you see that I was not able to ex -- to -- to -- to speak of the ambiance of the selected, because -- because it is -- it is -- it is horrible.</span> <span id="s1007">Imagine 200 people in a -- in America, waiting on the electric chair together.</span> <span id="s1008">What will they say?</span> <span id="s1009">Who would cry, who would shout?</span> <span id="s1010">So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: I think you just said a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: So that’s it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1014">I’m just saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: -- who did it is Primo Levi, but there’s no more Primo Levi.</span> <span id="s1016">Well, I think I could go at six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: What time is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: At the end of the march, how -- what kind of state were you in physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Ho, I cannot describe you.</span> <span id="s1021">We have been sent to a building, completely dark, and from this building, of course by feet to the gare -- to the -- to the s -- railway station.</span> <span id="s1022">Once more, I remember of the tramway in Gleiwitz, and I was very interested by this tramway, and the whole atmosphere, because i -- the ga -- the war was before Gleiwitz, and the people -- people wanted to go away.</span> <span id="s1023">So it was a s -- fantastic movement in the -- in the -- in the town, to -- to -- to escape, not -- not only the -- not prisoners, but normal civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: S-So you were in Gleiwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And you’re saying that there’s a sense that the -- the -- the -- that there’s a lot of movement, and -- and -- and really maybe that the war is winding down, or -- or going to peak, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1029">D-Did you begin to start imagining that you might be liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Not there.</span> <span id="s1031">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1032">Of course, everybody li -- to liber -- to be liberated was a dream, but we didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s1033">And what the Germans did, it was -- it made no sense to transport Jewish prisoners, and to lose the war.</span> <span id="s1034">To -- To use the rail for -- to transport people somewhere, I didn’t -- I didn’t know exactly where and how, between Gleiwitz and Dora Nordhausen, I think his number is five -- five hours of driving, and we did it in one week, in this open -- opened, coal cars.</span> <span id="s1035">It made no sense, so they paralyzed for one week, a train, the rails, and whatever, to transport us, and they did the same two month later to transport to Bergen-Belsen on April -- we arrive on April 10th, and the British army, the 15th.</span> <span id="s1036">So it made no sense to send ou -- to send somebody from the Americans, who they -- this was the American territory, I think well we’re -- where we were last time were, to the British territory.</span> <span id="s1037">It made no sense.</span> <span id="s1038">So what is the advantage to be liberated by the British instead of the Americans?</span> <span id="s1039">So -- Or -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Can you describe the moment of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1042">Th-The German there, the -- the Hakenkreuz has been put by -- put down, but you know, I was in a very bad, then I was in very bad health, and a couple of days are missing, so you know that I remember of the days, a couple of days are missing, because very probably I was in a kind of coma, and instead of -- I -- I -- I didn’t die, a had a big chance, because on perhaps the 10th or the 11th of May, I asked a -- a ge -- a German soldier, who became prisoner in the meantime, “How about the war?”</span> <span id="s1043">And he said, “The war?</span> <span id="s1044">The war is finished.”</span> <span id="s1045">And then I understood that I felt out for a -- a good couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: S-So you don’t remember the British soldiers coming in, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yes, the British soldiers coming in, yes, but it happened later.</span> <span id="s1048">The British soldiers came on April 15th, the end of the war on May eighth, and the -- and for me the 10th or 11th, so something is miss -- something was missing, and then I gi -- went out and met people, they said, “Oh, you are still alive.”</span> <span id="s1049">We didn’t -- We -- We didn’t think that he -- we are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: What was that like when the -- can you just describe what it was like when the British soldiers came in to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes, I think this is the Hakenkreuz, and the fact that we realized that it is finished, that this was finished, but the health was bad.</span> <span id="s1052">So the liberty was there, but the British -- not the British, nobody -- nobody knew how to handle th-this kind of -- of -- of -- of living -- living death people, so you can imagine that i -- I -- if -- if you lose 50 percent of your weight, approximately, how do you want to oblige your stomach and your body to work?</span> <span id="s1053">You couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1054">And they gave fat and meat, and -- and plenty of things, they -- they gave what they had, but what they -- what they -- but what they di -- they didn’t, couldn’t resolve, this -- this -- the -- the -- the health situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: What was wrong with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: I thi -- I think that I had typhus, I think, because the typhus is provoked by -- what’s the name of this small --</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Mosquito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1059">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1060">Very small insects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: An ant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Hm?</span> <span id="s1063">I -- I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Oh, tick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Y -- No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Lice.</span> <span id="s1069">In the hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1073">And I didn’t realize, because I -- in Bergen – Dora, we were working -- I was really working on the weapon miracle of Hitler, the V1 – V2.</span> <span id="s1074">And I -- I wore these glass bands, glass tapes, and of course i-it provoked my -- my [indecipherable.</span> <span id="s1075">And I didn’t -- I didn’t realize that the position between the glass and the -- and the insects.</span> <span id="s1076">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1077">I -- Imagine one sh -- one shirt you had 200 - 300.</span> <span id="s1078">Well -- Well, so I think we could continue this conversation eternally.</span> <span id="s1079">I think the most important thing is that I don’t know if the Jewish are really the chosen people, maybe.</span> <span id="s1080">If it is -- If it is so, our experience concerns the huma -- hu -- the entire humanity.</span> <span id="s1081">This is not only a Jewish problem, because people are very inventive, and new methods of killing will arrive.</span> <span id="s1082">And I think that -- that we cannot be -- we cannot agree with Serge Klarsfeld, you know him, a very important journalist, and -- and especially of Holocaust and the -- and war criminals.</span> <span id="s1083">I met him once in the air -- the air -- at the airport, and I told him who I was, that I was also in a concentration camp, etcetera, and I see -- and I ask him, what do you think, w-wouldn’t it be better to -- to try to share this experience with other people having the same conditions, or similar conditions?</span> <span id="s1084">And he said, “They have to find th-the right solution.</span> <span id="s1085">This is our problem now.”</span> <span id="s1086">And I think not -- I don’t think that is our problem.</span> <span id="s1087">I think that is of course our -- our problem, but if such a horror arrives to a -- to a people, and you see that something similar, and more cynical arrived in Cambodia when the -- the head of the state started to kill his own population, and -- and you -- we -- we see everywhere where we -- in hoot -- in Bu-Burundi, and the hoot -- Tutsies and Hutus and -- and the -- Kosovo, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1088">So I think that this experience should be -- must be strong enough to go over -- to let understand by other people, that these experience should serve to somehow -- somehow to immunize hum -- huma -- the whole humanity, to -- to try to think before they -- they s -- they start such horrors.</span> <span id="s1089">I think this is -- this must be the message of everybody having survived this -- this horrible period of ya -- of -- of human history.</span> <span id="s1090">Thank you very much, thank you for your patience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: End of third tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Conclusion of Interview Note from interviewee’s
