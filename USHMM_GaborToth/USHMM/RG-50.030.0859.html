around.</span> <span id="s2062">But some people are terrible, when they were hungry, they’re in pain.</span> <span id="s2063">It’s painful to be hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2065">So he would talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: He would talk about how he saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A:

<p><span id="s2072">A: He got typhus, he went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2073">They gave him a ice cold water to take a bath first.</span> <span id="s2074">We won’t go to the bath before you don’t take a bath.</span> <span id="s2075">He was there a few days.</span> <span id="s2076">He was there a few days, and then they took him back by open buggy, horse and – horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s2077">They didn’t have cars.</span> <span id="s2078">He had the water –</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Let’s cut.</span> <span id="s2080">[break] Okay, so he had typhus, and it was under those conditions that he was taken to a place to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: [indecipherable] back where he was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: And then he decided, I won’t survive, I won’t survive here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: So when he – she gave him the – the papers –</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Now why would she have given him these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: He’s – because, he said, he liked me.</span> <span id="s2090">He was joking.</span> <span id="s2091">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s2092">It was dangerous for her to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: So she was like a camp commandant, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yeah, something er – a working person that cou – that could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: You see, one of the reasons I ask is because when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, of course they weren’t friend any more, you know, after that attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And – and the Polish government in exile negotiated with Stalin that the Poles who are – the Polish – the Poles and the Polish citizens who are in Soviet custody in camps and prisons and labor camps all over the country, can be released.</span> <span id="s2098">And they were released, throughout 1940 – late ’41, ’42.</span> <span id="s2099">So it was throughout this time.</span> <span id="s2100">And I’m wondering whether or not –</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: I never her – I never heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Never heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: They were – yeah, they were released –</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: No.</span> <span id="s2108">There were a lot –</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: – now – there were a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: A lot of those labor camps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2112">And some made their way – some were able to leave the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2113">So I’m wondering whether or not this permission that she gave to him, had anything to do with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2116">It was personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: It was personal, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2120">No, it has nothing to do –</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: So she gave him papers, and what did he do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: He wanted to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: He went to Asia – Asia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Asia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Asia.</span> <span id="s2127">Yeah, he went to

<span id="s2143">So they gave him food.</span> <span id="s2144">They gave him cheese, they gave him some – some food.</span> <span id="s2145">Then, I think he didn’t have this – those papers expire,

train, and asking for papers.</span> <span id="s2149">Papers, papers, and he didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2150">So he said to the woman, I gonna hold on – or the woman told him, you go – can you hold on outside the w – the wed – the train, on the window, outside the window, and I’m going to stay back to the window, cover you.</span> <span id="s2151">I don’t know, one woman, or two women were there.</span> <span id="s2152">And that’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s2153">He wa – he came out the – the train, holding on –</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

again.</span> <span id="s2165">He didn’t know – I didn’t know what – he didn’t have any – anything to go by which way to go, where to go.</span> <span id="s2166">He was going, he was walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Do you know some of the places that he traveled through as he was – a-after he left this camp?</span> <span id="s2168">Do – you know, you say it’s Russian Asia, but what would be the place names?</span> <span id="s2169">Did he mention this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: It – was it to Tushkant(ph)?</span> <span id="s2171">Yeah, he went to
