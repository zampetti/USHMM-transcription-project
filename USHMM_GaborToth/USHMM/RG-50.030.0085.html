I may as well move right into Shanghai - I ended up in Shanghai, not thinking there were any Jews at all.</span> <span id="s16">What would Jews be doing in Shanghai, China?</span> <span id="s17">.</span> <span id="s18">I announced to my men that we're going to celebrate at least the service of victory, we were going to celebrate the first service of freedom, and we had just...</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s20">I need to back up for one minute, because I need people to understand a little bit.</span> <span id="s21">Uh, can you tell us - you came with a group of men and this would be ...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: This group that we, I was part of The Flying Tigers.</span> <span id="s23">The Flying Tigers were that part of the Air Force which dedicated itself to General Chenault (ph) to help him in winning the war in China.</span> <span id="s24">And I was part of the Flying Tigers.</span> <span id="s25">And when I, and after the war I did, I was invited to Peking where at the palace I was given a palace for the weekend.</span> <span id="s26">Three of us were chosen as the symbols to show that this, that we had won this war, and I was given with them, with the with the navigator who knocked down forty-eight planes or something, uh uh I mean a pilot, a bombardier, whatever it was, three of us were given the Chinese Medal of Honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">And I value that because I found out that nobody else every got the Chinese Medal of Honor.</span> <span id="s28">But that was for being in an American serving in the Flying Tigers and in the 14th Air Force and doing my work in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How did you get to go to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Really by orders.</span> <span id="s31">They they wanted a chaplain and they wanted a Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s32">They look around and they see where there is no Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s33">They wanted me to come there.</span> <span id="s34">So I came to be the chaplain and I announced immediately after I got there when when we had won the war, I felt that we should celebrate the winning of the war, and we took a very big building - I think I have a picture of it - and we got the various groups together and I sent buses to pick up my men and a lot of non-Jews wanted to come.</span> <span id="s35">Everybody wanted to come to celebrate the victory.</span> <span id="s36">So I took the largest place I could.</span> <span id="s37">I knew this would happen.</span> <span id="s38">And I come to into the building, and I see youngsters there and they look little Nazis - blond hair, blue eyes, and they talked with heavy German accents.</span> <span id="s39">I couldn't believe what I saw.</span> <span id="s40">What were they doing here?</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">Why would German kids come to my service?</span> <span id="s43">.</span> <span id="s44">I finally found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">These kids were from the ghetto and they came with other men and women - walked eight miles from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s46">They had no way of getting there.</span> <span id="s47">How they got there I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">How they knew that we were having this service I don't know.</span> <span id="s49">But there they were.</span> <span id="s50">A whole group and my men are standing around - they hardly had a place to sit.</span> <span id="s51">They were standing all over the place.</span> <span id="s52">We start the service.</span> <span id="s53">It was cold.</span> <span id="s54">Children whom we didn't know, looked like little Nazis, spoke with heavy German accents, little English. . . . . . . . (ph) and my men standing around - what did I do to them?</span> <span id="s55">.</span> <span id="s56">And as I said now we shall turn and sing "Shma.</span> <span id="s57">Israel."</span> <span id="s58">.</span> <span id="s59">"Hear oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord....".</span> <span id="s60">As I turned to Shma Israel, the kids looked up.</span> <span id="s61">Hey, these are Jews.</span> <span id="s62">The soldiers looked down and saw the kids singing Shma Israel, so with Shma Israel, "Hear oh God the Lord our God, the Lord is one," the whole room became one and the soldiers start pointing to the men and the soldiers melted into the crowd and suddenly I saw kids on soldiers' laps.</span> <span id="s63">The whole thing became one magnificent beautiful service of victory.</span> <span id="s64">And when it was over I turned to to to the, who are you?</span> <span id="s65">.</span> <span id="s66">So they invited me to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s67">So I have a picture here of me the next week.</span> <span id="s68">I'm in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s69">And from the ghetto I found out that these children attend schools.</span> <span id="s70">So then I went, after conducting a sabbath service, which was very unusual - they would never have taken a non- orthodox rabbi to conduct - they didn't even know.</span> <span id="s71">They just know I was a chaplain so they didn't bother uh you know - today's world you wouldn't have an orthodox, a conservative rabbi conducting uh an orthodox uh sabbath morning service.</span> <span id="s72">This is what I did and they were so pleased and that Bar Mitzvah boy was so wonderful, and and the family ...</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Back-up.</span> <span id="s74">What Bar Mitzvah boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: A kid from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s76">A youngster who was turning thirteen and it it was just a delight because a Saturday morning what does he have to do for bar mitzvah - not the speech.</span> <span id="s77">He gives a portion of the Talmud - he gives a portion where he asks an impossible question, and I myself said to myself, what is the answer to that question.</span> <span id="s78">Then he answers it on the spot.</span> <span id="s79">And while he's answering, he's thinking.</span> <span id="s80">He's going na-na-na, and then he gets stuck because he's a little stuck in his own thought.</span> <span id="s81">As he gets stuck, the whole congregation sings ya-ba- bam, ya-ba-bam, ya-ba-bam.</span> <span id="s82">Then he raises his hand.</span> <span id="s83">He's got it.</span> <span id="s84">They stop on a dime.</span> <span id="s85">He continues na-da-da.</span> <span id="s86">Whenever he gets stuck they sing and then they, he carried through with this dissertation of one hour on an impossible subject with an impossible question at the age of thirteen.</span> <span id="s87">I was visibly impressed that this is the way they celebrate a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s88">And then I went to the schools the next day.</span> <span id="s89">They invited me to school.</span> <span id="s90">And I went to the juniors and seniors in high school because they already had learned English.</span> <span id="s91">They were studying English.</span> <span id="s92">And I decided to have them write a composition and the composition is "Home Is Where Your Heart Is."</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">I said where is your home?</span> <span id="s95">.</span> <span id="s96">Where is your heart now that you've come from all over the world?</span> <span id="s97">.</span> <span id="s98">And how thrilling it was to have youngsters who had never heard of Israel but now they say we don't want to go back any place, any place.</span> <span id="s99">We want to go place to a land that we can call our own and the only land in the world that we would trust today would be Israel.</span> <span id="s100">So the 90%, then 10% of course said they'd like to go to America, so they were there.</span> <span id="s101">But I have used some of their original, their letters to quote from them to show of this universal love that they had to go to a homeland, to Israel.</span> <span id="s102">Now here we are in China, and I don't know how - what you want to continue in here, but I have...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Let let me let ask you if I could a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s104">Can you describe for me uh the Jewish ghetto in Shanghai as you found it?</span> <span id="s105">.</span> <span id="s106">You have given me two incidents but after the service and after the bar mitzvah, uh you learned about the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s107">Tell me what you learned?</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">What what how was it structured?</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">What had people done?</span> <span id="s112">.</span> <span id="s113">That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well, the Jewish community of Shanghai which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war, the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their Shanghai ghetto...well first of all, how did we become a ghetto?</span> <span id="s115">.</span> <span id="s116">How did it become a ghetto?</span> <span id="s117">.</span> <span id="s118">The Japanese became very friendly with Nazis, and they didn't want to be outdone when they heard what Hitler was doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s119">The Jews were living very peacefully in China and in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s120">But as they came and conquered Shanghai they decided that they must follow and imitate uh the Nazi empire.</span> <span id="s121">Otherwise they wouldn't be uh good allies, so they immediately started to introduce some of the customs that were prevalent in Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s122">They immediately said, here, you Jews have to be within the scope of this. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s123">.</span> <span id="s124">.</span> <span id="s125">(PH) settlement so to speak.</span> <span id="s126">This is where you have to be.</span> <span id="s127">You have certain hours you can't go out.</span> <span id="s128">This is where you will be.</span> <span id="s129">Your schools will be here, and they made a complete and they actually had uh I I don't know, I remember some of the kids saying they had badges which after the war they ripped off, and had all kinds of symbols to remind them that they are Jews, that they are Jews.</span> <span id="s130">That they are different from all other people and this was the stigmata that that the Japanese carried over merely to ape uh Hitler's concept of what should be, this image of the Jew to the world.</span> <span id="s131">And this is what they tried to imitate in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s132">But the the Joint Distribution Committee came in immediately with food and with equipment and I was amongst the first that was standing there and I have a picture with me with little children where we're giving them food baskets and and trying to show them that there are other people out there who care for them, who want to help them.</span> <span id="s133">And this is where I met them.</span> <span id="s134">And then I have stories of their schooling, and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Tell me some of those that as you know them, as your experiences were in the schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, they had two types of schooling.</span> <span id="s137">There was a man there by the name of Saul Livery (ph).</span> <span id="s138">Does the name ring a bell?</span> <span id="s139">.</span> <span id="s140">Saul Livery was in the Shanghai ghetto.</span> <span id="s141">He was the spirit of Judaism in the Shanghai ghetto.</span> <span id="s142">He decided that even though we're in these dismal surroundings, there's one thing that we need to know.</span> <span id="s143">We have to know our heritage.</span> <span id="s144">We have to know our history.</span> <span id="s145">We have to know our literature.</span> <span id="s146">And so Saul Livery was the spirit that motivated and energized not just the Yeshiva learning, but that the Jews should know literature and history even on a Hebraic (ph) secular level.</span> <span id="s147">Hebrew literature, see.</span> <span id="s148">He wanted to teach them Hebrew so he formed a series of religious schooling which was the saving grace of these young people.</span> <span id="s149">Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great schools - one was the Kaduri (ph) School and the other was another high school which I, slips my mind but I have it in my notes, and in these schools the children went to high school to learn their secular subjects.</span> <span id="s150">When I came in to the little Jewish schools, I found out that they had nothing to write on.</span> <span id="s151">The kids would pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of black slate that writes and these were their notebooks.</span> <span id="s152">And I saw that.</span> <span id="s153">I thought I must do something about it.</span> <span id="s154">So I sent back home and they sent me books and and paper and notebooks and pencils and so on - the greatest gift.</span> <span id="s155">Imagine children considering it the greatest gift I could give them.</span> <span id="s156">When I came one day to their to their little schools and I handed out notebooks with pencils, with pens, with books, with with all the equipment that they needed.</span> <span id="s157">They said I revolutionized the the school system in the ghetto because we gave them pens and pencils.</span> <span id="s158">When I think of what a gift means to somebody - they they they kissed my hands, the kids, for for the fact that I brought them this.</span> <span id="s159">The same as after that first service.</span> <span id="s160">At at the end of that first service I'm standing at the door trying to see who these people are as they leave to say goodbye, and they started kissing my chaplain's insignia which I have there.</span> <span id="s161">The Jewish, because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom, freedom to us and these, the whole the whole ghetto felt that America saved them.</span> <span id="s162">That we brought freedom to the people from the Nazi empire.</span> <span id="s163">It was a very thrilling moment in in American history when we were considered the proponents of freedom.</span> <span id="s164">It's being recapitulated right now in every country of Eastern Europe that that that when you .</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">OK.</span> <span id="s167">Any other questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">Tell me some more about other places in the vic...uh in the ghetto that you visited.</span> <span id="s170">Tell me about people's homes.</span> <span id="s171">What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, the homes that I visited, and I'll give you an example of this bar mitzvah - I went into a little house.</span> <span id="s173">They must have had about five or six in one room.</span> <span id="s174">They they they went from hand to mouth as far as food is concerned.</span> <span id="s175">Uh some standing on food lines and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other, just like in in the ancient in the in the ghetto of of of former times, of of three, four hundred years ago.</span> <span id="s176">What I found most exciting was the fact that the the Judaism which to many of them had never meant anything, I found that the the Jews of the survivors went one way or another.</span> <span id="s177">I thought that most of them would turn against their faith and I thought that as I went in one home after another these were survivors and these were the children and these were children without any parents who they adopted as their own.</span> <span id="s178">As I went into these homes I felt why would they want to carry on this heritage where there they were told - by the way some of them are so assimilated, so far-removed from anything Jewish - they looked so German that they could be an example of blonde hair, blue eyes, clipped - an example of German aristocracy, and went into their pitiful homes and saw their lovely children, saw that these children weren't even their children.</span> <span id="s179">They were adopting orphans who - by the way that's quite a story that these orphans were brought half way around the world and I found out later, you remember there's a story about Hannah Szenes [NB: Sennesh] who who who said I'm a match that was not to be consumed, where she volunteered to help save - I found out that Haganah, that the Jewish underground, had formed a railway and taken youngsters and put them into Christian homes who put their lives on the stake to save Jewish kids where the kids would be hidden in these Christian homes by day, and in the evening, at sunset they would pick them up and ride them through the mountains and ride them to the next town where they had another Christian home.</span> <span id="s180">I didn't know that story.</span> <span id="s181">And here I find that these kids were telling about the Israelis who who from from Haganah, went out there to save these kids.</span> <span id="s182">This was a chapter that that that really was hair-raising to me, to find these kids saved from in that kind of situation.</span> <span id="s183">As far as the - let me give you this bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s184">Here's a lovely little kid, little boy who would have known nothing if it weren't for the fact that a fellow like Saul Livery so to it that there was Jewish education.</span> <span id="s185">And took the few that knew Jewish education and made schools around them.</span> <span id="s186">By the way, not only schools - they created a choir, a choir of forty voices that came and sang at my first service.</span> <span id="s187">They had uh men with such beautiful voices - they called them cantors.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">They had operatic voices.</span> <span id="s189">I had an operatic singer conducting my Friday night service.</span> <span id="s190">With such a voice I wish I had video and I wish I had sound recording to hear that voice.</span> <span id="s191">To me it was, an operatic tenor like like Jan Peerce or Richard Tucker the days of...so here was my service where these people walked in and and and they - forty voice choir.</span> <span id="s192">An operatic singer to help me conduct a service, so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it.</span> <span id="s193">It wasn't until they let me take over with an opening hymn "Shma Israel" that the whole group got together.</span> <span id="s194">That that's an aside.</span> <span id="s195">But the beauty of that experience is that I see this youngster who could easily - first of all, how he survived - he was an orphan - how he survived the Nazi massacre and ended up in Shanghai in itself is is beyond understanding.</span> <span id="s196">Since he was only thirteen he wasn't one of those that wrote my compositions, so I started to talk with him and its another one of those stories.</span> <span id="s197">He he saw his - the knock on the door - he he saw them take his father and his mother and his sister and he were left and then and then two days later his sister was taken because she was a beautiful girl, and this kid saw it at four, five, six years old and he's telling this story and now he's going to be bar mitzvahed in Shanghai, all alone.</span> <span id="s198">His mother disappeared.</span> <span id="s199">So this is the kind of story that I got in in in the ghetto and and when you get it directly, when you hear it from a kid's lips, it's different than than the whole six million story again and again.</span> <span id="s200">It's just different.</span> <span id="s201">A bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s202">This kid to have such a Jewish bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s203">When they had to celebrate after the service, I, they said come and join us in a drink.</span> <span id="s204">They had one bottle of schnapps, of liquor, which they had kept for the whole year and every time they take a few they fill it with water.</span> <span id="s205">They filled the bottle with water so it says liquor.</span> <span id="s206">I said I don't drink.</span> <span id="s207">They says this you can drink.</span> <span id="s208">I said I don't drink.</span> <span id="s209">They said this you can drink.</span> <span id="s210">Take a look.</span> <span id="s211">I'm drinking water.</span> <span id="s212">But they have a big bottle of Jewish liquor, uh liquor, and they, everybody drinks it as if LALHAIM (ph) and they make believe they're they're getting drunk on it.</span> <span id="s213">It's the same.</span> <span id="s214">They have five bottles like that, practically all water, but this was their their schnapps.</span> <span id="s215">This was their SABBATH THING and a little old piece of herring which was this big - I didn't want to take anything because here I come from where we have everything in the service.</span> <span id="s216">They insisted.</span> <span id="s217">From their nothingness they insisted that I have something.</span> <span id="s218">So I have a picture of one of these bigger homes, a big basement where we were meeting sabbath morning, after the service.</span> <span id="s219">So there's a a little bit of the flavor of what I'm talking about in in in in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s220">Now I can, I don't know - based on your timing experience I would uh I could uh I could tell you the end of that story.</span> <span id="s221">Alright.</span> <span id="s222">The end of the story is that I started badgering the Pentagon that I want these kids out.</span> <span id="s223">I want a ship.</span> <span id="s224">I want somebody to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">It's after the war now.</span> <span id="s226">By the way, we couldn't get out after the war because there were no, there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s227">They felt that the, that the people from Europe were more entitled to get back than we who came in a little later.</span> <span id="s228">So all the boats and all means of transportation, they gave us no idea of when we would get out of of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s229">Uh my luck was that my wife was pregnant with a child, and at the end of that period uh the doctor said look, something has gone wrong, and it's only because of her uncertainty of where you are - it's getting worse.</span> <span id="s230">She can't conceive of having the child without your presence.</span> <span id="s231">Since the war is over, he wrote to my colonel - so the colonel saw to it that I was able.</span> <span id="s232">I took a plane that goes around the world every week - we called it the Marco Polo flight - every week it takes mail from all the Army bases - I got on the mail plane with all the Army - and I got a lift to Chicago where my wife was.</span> <span id="s233">And and I traveled day and night and came just a few days before the child came to be.</span> <span id="s234">It was a very exciting experience.</span> <span id="s235">I didn't tell them I was coming because I didn't know I'd get there, so it's a wonder she didn't have the child when I walked in.</span> <span id="s236">But that's that's a story in itself.</span> <span id="s237">I did come home in time for my...but that meant that I would not be there to fulfill my mission which was to get these people out, to get these kids out.</span> <span id="s238">And I badgered them and badgered them and finally I learned that they finally sent a ship and the ship took a thousand of them out of Shanghai and that picture of the thousand of them out of Shanghai was shown last summer at the B'nai B'rith Museum, at the Klutznick Museum.</span> <span id="s239">They had a whole section on Shanghai, and in the section on Shanghai, over my torah, they had a picture of all these young people or whatever ages they were, who who finally got out, and I never let up until they one day they said yes, we will get you a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Enough telegrams, enough.</span> <span id="s241">And that's how I knew that my hope for mission.</span> <span id="s242">And the end of that story is even more exciting.</span> <span id="s243">Uh well, first of all, I was given a dinner here by the Jewish War Veterans for all the service uh found out that I had more medals than most chaplains who served in the service.</span> <span id="s244">Uh I didn't know that at that time, but they had all my medals and clusters and all that, and then the fellow who ran it was a fellow by the name of Kiwi (ph) - I had never heard his name.</span> <span id="s245">I said what makes you so excited about this dinner, and you've given your life to it.</span> <span id="s246">Why?</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">He says because when you come and take a look at this picture, you'll see that I'm on it.</span> <span id="s249">I was one of those that you saved from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s250">And so the man who ran the dinner here at the Hilton, Jewish War Veterans and and let's see, who who was with me.</span> <span id="s251">We honored I think the Ambassador of Israel and myself, but the man worked on it so hard because he was on that picture.</span> <span id="s252">That picture by the way at this point is in limbo.</span> <span id="s253">It went from the B'nai B'rith Museum to whatever museum supplied it or whatever individual supplied it.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: We can we can discuss that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: We'll discuss that later, because I'd like you to find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s257">We move on.</span> <span id="s258">Let's go back to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s259">(Alright -just a word, another word about Shanghai...).</span> <span id="s260">We have time.</span> <span id="s261">We have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: We have time.</span> <span id="s263">As far as I'm concerned I'm coming to the end of my story unless we want to give more of the other parts, but what happened to the end of the Shanghai story?</span> <span id="s264">.</span> <span id="s265">After I left, I just wan to tell you after I left, a few years ago I took a number of doctors - for some reason or another a lot of them were gastrologists - why I got into that I don't know - but they had sons who wanted to be bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s266">And they were members of my congregation in uh HAR (ph) Shalom.</span> <span id="s267">As you know I uh I am very privileged that of the eight synagogues that I was, that God has enabled me to found on the outskirts of Washington, one of them went out of its way to name the sanctuary for me, so in the Rabbi Morris Gordon sanctuary, they were members, and they went with me to to Israel to have their sons bar mitzvahed on Masada, who we had forty, with their families, all of us on Masada celebrating a double bar mitzvah and then we decided to go to Elat, so our buses, our filled bus, we're traveling to Elat and we suddenly come to a little cross-road.</span> <span id="s268">It looked like this one was a newer road.</span> <span id="s269">We didn't know exactly - there were men standing with drills making the rocks of of drill...of cracking the rocks of which to make the road to the south.</span> <span id="s270">So I got off the bus since this is my people and I was the tour leader, and I said uh. . . . . (ph), please, tell me which road would be best to take to Elat.</span> <span id="s271">I mean I never knew you had two roads.</span> <span id="s272">So one of them looks at me and one and one says in Hebrew,. . . . . . . (ph) Chaplain Gordon.</span> <span id="s273">Are you Chaplain Gordon?</span> <span id="s274">.</span> <span id="s275">Yes.</span> <span id="s276">Rabbi?</span> <span id="s277">.</span> <span id="s278">I looked at them.</span> <span id="s279">There were five men.</span> <span id="s280">How could I recognize them?</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">I mean they were thirteen and they're thirty-five or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s283">I didn't recognize any one of them.</span> <span id="s284">You must be...and they picked me up and everybody on the bus thought I'm going to get killed here, these big husky guys and they wouldn't let me go, and but we had to continue our journey.</span> <span id="s285">So they told me that they were on the boat.</span> <span id="s286">They were saved.</span> <span id="s287">They remembered me.</span> <span id="s288">They even gave me uh the psalm that they recited as they got on that boat in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s289">It's the psalm with which uh. . . . . . . (ph), uh we sing onto thee oh Lord uh the song of a. . . . . . , and then we return,. . . . . . , when God returned the people to Zion, they returned as those who dream and that those who sow in tears will reap in joy.</span> <span id="s290">They quoted the psalm that they quoted as they were going on that boat to leave Shanghai. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s291">. . . . . . . . .</span> <span id="s292">We were like those who dream.</span> <span id="s293">And they started saying it to me to show me that they remembered, that would I..</span> <span id="s294">.</span> <span id="s295">they didn't realize I wasn't even there when they got on the boat.</span> <span id="s296">They were sure, they were waving that I must have been there to wave goodbye, and now here in Israel, they complete the story and I look at them and I said, but is this such a wonderful thing to do.</span> <span id="s297">All of you are cracking rocks.</span> <span id="s298">I said uh are you en...enjoying this?</span> <span id="s299">.</span> <span id="s300">And one of them says uh Chaplain Gordon,. . . . . . . . . . (ph).</span> <span id="s301">These rocks are mine.</span> <span id="s302">That's all they said.</span> <span id="s303">One guy said it.</span> <span id="s304">These rocks are mine.</span> <span id="s305">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s306">This is what they had dreamed of - that if they're going to crack rocks and if they're going to build homes, it's going to be in their own land.</span> <span id="s307">And they're not going to do it anymore for strangers in this foreign land.</span> <span id="s308">That's the way they spoke.</span> <span id="s309">That's the way they dreamed, and my men finally came off the off the bus and they surrounded them and we had a real - my men always have little food or a little schnapps and then they had the party that they didn't have in the ghetto in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s310">They had at the road to Elat.</span> <span id="s311">So there is the uh how that thing ended.</span> <span id="s312">At this point there are there are few who would like to get my story for some reason or other uh I never was able to write down.</span> <span id="s313">I have my original hundred and sixty-eight different experiences in jungle, experience in China.</span> <span id="s314">I have these letters that these children wrote, when I said home is where your heart?</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">Where is your home?</span> <span id="s317">.</span> <span id="s318">Each one wrote a letter to to tell me where their heart is and where their home is.</span> <span id="s319">All these I have in a in a book with a couple of chapters that I started, but at the same time that I started thinking that I had finished - the areas of my life I told you was was schooling then synagoguing.</span> <span id="s320">Uh the first part was a rabbi of a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">The next part was starting synagogues without enumeration, just as my love for the. . . . . (ph) and then and then the war experience, and the fourth part was going to be put it all together.</span> <span id="s322">To write it all up.</span> <span id="s323">But I got involved in a universal aspect which I just mention one word - I am Chairman of the Board of PAIRS, Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills, the only course today in the country and perhaps in the world that says that you can go through high school and college without ever learning how to live side-by-side as a couple, with pleasure.</span> <span id="s324">How to overcome pain and live with pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Rabbi, not for this tape OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Not for this tape, but I wanted you to know that we were just in Israel and they've introduced it into the University of Israel and it's now in Australia.</span> <span id="s327">It's being, it just was, they gave me a book in Hebrew on this course.</span> <span id="s328">It's in Russian.</span> <span id="s329">It's in Chinese and it's Burma, India, and all over the world, so I just want you to know that that's my universal aspect.</span> <span id="s330">How to make this world a better place to live in by putting couples together more pleasurably.</span> <span id="s331">It's in this issue of New Woman and four other magazines.</span> <span id="s332">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s334">Thank you.</span> <span id="s335">Uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Can I put in just one word.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: No, no more plugs.</span> <span id="s338">(OK.</span> <span id="s339">I loose.)</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">No more plugs.</span> <span id="s342">No plugs allowed.</span> <span id="s343">No, thank you.</span> <span id="s344">The Shanghai experience is very important and I I thank you.</span> <span id="s345">I think what I'd like to do is, if you have nothing more, is to stop unless there's and go to the things that you've brought unless you have something else on Shanghai that you want to tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Right now it doesn't come to mind.</span> <span id="s347">I don't want to force the issue because if I think of something I'll go off into a long rampage (ph) on another aspect of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s348">I mean I could talk more about the life.</span> <span id="s349">I could talk more about what was happening, but I feel I gave you the salient points.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s351">OK.</span> <span id="s352">Then what we're going to do at this point is, Barney, why don't we stop the film and let the camera do, do it's thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s355">Let's take the knife.</span> <span id="s356">(Technical conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: ...and this particular knife when I, it was lost - it wasn't lost - it was stolen I presume when I ended up in one of these, with one of these tribes after we were lost in the jungle, and we partook of food and I used it to open up the coconuts.</span> <span id="s359">We only ate uh food that had a cover over it so that we didn't partake of uh the food that they touched with their water and their hands.</span> <span id="s360">And so I broke open the things and I ate it and and used the knife and then later on I found out that I was missing the knife, and this is the story that I told you.</span> <span id="s361">They punish somebody who steals from a stranger with death.</span> <span id="s362">They have a lot of interesting uh things that they do.</span> <span id="s363">By the way the way I was able to communicate was because I was a chaplain and uh the head man would come to our base to bring fruits and vegetables from this particular tribe, so I was able to talk with him in English and able to get the story.</span> <span id="s364">He hearing I was a chaplain became very friendly with me because I, he felt I was in the same work.</span> <span id="s365">To me it was very interesting to see the young people sitting and and and swaying back and forth and and and praying sort of as they learned.</span> <span id="s366">Uh to me it was just like a Yeshiva in the school where I studied.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s368">I think that's it.</span> <span id="s369">(Technical Conversation) OK.</span> <span id="s370">Let's go to the challis since we're still in Burma.</span> <span id="s371">(Technical Conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: This is the challis that the Catholic (technical conversation)...
