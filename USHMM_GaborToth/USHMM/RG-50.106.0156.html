Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer, t -- conducted by Gail Schwartz on August 4th, 2002 in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s4">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s5">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: My full name is Alfred Munzer and that’s spelled M-u-n-z-e-r.</span> <span id="s7">The name has undergone some changes, so when I was born it was actually Minzer, M-i-n-z-e-r, because of a slight spelling error that had been made in my father’s birth certificate.</span> <span id="s8">Someone forgot the upstroke on the -- on the U actually, which had a little umlaut on it.</span> <span id="s9">And officially also, when we came to the United States the name was changed back to Munzer, M-u-e-n-z-e-r.</span> <span id="s10">So we have all three spellings, but commonly I use M-u-n-z-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Do you have a middle name?</span> <span id="s12">A: I don’t have a middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And where were you born and when were you born?</span> <span id="s14">A: I was born in The Hague, in the Netherlands, November 23rd, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And your parents’ names and where they were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father’s name was Simcha or Siegfried Munzer, or Minzer.</span> <span id="s17">And he was born in a town in Galicia called Kanczuga.</span> <span id="s18">And he was born in 1904.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was born in a town in the same general area, called Rymanow, and she was born May 20th, we th -- 1905 officially, but it could have been, it probably was more likely 1907.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And when did they come to the nether -- Netherlands, and what brought them to that location?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My father came to the Netherlands in the late 20’s, and my mother came to the Netherlands in 1932.</span> <span id="s22">And my father came there to -- to start a -- a business, obviously.</span> <span id="s23">Conditions for Jews in Poland were not ideal.</span> <span id="s24">He came from a large family of tailors and he decided to start his own tailoring business in The Hague.</span> <span id="s25">And then my mother joined him there about four years later.</span> <span id="s26">She was also -- they were actually cousins, so they shared the same last name.</span> <span id="s27">And she initially left Rymanow in the impr -- the end of the 20’s probably, maybe beginning 30’s and went to Berlin to join a sister and a brother who were -- already lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s28">And she worked in their tailoring business, and then came to join my father, and they were married in the Netherlands in 1930 --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: -- Two.</span> <span id="s31">1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: December 16th, 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Right, December 16th, 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And then when did they begin a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: They -- I had -- they had two children before I was born.</span> <span id="s36">My oldest sister Eva was born in 1936, and my younger sister Leana was born in 1938 and then I followed in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Were your parents very religious, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: They both came from very re-religious backgrounds, very typical eastern European, but they were also part of the -- the enlightenment, if you will, and so they -- they experimented, when they came to Holland.</span> <span id="s39">And some of their closest friends in Holland were actually not Jewish.</span> <span id="s40">They -- they observed, you know, the Jewish holidays, certainly, but they -- they did make a break with the very rigid, and what they considered, I think, constraining and confining religion of their bankr -- background in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s42">Now obviously I know what you’re telling me is what your mother told you, cause you haven’t been born yet.</span> <span id="s43">How much education did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I’m not entirely sure, my -- they -- they both, I think, had a high school education, essentially.</span> <span id="s45">Neither one of them went to the university.</span> <span id="s46">And to a large extent also were self educated.</span> <span id="s47">My mother read a tremendous amount, was a voracious reader throughout her life.</span> <span id="s48">And my father was also a fairly educated man, apparently very interested in world affairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Was there an extended family in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: In the Netherlands there was -- my father had a brother by the name of Emil, Emil Munzer.</span> <span id="s51">And I think that that’s -- that’s really an -- all we had in Holland.</span> <span id="s52">There were some close friends.</span> <span id="s53">There was another Emil, an Emil Landau who I subsequently met because he happened -- he lived in the United States and you know, he happened to -- to marry, actually, someone who became a part of our life much, much later on.</span> <span id="s54">And so we became very close friends with him.</span> <span id="s55">But he was very close with -- with both my father and with my Uncle Emil.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: But -- but he was not a blood relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My uncle --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: No, no, Emil Landau.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Emil Landau was not a blood bra -- blood relative.</span> <span id="s60">The only blood relatives that I know of in Holland was my Uncle Emil, my father’s side.</span> <span id="s61">All of the others were either -- either remained in Poland or Czechoslovakia, whatever.</span> <span id="s62">The location of -- of the towns actually was changed quite frequently throughout history.</span> <span id="s63">And the [indecipherable] some of them were in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And on your mother’s side there was no rela -- there were no relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: On my mother’s side, as far as I know, there were no relatives in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And wh-what do you know of the conditions in Holland before you were born?</span> <span id="s67">Did your mother tell you about any tightening restrictions or any sense of danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Certainly the -- you know, she did tell me about the -- the -- the -- the gradual tightening of the screws after the invasion of Holland by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Which was May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: That’s right, May 1940 and the confiscation of -- of Jewish property, the banning of Jews from -- from various positions in the arts, or in -- in -- in business.</span> <span id="s71">Just a very -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah, ritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter.</span> <span id="s72">And I think they try -- my -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as normally as possible in Holland, and I’m not sure how directly threatened they felt in Holland, actually.</span> <span id="s73">My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe.</span> <span id="s74">As far as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to the United States or anywhere else.</span> <span id="s75">I think they -- they -- they really felt very secure in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s77">And then your mother became pregnant with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in Holland had really deteriorated a great deal.</span> <span id="s79">By then the -- the occupation was in full swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy.</span> <span id="s80">And my mother was advised in very strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion.</span> <span id="s81">He told her that it would be immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world.</span> <span id="s82">And my mother, this is one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of Hannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story, my mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion.</span> <span id="s83">As a result of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do with her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home actually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an obstetrician.</span> <span id="s84">And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said, November 23rd, 1941.</span> <span id="s85">And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and that’s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision.</span> <span id="s86">Again my -- my parents friends advised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and then the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father that I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and my father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular bris.</span> <span id="s87">And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris.</span> <span id="s88">They’re very remarkable photographs, they’re very, very tiny, they’re only about one by one and a half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year -- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So you were born, you were circumcised and then the next development?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the following May is -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s91">That’s when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the -- the first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father, to -- to go to a so-called work camp.</span> <span id="s92">What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a hernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the operation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile.</span> <span id="s93">And then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt, which gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho-hospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek.</span> <span id="s94">And that’s -- so he entered there, basically under the pretext of being a patient.</span> <span id="s95">My mother, in the meantime, began to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself.</span> <span id="s96">The f -- my father -- my parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should -- should hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found out, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the others would survive.</span> <span id="s97">My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among our neighbors.</span> <span id="s98">The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko, K-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann.</span> <span id="s99">They were very, very close to us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things.</span> <span id="s100">First they -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic school, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity.</span> <span id="s101">And then through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then, on the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a father by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-l-l-i-n-g, and I right now can’t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were instrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters.</span> <span id="s102">The woman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic.</span> <span id="s103">She had had a vision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children.</span> <span id="s104">And th-that’s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman.</span> <span id="s105">Subsequently, my mother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me in.</span> <span id="s106">And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then eventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside, where most Jewish children apparently were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What -- where -- what -- what was the address of your family’s house?</span> <span id="s108">Wa -- you’re talking about neighbors --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s110">It was 100 Zoutmanstraat in The Hague, and I don’t recall exactly, but they lived on the same street, on Zoutmanstraat, right across the street, actually.</span> <span id="s111">Her name was Annie Madna and that’s -- that’s the woman I was -- I was placed with.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And your family knew her because she was a neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: They were very -- they were close neighbors.</span> <span id="s114">She was divorced from her husband, Tolé Madna, who was of Indonesian background.</span> <span id="s115">She herself was Dutch.</span> <span id="s116">And they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were apparently in and out of my mother’s house all the time.</span> <span id="s117">It was a very, very close relationship.</span> <span id="s118">They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well.</span> <span id="s119">So it was -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially, certainly.</span> <span id="s120">That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine months old at the time when I was placed with Annie.</span> <span id="s121">And at that point my mother sold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of items in hiding with our neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in hiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her case, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse’s aid, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Was she known as his -- his wife?</span> <span id="s123">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s124">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s125">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s126">There were quite a few Jews who were hiding there in the same way, although I never asked my munther -- my mother exactly how many people.</span> <span id="s127">She did tell me about the shock it was to her to -- to -- to be in a -- in a s -- in a hospital where people had been confined -- and psychiatric hospitals at that time were quite different from the clinics we are accustomed to.</span> <span id="s128">So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and it was a tremendous shock for her.</span> <span id="s129">My father apparently adapted much better and he found a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards.</span> <span id="s130">But for my mother it was -- it was much more difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did she have contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: She did have contact with him.</span> <span id="s133">As a matter of fact, for Christmas day 1942, the -- in Holland Christmas is celebrated for two days, but the -- on Christmas day, the -- my two sisters were brought to the Remarkkliniek to visit my parents.</span> <span id="s134">I’m not sure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have some notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which is also a big deal in Holland, which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f-for -- for Christmas day.</span> <span id="s135">Yeah, it was Christmas day.</span> <span id="s136">And they -- so that that part of the family at least, was reunited that -- one last time.</span> <span id="s137">This was December 25th, 1942.</span> <span id="s138">The following day the clinic was invaded by the Germans and apparently was emptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients and the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s139">And my parents were taken, first to a -- a temporary prison in The Hague, the former home of the philosopher, Dutch philosopher Spinoza had been converted into a prison.</span> <span id="s140">And then, just within a matter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first concentration camp, and that was Westerbork.</span> <span id="s141">Westerbork, which is located in the northernmost part of -- of Holland.</span> <span id="s142">Westerbork, my mother told me, initially had been built actually as a receiving center for Jewish refugees fleeing eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And -- and so they were together in Westerbork for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: They remained in Westerbork, I believe for sev -- for -- for several weeks, not a very long period of time.</span> <span id="s145">My mother was put in charge of the nursery there, of taking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that -- that her own children were not there.</span> <span id="s146">She was really quite glad of that, actually and very grateful that -- that there ha -- was -- that we had found sa -- that she had found safe refuge for all three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Once she was in Westerbork, was there any contact with -- where y -- where you all were placed?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t think -- there was no contact.</span> <span id="s150">And I -- I think at that point every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she did not disclose.</span> <span id="s151">There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is actually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to Auschwitz, wrote a little note on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to Auschwitz, all is well.</span> <span id="s152">And she dropped that on the railroad tracks and she put an address on it, not -- I -- probably to my mother’s neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was.</span> <span id="s153">And a railroad worker in Holland found the note and it did make its way back.</span> <span id="s154">I’ve never seen the note, I’m not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there is a very similar note in the museum in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s155">So I -- I assume that this was really s-something that was done fairly commonly.</span> <span id="s156">But in any event, from Westerbork, my -- my parents were deported to the next concentration camp, which was Vught.</span> <span id="s157">And Vught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland -- northeastern Holland, sorry, not far from the city of Eindhoven, and it was home to the Philips factory.</span> <span id="s158">And both my parents were put to work in the Philips factory.</span> <span id="s159">And at that time they still had contact with each other; although they were separated in the camp, th-they saw each other and still had contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did your mother talk about her state of mind at that time or your father’s state of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Just an extreme hope for peace.</span> <span id="s162">One of the things that my mother told me that, you know, they had these -- these morning line-ups, and -- in the camp, in Vught.</span> <span id="s163">And at one point actually they were -- they were visited there by -- by Himmler himself, who told them that as long as they worked, they were in no danger, nothing would ever happen to them.</span> <span id="s164">[indecipherable] Whether it’s at that same line-up or one of the others, I mean, very humiliating experiences.</span> <span id="s165">She saw a little church way in the distance in the du -- Dutch church on the horizon, and she wondered how -- how wonderful, how it would be if peace would break out at that moment.</span> <span id="s166">And she said she would just run to that church, she didn’t care if it was a church or a synagogue and just thank God for -- for being freed.</span> <span id="s167">So she did maintain hope.</span> <span id="s168">I think that’s -- that’s really what kept my mother going then, and -- and subsequently.</span> <span id="s169">She never lost hope.</span> <span id="s170">She -- she always tried to -- to -- to really make the best of -- of the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And she would have been in her what, mid to late 30’s by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: She was in her -- in her 30’s at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: One of the things which -- which happened really a bit later was -- but which sort of says something about her state of mind I think, is when she was in one of the cattle, the infamous cattle cars.</span> <span id="s175">She -- she looked outside, she was able t-to -- to look at the -- the countryside, the German countryside and -- and realize -- this was springtime and she realized how beautiful it was and she -- she said to herself that after the war we probably would not have much money, but that this still was one way that the family could actually go around and see Europe and still admire the beauty of -- of creation.</span> <span id="s176">So that’s -- I think that says something about her state of mind.</span> <span id="s177">This was much later, when things were much worse for her.</span> <span id="s178">Much worse than they were when she was at -- in Vught.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And did she talk about what your father’s state of mind was, there at the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Not at that time, but she -- she did tell me about my father’s state of mind actually, earlier.</span> <span id="s181">He kept hoping that the Germans would be defeated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s182">He had -- he had great faith in th-the -- in history and what happened during the Napoleonic wars, and he -- he felt that when -- when Russia entered the war, he -- he felt it was a strong possibility that the Germans would be defeated in Russia and that that will be the end of the war.</span> <span id="s183">But that, of course, was not to be for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s185">And then how long did they stay at this factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I’m not entirely sure.</span> <span id="s187">I do have some documents that I could refer to, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Well, why don’t you continue with the story and we can talk about the documents later.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Right.</span> <span id="s190">I think -- good.</span> <span id="s191">They -- they stayed in Vught for sev -- as far as I know, several months and then were transferred from, or tra -- deported from Vught to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s192">That’s where my mother wrote that fame -- that note, which she dropped on the railroad track.</span> <span id="s193">They were still together on arrival in Auschwitz, and were both selected for work -- to -- to work in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: What did she say about that journey with your father in the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I don’t think they were in th -- in the cattle car together.</span> <span id="s196">They just -- I -- I -- I don’t know, but I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s197">I think men and women were separated, but I’m -- I’m not sure of that.</span> <span id="s198">But -- and I d -- I don’t know of any specific conversations what they had.</span> <span id="s199">She did, on arrival in Auschwitz they -- they -- they both, I think, were very much aware of -- of what the realities of Auschwitz were, there was no -- no hiding it.</span> <span id="s200">You know, she -- she told me of Torah scrolls that were on the floors.</span> <span id="s201">She told me of Tallisium that had been com -- made into curtains and sh-she realized that things in Auschwitz were going to be very, very, very bad.</span> <span id="s202">My mother somehow found a way to make herself indispensable in -- in many different ways.</span> <span id="s203">The first kind of job that she had actually, was making fur coats for the wives of -- of German generals.</span> <span id="s204">My mother had never done any kind of tailoring, any kind of work before, hard work, let alone working with fur, but somehow she managed to persuade them that she was able to -- to work with fur.</span> <span id="s205">And so she made some -- some fur coats.</span> <span id="s206">That was her -- her first job.</span> <span id="s207">And then through the grapevine is how she learned that people working in electronics were very essential to the work effort, and that led to a different kind of work, first in Auschwitz, but then to a transfer to Reichenbach, which was home of the Telefunken factory, and there she was put to work assembling radio tubes essential for the war effort and for transmission.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s210">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s211">You were talking about your mother’s experience in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes, my mother found work in Auschwitz, made herself indispensable first by making fur coats, and then she learned through the grapevine that people who worked in electronics were saved, actually had a way of saving themselves.</span> <span id="s213">And so she started doing that, she claimed that she knew how to -- how to work in electronics, and she was -- that led to a transfer to the Telefunken factory in Reichenbach, sort of a continuation, if you will, of what she had been doing at Philips in -- in -- in Vught.</span> <span id="s214">And in Reichenbach she -- she worked assembling radio tubes.</span> <span id="s215">Her state of mind at that point actually improved, or she took heart from the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the concentration camps working at Telefunken, but there were also German soldiers who had been injured on the Russian front, many of whom were missing limbs and were put to work basically, as best they could in the factory.</span> <span id="s216">And their state of mind, they were so anti-Hitler, and anti-Himmler that they would do everything to -- to sabotage the effort at that point.</span> <span id="s217">And she took tremendous heart from that, and told me of her own sabotage efforts basically, you know, she would spend the whole day assembling the radio tube, and then when the alarm sounded, or the siren sounds at the end of the day, she would take the -- the entire radio tube apart and put it back in the drawer and then the following day would start the process again, which is kind of a daring thing, certainly.</span> <span id="s218">But by that time, things like that were quite common.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: What did she say a-about leaving your father in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: We didn’t talk about that specifically.</span> <span id="s221">I -- not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Did she have contact with him when they were there together?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: In Auschwitz they still had contact together, but that was the end.</span> <span id="s224">It was in Auschwitz really that they were separated.</span> <span id="s225">I did not realize that until much later, but my father actually remained in Auschwitz, amazingly for -- for over a year, before being transferred to another hellhole, Mauthausen, another work camp, death camp.</span> <span id="s226">It’s -- it’s hard to distinguish the two suddenly -- certainly.</span> <span id="s227">And then he was transferred from Mauthausen after being there for several months, to several other, smaller subsidiaries of Mauthausen; Gusen, Steyr and then finally ended up in a camp called Ebensee.</span> <span id="s228">My mother and I for many years thought that he worked in salt mines.</span> <span id="s229">I don’t know where we got that idea from, but there were salt mines in -- in that area, that part of Austria, actually.</span> <span id="s230">And it’s called the Salzkammergut.</span> <span id="s231">And -- but the-these were actually abandoned salt mines that were used for assembling of V-2 rockets.</span> <span id="s232">And that’s where my father di -- where my father worked to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s233">And he -- he remained there through the liberation, survived the liberation by the Americans, and -- but was much too weak, contracted -- well, what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still without having been able to establish contact with us, two months after the war, on July 25th, 1945.</span> <span id="s234">He -- he died in a -- a c -- a convent in Ebensee that had been converted into a hospital for concentration camp victims who were very ill.</span> <span id="s235">My partner Joel and I visited the -- the convent, actually, and spoke to one of the sisters about her experience there, and she -- she had -- she was much too young, I think, to have been there, actually.</span> <span id="s236">But she said that -- that literally there were hundreds of inmates who were being cared for, and that people were just also dying on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s237">And my father was buried actually, in -- in a cemetery in the former concentration camp of Ebensee.</span> <span id="s238">It’s -- it’s an absolutely beautiful place.</span> <span id="s239">It is im -- un -- it’s unimaginable that -- that horrors like that could have taken place.</span> <span id="s240">It -- it’s -- I think it’s one of the most beautiful places on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Is that a marked grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, his grave originally was marked, and there are some -- some mass graves there, because of the tremendous number of people who died immediately after -- they were found dead in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s243">And then there were a lot of marked graves, but for the sake of -- of uniformity, basically -- initially actually his -- his -- the first time my mother visited the cemetery in 1952, there was actually a cross on -- on his grave, that we didn’t know -- there were Jewish graves that did not have crosses, that had, you know, just plain markers.</span> <span id="s244">We didn't know why there was a cross on his grave.</span> <span id="s245">And we didn’t know whether in -- somehow in his last days he had converted, or whatever, what had happened.</span> <span id="s246">But we were told at the t -- or she was told at the time that all the markers would be removed because there were far too many errors like that.</span> <span id="s247">And also because many of the people were unidentified, and so all markers were removed, but we do know exactly where he is buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s249">And to get back to your mother’s experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: My mother eventually -- Reichenbach was bombed by the allies and the factory was destroyed and again showing my mother’s attitude at the time and her continued hope that kept her going was she said the Shechianu prayer, as she saw the flames engulfing the factory.</span> <span id="s251">She said that was one of the greatest joys that she had, was seeing that factory going up in flames.</span> <span id="s252">And then after that she was put on -- on one of these many death marches that were occurring and she was just transferred from one camp after another, in very, very desperate conditions.</span> <span id="s253">She told me that she stuffed newspapers around her -- her -- her feet to keep them warm, basically.</span> <span id="s254">And sh -- barely -- she barely had -- had shoes.</span> <span id="s255">Just absolutely desperate conditions.</span> <span id="s256">She did become ill along the way, developed a diarrheal disease, and -- but somehow managed to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: How did she continue to carry the photographs with her, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: My mother told me that the photographs were hidden in her hair, and she told me that her hair -- I asked her whether her hair was ever cut or shaven like -- like most women in Auschwitz, but she said it was not.</span> <span id="s259">I don’t whether that was just -- she was just being discreet with me, but she -- but she claims -- she told me that she had them hidden in her hair.</span> <span id="s260">She had the feeling that if these two little photographs of my -- my bris were ever lost, it would mean that I had died.</span> <span id="s261">And so she really, she held onto those, and I still have those photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Did she have a number on her arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes, my mother did have a -- a number on her arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Do you know what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I have it written down somewhere, but I -- I don’t remember it offhand.</span> <span id="s266">It’s -- it’s interesting, my mother never wanted me to photograph the number, and she -- she talked many times of having it removed, actually.</span> <span id="s267">She always kept it covered.</span> <span id="s268">She was -- til the end of her life she would shop for dresses that had, you know, sleeves that just barely covered the number.</span> <span id="s269">She -- she did not want to show that number.</span> <span id="s270">Eventually my mother ended up at a -- a camp at the German-Danish border, and that’s where she eventually was -- was liberated.</span> <span id="s271">It was actually about a month or two before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s272">It turns out, and this -- this was really found out -- and my mother did tell me that she was liberated, came off a train, was in -- in territory that was marked, Red Cross.</span> <span id="s273">And she was greeted by a Count Bernadotte o-of Sweden.</span> <span id="s274">And I believe the Danish -- Swedish crown prince was with him.</span> <span id="s275">And she was, it turned out, part of a large convoy of -- of women who had been kept hostage by Himmler to try to gain his own freedom, eventually, negotiate his own safety after the war through -- wi-with -- with Count Folke Bernadotte.</span> <span id="s276">And also she was fortunate enough to be -- to be saved as a result of that, and to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What was the name of the last camp that she was in?</span> <span id="s278">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: -- was it Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I think it was Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s282">She did mention that camp.</span> <span id="s283">There were other -- several small camps in the area that my mother was -- was with -- was in.</span> <span id="s284">And that’s -- that’s -- that was the last camp and then from -- from the train, she was transferred.</span> <span id="s285">Now, she never mentioned the white buses, the famous white buses specifically, but subsequently I’ve seen photographs of those.</span> <span id="s286">I’ve never been able to verify with her whether that’s how she was transported, but she did tell me that she crossed Denmark, which was then still occupied, and was taken in by a family in Sweden.</span> <span id="s287">The inmates were just -- were distributed to -- to different families in Sweden who were willing to take in the prisoners and be part of the rehabilitation process, basically.</span> <span id="s288">And she remained in Sweden through the end of the war until August 1945, when she returned to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: All right, well now let’s -- that helps us get back to your story, which was that you were then placed across the street with Annie Madna.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: We also need to --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: We also need to talk about my sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Yeah, yeah, I meant your -- your -- your story and your sister’s story.</span> <span id="s294">Yeah, okay, so you’re at Annie Madna’s house and your sisters are with this Catholic family.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Right.</span> <span id="s296">I don’t know exactly the name of the family that -- that my sisters were placed with.</span> <span id="s297">Much, much later I found a book that -- that contained an advertisement asking for the whereabouts of my sisters, and the name they were given was Jonson, the last name.</span> <span id="s298">And I don’t know whether that’s the name of the family that they were hidden with or not, my mother didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s299">But in any event, I-I was placed with -- with Annie Madna --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: But before we get to that, who placed that advertisement?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: This was an advertisement placed in a Jewish newspaper in July 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: We don’t know.</span> <span id="s304">We don’t know who placed the advertisement.</span> <span id="s305">I gave a talk about my family’s experiences and someone in the audience worked at the Library of Congress, and the following day just happened to pick up a book that contained reprints from Jewish newspapers in Holland and there, in the middle of the page was an adver -- was an advertisement a-asking about -- the whereabouts of my two sisters and where they had last been seen when they were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: But no n -- knowledge of who placed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: There was a -- the -- the name, actually was th -- was -- there was a name in there in terms of contact and it was Van Luhrmann family.</span> <span id="s308">So I think that this was a different member of the same family, the Van Luhrmann family, because they were not -- this was not The Hague address.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s310">All right, now let’s get back to th -- yo-your story and their story.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: I was placed with Annie Madna and again with -- with the -- the -- with the goal of eventually going to the countryside.</span> <span id="s312">I remained with Annie for -- I don’t know exactly how long, I think about two months altogether, because I -- I think I was told that I was 11 months old when I finally arrived at the Tolé Madna household.</span> <span id="s313">Tolé Madna was the ex-husband of Annie Madna.</span> <span id="s314">They had joint custody of their three children, Vidy -- Willy, Davy and Robby.</span> <span id="s315">And so I was transferred to -- eventually to -- to her husband.</span> <span id="s316">Tolé Madna had a housekeeper by the name of Mima Saina, S-a-i-n-a.</span> <span id="s317">We don’t even know what -- what -- what her real name was, if that was her real name.</span> <span id="s318">She was an Indonesian woman who was really -- the Indonesian term was a babu, which was nursemaid.</span> <span id="s319">She took care of -- or nanny.</span> <span id="s320">And she took care of the children and also the entire household.</span> <span id="s321">She was a -- a young woman, probably in her 20’s at the time and had no -- was not married and had no children of her own, but she had taken care of -- especially o-of -- of Robby Madna when he was very young.</span> <span id="s322">And -- so it was completely natural for her to -- to take me on as -- as -- and take care of me.</span> <span id="s323">And she really did not want to part with me, and apparently the other children in the household also liked the idea of having a baby in the household, and so I ended up remaining with the Madna family until the return of my mother in August 1945.</span> <span id="s324">Obviously, since I was an infant I have, you know, very few memories, direct memories just of -- of my stay with the Madna family, but I do have a few, actually.</span> <span id="s325">I -- I remember listening to Indonesian lullabies that Papa Madna, Mr. Tolé Madna played on the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Can you sing any of them now?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No, I can’t.</span> <span id="s328">My native tongue apparently was -- was Malay, or Indonesian, but I’ve totally -- I’ve just almost totally forgotten it, for two -- a few words, but I was told that that’s how I communicated with Mima, who did not speak any Dutch.</span> <span id="s329">She was actually illiterate, couldn’t read or write.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: When you were gr -- not you, but when your family, in the 1930’s and your sisters were talking to each other, it was in Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s332">My family, th-they all spoke Dutch, and my mother had learned Dutch.</span> <span id="s333">Close -- it’s close enough to German that -- that she learned Dutch fairly quickly, that’s what my father spoke, and certainly, you know -- they tried everything really to -- to -- to become a part of the -- the Dutch community.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: So they -- that -- that was their language, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Tell me about the Madna family, a little bit of their background and the neighborhood that the house was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s338">The house that I was hidden in was located -- was not -- van Kinsbergenstraat, number 40.</span> <span id="s339">And it was a -- a -- a very modest house in -- not too far from the -- the home of my parents and also my -- my parent’s home was actually an apartment that was just a door away from where my mothe -- my father’s business was, his store was.</span> <span id="s340">And this was probably half a mile, or a mile away from-om where the store was, certainly within walking distance, was where the van Kinsbergenstraat house was.</span> <span id="s341">It had a front room, sort of a middle room, typical Dutch house and then a back room and then two little rooms at the very, very end.</span> <span id="s342">And I slept in sort of an enclosed porch, as I remember.</span> <span id="s343">My father -- my foster father, Papa Madna also had kept birds, that was his hobby.</span> <span id="s344">He had canaries.</span> <span id="s345">And that was one of the other sounds, besides the -- the -- the lullabies, the Indonesian lullaby, what I also remember was the sound of canaries.</span> <span id="s346">I’ve subsequently made a tape of that, actually, because it -- that’s -- it’s something that he -- he stuck to through the end of his life, really.</span> <span id="s347">He had a tremendous love for his birds.</span> <span id="s348">It was a very joyful household as I -- as I remember.</span> <span id="s349">I -- I do remember one specific thing, which must have been when I was a little bit older, obviously.</span> <span id="s350">I came there when I was less than a year old, my guess is when I was about two or three.</span> <span id="s351">I -- I tried to copy the writing.</span> <span id="s352">I saw my -- the -- my foster -- my sisters, then sisters, Willy and Davy tri -- writing and so I scribbled on a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s353">And I remember that they were laughing and I was very unhappy about that.</span> <span id="s354">It’s -- it’s just one of those memories that -- that has stuck with me.</span> <span id="s355">I -- I also remember some of the f -- a little bit of the furniture.</span> <span id="s356">Here in the apartment I have -- I have some items actually that were in -- in the house.</span> <span id="s357">There was a big, Indonesian wayang doll, which is a puppet, which is now hanging in my foyer.</span> <span id="s358">And just to show, you know, the dimensions of -- of -- perceived dimensions as a child, Papa Madna had a -- a little liquor cabinet that was shaped like a barrel, and to me it looked very big, actually and it wasn’t until many, many years later, recently in fact, that I encountered that barrel again and realized that it was very tiny.</span> <span id="s359">And I -- I -- that barrel is now in my apartment as well, I -- it -- it arrived here rece -- just a few weeks ago.</span> <span id="s360">And just -- just one other reminder of those days.</span> <span id="s361">I also remember some of the toys I had.</span> <span id="s362">I had a big yellow stuffed dog and then a little stuffed rabbit, also yellow.</span> <span id="s363">And I subsequently found out that that’s where much of my mother’s jewelry was actually hidden, was sewn into -- to th -- my toy rabbit.</span> <span id="s364">I also, towards the -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the war in Holland was extremely bad, very rough, and there was really very, very little food.</span> <span id="s365">And the only thing we had to eat at that time -- again something I found out subsequently, is tulip bulbs.</span> <span id="s366">And I remember waking up, or -- one night and feeling hungry and seeing the table set for the following morning.</span> <span id="s367">And so I just sat down at the table, waiting to be fed, and I -- I -- I really distinctly remember falling asleep and my head falling into the plate.</span> <span id="s368">That’s one very distinct memory.</span> <span id="s369">And then the -- the most definite memory I have is when my mother returned, when I was reunited with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: We’ll -- we’ll get to that in a little bit.</span> <span id="s371">Let’s talk a little bit about your experience before that.</span> <span id="s372">Did you go outside at all, or were you confined in a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Oh no, I -- I was confined to the house and to the backyard, basically, and I do -- my view of the outside world was really through a mail slot.</span> <span id="s374">That’s the only thing that I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So you never went out the front door?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I never went out the front door, never went out to the street, but was allowed to play in the backyard, and I have some photographs of me playing in the backyard.</span> <span id="s377">Very --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: But you -- you could be seen in the backyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Some of the neighbors were aware of the fact of my -- were aware of my presence.</span> <span id="s380">My -- Papa Madna told me that in fact he had made a -- concocted a story that I was the illegitimate child of his ex-wife, who now had a new boyfriend who didn’t want me around, and that’s how I ended up in his household.</span> <span id="s381">Whether, you know, he really used this story with the Germans or not, I don’t know, but that’s the story he told me.</span> <span id="s382">The n -- our neighbors on va -- on van Kinsbergenstraat, I was told were actually very anti-German, were communist and so they were of the where -- aware of the fact that I was there.</span> <span id="s383">Many members of the Indonesian community who came to the house, I think also were aware of the fact that I was there in the house and -- and in fact, many, many years later, when I would visit Papa Madna, we -- we -- we’d go to a Indonesian grocer store and the grocer had one look at the combination of Papa Madna and myself and immediately realized who I was.</span> <span id="s384">And he called me by my then name, I had a name in hiding called -- I was called Bobby, and that’s what he called me, you know, Bobby.</span> <span id="s385">I -- I -- I thought for many years that I -- I was named after the dog, I had -- there was a dog in the family.</span> <span id="s386">And that the reason for that is so that people would think the dog was being called when I was being called, and -- as a -- as a disguise.</span> <span id="s387">That story turned out not to be true, because I found out that the dog’s name was actually Teddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What was your relationship with the other children in the family that you were told either later or that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, to this day, I am still their younger sibling.</span> <span id="s390">It’s -- it’s -- you know, that -- it’s -- it’s very, very interesting actually, you know.</span> <span id="s391">For example, September 11th last year, the first telephone call that I got to make sure I was safe was from one of the siblings, was from Davy Madna.</span> <span id="s392">She -- she called me here several times, left messages on the machine, was desperate to find out, to make sure that I was okay.</span> <span id="s393">And whenever -- and I’ve maintained contact over the years and there is no question but that when I’m with them, I always feel the younger sibling.</span> <span id="s394">Mr. Madna subsequently remarried and three more children and there is no question but that I feel like the older sibling to the next three children.</span> <span id="s395">So I’m really the bridge between them.</span> <span id="s396">In fact, the only time that they ever talk to each other is when I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: When the two sets --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: The two sets of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s400">And when you were talking about September 11th, that was 2001.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Tell me a little bit about the elder Mr. Madna, what you know about his background.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Mr. T-Tolé Madna was born in Indonesia and came to Holland around -- he was born in 1896 and came to Holland around the time of World War II -- World War I, sorry.</span> <span id="s404">With either -- and I’m not sure whether this was his mother or a foster mother, I’m not sure, he was very, very mysterious about his background, never talked about it very much.</span> <span id="s405">Apparently he came from a family that was relatively well-to-do, because he -- he -- after he arrived at Holland he was able to take piano lessons.</span> <span id="s406">He was very proud of the fact that he owned a motorcycle, and he -- he really became a part of -- of the very -- the young Indonesian community that was being established in Holland.</span> <span id="s407">Indonesia, of course, was a Dutch colony at the time.</span> <span id="s408">And he -- he then married Annie Madna, further really integrating him really into -- into Dutch society.</span> <span id="s409">But he also, I think felt very proud of his -- of his Indonesian heritage.</span> <span id="s410">He -- there were paintings in the house that illustrated, really, life in the Indonesian villages.</span> <span id="s411">And he -- he enjoyed gardening in -- in the home, in van Kinsbergenstraat actually, we kept chickens in the backyard, which he -- he really greatly enjoyed.</span> <span id="s412">Many years later, when he moved to a smaller apartment after the war, he -- he got one of those little gardens outside the city and th-there was no question as t -- his garden, his little garden was the most luxuriant of any of them around.</span> <span id="s413">And -- and he had all sorts of -- of little quirks.</span> <span id="s414">For example, he -- he dug a big hole in that backyard, which became a -- a refrigerator.</span> <span id="s415">Was very, very clever, that’s where he kept his beer, so that when he worked in the backyard he could sit there and -- this little yard, little garden, he had his -- his -- his little comforts from home, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s418">This is tape number two, side A. And you were talking about Papa Madna.</span> <span id="s419">Any other memories that you have?</span> <span id="s420">What -- was he a very affectionate, physically affectionate person?</span> <span id="s421">Do you remember any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: He was a very affectionate, very warm person.</span> <span id="s423">I’m not sure about physical affection, but you know, we -- we were very, very, very close.</span> <span id="s424">He was always to -- to the very end very protective of me, certainly.</span> <span id="s425">And I remember sitting on his lap.</span> <span id="s426">I remember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of the house, I remember sitting on the back of his bicycle, or he also had a little seat on the front of his bicycle where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal.</span> <span id="s427">We would take long walks together.</span> <span id="s428">He -- the -- we’d alway -- he would always -- this was after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a restaurant and I would go up the back stairs with him and the Indonesian women who worked in the kitchens would always have little snacks for me.</span> <span id="s429">He -- he always as -- as -- even when it was really no longer necessary he would always have a -- a little savings, a piggy bank for me, for example.</span> <span id="s430">He fashioned those out of his cigarette boxes.</span> <span id="s431">These were Player cigarettes, which came in metal cans at the time, and I remember he made those into a piggy bank for myself.</span> <span id="s432">And that continued for a long time.</span> <span id="s433">He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip that I really enjoyed called “Panda” which was really just only found in Holland, and he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those.</span> <span id="s434">So we -- we really had a very, very close relationship.</span> <span id="s435">And that -- that continued to the very end of his life when he died at age 96.</span> <span id="s436">I-I saw him just two months before he died.</span> <span id="s437">Joel and I went to vi -- went to Holland and we visited him, spent quite a bit of time with him and with his t -- other children.</span> <span id="s438">And I -- I remember his final gesture -- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my mother, which was very typical.</span> <span id="s439">This is the way he had always been, very concerned about her as well.</span> <span id="s440">And then, as we were leaving the apartment building he stood at the window waving a white handkerchief.</span> <span id="s441">And that was the last gesture, that was the last time I saw him alive.</span> <span id="s442">And then two months later I went back for the funeral.</span> <span id="s443">And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and visit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close.</span> <span id="s444">And I also to -- to the very end always called him Papa.</span> <span id="s445">There were no qualifications to that.</span> <span id="s446">Now, Mima we have not talked about.</span> <span id="s447">Obviously, the person who really raised me, especially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima.</span> <span id="s448">I was told that I slept in her bed, slept with her.</span> <span id="s449">And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under her pillow and that she said that if ever the Germans came for me, she would kill me and then herself.</span> <span id="s450">Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that’s what I was told.</span> <span id="s451">I was very, very close to her.</span> <span id="s452">I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of Mima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I remember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive.</span> <span id="s453">Mima tragically died shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s454">She died in October 1945 of a cerebral hemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s455">And I do remember visiting her grave many times.</span> <span id="s456">I also remember going back there to -- to the grave when Papa Madna buried his favorite canary in -- in the same grave, the gravesite.</span> <span id="s457">And many, many years later I went to visit the grave with Papa Madna.</span> <span id="s458">And th-there -- there was a woman at the gate, who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a Caucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and recognized me from the little child who had come to visit the grave of Mima.</span> <span id="s459">And I was able to find the grave without anybody telling me where it was.</span> <span id="s460">So there was a very sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory of her alive, but I do remember her grave very well, very distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Were there any times when it was very dangerous?</span> <span id="s462">Did any Germans come to the house?</span> <span id="s463">Was there any particular incidents like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I have no direct memories of any particular dangerous times, but I do remember being asked to hide in this -- it’s not -- a little cellar.</span> <span id="s465">Was a space, I thought it was beneath the stairs, but I’m not quite sure there were stairs there.</span> <span id="s466">There was a little cellar and th-that’s where all the families -- the families’ Christmas decorations were -- were -- were actually kept, and I -- I remember playing with them while the house apparently was being searched.</span> <span id="s467">Another memory that I have of the house besi -- I mentioned the little barrel before -- my very favorite place in the house was actually the kneehole of Papa Madna’s desk.</span> <span id="s468">It was sort of a dark mahogany desk and I -- I still very distinctly remember that kneehole.</span> <span id="s469">I also remember opening one of the drawers one time and finding a gun and then closing the drawer again.</span> <span id="s470">And I -- I didn’t tell anybody about it at the time, but told Papa Madna about it many, many years later and he was absolutely shocked that I had seen it and remembered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s472">So what did -- what were you told that you did during the day?</span> <span id="s473">You just played with Mima, and -- the other children were at school, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I think I just -- I -- I really -- I -- I don’t know, specifically.</span> <span id="s475">I did play with some of the children next door, there were other young children, and I have some photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: But only in your backyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: On -- only in our backyard.</span> <span id="s478">And I -- I did have my toys, and I did look out the mail slot to the outside, but just was confined to the house.</span> <span id="s479">But I -- I really do not recall anything sp-specific as to what -- what I did in the house during those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Do you have any memories of what it was like to look through the mail slot to see the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Not really, you know.</span> <span id="s482">I-I remember doing it, and standing there and evy -- and even the mail sl -- even though the mail slot was very low, to me it seemed very high, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s483">You know, van Kinsbergenstraat was actually a very quiet street, there wasn’t much going on, even there.</span> <span id="s484">And so I think I spent more time, really, in the backyard than anywhere else, which was enclosed, so that people really couldn’t look in very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: And these two people were your parents at the time, Mima and -- and Mr. Madna were your mama and your papa.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s487">And that was, you know, became very difficult, of course, when I was reunited with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: While this was -- while you were at the Madna’s, what was happening with your two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Unfortunately there was -- a fight apparently had broken out between the husband and wife of the home where my sisters were hidden, and the husband denounced of his wife and of my two sisters to the Germans.</span> <span id="s490">And so his wife and my two sisters were deported.</span> <span id="s491">They were taken to Westerbork, and were actually there at about the same time as my mother.</span> <span id="s492">Either there, or subsequently in Auschwitz [indecipherable] obviously they never saw each other.</span> <span id="s493">The woman, the wife eventually was liberated, but my sisters were deported from -- taken from Westerbork in 1944, early 1944 to -- to Auschwitz and they both died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s494">And it’s na -- something that we did not -- my mother did not find out until she returned, actually, back to Holland.</span> <span id="s495">I’m not sure whether my mother had had any warning when she was still in Sweden.</span> <span id="s496">I -- I just -- we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s497">I really don’t know exactly when she found out.</span> <span id="s498">I don’t think she found out until she actually returned to Holland, what had happened to my sisters.</span> <span id="s499">My mother was so upset at the time, obviously, that she -- she squeezed -- she developed this habit of squeezing her fi -- her hand with -- with her other hand, one hand with the other and she actually developed an infection in her fingers.</span> <span id="s500">It was -- you know, she squeezed so hard.</span> <span id="s501">I remember very distinctly the time when I was reunited with my mother, finally.</span> <span id="s502">This was in -- in August 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Well, let’s back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: When -- do you have any memories of the time when the war was over in Holland?</span> <span id="s506">Any celebrations?</span> <span id="s507">Do you have any thoughts or any memories of that time?</span> <span id="s508">A: Well, this is where, you know, my -- my old memories and -- and the memories of others, you know, begin to sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: -- flow together.</span> <span id="s511">I do remember leaving the house and I-I’m told I was all dressed up in -- in the national colors of -- of Holland, and watching a parade.</span> <span id="s512">It’s interesting because I don’t have any direct memory of that, but I do have a memory of about eight months later or so, being with my mother at the place where we watched the parade and telling her that’s where I was with Mima.</span> <span id="s513">That memory I do have, which is -- which is interesting.</span> <span id="s514">And -- and my mother really didn’t believe me at the time, and she had to -- she verified this with the family.</span> <span id="s515">But other than that, I really don’t have any -- any specific memories of -- of the months before my mother returned.</span> <span id="s516">When I was -- I -- I was sleeping the night she came back and someone came to wake me up.</span> <span id="s517">I don’t know who it was.</span> <span id="s518">I think it was one of my sisters, foster sisters, Davy or Willy.</span> <span id="s519">And I went to the front room of the house where everybody was sitting in a circle.</span> <span id="s520">And I was crying because I was unhappy about being woken up, and I was being passed around from lap to lap.</span> <span id="s521">And I do remember very distinctly refusing to sit in a strange woman’s lap, and that, of course, was my own mother.</span> <span id="s522">And it took awhile for my mother to -- for me to get used to my mother, and to be -- I -- I have no specific memories of all the things that happened.</span> <span id="s523">One thing my mother told me was that she as -- she told Mima -- she -- she got tickets for Mima to go to a movie, which was something very special at that time, and just so -- so that my mother would have some time alone with me.</span> <span id="s524">And Mima left the house and then came back a few minutes later and told my mother, don’t hit him.</span> <span id="s525">Just -- that’s how protective, of course, Mima was, even vis-à-vis with my mother.</span> <span id="s526">Initially my mother and I stayed with the Madna family and then my mother found an apar -- was a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s527">Well, these were furnished rooms, really.</span> <span id="s528">Again, somewhere not far from where our original home had been on Laanformairdafort, another -- sort of all in the same general area.</span> <span id="s529">It was an apartment upstairs and a woman and her daughter lived there and they -- they rented out the front room.</span> <span id="s530">I do remember that they had a little dog.</span> <span id="s531">You know, it’s funny what children remember.</span> <span id="s532">Little dachshund.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: How long did -- did your mother stay at the Madna’s?</span> <span id="s534">She stayed with you at the Madna’s for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: I think it was a few weeks, I’m not sure entirely, cause then we moved with -- to this first apartment and I think we were only there for a month or two and then moved to a larger apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: D-Do you have any memories of leaving the Madna house?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: You know, I think that this -- I -- I don’t, and I think part of that is because it was a very gradual thing.</span> <span id="s538">I still spent a lot of time with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: -- initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: I mean, you were -- you were only -- close to four years old, you were still a very young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I think it’s really only probably after Mima died that I moved entirely with, or primarily with -- with my mother.</span> <span id="s543">And she -- sh -- she had to go out of the house to try to make a living, and the reason I say that I -- I -- I was really away from the Madna family at that point, because I remember one time having trouble getting into the apartment and that was because my mother was away, she was actually selling some of the merchandise that my father had left behind from his tailoring business.</span> <span id="s544">Fabrics were very valuable at the time and he had many factories that owed him fabrics from -- from England.</span> <span id="s545">And that’s -- that was her first business, was selling those.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Who kept up his stock while he was taken away?</span> <span id="s547">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s548">This was not in his store any more, the store was -- was gone, had been taken over.</span> <span id="s549">So these -- this was really more a credit sort of -- and my mother, actually, her initial work was out of a suitcase.</span> <span id="s550">But then I remember the day when -- when I couldn’t get into the house, she was extremely upset and that’s when she decided to -- to start her own business, basically and she bought us a store.</span> <span id="s551">But this was over a fairly long period of time.</span> <span id="s552">I would imagine -- I think she bought the store probably about 1947 or so.</span> <span id="s553">I’m not entirely sure because I had already gone to kindergarten at a -- at a school that was around the corner from that second apartment that we lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Was that a hard adjustment, to leave, to go to a strange school?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I love difficulties mixing with other children.</span> <span id="s556">I don’t remember too much to -- having too many difficulties at the kindergarten, actually, but I do remember my mother sending me to a summer camp.</span> <span id="s557">And that -- that created tre-tremendous difficulties and fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Was it a Jewish camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: It was a Jewish camp called Wijk aan Zee, not too far from -- from Amsterdam and I was surrounded by very, very rowdy Jewish kids who had all been in hiding and who all had, in retrospect, tremendous difficulties, you know, they were very difficult to control.</span> <span id="s560">And I had come from a t -- you know, very quiet household, basically.</span> <span id="s561">I had had it easy compared to -- to many of them.</span> <span id="s562">And I was -- so I -- I just did not fit in, and I had trouble, you know, wi-with that.</span> <span id="s563">So then the next place that my mother sent me to for summer vacation was not a summer camp, but it was actually a private home where I went with m -- friends of my mother in a -- in a town called Appledorn.</span> <span id="s564">And th-that’s -- that worked out much, much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Y-You have actual memories of th -- of those experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Of?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Of being with those children who were rowdy, and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Very much so, yeah.</span> <span id="s569">I remember vomiting every day and really being sick and then finally my mother, you know, take me -- took me back.</span> <span id="s570">I -- I did not last one we -- I think I lasted about a week and then she took me back, and -- because it d -- it just did not work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: How was your proficiency in Dutch?</span> <span id="s572">Were you -- you said you -- you knew Indonesian at the time.</span> <span id="s573">Were -- were you also being brought up as a youngster to speak Dutch when you were with the Madnas?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I don’t remember ever having any difficulties when I was in -- when I started kindergarten or school, so I think I -- I -- I think I was pretty fluent in Dutch.</span> <span id="s575">As I said, I d -- I never -- I don’t remember ever speaking Malay, so this was really very, very early on.</span> <span id="s576">It’s only in speaking to Robby and Davy that I -- you know, that I was told that I -- I really did communicate and answered in -- in Malay whenever I was spoken to.</span> <span id="s577">And I was able to understand Mima.</span> <span id="s578">But -- but I must have, you know, learned Dutch at that time as well from the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did you ask your mother about the rest of the family?</span> <span id="s580">Again, I know you were very young at this time, but when you were -- in the beginning, those first few years after the war, did you ask her?</span> <span id="s581">And if so, how did she answer you?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: I learned about my sisters and -- and about my -- my father very, very early on.</span> <span id="s583">The interesting thing is, you know, that at that time my story was not unique.</span> <span id="s584">So having sisters who were deported was not unusual.</span> <span id="s585">And so it didn’t particularly shock me, it didn’t particularly affect me.</span> <span id="s586">They were just gone.</span> <span id="s587">And my mother -- my mother’s neighbor, the Van Luhrmann family, they were both schoolteachers and they had taught my sisters how to -- to read and write at a very, very young age.</span> <span id="s588">And they and my mother had saved all of my sisters’ notebooks.</span> <span id="s589">And my mother would show me those notebooks.</span> <span id="s590">And this -- this was before I started elementary school, so it was really pretty soon after the war that she showed me those.</span> <span id="s591">She had portraits of my sisters that were -- that were hanging in -- in the -- in the apartment.</span> <span id="s592">So again I knew certainly, of them.</span> <span id="s593">She told me many stories about my sisters.</span> <span id="s594">They were held out, really as a example to me in many ways.</span> <span id="s595">And so I got to know my sisters through my mother’s words and also through her neighbors, the Van Luhrmann family.</span> <span id="s596">They v -- also showed me -- my mother showed me the notebooks that -- that my sister Eva was writing in.</span> <span id="s597">I don’t think my sister Leah was -- she was much younger, obviously did not know how to -- to write, but the Van Luhrmann family also showed me books, and they were actually -- because, as I said before, my sisters had gone to a Catholic religious school, so she would show me books, little Catholic books that my sisters were able to read.</span> <span id="s598">And I remember had a little devil one side, a little angel on the other side.</span> <span id="s599">And I -- I remember very distinctly looking at those.</span> <span id="s600">My mother always told me that she -- she had decided that she did not want me to learn how to read at a very young age.</span> <span id="s601">She thought somehow that this was a jinx.</span> <span id="s602">That when -- when, you know, my sisters were so precocious in their reading and writing, that somehow had something to do with -- with their -- with their fate.</span> <span id="s603">And so in my case, my mother really did not encourage that.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Who watched over your parent’s belongings while you were gone?</span> <span id="s605">You said your mother had pictures of your sister, or portraits, or other things.</span> <span id="s606">Who -- who oversaw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: The Van Luhrmann family next door had some of the things.</span> <span id="s608">There were others also who -- who had hidden things, and we sort of gradually -- my mother gradually had things returned to her.</span> <span id="s609">Again, you know, this -- this was sort of part of normal life, to have things returned.</span> <span id="s610">All the people we had contact with after the war were people who were -- either had survived the concentration camps or people who had been in hiding, so that was normal conversation.</span> <span id="s611">You know, it was how you survived.</span> <span id="s612">How did you survive, what did you do?</span> <span id="s613">It’s without -- with very little emotion, as far as I can remember, actually, because it was so much -- just an everyday occurrence.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: The same thing, for example, one of the families that we were very close with after the war was the Vanderpool family.</span> <span id="s616">Hela Vanderpool was a woman who had gone through all the concentration camps with my mother.</span> <span id="s617">And she was younger than my mother.</span> <span id="s618">Also came from the same general area in Poland, Galicia.</span> <span id="s619">And after the war married a -- a Dutch man.</span> <span id="s620">Her -- her maiden name was Helen -- Helen Enwine and then she married Max Vanderpool.</span> <span id="s621">And my mother remained very close friends with her.</span> <span id="s622">Probably -- she was probably my mother’s closest friend.</span> <span id="s623">And the only housing that they could find in The Hague was in the attic of one house that was sort of left standing in this entire bombed out neighborhood.</span> <span id="s624">And I remember this is a time my mother already had her store, taking this very, very long walk across this bombed out area, this -- this -- all this debris and rubble, through the rubble to this house where they lived, this attic.</span> <span id="s625">And again, it was -- it was a joyful occasion to take those walks.</span> <span id="s626">I thought it was the most normal thing to do, was to take a walk across, you know, bombed out rubble.</span> <span id="s627">I remember thinking that it was the most normal thing to find bunkers with shells on the beach.</span> <span id="s628">Again, this was just part of normal growing up after World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s631">This is tape number two, side B. And let’s now talk about your schooling after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Well, before I even started schooling, my mother, who as I said before, did not really want me to learn how to read or write before had to teach me some other things.</span> <span id="s633">And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for theater, and for theater type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those.</span> <span id="s634">She would tell me things that -- plays that she had done when she was a young girl, young -- growing up in Poland, she was part of a -- a theater company.</span> <span id="s635">And I would remember those, and that’s -- and I would -- I would actually start playing those before I even learned how to read or write, with a puppet theater.</span> <span id="s636">That became one of my favorite toys.</span> <span id="s637">Another thing that really fascinated me, probably because I had spent those early years completely confined to the house was the tramway outside and going from place to place on -- on public -- this public conveyance, on the tramway.</span> <span id="s638">And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the tramway, the local tramway.</span> <span id="s639">And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war for my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature tram.</span> <span id="s640">And right about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were changed on the tramway.</span> <span id="s641">And I remember, since I didn’t know how to read or write yet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the number on my tramway.</span> <span id="s642">It’s a very, very distinct memory I have.</span> <span id="s643">This was just about the time when I started kindergarten.</span> <span id="s644">The kindergarten was right around the corner from the house that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called Archimaidastraat [indecipherable] street -- straat in -- in -- in The Hague and right around the corner was the first school that I went to.</span> <span id="s645">And I do remember very distinctly enjoying kindergarten, doing all the things pe -- children do in kindergarten, you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that very distinctly.</span> <span id="s646">Little artwork, bringing that home, learning about some -- some holidays.</span> <span id="s647">For example, I -- I learned about Mother’s day through kindergarten and bringing home a card that I had made for my mother.</span> <span id="s648">I also remember going shopping to buy my mother a gift, and it was a geranium.</span> <span id="s649">That was the first plant.</span> <span id="s650">I went to a store and asked her, you know, if she has this much money, whatever it was, I said, what would she get?</span> <span id="s651">And so that’s -- that was the first time I ever bought a gift for my mother.</span> <span id="s652">I think for her birthday, which was very close actually, since that was May 20th -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of perfume which I accidentally dropped.</span> <span id="s653">Also one of those -- those childhood memories.</span> <span id="s654">I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of me, and phew, it fell to the floor as th -- as she opened the door.</span> <span id="s655">After -- it was after kindergarten that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business.</span> <span id="s656">That was in a -- that was a -- a cosmetic store, perfume store.</span> <span id="s657">It was in the --in -- not in a very good neighborhood, quite far away from where we had lived before and where I had spent my years with the Madnas.</span> <span id="s658">This was near the -- one the train stations in The Hague.</span> <span id="s659">Little bit of a red light district, as a matter of fact, and certainly non -- not a wealthy neighborhood, but it was the only -- housing was extremely short in Holland because o f-- in The Hague especially, because such a big part of the city had been bombed out by the allies, actually.</span> <span id="s660">And so we -- she found this -- this store, this perfume store from a man who -- it was called Parfumerie Idajale, and she bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to South America.</span> <span id="s661">And she took over the store and we lived in back of the store.</span> <span id="s662">And then I -- she -- she had to decided on a school for me to go to -- decided that the -- the public schools were just not the greatest in that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s663">There was a -- a Catholic school right across the street from us, but for whatever reason, my mother did not want to go that route -- route again, because probably it brought back too many memories of my sisters.</span> <span id="s664">So instead, I went to a -- a private Protestant school called the Weeshuis, it was called Weeshuis, it means orphanage.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t know whether there -- there ever was an orphanage attached to that school at one point, but that was what it was called, the orphanage school.</span> <span id="s666">Which was a fair distance from -- from home, but not -- not too great and I -- I was able to walk to school by myself, and I went there for my -- for the first few grades, first two grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Was that a pleasant experience?</span> <span id="s668">Did you find a better adjustment with the other children then you did in the summer experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Oh definitely, I -- I did very well in -- in elementary school, I did very well in -- I did very well in kindergarten and I did very well, I had no trouble whatsoever in elementary school in terms of fact, you know, I sort of became a leader among ah, the children.</span> <span id="s670">I had no trouble making friends at all.</span> <span id="s671">There was an incident with -- with a schoolteacher who sang a song that had some inappropriate words in it and I told my mother about it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: You mean anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No, no, not anti-Semitic, just sexual.</span> <span id="s674">And he made some gestures that were inappropriate and I told my mother about it, and I -- you know, the teacher and the principal of the school, with whom we were very good friends, my mother had become close friends with the fre -- with the principal and I was very close friends with the principal’s son.</span> <span id="s675">His name was Bati Bos, B-o-s.</span> <span id="s676">And they came over to the house and I was confronted, I was asked to -- to confront the teacher and tell them what -- what had happened, and I did.</span> <span id="s677">And after that my mother decided to change schools and I then went on, took a tramway actually to go back to take -- to -- to attend the school in the neighborhood where we had lived before the war, because my mother really felt those were the better schools.</span> <span id="s678">And that was a public school.</span> <span id="s679">And that’s where I went for third and fourth grades [indecipherable] something approximately, and I again, you know, enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s680">And then subsequently then, after that, is when we -- when we moved to Belgium.</span> <span id="s681">And so I attended schools in -- in Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: When did you move to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: We moved to Brussels, if I remember correctly, probably 1952 -- either 19 -- some time between 1950 and 1952 is when we moved to Belgium.</span> <span id="s684">And my mother at that point, at the -- was considering or attempting a remarriage that -- that utterly failed, but we did end up living in Belgium for several years.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Was that hard for you, to leave the Madnas?</span> <span id="s686">A: It was difficult to leave the Madnas and by then also I had become very close with -- with other friends of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s687">For example, one family that we’re v -- we were very, very close with was a family that lived -- called Ravensbergan.</span> <span id="s688">Husband was Truus, T-r-u-u-s, and Piet, P-i-e-t.</span> <span id="s689">They -- my -- my Uncle Emil, whom I mentioned earlier, had actually been hidden with them in this little town called Rijnsburg, outside of Leiden.</span> <span id="s690">And -- but he was -- he was found out by the Germans and was deported.</span> <span id="s691">And I never really found out anything else about him.</span> <span id="s692">I have no new information whatsoever.</span> <span id="s693">But we became very close friends with the Ravensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there.</span> <span id="s694">We would take the train, first to Leiden and then a second, more local tramway, actually [indecipherable] tramway to the town of -- of -- of -- where they lived.</span> <span id="s695">And I -- I would spend weekends there, or sometimes a week and I would ver -- I was very, very close with those people.</span> <span id="s696">By that time the Vanderpool family had left for the United States.</span> <span id="s697">They emigrated du -- in 1948 to the United States, so that was a loss for my mother.</span> <span id="s698">And that’s, I think, when she became really very -- even closer friends with -- with these -- the Ravensbergan in -- in Rijnsburg.</span> <span id="s699">And we would go there almost every other weekend.</span> <span id="s700">And -- and leaving them when we moved to Brussels was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s701">And I remember catching rides periodically to get back to visit them.</span> <span id="s702">Rijnsburg is a -- is an area where it’s in the middle of all the flower fields of Holland, the flower industry.</span> <span id="s703">And trucks with flowers would go to Belgium to deliver them to the market.</span> <span id="s704">And when these trucks would go back empty I would catch a ride with them to go back and visit the family from Brussels.</span> <span id="s705">So I remained in very close contact with them as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Was your mother extremely protective of you when you were young, after the war because of what you went through?</span> <span id="s707">Did -- did you sense that maybe more than other parents of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: When you were in elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s711">It’s hard to say, you know, because it’s -- it’s compared to what, you know, I have no -- I have no way of comparing.</span> <span id="s712">I-I don’t f -- you know, I -- when I was in elementary school I became -- I had -- I became very, very ill.</span> <span id="s713">I had a ruptured appendix.</span> <span id="s714">And this was in my first year in elementary school, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s715">And at that -- at that time there was no -- there were no antibiotics, as yet.</span> <span id="s716">Penicillin had just come out.</span> <span id="s717">So I was really very, very sick.</span> <span id="s718">I was in the hospital for about 10 weeks altogether.</span> <span id="s719">And my mother had a tremendous fear that she was going to lose me at that time.</span> <span id="s720">And she talked about that, a lot.</span> <span id="s721">And that’s -- that’s when I really found out how much I meant to her, that -- that -- you know.</span> <span id="s722">I was the one thing that kept her going, and she told me that many, many, many times.</span> <span id="s723">So yes, you know, she was very protective.</span> <span id="s724">But at the same time, for example, did allow me to play outside, did allow me to have friends, encouraged me to walk to school by myself, even though there was some danger there.</span> <span id="s725">And one time I was almost hit by a car.</span> <span id="s726">But nonetheless, sh-she did allow me that freedom and she allowed me to grow up, basically.</span> <span id="s727">So she was not overly protective.</span> <span id="s728">She also tried to encourage me to mix with other children.</span> <span id="s729">Hence, you know, the -- the camp I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s730">I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary school in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder, to a -- a Hebrew school which was in a building adjacent to the big synagogue in The Hague.</span> <span id="s731">And that was a very, very long walk actually.</span> <span id="s732">But I [indecipherable] my mother never accompanied me.</span> <span id="s733">She couldn’t, she had her store.</span> <span id="s734">And she certainly allowed me to go there by myself, and I -- I do remember attending the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s735">I remember also her warning, because I was -- the -- the Protestant school was extremely good at teaching Bible, and so she -- she told -- and I was very good at that, so she told me, don’t repeat in the afternoon, what you learned in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Did you feel very Jewish then, when you were that young?</span> <span id="s737">You really knew you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I definitely knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s739">I -- certainly my mother made -- you know, sent me to the cheder very, very early on.</span> <span id="s740">I think at the same time, virtually that I started elementary school, I started going to the cheder, which wasn’t much of a school at the time because there were very, very few kids left.</span> <span id="s741">My teacher was the cantor of the synagogue, Mr. Mussel, and I -- I don’t remember too much of what we -- what he ler -- what he taught us, but I -- and shortly -- it was around that time also, when my mother definitely found out that my father had died, when we got documentation through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s742">My mother had a very good friend who worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Liza.</span> <span id="s743">And he managed to speed things up so that we got documents from the Red Cross explaining exactly what had happened to my father.</span> <span id="s744">And as soon as we found out when he had died exactly, we -- my mother di -- encouraged me to learn to say Kaddish and to go to the synagogue on his Yahrzeit.</span> <span id="s745">And I probably was about six or seven when I started doing that.</span> <span id="s746">And I also remember going, certainly, to the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, on Yom Kippur with my mother.</span> <span id="s747">I remember very distinctly, for example -- you know, that -- this was an Orthodox synagogue in The Hague and so the women sat in the gallery upstairs and of course, there I was all by myself downstairs, and I had to be adopted by some -- some of the men downstairs, yes.</span> <span id="s748">And I remember for the first time th-the honor of rolling up the -- the scroll, the Torah scroll is usually given to a child in Holland, and I remember being given the honor.</span> <span id="s749">And then afterwards, you know, going over and shaking the hand of the president of the congregation, or the parness, as we called him there, and then rushing upstairs to the balcony to ask my mother if I had done okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Did she observe the Sabbath at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s752">She -- she certainly lit candles on Friday night and she observed Pesach, very distinctly I remember.</span> <span id="s753">The Pesach I remember most distinctly was in -- in 1948, and the reason I remember it is because my mother was telling me the story about the Egyptians, and then at the same time there was the Arab Israeli war.</span> <span id="s754">And I remember asking how -- her how this was possible since all the Egyptians had already been defeated.</span> <span id="s755">Passover.</span> <span id="s756">So that was -- that was -- I remember that.</span> <span id="s757">I remember, you know, going out and buying matzos, which were hard to get in Holland.</span> <span id="s758">They were round and came in special boxes.</span> <span id="s759">The other thing was that -- that I remember in terms of -- of -- of Jewish things is that I had -- a-as I indicated before, I went to a Protestant school, and either the principal of the school or someone passed out -- passed my name on to a -- a pastor, a p -- a Protestant pastor who was a Jewish convert, by the name of Suril Tabachsblaat.</span> <span id="s760">And he came to my mother’s store with the idea, I think, of trying to convert her to becoming Protestant.</span> <span id="s761">But by the time he left the store, she had sent him on errands in Antwerp, she knew he was going to Antwerp, and so he brought back mezuzahs and a siddur, which we didn’t have, you know, none of that was left.</span> <span id="s762">And to this day the mezuzah on my door is the mezuzah that Mr. Tabachsblaat brought back from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s763">She also persuaded him to let her -- and I don’t think it took much -- she told him, she said we were going to have a Seder and she said, you know, Seder is not necessarily a Jewish thing, why don’t you have a Seder in your church?</span> <span id="s764">And she -- she persuaded him, something that became very commonplace afterwards, to have a Seder in the church.</span> <span id="s765">And my mother spoke to his congregants about the Jewish lifecycle events.</span> <span id="s766">And my mother, in many ways, I think, rediscovered Judaism after the war.</span> <span id="s767">Her experiences in the concentration camps did not seem to lessen her faith, but if anything increased it, and she became much more interested in Judaism after the war.</span> <span id="s768">Before the war she -- she used the word, searching.</span> <span id="s769">After the war there was no searching any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: When you were at this Protestant school, where there other J-Jewish children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No, there were no other Jewish children at the -- at the Protestant school, I wa -- as far as I know, I was the only one there.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Were you accepted by the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s774">I -- I don’t think there was a -- as I said, you know, I was very close friends, for example, with the -- the son of the principal.</span> <span id="s775">The principal’s wife was also one of the schoolteachers and I -- I remember watching her grading papers and things like that and spending a lot of time in their household, and I had many other children in the playground.</span> <span id="s776">And I had no difficulty, you know, playing games with them.</span> <span id="s777">I remember our favorite game -- my favorite game at that time, because I enjoyed going to -- Papa Madna had taken me to the circus and my mother took me to the circus in Holland, which is really a big deal over there, and I remember playing circus in -- in the playground with the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Then, did your mother talk about your father and the children as you got older -- your sisters, as they -- got older, was it a big topic of conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Well, as I said before, my mother showed me my sister’s notebooks and through the Van Luhrmann family I also -- you know, we constantly talked about my sisters.</span> <span id="s780">Maybe a little bit less so about my father except my mother did tell me about the -- his store, and what it looked like and the furniture they had bought.</span> <span id="s781">In many ways he was really kept, you know, in the family and very early on she gave me a -- a pen, a Parker pen that belonged to him, which I have -- which I still have.</span> <span id="s782">That sort of became a good luck charm.</span> <span id="s783">Whenever I took an exam or anything, she told me to take the pen along and use that pen for writing.</span> <span id="s784">So she -- she -- she really tried, you know, to impress on me who my father was.</span> <span id="s785">Said things like, you know, your father is with you.</span> <span id="s786">And when -- whenever, you know, there were moments of difficulty, or -- or sadness, or po-potential difficulties, we -- I do remember fairly early on after the war, visiting the woman who had hidden my sisters, where my sisters had been hidden.</span> <span id="s787">She and her husband, as far as I know, separated, so he was not there.</span> <span id="s788">But my mother took me in to what -- t-to what me seemed -- seemed like a very long trip actually on the tramway, way outside The Hague, somewhere near the beach is where this woman lived.</span> <span id="s789">And it was very important to my mother to thank this woman and let her know that at least one of the children had survived and to relieve some of this woman’s guilt.</span> <span id="s790">And my mother gave her some -- some money, some gifts.</span> <span id="s791">I don’t know whether my mother had any subsequent contact with her.</span> <span id="s792">That must obviously have been an incredibly difficult time.</span> <span id="s793">We also had continued contact with the two priests, one of them I mentioned before, Father Schulling, the other one was called Father Lodders, L-o-d-d-e-r-s, and he was -- oh, he was much younger though, Schulling was the older man and Lodders was a -- a younger, Jesuit priest.</span> <span id="s794">And he would come to visit my mother’s store quite frequently on his motor bike.</span> <span id="s795">And I -- I very much remember him also.</span> <span id="s796">And in some ways they -- they also encouraged me in Judaism.</span> <span id="s797">Not too many forms, actually, the -- you know, is -- I was at my -- my mother took great pride in exposing me in an ha -- to -- to many different beliefs.</span> <span id="s798">It was very important to her, which is really amazing after what she went through, to -- to have a respect and an understanding of other religions.</span> <span id="s799">And she would take great pride, for example, at birthday parties for me, in counting around the table how many different religions she had represented.</span> <span id="s800">And there were always very devout Catholics, there were the Madnas, who were probably Moslem in origin.</span> <span id="s801">There were the Protestant family from -- from Rijnsburg.</span> <span id="s802">And you have to understand that in Holland, Protestants and Catholics do not speak to each other.</span> <span id="s803">But there they were, all around the table for my birthday.</span> <span id="s804">And then there were Jewish members, and some of them were very Orthodox Jewish, and my mother took tremendous pride in bringing -- and in the convert Minister.</span> <span id="s805">And my mother took tremendous pride in bringing all these people around the table.</span> <span id="s806">This was very, very important to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: You had mentioned that when you went to visit the woman who sheltered your sisters, your mother wanted to give her some gifts.</span> <span id="s808">Had j -- had your folks given any money to the Madnas to take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, they didn’t give any money, as far as I know, to the Madnas, or they had th -- in other words, there was no money paid for my -- for -- for -- for them sheltering me.</span> <span id="s810">They did give them some ration cards and ration coupons so that they could obtain food for me.</span> <span id="s811">There may have been some money, you know, to -- to -- to help take care of me, defray expenses, basically.</span> <span id="s812">But they certainly weren’t paid, you know, to take care of me.</span> <span id="s813">There was no -- no -- no, there was no monetary gain to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: And what about the family that took your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: I think it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s816">No, it was really -- my sisters, th -- all their possessions were taken to them.</span> <span id="s817">And again, the most important thing at that time was ration cards, and I remember what they looked like, even.</span> <span id="s818">I remember immediately after the war even, you know, when rationing continued, going with my mother to get those ration cards at an -- at an office and standing on line to get them.</span> <span id="s819">So I was -- I was very familiar with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: And then you also mentioned the probab -- possibly the Moslem background of the Madnas.</span> <span id="s821">Were there any holidays or any traditions that you -- that they carried out while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Christmas was the only holiday because I remember the decorations.</span> <span id="s823">They had a Christmas tree and it was decorated.</span> <span id="s824">There were no electric lights, but I remember there were real candles in the -- in -- in the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s825">I’m not entirely sure whether there was one during the war years, or whether the one that I remember was immediately after.</span> <span id="s826">I th -- it may have been immediately after when my mother was actually in -- I just remembered that now, is when my mother was actually living there with us.</span> <span id="s827">She was there at the time, also.</span> <span id="s828">So this may -- this -- this may have been the first Christmas, 1945, but I’m not --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: I -- I -- I thought you said she stayed a few weeks with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s831">Or whether she came back, we came back to stay with them, that may have been, but -- but it’s -- I remember my mother being there for -- for that Christmas at -- at -- at the Madnas.</span> <span id="s832">And we may have had the trees before.</span> <span id="s833">I do remember that, you know, seeing the decorations before, but that’s where sort of memories blend into each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s835">Did you have any hobbies when you were a small child?</span> <span id="s836">Any -- or did you like sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: I didn’t play many sp -- any sports, I -- I rode a bicycle, but what I -- my -- th-the earliest hobby that I had as a child carried through from the puppet theater.</span> <span id="s838">I u -- I used to really take the puppet theater to all my friends birthdays an-and have puppet plays for them.</span> <span id="s839">And then the next phase after that, related to that is when I started writing plays, and I started doing that when I was what, about six or seven, as soon as I learned how to -- to write.</span> <span id="s840">I still have some of those early manuscripts and they were based on stories that my mother told me.</span> <span id="s841">And my f-first play was produced in elementary school, and I remember taking down my mother’s curtains -- draperies, to make -- fashion curtains for my stage.</span> <span id="s842">I also had little gifts for the teachers, to get them to send their kids in to watch my play.</span> <span id="s843">And I’m ashamed to admit it now, but I had little packets of cigarettes and had little samples, soap samples, I remember those, they were in the shape of a hand, because those are things my mother got in her store.</span> <span id="s844">So those -- I handed those out to entice people to come and watch my play.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s847">This is tape number three, side A, and you were talking about your performances and your playwriting ability.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Well, this was something that really was encouraged by my mother, who had a tremendous love for theater.</span> <span id="s849">My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I could never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting.</span> <span id="s850">And I also learned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s851">When we would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in Rijnsburg, another religious angle, I would also always go to church with the family.</span> <span id="s852">And after the church service I would be able to repeat the sermon that I had heard almost verbatim.</span> <span id="s853">And so that’s -- that’s really where I learned public speaking, and I’ve -- I’ve always enjoyed that, and it’s -- it’s a very, very valuable experience I had.</span> <span id="s854">But the interesting thing is again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a variety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish foundations would remain very, very strong.</span> <span id="s855">One more thing in the involvement in terms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned, you know, attending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s856">My guess is that it would probably have been ’46 - ’47 approximately, probably more ’47 because I remember where we lived at the t -- we were living at the time.</span> <span id="s857">My mother already had her store, and she would dress me up as a Karen Kayemet collection box.</span> <span id="s858">And I won second prize, actually.</span> <span id="s859">First prize was to a girl who was dressed up as a Sabbath queen.</span> <span id="s860">And that -- that was a very, very major event.</span> <span id="s861">Actually, you know, now -- now that I think about it, prior to this Purim fe -- feast, it was also an even earlier experience that I had, which was a Hanukkah party earlier, because I remember very distinctly the kinds of gifts that we got.</span> <span id="s862">And they were not toys, they were not books, they were socks and very common things that people needed immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s863">So that -- that probably was -- may have been the end of ’45 - ’46, something like that.</span> <span id="s864">As I remember also, related to that, going with my mother to -- to a place where packages would arrive from overseas, and one of my mother’s brothers had survived and escaped to Bolivia and he arranged for packages to be sent from the United States to us.</span> <span id="s865">And I remember going with my mother to collect those packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: What about the extended members of your parents’ families?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: As far as we know, the -- the only person who -- who survived for sure was one of my mother’s brothers, Adolf, or Abraham Munzer.</span> <span id="s868">And he managed to leave Germany on th -- right after, or right around Kristallnacht, and the only country that he could go to was Bolivia.</span> <span id="s869">He had married a German woman who converted to Judaism, and they had one son, Norbert and the three of them managed to escape to Bolivia.</span> <span id="s870">My mother’s sister in Berlin was deported eventually, and -- with her family, her son Yossi, who was exactly the same age as Norbert, they sort of looked alike, and I have some beautiful photographs of the two of them.</span> <span id="s871">But sh -- that part of the entire -- of the family was deported and all of the ones who remained behind, the immediate family that remi -- remained behind in Rymanow, or my father’s side in Kanczuga, they all died at concentration camps.</span> <span id="s872">There were some cousins of my mother, an aunt of my mother who survived and we did not find out about that until we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s873">But she managed -- she survived with eight children, which was totally am-amazing, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Were your parents strong Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: My mother was a member of some Zionist youth organizations, but I don’t know how strong Zionists they were.</span> <span id="s876">My mother, you know, did face the choice of after the war, whether we should come to -- go to Israel or come to the United States.</span> <span id="s877">And I know it was a difficult choice for her.</span> <span id="s878">A lot of people did mo -- who we had contact with in -- in Holland came -- went to Israel.</span> <span id="s879">And it was probably about equally divided.</span> <span id="s880">But she -- I guess I think she did not -- wasn’t ready for renewed hardship and she felt -- and that’s why we ca -- we eventually came to the United States, although that was not so many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Is there anything else you want to talk about before you move to Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Do I think -- no, if things come up we can come back -- we’ll backtrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: All right, okay.</span> <span id="s884">So then your mother decided to move to Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: That’s right, we moved to Brussels in 1952 and she sold her business in The Hague and we then remained in Brussels until 1958 when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s886">I attended scho -- my -- my education continued in Brussels and my mother made a decision that the s -- French speaking schools were better than the a -- that the Dutch spe -- the Flemish schools, so initially I went -- this -- this is where I did go to a full time Jewish school actually, called the E-École Israel Elite in -- in Brussels.</span> <span id="s887">And a little van would pick us up every day, make the rounds and pick up the children for the school.</span> <span id="s888">Not a very big school, probably had about a hundred students is my -- my guess, at most.</span> <span id="s889">And I went there for approximately two years and then graduated and went to -- in -- in Belgium they call it attenay or it’s li -- Lycée in French, or in France, but basically that’s -- that’s seventh grade.</span> <span id="s890">I started the -- the Atheneum School, and that was -- that was not a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s891">That was just a -- a public high school, in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Was it hard for you to leave Brussels -- leave to go to Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: It was hard because we had very -- you know, as I said, we had many close friends in Holland.</span> <span id="s894">My mother attempted a -- a remarriage, it didn’t work out, she -- it was someone, a man who was much older than she was.</span> <span id="s895">But at the same time, the positive thing that came out of that, we became very, very -- I became very close with his family in -- in Brussels, the Schumer family, and have maintained that friendship to the present day.</span> <span id="s896">They were very, very warm, very supportive to me and to my mother.</span> <span id="s897">Some of the members of the family live here in the United States, lived there at the time, they were coming back and forth between Belgium and -- and -- and the United States and others lived in -- in Brussels, actually.</span> <span id="s898">And they -- so that became my next family.</span> <span id="s899">I also became much more aware of -- of Jewish things, things Jewish after we moved to Brussels, Brussels had a much more active Jewish community, more synagogues.</span> <span id="s900">It even had some, as I said before, a -- a full time Jewish school that -- that had somehow survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: What about your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: And that’s where I had my Bar Mitzvah, in -- in Brussels, actually, in a fairly small synagogue, synagogue that was attached to a -- an old people’s home, nursing home actually.</span> <span id="s903">Nursing home or senior citizen home, and that’s where we had the Bar Mitzvah and it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s904">I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Did you have many friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Fair number.</span> <span id="s907">Not -- not a great number of friends.</span> <span id="s908">The friends of the Schumer family, they were all there, but I -- we had some neighbors were friends, but ah, Jewish community even in -- in -- in Brussels was fairly small, so certainly I did not have many, many friends.</span> <span id="s909">But nothing again, that seemed out of the ordinary f-for me, simply because that’s the way things were in Holland, you know, we weren’t -- it was much more of -- of a -- of a shock really, coming to the United States and becoming aware of the intensity of Jewish life and J-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s910">That, you know, was just -- it’s a totally different scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: What was your life like in high school, junior high school, high school.</span> <span id="s912">Did you talk about your early childhood with people?</span> <span id="s913">Were you accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I did not enjoy the Jewish day school particularly, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s915">It was -- I -- I just did not particularly get along well with my teachers.</span> <span id="s916">It’s the only school experience that I had that was negative, and I don’t know why it -- why that was particularly.</span> <span id="s917">I had a very good experience subsequently in the -- in the Belgian school, the Atheneum.</span> <span id="s918">And did very wer -- well, even though French was a new language to me, but still, you know, did very well.</span> <span id="s919">But there was some anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s920">It was very -- it was kind of subtle.</span> <span id="s921">There were several Jewish students in my class in the Atheneum, and we had religious -- Jewish religious instruction in the public school.</span> <span id="s922">There’s no separation of church and state in Belgium.</span> <span id="s923">And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently.</span> <span id="s924">People -- students basically pick what religion -- religious instruction they want to attend.</span> <span id="s925">So it could be protest -- they could go to a Protestant class, Catholic class, Jewish class, or one that was called ethics.</span> <span id="s926">And I did go to -- to a class with a Mr. Deener, and I think, you know, the entire class we only had two or three students at any one time because there were so few Jews in the class.</span> <span id="s927">But then one time -- I did not -- there were classes on Saturday mornings, that was part of the regular school week, and I did not go to those classes on Saturday mornings, and I remember -- and the principal, you know, contacted my mother and said that I -- I was in danger of failing, you know, because, you know, the Jewish students, you know, were -- were staying away on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s928">And that didn’t happen, the Jewish students graduated, you know, near the top of the class.</span> <span id="s929">But there was a -- that little bit, definitely.</span> <span id="s930">Anti-Semitism actually, hadn’t thought of this, but certainly was prevalent also in Holland, and I -- I remember when I was walking back from cheder being pursued by kids yelling dirty Jew and things like that, or the equivalent in Dutch.</span> <span id="s931">Was -- Jew with glasses was the term, I can’t translate it, burla yout.</span> <span id="s932">And that’s -- that’s -- that was a very common thing.</span> <span id="s933">So there was -- there was a fair amount --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: What did you do when you heard those expressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Just -- just ran.</span> <span id="s936">It was very frightening.</span> <span id="s937">Very, very frightening.</span> <span id="s938">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Did you tell your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s941">We talked about it and my mother had similar experiences, actually.</span> <span id="s942">One time she -- we were on -- in line to go to a -- a movie and the newsreels.</span> <span id="s943">And I don’t know, someone noticed my mother’s number and made a remark about, well there’s one they didn’t get.</span> <span id="s944">So it’s -- it’s -- there was still anti-Semitism after the war, certainly, in -- in -- in Holland and in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So then you stayed in Belgium until what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Well, in ninet -- I stayed -- I -- my mother stayed in Belgium til 1958.</span> <span id="s947">I stayed in Belgium til 1956.</span> <span id="s948">I had gone to summer came in Belgium in a -- a summer camp sponsored by yeshiva.</span> <span id="s949">I’d been to several summer camps, but the last one I went to was one sponsored by a -- a j -- a -- a yeshiva, actually, near Antwerp.</span> <span id="s950">And they encouraged my mother to send me to a yeshiva full time.</span> <span id="s951">I was not getting along with the man my mother had remarried and so that was one solution.</span> <span id="s952">And plus the fact that, you know, I was really encouraged.</span> <span id="s953">So we -- I went to a school in France, a yeshiva in France in a town called [indecipherable] and my mother took me there in -- in 1956 and that was a very, very wonderful experience, actually, a very, very positive experience.</span> <span id="s954">An extremely warm, caring atmosphere</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: So it wasn’t hard for you to keep picking up and changing where you lived, I mean you -- you had already, at a young age, had made so many moves.</span> <span id="s956">But you were able to adapt to that.</span> <span id="s957">How do you explain that?</span> <span id="s958">A: I don’t know, but it’s -- it’s just -- it’s just the facts, you know, that I did really da -- did make many changes, and somehow this -- this was a very, very different atmosphere.</span> <span id="s959">Obviously this was a very Orthodox yeshiva.</span> <span id="s960">It was -- the -- the head of the yeshiva was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s961">He was a student of the Chofetz Chaim, so it was -- you know.</span> <span id="s962">But I -- I somehow managed to fit in very -- fairly quickly.</span> <span id="s963">Again, made very, very good friends very quickly.</span> <span id="s964">And took charge actually of the -- volunteered to take charge of the infirmary, that was my first inkling of becoming a doctor.</span> <span id="s965">You know, all the students had different chores and my chores were in the infirmary.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Whi-Which you chose, or you were assigned?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: No, I chose.</span> <span id="s968">So that was the first time that I made, you know, the choice that I -- ultimately I was going to be a physician.</span> <span id="s969">Th-The school was sort of -- had -- had students from -- half the students were Ashkenazi and the other half were Sephardic from Morocco and Algeria.</span> <span id="s970">And so they -- that created -- there was an interesting dynamic.</span> <span id="s971">That was a whole different exposure again because they spoke Arabic, in addition to French and so to resolve that dilemma, the -- the head of the school actually decreed that were two languages that could not be spoken.</span> <span id="s972">One was Yiddish and the other one was Arabic, they were forbidden.</span> <span id="s973">And also, all the studying, everything was done in French as a result of that, which was very, very difficult for the head of the school, because his -- his French was -- was atrocious.</span> <span id="s974">But he was a very, very nice man who had been imprisoned during the war years.</span> <span id="s975">His name was Haim Haiken.</span> <span id="s976">And he died in er -- a very advanced age, in early 90’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And you stayed there for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: I was there for two years, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: During that time did you have any correspondence or connection with the Madnas?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I stayed in touch with the Madnas.</span> <span id="s981">I can’t remember specifically whether during that time I went to visit them.</span> <span id="s982">I think I did.</span> <span id="s983">I did go back to visit my mother, you know, several times and finally, just before we left in -- in early July, after I had taken some ex -- my exams, my final exams, which in -- in fr -- in France at th -- at that stage are fairly elaborate.</span> <span id="s984">You have to go to a different city and be -- take an oral exam, a written exam and then an oral exam by teachers from different parts of the country to make sure it’s absolutely honest.</span> <span id="s985">Well, anyway, I passed that exam and then there was -- you know, then I left the Yeshiva and for f -- to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s986">Basically, my mother never told the man that she had remarried to that she was leaving, she just packed up her things and we met, actually.</span> <span id="s987">We arranged to meet in Ebensee where my father was buried.</span> <span id="s988">I took the train from France and she took the train from Belgium.</span> <span id="s989">And we met a little town called Bad Ischl, which is very close to Ebensee.</span> <span id="s990">We met actually because of all the coupling, uncoupling of the trains, I remember meeting on the train and my mother was being -- walked from one end of the train, I walked from the other.</span> <span id="s991">And we went on to Bad Ischl, stayed there overnight and then the following morning took the train to Ebensee to visit my father’s grave.</span> <span id="s992">My mother wanted to be sure that I saw it before we left for the United States.</span> <span id="s993">And then -- that’s the first time that I really shed tears over my father.</span> <span id="s994">I remember very distinctly crying at the grave.</span> <span id="s995">The reality of my father had really -- and of his death had really never quite registered.</span> <span id="s996">You know, it was -- it was like a page in a book, it wasn't -- I had sort of -- was detached from it.</span> <span id="s997">But standing there at the grave and knowing that’s where my father was buried was incredibly -- an incredible experience and I -- I did cry.</span> <span id="s998">And we -- we left Ebensee and Bad Ischl and stayed my mother’s -- stayed -- I stayed with my mother for a few days in a town called Bad Nauheim in Germany and then from there went to Rotterdam and met up with the Madna family and the Ravensbergan family from Rijnsburg and some other friends of my mother, close friends of my mother from The Hague, and who saw us off on the Ryndam and we left for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: What did you know about the United States?</span> <span id="s1000">You were 17 years old.</span> <span id="s1001">What did you know about the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: I had been -- I was scared of the United States, especially when we were in this spa at bel -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in Germany called Bad Nauheim.</span> <span id="s1003">There was a woman who sat at our table who was there from the United States and she told me that I’d better toughen up, that all the kids here were extremely rough and that I was going to have a very hard time.</span> <span id="s1004">And so I was -- I was -- frankly, I was scared.</span> <span id="s1005">I didn’t know what I was going to encounter.</span> <span id="s1006">You know, I’d certainly seen cowboy movies also, and that’s what I expected the United States to be like.</span> <span id="s1007">And I -- it was a very different experience, very positive when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Di-Did you -- d-d -- were you upset that your mother wanted to move to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: No, because I knew that this situation in Brussels was really not tenable.</span> <span id="s1010">At one point I actually -- we had even planned on going to Canada.</span> <span id="s1011">The reason we didn’t go to the United States earlier is because it took that many years to obtain a visa, because of the quota system.</span> <span id="s1012">And so we have -- we had applied for a visa to go to Canada in about 1954 or so, but then there was a flood in Holland, and -- I may be off somewhat on my years, and all of a sudden we were told that the -- that I had -- that there was a visa for me to go to -- to th -- the United States opened the Dutch quota basically, because of the floods.</span> <span id="s1013">And so I got a visa and my mother assumed that she had one too, and she didn’t know about the visas being by national origin.</span> <span id="s1014">So she did not -- was not able to come t -- [indecipherable] to the United States.</span> <span id="s1015">But that’s -- as a result of that, we dropped our pla -- we had dropped our plans to go to Canada and -- so I was prepared for the change to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1016">I had also -- I’d gotten different warnings.</span> <span id="s1017">I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at the yeshiva and the older, more senior students, you know, warned me, said that the United States was extremely materialistic and I shouldn’t forget the things I had learned over there, you know, that -- and that one of the -- the lessons that I should take back from the war was that material objects were really not that important.</span> <span id="s1018">There were more important things in life.</span> <span id="s1019">School over there was very, very much geared towards the Mussar ethical movement and was very, very valuable.</span> <span id="s1020">So I was prepared for the worst in many ways when we came to the United States, but instead, I think both of us really adapted quite well.</span> <span id="s1021">We -- my mother purposely had booked a trip on -- that was fairly long because she -- she looked on this as kind of a -- a vacation.</span> <span id="s1022">So our -- our trip to the United States took about 10 days.</span> <span id="s1023">The ship made stops in Ireland and France, Halifax, Canada before finally arriving in -- in Hoboken, New York.</span> <span id="s1024">And in Hoboken we were met by someone from the HIAS, Mrs. Citrin.</span> <span id="s1025">By f -- our first exposure to a real American woman who was super-American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Did you know any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Very, very little.</span> <span id="s1028">I had taken English as my second foreign language which -- which was really bare bones, was twice a week for about two years, so it was very, very little.</span> <span id="s1029">But there was this -- this very swaggering woman, very, very different from -- yeah, the -- the very quiet European women we -- and that was -- that was intere -- and then we -- we took the taxi to -- to -- to Brooklyn and joined -- and stayed with the Vanderpool family, who had -- since they originally -- they i-initially had lived in Williamsburg when they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1030">Hela Vanderpool had a job actually, in a matzo baking factory.</span> <span id="s1031">And then finally, you know, they -- they moved to a nicer part of Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1032">We moved in with them for a short period and got our own apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Did it mean anything to you to put -- to arrive in America, to walk onto American soil?</span> <span id="s1034">Did that have any special meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I very distinctly re -- remember seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.</span> <span id="s1036">You know, we were having breakfast on the ship and there it was, and really -- it -- it si -- it did symbolize a tremendous amount.</span> <span id="s1037">The other thing that really struck us as -- as we got off -- as we were on the boat watching, you know, being processed on the boat, was they were -- the dockworkers were unloading things from the ship and that the dockworkers were wearing leather -- were wearing protective gloves.</span> <span id="s1038">That was one thing that really struck us.</span> <span id="s1039">The second thing that struck us, that on this big loading platform at one point, they brought -- they dropped a newspaper and containers of coffee for the workers.</span> <span id="s1040">And this was very, very different from working conditions in -- in Holland at the time.</span> <span id="s1041">And that -- those two things, the newspaper, especially, and the cups of coffee and the leather gloves, the protective gloves, somehow struck us as being very special and showing that -- you know, that things were much, much better in the United States.</span> <span id="s1042">The other -- very shortly after our arrival, we also -- we started looking for permanent places to live and -- which is quite an adventure.</span> <span id="s1043">We ended up in some of the worst neighborhoods of -- of -- of Brooklyn before we finally found a place, but -- and my mother had to look for work.</span> <span id="s1044">And I remember visiting the offices.</span> <span id="s1045">I think it was either the HIAS, or there was another organization called New Americans, which was -- and this was on Beekman Place in -- in New York, not far from Wall Street.</span> <span id="s1046">And I remember one of the first things we visited was -- was Trinity Church and -- and the graveyard, and how impressed we were to see this old graveyard next to Wall Street over these -- these skyscrapers.</span> <span id="s1047">That was also a very, very positive impression.</span> <span id="s1048">And we both feel -- felt -- my mother, I know, felt liberated.</span> <span id="s1049">She really is the one who wanted to leave behind the memories of Europe.</span> <span id="s1050">She found Europe extremely confining.</span> <span id="s1051">The memories were bad, but in addition to that, she -- she did not -- she did not like being referred to as the widow Munzer, which was how women were still regarded, single women, widowed women in -- in -- in Europe were still regarded at that time.</span> <span id="s1052">Whereas here in the United States she could get a job and make a living, and she would just be like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s1055">This is tape number three, side B. And you’ve arrived in the United States, did you -- and where did you eventually live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: We actually lived in an apartment that was almost next door to the Vanderpool family.</span> <span id="s1057">There were some people who -- these were two family, two si -- houses and we took an apartment next door to them.</span> <span id="s1058">And we stayed there for several years and then moved to an o -- to a larger apartment a little bit further away.</span> <span id="s1059">My mother, almost immediately got -- got work, went to work in the -- the ladies’ garment business, basically.</span> <span id="s1060">She made -- she had a variety of jobs.</span> <span id="s1061">One of them was making hats, all sorts of things, til she finally got a s -- a job that she kept for a long period of time, which was working as a t -- at a tailor in a -- in a women’s store.</span> <span id="s1062">The reason she took that particular job, which was on Williams Street, again, and Wall Street, was because it was closed on Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1063">And by then my mother really had become much more observant and she would go to shul every -- every Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1064">So that -- that became very important for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Considering what she had gone through during the war, how was her health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: My mother was in very, very good health, actually.</span> <span id="s1067">Had -- had no -- was never si -- never sick at all.</span> <span id="s1068">Had no -- no major health -- no health problems that I know of at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And your health was good, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yeah, I had no -- no problems in spite of, you know, malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1071">I’m told that there’s some dental problems, probably from early, you know, development that may be related to that.</span> <span id="s1072">My mother was concerned about my health early on, but there really weren't any -- any problems.</span> <span id="s1073">After we came to the United States, started looking for a school for me and I enrolled actually at -- I -- we -- we explored one of the more religious inst -- yeshiva, Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in -- in -- in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1074">But that was in a -- in a -- in a very ver -- bad neighborhood and my mother wanted -- but by then I was beginning to think really of -- of eventually going to medical school.</span> <span id="s1075">And so my mother really wanted me to go to a school that was more progressive.</span> <span id="s1076">That’s why I went to Yeshiva University High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1077">And it was a -- that was a very -- it was a difficult move because I knew -- spoke very, very little English.</span> <span id="s1078">And I must say that the school was not supportive.</span> <span id="s1079">No one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother survived.</span> <span id="s1080">It -- it’s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth.</span> <span id="s1081">The students were very, very friendly and the students were very interested in my past.</span> <span id="s1082">And I still have an article that they wrote for the school newspaper, actually an interview about my experiences in Europe.</span> <span id="s1083">So it’s -- it’s -- but the adults were just -- I -- I -- for whatever reason, no one wants to talk about.</span> <span id="s1084">The only person who really asked us about our survival, how we had survived, it was very interesting, it was someone who wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1085">It was when my mother went to open up a bank account at Manufacturer’s Trust.</span> <span id="s1086">And when the -- the woman who read the application, she called over the bank manager and they were both in tears practically, when they found out my father had died and how he had died and -- and such.</span> <span id="s1087">That was -- but that was unique.</span> <span id="s1088">Most people -- there were some other people, obviously, who had been through similar experiences we talked to.</span> <span id="s1089">We went to a small synagogue, Rabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were very close with him and we talked with him.</span> <span id="s1090">But other than that, certainly at Yeshiva University High School there was no -- there was no talk about the Holocaust at all.</span> <span id="s1091">And I -- I was asked to take every single Regent’s exam for the entire four years of high school in that one year because they were afraid really of -- of giving me a diploma without doing that, so I did.</span> <span id="s1092">But it -- I -- the unfortunate thing is that it’s probably as a result of that experience that I did not go -- did not attend Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s1093">I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but ended up going to Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s1094">And that’s where I graduated from eventually.</span> <span id="s1095">And that was a very good experience.</span> <span id="s1096">And the interesting thing is that over there there were the beginnings of talk.</span> <span id="s1097">At least there were other foreign students and there was some interest.</span> <span id="s1098">But I felt very much at home, felt very comfortable there, made good friends and really blended in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: So you did not feel like an outsider?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Definitely not, no.</span> <span id="s1101">I -- o-or if I did, it was -- it was something positive.</span> <span id="s1102">But I no -- definitely felt a part of the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And you obviously picked up English quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1105">I had a -- I did have a -- a very heavy accent, initially, because I -- and I had a very, very good speech teacher, Professor Dorothy Lawson.</span> <span id="s1106">And she spent hours with me with a tape recorder, and I would listen to my voice and then she would make corrections and she taught me the international phonetic alphabet, and that’s how I learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And then you -- so you attended for four years to Brooklyn College, and then what?</span> <span id="s1108">A: I attended Brooklyn College for four years, then applied to medical school.</span> <span id="s1109">Did not get in the first time, so I did a year of graduate studies at -- also still at Brooklyn College and then fi -- and then was admitted to -- to medical school and went to the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1110">And after that, it’s part of my internship, my internship and residency at State University, King’s County Medical Center, then went on to the University of Rochester, then Johns Hopkins, and then finally did my military service in Washington, D.C. at Andrews Air Force base.</span> <span id="s1111">And that’s how I came to live in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1113">And you always found it was easy to have friends, and a social life and so forth?</span> <span id="s1114">You did not feel arre -- being a refugee, so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, I did -- I did not feel like any stranger, refugee or foreigner.</span> <span id="s1116">I never really found that an obstacle at all.</span> <span id="s1117">I found it really a positive -- I tried to -- to use it as a positive experience.</span> <span id="s1118">You know, certainly all of the different exposures that I had to different people, different cultures, different religions, I -- I tie th -- try to keep that basically as part of me.</span> <span id="s1119">And I think to this day it’s -- it’s something that has -- has helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: We became citizens in 1962, really the first up -- no, ’63, five years, I think.</span> <span id="s1122">The first opportunity that we had, basically, we became citizens.</span> <span id="s1123">Unfortunately, that was not a good experience.</span> <span id="s1124">[indecipherable] everybody has wonderful experiences, but we were being interviewed -- we were interviewed by someone who basically told us that -- said, you know, remember in this country you don’t do what you want, you do as you are told.</span> <span id="s1125">This country is run like the army.</span> <span id="s1126">And that -- that was pa -- horrible, you know, and the man tried to trick me in -- in the citizenship questions.</span> <span id="s1127">He threw my -- my mother’s green card and mine on the floor.</span> <span id="s1128">The positive thing that came out of that is that I wrote a letter of complaint to the Immigration Naturalization Service, which initially -- and to the Justice Department, which at that time was headed by Bobby Kennedy.</span> <span id="s1129">I did not get a reply, but then wrote to Emmanuel Seller, who was my congressman in Brooklyn and who was head of the Judiciary Committee and I got immediate action, they actually -- there was a hearing held in -- in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1130">And I was confronted -- and the man was forced to apologize.</span> <span id="s1131">And I think h-he retired shortly after that.</span> <span id="s1132">So it -- it did show the negative and the positive, you know, the fact that you can stand up and -- for your rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Did he give a reason at the hearing why he treated you that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1135">You know, it’s -- it’s interesting because the -- the hearing examiner told me that this man had never even served in the army, and why he was making the reference to the army was bizarre, and he didn’t -- he said he didn’t know whether the man was having a bad day, or what it was, but obviously the behavior was -- was totally -- was inappropriate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: So then you s -- you said you -- you worked at Andrew’s Air Force base and you stayed in Washington since then.</span> <span id="s1137">And what -- and what do you do now?</span> <span id="s1138">Or what did you do after Andrew’s Air Force base, professionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Well, after Andrew’s Air Force base -- well, I ni -- I had become -- I was a lung specialist by then and I looked for practice opportunities in the Washington area and decided to join an associate at Washington Adventist Hospital and that’s where I have been in practice since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1141">And your family situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Well, I -- I have a partner, Joel Wind and we’ve known each other for 21 years and we’ve lived together here for about 11 years.</span> <span id="s1143">And I’m very, very close to his family, another survivor family.</span> <span id="s1144">Joel’s father is a rabbi and came to the United States in 1938 from Lvov, and -- on a scholarship to the Jewish Theological Seminary.</span> <span id="s1145">Joel has -- had an aunt who actually was one of the people who lived in the sewers of Lvov.</span> <span id="s1146">So there are a lot of connections, family connections and I’m -- I’m very, very close to Joel’s family and we are one family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1148">Now let’s talk a little bit about some of your general thoughts.</span> <span id="s1149">Though, before we do that, you kept up your relationships with the mand -- Madnas I assume, all through -- once you got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: A-After we came to the United States, I did keep up my relationship with the Madnas.</span> <span id="s1151">For many years it was just writing and sometimes, you know, there would be -- months would go by before I would write, but we always stayed in touch.</span> <span id="s1152">I did not go back for a visit to Holland until I think in 1973, 15 years after we had been here is when I -- when I went back on a visit and spent a lot of time -- primarily went back to visit the Madnas, basically.</span> <span id="s1153">And Papa Madna was as protective of me as he had ever been.</span> <span id="s1154">I had never been to -- to Amsterdam, actually.</span> <span id="s1155">My mother had always said negative things about Amsterdam, she sa -- basically she said my father did not like Amsterdam, it was too noisy and that’s why he lived -- they lived in -- in The Hague.</span> <span id="s1156">And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1157">And I decided that on this trip I was going to go to Amsterdam and Papa Madna again, almost completely dissuaded me from going altogether, then scared me so much that I went there for one day and then came right back t-to him.</span> <span id="s1158">And -- but that’s -- that still is the -- the -- the influence.</span> <span id="s1159">You -- you asked earlier about whether my mother was -- was protective.</span> <span id="s1160">I have the sense -- I had the sense really that i-in many ways he was more protective of me than she was.</span> <span id="s1161">That was very, very special.</span> <span id="s1162">And he -- he had remarried in 1947, and I was very, very close with this second wife.</span> <span id="s1163">And they had three children, Vonny, Tolé and Matipah.</span> <span id="s1164">And I was very, very close with all three of them, and remain close with them to this day.</span> <span id="s1165">Vonny Madna and his wife Annika have been here to visit, and just a few weeks ago, their son Rodewick and his girlfriend came over here for a visit.</span> <span id="s1166">And so the -- we’re -- we’re passing on the -- the accomplishments or -- of his -- of his grandfather, or -- of Tolé Madna now to the next generation.</span> <span id="s1167">And I think that’s what the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is all about in a way.</span> <span id="s1168">We had a -- a wonderf -- we had -- we visited the museum together and the importance of a museum and of a memorial suddenly hit me.</span> <span id="s1169">Prior to that I thought that people could get information from books, but there is something very special about a memorial, in terms of the passage from one generation to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1171">When you went back t -- at Papa Madna’s funeral, did you feel like you were losing a father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: What do yo -- yes, I think when he f -- when he finally -- I -- you know, he was -- even though we were far removed geographically, he really remained very much a part of my life to the very end, and -- and certainly, you know, his -- his death was -- was a big loss for me.</span> <span id="s1173">Fortunately he lived to a -- a ripe, old age, and fortunately, you know, we were able, Joel and I were -- were able to spend time with him.</span> <span id="s1174">It was very important for me for Joel to get to know him, and we made several trips together where we saw the Madnas.</span> <span id="s1175">I made that initial trip by myself in 1973, but then in 1985 Joel and I were in Holland together and visited the Madnas, all of them, and it was a -- a very, very good visit.</span> <span id="s1176">And then Joel and I were back again just before Tolé Madna died.</span> <span id="s1177">And that too, was very, very special visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Did you speak at his funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, Rob Madna is the one who spoke at the funeral, I did not.</span> <span id="s1180">But Rob Madna -- I can’t remember ma -- whether I did or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through such terrible difficulties and such terrible losses and other people living, let’s say in the United States, did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: You know, there were times when I really miss not knowing, not having had, you know, my sisters.</span> <span id="s1183">Not having nephews, nieces and nephews and feeling lonely at times.</span> <span id="s1184">I certainly have missed my father.</span> <span id="s1185">The interesting thing is that I really have never, you know, you -- you mentioned the word angry, and I don’t think that describes it.</span> <span id="s1186">I don’t think I’ve ever really felt anger.</span> <span id="s1187">It’s -- it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s1188">When Joel and I went to Austria, for example, he was much angrier than I was.</span> <span id="s1189">I was able to speak and converse with people without, you know, difficulty.</span> <span id="s1190">We had one very special experience there.</span> <span id="s1191">We were staying again in the town, the same town where I stayed with my mother, Bad Ischl, and we had ma -- made reservations in a -- in an inn, and the woman who was the innkeeper, when we arrived told us that she had made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1192">She said, you know, you’re going to have to change rooms tomorrow morning because of some mistake I’ve made in the reservations.</span> <span id="s1193">And I told her that would be very difficult because we were going to take a train first thing in the morning to visit my father’s grave in Ebensee.</span> <span id="s1194">And the woman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says, you know, my family is from Ebensee and I am so ashamed.</span> <span id="s1195">And we hugged, and that -- that was truly an incredible experience.</span> <span id="s1196">But Joel would not -- would barely look out the train window.</span> <span id="s1197">He -- he could not bring himself to say anything positive about Austria, and couldn’t wait to get away.</span> <span id="s1198">That’s one reason we did not -- this was around my -- the time of my father’s Yahrzeit and so we visited Ebensee and then from there, instead of going to Vienna, we went to Prague and said Kaddish in the Altneu shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Do you feel you had a childhood, or you never did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Well, it was a very different childhood probably, but I -- I definitely, you know, definitely had the childhood.</span> <span id="s1201">I had a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s1202">I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1203">M -- you know.</span> <span id="s1204">I was taken care of by many different people and I was fortunate, I think, in having a read childhood, a good childhood, and learning many different things.</span> <span id="s1205">And I -- I think I -- because of the unusual nature of my childhood, I had had many opportunities that other kids probably did not have.</span> <span id="s1206">So I was able to learn several languages and be exposed to many different cultures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Are there any sights today or sounds or smells that kind of trigger memories from your early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Well, when we went back to Holland and crossed the border, I smelled the coffee.</span> <span id="s1209">And there was something very special about the smell of Dutch coffee, and that -- that was very, very distinct.</span> <span id="s1210">And of course, you know, Indonesian cooking still ha -- is a -- something very special.</span> <span id="s1211">And I -- I do enjoy, you know, going back to Holland and the sights of Holland.</span> <span id="s1212">And I do enjoy going back to visit The Hague, the places where I grew up.</span> <span id="s1213">The house at van Kinsbergenstraat, number 40 doesn’t exist any more, but other places are still there.</span> <span id="s1214">Where my father had his store, that’s still there.</span> <span id="s1215">I’ve taken Joel there on a visit.</span> <span id="s1216">So -- the -- the one place that -- that gave me some difficulty was the Anne Frank house, actually.</span> <span id="s1217">It’s interesting, you know, you mention the word anger, maybe there I did feel some anger.</span> <span id="s1218">And the first time I went there was with my foster sister, with Davy and both of us had to leave.</span> <span id="s1219">She more so than I did.</span> <span id="s1220">For her it just brought back too many memories and she -- she really was very upset, very angry.</span> <span id="s1221">In my case, it -- it was just wanting to shout out, you know, there were other people like Anne Frank, like myself, you know?</span> <span id="s1222">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Do you feel very Dutch, or very American?</span> <span id="s1224">A: I think I feel very American.</span> <span id="s1225">You know, I think the Dutch has sort of faded, although, you know, I -- I -- I still pride myself on being able to read Dutch -- Dutch newspapers and being able to converse in Dutch, but I -- I don’t really feel -- and my mother did not have any -- any great affinity to Holland after the war.</span> <span id="s1226">My mother, I think, really understood also, that there was a large Nazi presence in Holland itself, and that -- that Holland really never faced up to that.</span> <span id="s1227">Apparently that has changed and now there is -- there is -- it’s been -- there’s mo-more talk about the Dutch Nazi party.</span> <span id="s1228">It’s one of the things that even in the Holocaust Memorial Museum doesn’t get enough emphasis is -- is the size of the Dutch Nazi party.</span> <span id="s1229">It’s -- it’s sort of between the lines, when you look at the -- the percentage of people who lost -- or Jews who lost their lives, the greatest percentage was in Holland.</span> <span id="s1230">But then there’s nothing said about it and why that was, and part of the reason was that Holland had a very large Nazi party which collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1231">So we -- we know about the Vichy regime in France, but we don’t know enough about the Nazi collaborators in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1233">As you’ve gotten older, do you think more of your wartime experience than European experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: I think it -- it’s become more important for me to -- to really preserve the memory of -- of Holland and of the story of my family.</span> <span id="s1235">And I’m -- I’m very, very glad I’ve had the opportunity to sit down with my mother and go through all the names of all the concentration camps that she was in and sit down with a map with her, and -- and have a presentation p -- on that.</span> <span id="s1236">That -- that -- that was very, very important.</span> <span id="s1237">Emotionally it’s very hard to tell.</span> <span id="s1238">You know, at times I have dreams about it that obviously come from there, and -- but it’s not a part of my -- my everyday life.</span> <span id="s1239">I also -- sometimes I’m concerned that there are people who may resent talk about the Holocaust, and the experiences.</span> <span id="s1240">So it’s -- there’s some -- there’s a little bit of caution there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Are you talking about non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No, more in the Jewish community, I think.</span> <span id="s1243">There is -- there is some feeling, I think that enough is enough.</span> <span id="s1244">At times I have -- I have a sense of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Are you more comfortable around people who were born in Europe and have wartime experiences than others who grew up in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1247">No, I think it’s -- it’s really m-most of my friends now and most of the friends we have are p -- are people who grew up in the United States.</span> <span id="s1248">But you know even when you begin to talk to people, you -- you realize that -- how common the experience really is, and I’m -- people may have been born here, but their parents may be from Europe.</span> <span id="s1249">I had a ni -- a fascinating experience very recently.</span> <span id="s1250">I -- I was speaking to a young man at Congregation Bet Mishpachah and he -- his name is -- his last name is Flatow, Warren Flatow.</span> <span id="s1251">I told him, I said, you know, Flatow is not a very common name, and I worked with a gentleman many, many years ago who was a -- was from Germany, a German refugee and whose last name was Flatow, Anzd Flatow, and he said -- and he worked as a translator and I worked in the same translation bureau in -- in New York while I was in college.</span> <span id="s1252">And he -- he said, gee, you know, he has a grandfather the same name, but his grandfather was a lawyer and to his knowledge never worked in the translation bureau.</span> <span id="s1253">Then he asked his father and it turned out to be the same Anzd Flatow.</span> <span id="s1254">And we worked together at the Lawyers and Merchants Translation Bureau in New York.</span> <span id="s1255">And he was, you know, had escaped from Germany in 1944 and was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1256">Obviously couldn’t do any work as a lawyer in the United States, so he took this job as a translator.</span> <span id="s1257">So the -- the connections are many, once you begin talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Did you go into medicine -- though I know you said you -- you thought about it early on, but do you think you went into this helping, giving profession because of what you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Pro -- probably.</span> <span id="s1260">It probably was one of the factors, you know.</span> <span id="s1261">Certainly my mother always impressed on me that I was there to serve human kind.</span> <span id="s1262">And I don’t want to be overly dramatic about it, but that goes all the way back to -- to her reading the story of -- the biblical story of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Of -- of Hannah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Oh Hannah, right, the biblical story of Hannah, and -- and Hannah’s promising to -- to -- you know, to have her son, you know, be in -- of service to God.</span> <span id="s1265">And that story really stuck to me.</span> <span id="s1266">My mother said, you know, that I too, that’s the promise that she made to God.</span> <span id="s1267">And when times were bad, when I -- I would give her trouble or something like that, she would repeat that story.</span> <span id="s1268">My mother never hit me.</span> <span id="s1269">She never spanked me, but she certainly used every psychological means, and that was one of them, and you know, and so becoming a physician -- she wanted me to be a rabbi, she didn't want me to be a physician, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Alfred Munzer.</span> <span id="s1272">This is tape number four, side A, and you were talking about your relationship with your mother and how she was -- she wanted you to be a rabbi and not a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Sh-She felt that I was more suited -- that I was really suited to becoming a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1274">She -- she felt that I would not do well in -- in hav -- in business, for example.</span> <span id="s1275">She just -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so she wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to acquire a family, in a sense.</span> <span id="s1276">But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the respect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially.</span> <span id="s1277">When we came to the United States she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here, and that congregations can be very difficult.</span> <span id="s1278">So anyway, but -- but -- I had really never considered that that much.</span> <span id="s1279">It was a -- was a brief consideration.</span> <span id="s1280">The oth -- the other place where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family that we used to visit in -- in Rijnsburg, in Holland and who would take me to church and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say oh, he’s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he’s going to become a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1281">And so that was -- that was one of the early things.</span> <span id="s1282">But it was -- those were the two professions that I really considered seriously.</span> <span id="s1283">But from -- from my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1284">Maybe it was when I was really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix.</span> <span id="s1285">That’s, I think, when I really made up my mind that I was going to become a physician.</span> <span id="s1286">But my experiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very direct sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major impact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time.</span> <span id="s1287">When I picked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one where I could have a wider impact.</span> <span id="s1288">And so I chose lung disease because lung disease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it’s related to smoking and I became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as -- as president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their Will Ross medal a few years ago, which is their highest volunteer honor.</span> <span id="s1289">So at -- it’s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the Madna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1290">And the Madnas received a standing ovation.</span> <span id="s1291">They weren’t there, but you know, just -- it was -- it was extremely moving.</span> <span id="s1292">So my past, my experiences certainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the kind of person I am.</span> <span id="s1293">And I guess it’s possible for that, depending on the experiences, to be positive or negative and I’m very fortunate that in my case, it was very positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: In talking about the Madnas, did you -- have you come to any conclusion why Mr. Madna really risked his life for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: I -- I really haven’t.</span> <span id="s1296">You know, it’s -- it’s very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1297">To me, this seemed like the most natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s1298">You know, recently at -- when I was at Adas Israel at a service, it was a -- a young girl who had a Bat Mitzvah who came here from Russia, and th-the rabbi mentioned all the languages she spoke and all the things she had done and then he had asked her, you know, how did this happen, how -- how is this possible?</span> <span id="s1299">And she said, it’s normal.</span> <span id="s1300">And those words really stuck because that’s -- that’s probably what describes the way I look on -- on what the Madnas did.</span> <span id="s1301">To me there was nothing unusual about it.</span> <span id="s1302">That may be terrible, but it’s -- it’s really -- it’s really true because I -- I was so much a part of their family.</span> <span id="s1303">They never made a big deal about it.</span> <span id="s1304">My mother did, she expressed, certainly, her gratitude, especially to Mima.</span> <span id="s1305">To her Mima was really the important person.</span> <span id="s1306">But it’s -- it’s -- so I -- I -- it took me a long time to -- to give them the recognition they deserved as a result of that, again, because it was just part of my everyday life, they were -- you know, they were never out of my life.</span> <span id="s1307">I couldn’t -- I never really distanced myself to -- to be able to say this was something incredible they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: But when you were an adult, did you ever ask him why he risked -- you know, took such terrible risks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s1310">I really -- I -- I -- I just -- you know, it would have been like a child asking a parent why did you have me.</span> <span id="s1311">You know, it -- it really -- it -- it was very strange, may seem very strange, but it really -- it never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s1312">It -- you know, he knew that I loved him dearly, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: I -- I -- I really meant the initial --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: -- acceptance that -- not -- not you particularly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: -- but accepting a child and putting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: -- his life in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No, no, no, I know, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1321">I -- I just -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1322">The only thing that I -- that I -- that I’ve heard was that the plan originally was that this was supposed to be an intermediate step.</span> <span id="s1323">I’m not sure that this was a conscious decision on his part.</span> <span id="s1324">It is -- it’s -- it’s very possible that this was more something that was thrust into him -- at him, and I don’t -- you know, at that point he really didn’t have any control over.</span> <span id="s1325">I think one of the factors really was -- was Mima.</span> <span id="s1326">Papa Madna was ready also to adopt me if my mother had not come back.</span> <span id="s1327">And I did, you know, find that out.</span> <span id="s1328">He did tell me that.</span> <span id="s1329">He -- he also told me that he had felt very warmly towards my father, and that -- you know, th-that -- but again, nothing specific as to why he took the risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: So he knew your father?</span> <span id="s1331">You said that she had -- his first wife had lived across the street, but -- but Papa Madna had known your father also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yes, and one of the things that he -- he showed me after the war was a suit that my father had made for him.</span> <span id="s1333">So yes, they knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1335">What about your religious feelings?</span> <span id="s1336">Are -- are you affiliated, Jewishly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s1338">I’m not as religious as I was when I was at the yeshiva in Aix-les-Bains, but I certainly, you know, I -- I certainly am -- I’m very much involved.</span> <span id="s1339">I’m involved in three different synagogues.</span> <span id="s1340">Maybe it’s -- maybe it’s that -- maybe that’s where the -- the -- the ambivalence or the -- the division between different religions is still coming to [indecipherable] I can’t make up my mind which one.</span> <span id="s1341">No, but I’m very involved at -- at B’nai Israel.</span> <span id="s1342">That’s where my mother was a member for many years and so I’ve maintained a -- a strong connection with -- with B’nai Israel.</span> <span id="s1343">It also turns out that there is a -- a family relationship through -- through Joel and Rabbi Schnitzer there.</span> <span id="s1344">I became involved at Adas Israel when I was saying Kaddish for my mother, and -- because it was in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1345">And then of course, through the ceremony honoring the Madnas at Adas Israel, I’ve become very much a part of that congregation and feel very, very warmly.</span> <span id="s1346">And then last but not least, I’ve been a member of Bet Mishpachah for -- for many years and on a fairly regular basis do have a chance to -- to write a [indecipherable] sermon, the high holidays or sometimes during the year.</span> <span id="s1347">So I’ve been -- I’ve been very much involved in -- in religious things, and what I learned certainly at the yeshiva in terms of ethics especially, in Jewish ethics is -- is something that really still guides me -- I hope guides me and is something that I still try to convey to others as being very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: What are your feelings about Germany or Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: I have had some very close German friends, whose -- I had one German friends whose -- one whose parents I think it was, part of his family were Nazis.</span> <span id="s1350">We -- we -- we didn't talk about it a great deal, but it was, I think, part of -- almost the reason for our sh -- our fr -- our friendship, on both sides.</span> <span id="s1351">It was very important.</span> <span id="s1352">And I -- I real -- as I -- I have ha -- I-I’ve no great discomfort around German being spoken or -- or Germany.</span> <span id="s1353">I am baffled by -- by Germany.</span> <span id="s1354">In 1973 when I went back to Holland to visit the Madnas I also -- I was still in the air force at the time and I took a flight into -- in and out of Frankfurt, and that was the first time that I had really, except for going to bat -- being in Bad Nauheim with my mother, that I spent time in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s1355">And I had spent also a little time at that time, in Paris, and did not have very pleasant experiences as a tourist in Paris.</span> <span id="s1356">In Germany, for the one night that I was there actually, it was in a very nice hotel, they were very honest, it was very civilized.</span> <span id="s1357">You know, turned on the radio and it was opera and there was -- there was beautiful music.</span> <span id="s1358">And I became -- I’ve become -- became more and more baffled.</span> <span id="s1359">And to this day I -- I cannot understand how Nazism arose.</span> <span id="s1360">I can -- I can do it on an intellectual level -- yeah, I can certainly read about it and I -- I know what happened, but it’s beyond me as to why Nazism took root to the extent it did in Germany.</span> <span id="s1361">And what frightens me about it is -- what I think is if it happened there, it can happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s1362">I really -- because I don’t think -- I cannot tell if there is anything different about the German character from any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Do -- do you receive reparations, or did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I did for a brief period of time until my 18th birthday and I’m s -- my mother did get reparations to the very end, and s -- she encouraged other people also to -- to apply for reparations.</span> <span id="s1365">She had many friends who re -- who -- who refused, but in her case she felt that this -- she -- this was something she was owed.</span> <span id="s1366">And so she did not hesitate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Obviously everyone has a close connection with a parent, a mother, but when you lost her, because of your special story, was that even doubly painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: It was, because you know, I -- I -- I -- you know, it’s -- I was more afraid before it happened, before she died.</span> <span id="s1369">My mother, the last few years had fairly severe, progressive dementia.</span> <span id="s1370">So I felt, you know, I was becoming -- but nonetheless, you know, that -- that’s -- the touch, the warmth of being with her was very, very important.</span> <span id="s1371">And you know, s -- even the number was very, very impor -- she didn’t like to look at it, but for me, you know, it brought back a lot of memories.</span> <span id="s1372">And -- and -- and I -- it was totally amazing to me how my -- what my mother’s attitude was towards life after the war.</span> <span id="s1373">I -- I -- to this day cannot understand that.</span> <span id="s1374">My mother could speak with joy about her childhood in Poland, in Rymanow.</span> <span id="s1375">Talking about, you know, the policemen called bambula and -- and all of the places where, you know, they -- the kids would go out to play and then -- and I have a very, very vivid picture, actually, of the town.</span> <span id="s1376">She could talk to me about, you know, experiences in the concentration camps when she put on plays with other prisoners and sh -- and portraying Hitler.</span> <span id="s1377">And then after the war, beginning -- starting a life over again, I would hear her cry at night at times, certainly, in the first few years.</span> <span id="s1378">She would be very -- sometimes she would accidentally refer to me by my father’s name and that was a very frightening thing.</span> <span id="s1379">But somehow, you know, she was always very cheerful.</span> <span id="s1380">You know, when I was little and she had her store, after she closed the store we would take very, very long walks to the park and she would race me to the park.</span> <span id="s1381">She took me to the theater.</span> <span id="s1382">You know, every Su-Sunday there was always something.</span> <span id="s1383">We either went to a museum, we went to -- to a play, we went to -- I-I -- I remember the very first time I went to a -- a -- a Jewish dance company.</span> <span id="s1384">I was probably seven years old or so, and I -- I still remember it to this day because I remember putting on a performance in the store window afterwards.</span> <span id="s1385">It’s really -- her -- her introduction of me to the theater.</span> <span id="s1386">And then she picked up painting again.</span> <span id="s1387">Somehow, being able to enjoy life and to continue to really enjoy life is -- is just -- without f -- ever forgetting what happened, my sisters or my father, is -- is beyond me.</span> <span id="s1388">I don’t know where -- where that strength came from.</span> <span id="s1389">And I was a very f -- I feel very glad to have had my mother for so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Politically, do you -- are -- d -- are -- are you -- is your political inclination influenced by your war experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: I tend to the liberal side, I don’t know whether that’s really related, except that people have responsibility for each other.</span> <span id="s1392">That is -- that’s -- that’s an important part of -- of certainly my outlook, politically.</span> <span id="s1393">And -- but other than that I don’t think it has had a direct bearing.</span> <span id="s1394">I certainly do not consider myself, you know, a -- a far right, or a -- no, not at all, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Has it affected your feelings about Israel?</span> <span id="s1396">A: Certainly I think it has -- it has made Israel all the more important to me.</span> <span id="s1397">I realize the role of Israel really as a refu -- as an ultimate refuge is very, very important.</span> <span id="s1398">At the same time I’ve also come to appreciate recently, more recent -- in recent years, the importance of the United States as a place of refuge.</span> <span id="s1399">And I really do feel very, very positive about the United States.</span> <span id="s1400">I think the -- the ability to accommodate the diversity of beliefs of peoples.</span> <span id="s1401">You know, we may have many problems and there may be anti-Semitism here and there may be f -- there may have been oppression of -- of African Americans, Latinos, and negative things said.</span> <span id="s1402">But in the end, I think, there’s a tremendous amount of positive in the United States.</span> <span id="s1403">And I feel very good about being here and being an American.</span> <span id="s1404">Hadn’t really thought about that very much, but I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: You had mentioned that the Madna’s story got recognition when you got your award.</span> <span id="s1406">Can you just tell a little bit about any other recognition that the Madnas have received, the Madna family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: I’m -- I’m told that the Madna family was recognized within Holland, actually.</span> <span id="s1408">There was a ceremony held by -- by the queen.</span> <span id="s1409">I don’t know an -- too many details about that.</span> <span id="s1410">But I’ve also submitted the family history to Yad Vashem and hopefully in the near future, they will also be honored at Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1412">And then they were honored at your synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: At Adas -- yeah, at Adas Israel we had a wonderful ceremony in the garden.</span> <span id="s1414">There is a Garden of the Righteous at Adas Israel, where every year a -- a righteous family that was responsible for saving Jews is honored.</span> <span id="s1415">And this year the Madna family was honored, and that was an incredible experience for me.</span> <span id="s1416">Not just the immediate ceremony, which was beautiful, but because it gave me a chance to speak to -- altogether I figured out there were close to a thousand schoolchildren.</span> <span id="s1417">All the schoolchildren at Adas Israel, plus all the s-schoolchildren at the Jewish Day School heard the Madna’s story with slides, with pictures.</span> <span id="s1418">And many of the s -- children wrote letters to the Madna family and I think that -- that was incredibly exper -- an incredible experience, very, very positive for me, and -- and -- and for ma -- for Rob Madna and I think the rest of the family as well.</span> <span id="s1419">I also, again realize the importance of a monument, as when I came there to visit with one of the ma -- recently with the Madna grand -- one of the Madna grandchildren and they took tremend -- he took tremendous pride in seeing the name inscribed, the Madna family.</span> <span id="s1420">And we took a nice photograph there and then after that, we went to visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and I -- I -- it’s -- it’s the next generation now coming up.</span> <span id="s1421">We talk about the Jewish next generation needing to keep the Holocaust in mind and not to forget the Holocaust, but I think it’s -- it’s even more important that the next generation of the heroes also, that they are remembered for generations to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: That’s a wonderful note to end on.</span> <span id="s1423">So thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span
