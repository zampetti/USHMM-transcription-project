for?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">SWB: Go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">HELEN FAGIN: Well j- I'll-I'll just touch the highlights.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">The Holocaust began for me exactly the day World War w- two started, which is Friday morning, September one, 1939.</span> <span id="s9">Our house was bombed Saturday morning, September 2, 1939.</span> <span id="s10">And we were on the run since then.</span> <span id="s11">We finally returned to our home town of Radumska, Poland, where we stayed with friends, and soon after that the ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s12">We stayed in the Radumska ghetto through 1942.</span> <span id="s13">In 1942, September of 1942, my parents were taken away from us and sent to Treblinka, where they perished.</span> <span id="s14">My two sisters and I, then, remained in the ghetto, but we stayed there until the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s15">I was able to escape the march to the railroad station, having sent away my other two sisters before.</span> <span id="s16">And I was hiding, I was hiding for a long time and then I couldn't hide any longer.</span> <span id="s17">I was able to find my way to a large ghetto in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s18">I stayed in the Warsaw ghetto until the uprising.</span> <span id="s19">Then just before the uprising I was able to get out of the ghetto, and I was on so-called Aryan papers, which is false papers.</span> <span id="s20">In the mean time, I was caught, and uh worked in a camp, in a w- in a labor camp, but then was released and was taken back to the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s21">I was liberated in Poland, February 17 of 1945.</span> <span id="s22">And tried to find my two sisters.</span> <span id="s23">We were able to reunite for a very, after a

Page 2 long long search.</span> <span id="s27">And then the decision was made that we could not stay in Poland because we lost everyone, we lost everything, and there was no reason to stay in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Mostly because the atmosphere was not very inviting.</span> <span id="s29">Uh, people resented those Jews who have been liberated, and resented the fact that some Jews survived.</span> <span id="s30">And uh, we had some personal experiences which persuaded us not to stay in</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SWB: Tell me about those.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">HELEN FAGIN: Well, for example prior to us uh leaving for the ghetto, we had some personal possessions that we took when we fled, and we entrusted these possessions to a so called friend, and uh, after we returned after the end of the world war two to claim these possessions, they wouldn't recognize us, they wouldn't give them back to us, and uh, uh, they just totally dismissed us.</span> <span id="s34">So we decided that this was not a very favorable atmosphere to stay at.</span> <span id="s35">And then it was much too painful to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s36">It was um, Poland was not very hospitable.</span> <span id="s37">And it was very very painful.</span> <span id="s38">The memories and the experiences connected with living in Poland will just, were just too devastating.</span> <span id="s39">We were contacted by some people who told us that there is a group of Israeli young boys who formed an organization called Brucha, and that they are helping survivors of the Holocaust...to rehabilitate themselves and possibly to find a way of taking them to Palestine.</span> <span id="s40">Now Palestine was a place where we knew about because our father was a great Zionist, and he had purchased land in Palestine in 1930's.</span> <span id="s41">And he had traveled to Palestine several times.</span> <span id="s42">So we knew that eventually we would like to reach Palestine.</span> <span id="s43">Parenthetically as a matter of fact, my father had signed me on the list of a uh, higher Working transcript: not spell checked or

the Rehovot, Weissmann Institute in Rehovot, in-in then[?]</span> <span id="s47">Palestine.</span> <span id="s48">So we decided to put our lives in their hands because there was no real alternative.</span> <span id="s49">We were contacted by them and we were told to just, to follow their instructions.</span> <span id="s50">And they took us on a long journey over the Carpashian mountains.</span> <span id="s51">And we found ourselves on the Czechoslovakian side of the mountains.</span> <span id="s52">In Czechoslovakia we were met by another group of young boys who took us through the countryside.</span> <span id="s53">And we finally arrived in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s54">In Bratislava there was a kind of a camp, which was, in a uh, actually in a square surrounded by buildings, like a large apartment building complex.</span> <span id="s55">And we arrived there and there were many many many people, meandering back and fro and uh, everyone was in the same situation as we were.</span> <span id="s56">Well we were staying there for a certain time, and I really don't recall how long it was, but I remember that we were walking through the streets of Bratislava, trying to find people who looked familiar, as a matter of fact, we did find some friends who came from our hometown, just by sheer chance, and we were very delighted to have found somebody we have known.</span> <span id="s57">And then we were told that we were going to go on a journey.</span> <span id="s58">And that journey's going to take us into Austria.</span> <span id="s59">The object of our journey was to go out of the Russian occupational zone, leave the Russian occupational zone and go to the American occupation- al zone.</span> <span id="s60">Because the conditions were much better and there were some displaced persons camps formed already.</span> <span id="s61">In the uh, in Austrian territory of the American occupational zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">We were met by two or three young boys who told us that from now on we have to shed our identity.</span> <span id="s63">That we are no longer Polish Jews, that we are Jews who are trying to return to Greece.</span> <span id="s64">Simply because it was felt that no one really in Austria would know the Greek language.</span> <span id="s65">But people knew Working transcript: not spell checked or

and they could always find somebody who could be the translator for us.</span> <span id="s69">So we played the role of Greek Jews knowing full well that we cannot communicate in the language.</span> <span id="s70">So one of the young boys told us that we, since we cannot be numb altogether, that we have to make an appearance of being able to communicate to one another.</span> <span id="s71">That perhaps we ought to use the Hebrew prayers because very few of us really could communicate in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s72">So we actually did communicate by gesticulating and using the prayers that everybody knew, in a very conversational tone, so that we would give a uh, some kind of an indication that we are communicating with each other.</span> <span id="s73">When we were traveling the international Red Cross would meet us at the different points of the journey and try to help us.</span> <span id="s74">And he actually tried to find somebody who knew the Greek language to be able to speak to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">SWB: We have to put another roll of film on...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">[CAMERA RELOAD]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">[CR#2] SWB: When you start again, why

the Greek language uh we used Hebrew prayers by simply using them in a conversational tone, and gesticulating as if we understood each other.</span> <span id="s79">Well, we were taken by different

uh the shores of the Danube riv- river, at night.</span> <span id="s84">And there were little boats waiting for us and we got onto the boats and we crossed the Danube.</span> <span id="s85">And then we found ourselves on the other shore which was already in the American sector.</span> <span id="s86">From there we were taken by foot and then later by some other conveyance.</span> <span id="s87">I remember it must have been trucks, to a camp past Mauthausen concentration camp, which was Wels, in Austria.</span> <span id="s88">And there they uh experience of displaced persons camp began.</span> <span id="s89">This was our first displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s90">And it was a very depressing experience.</span> <span id="s91">First of all, the camp had a fence around it.</span> <span id="s92">Secondly, it was guarded by military, American military police, by the MP's.</span> <span id="s93">Dressed in the white helmets that say MP, they were wearing the MP uniform, and they were always carrying guns.</span> <span id="s94">We had to register and this is the first time that we registered.</span> <span id="s95">We got food rations and I remember that the entire experience was very depressing and very devastating.</span> <span id="s96">This was to- supposed to have been the liberating aspect of our situation.</span> <span id="s97">But it was not.</span> <span id="s98">I remember the anguish, and I remember the thought processes that went through my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">And I remember asking myself what am I doing here.</span> <span id="s100">Where am I going?</span> <span id="s101">Who is going to be waiting for me?</span> <span id="s102">How am I going to begin my so-called new life?</span> <span id="s103">What is in store for me?</span> <span id="s104">I remember one night, we were awakened about two or there o'clock in the morning, and the MP's stormed in, and told us to get off our bunks, and our bunks were just that, bunks.</span></p>

six weeks or so, maybe two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">SWB: Were you locked in?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">HELEN FAGIN: We were not locked in, but we were surrounded by fences and we really couldn't get out because, number one, we didn't know where to go, it was a very isolated place.</span> <span id="s117">And secondly, we were really guarded, for whatever reason I don't know.</span> <span id="s118">[Sound of crows in BG] They took us from Wels to Lenz in Germany.</span> <span id="s119">Lenz was another displaced persons camp, but when we arrived there, it was full to capacity.</span> <span id="s120">And they couldn't receive us.</span> <span id="s121">So we were waiting there on a temporary basis, they couldn't accommodate us there.</span> <span id="s122">And finally, they told us that we have to go back on those trucks, and they took th- took us to the south of Austria.</span> <span id="s123">Into a beautiful place called Badgastein.</span> <span id="s124">Which was a resort, in the Alps, and the accommodations were absolutely phenomenal.</span> <span id="s125">They put us up in hotels.</span> <span id="s126">And we had nice beddings, and we didn't have to use outhouses any longer.</span> <span id="s127">We had bathrooms.</span> <span id="s128">And we had indoor showers.</span> <span id="s129">In Wels we had outdoor showers.</span> <span id="s130">And that was a tremendous improvement.</span> <span id="s131">It was, this camp was under the auspices of UNRHA, United Nations Refugee Rehabilitation Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">And the conditions were-were-were much improved.</span> <span id="s133">There was a certain aspect of that camp which was different from any other.</span> <span id="s134">First of all, we were freer to think about our future.</span> <span id="s135">There was a free movement of people in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">And we were aware of what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s137">So we knew that there was such a thing as exodus.</span> <span id="s138">We could leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">We could go by way of Switzerland, to Italy, and we could sign up to go on those boats towards Palestine.</span> <span id="s140">And we could dream at least of a certain kind of an objective, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s142">2/13/95 Int.</span> <span id="s143">HELEN FAGIN Page 7 certain kind of a goal, certain kind of a future, that was in sight.</span> <span id="s144">It was concrete, it was achievable, it was do able.</span> <span id="s145">So those of us who had dreams of going to Palestine did so.</span> <span id="s146">We signed up.</span> <span id="s147">I believe that we arrived in Badgas- tein towards the end of September, probably beginning of October 1945.</span> <span id="s148">The international Red Cross sent us packages, and we were able to find some decent clothes to wear.</span> <span id="s149">With the approaching fall and winter however, we didn't have much winter clothes.</span> <span id="s150">But we were satisfied that we could at least have some decent attire.</span> <span id="s151">Not too much of it, but we were wearing decent clothes.</span> <span id="s152">When winter approached, I remember a very fine young lieutenant, from Dayton, Ohio, I remember his name, Lieutenant Kyle, approached me once and asked me if I had a winter coat, and I said, no I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">So he brought me a G.I. blanket.</span> <span id="s154">And I remember I cut a hole in the middle of the blanket and I wore it as a cape.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">And that was my winter coat and I was very grateful for that.</span> <span id="s156">In the camp I was able to work in the office, cause I spoke fluent German, and it helped us to know the German language to communicate with the rest of the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">The population was not very happy with our presence there.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">But we did the best we could not to aggravate them and to stay out of their way.</span> <span id="s159">The life inside displaced persons' camp... was very interesting.</span> <span id="s160">First of all, we tried to gain awareness of what the potential, what our future oppor- tunities may be.</span> <span id="s161">And we got together quite often, young men and women, to discuss our situation.</span> <span id="s162">The first thing that we did, and that was a very determined act, we were told that if we are of a special, of a certain nationality, we will be given the opportunity to return to the country of our origin.</span> <span id="s163">And if we make that choice, we had to sign up, and we would go to our respective countries.</span> <span id="s164">The other choice was, the other alternative was, to declare ourselves Working transcript: not

<p><span id="s173">HELEN FAGIN: Well in the displaced persons camp of Badgastein, we were given two choices.</span> <span id="s174">One, to return to the country of our origin and become repatriated.</span> <span id="s175">Or to remain in the camp, in that case we have to pronounce ourselves and declare ourselves stateless.</span> <span id="s176">Without any right of belonging to any country any longer.</span> <span id="s177">That was a uh choice that many of us decided in favor of, becoming stateless.</span> <span id="s178">At that moment of our decision I think we suffered a very tremendous anguish.</span> <span id="s179">Because the decision has to be made on the basis of what is there for us in the future.</span> <span id="s180">We knew we cannot go back to Poland, because there was nothing to go back to.</span> <span id="s181">We knew we have lost all the ties to Poland and we knew that the situation in Poland was really not favorable to establishing any kind of a life for ourselves.</span> <span id="s182">So the decision to become stateless was the better decision.</span> <span id="s183">And perhaps the most, the more, the more promising decision for our future.</span> <span id="s184">And it was, at that moment, I remember, that my thoughts and my feelings ran the gamut.</span> <span id="s185">It was a period of feeling tremendous anguish, even despair.</span> <span id="s186">Liberation was a very bittersweet concept for us at that moment.</span> <span id="s187">And as much as we longed for being Working transcript: not spell checked or

holocaust, the situation of having been liberated did not hold very much promise for a better life for us.</span> <span id="s191">Our thoughts went back obviously to the past, to our childhood, to our youth, to our families, to our parents, and there was a tremendous emptiness in our souls and our hearts.</span> <span id="s192">There was no jubilation, there was no happiness, there was almost depression.</span> <span id="s193">When we talked, when we met, we were always somber.</span> <span id="s194">And we couldn't really understand whether or not we made the right decision.</span> <span id="s195">We just felt in our guts that this was the decision that we had to reach.</span> <span id="s196">Knowing full well that we are not the masters of our own fate, we just had to leave everything to those who would direct us from then on.</span> <span id="s197">So many of us decided to be as positive as we could.</span> <span id="s198">We would gather together and we would attend some kind of lectures, I remembered many of us decided to learn English.</span> <span id="s199">Uh we decided to find some books or some uh resources that would allow us to get acquainted at least with the language so we could communicate with the people of UNRHA, most of whom were either American or British.</span> <span id="s200">And I remember getting some kind of a book with verses, with little ditties, little poems, and we were learning them and trying to understand them, and I still remember a couple of them, but uh.</span> <span id="s201">We tried to be as useful to ourselves as possible.</span> <span id="s202">Another aspect of our activities, I remember, were political activities.</span> <span id="s203">We have found out that the British did not allow the boats to uh land in Haifa, and they did not allow, they did not receive the refugees into Palestine.</span> <span id="s204">I don't recall whether we learned about the camp of Cyprus at that time or not, but we heard that some of the boats were returned, and we organized protests.</span> <span id="s205">And we were marching [light plane noise in BG] and protesting, and uh we were very vociferous, very vocal

us all this news, of what was going on, and we tried to inform ourselves the best we could.</span> <span id="s210">And we tried to help people who are in need, that there was a hospital nearby in Hoffgastein, my sister who had some nurses' training was working in that hospital.</span> <span id="s211">We tried to obtain as much medication as we could, to save the health of a number of people who were placed in that hospital.</span> <span id="s212">We tried to be as helpful to each other as we could.</span> <span id="s213">We tried to be as uh social with one another as we could.</span> <span id="s214">There were very many kids who didn't have any parents left and who didn't have any siblings, so we tried to sort of form extended families for those who didn't have any families left.</span> <span id="s215">We tried to boost each others' hopes and we tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s216">The international Red Cross came there to try to find some of our families.</span> <span id="s217">We had families, we thought we had families in England and we gave them the names and they tried to research it for us.</span> <span id="s218">They did research, uh-uh, some of the names for us.</span> <span id="s219">Uh, we tried to communicate with people we knew who lived in Israel, I had family in Israel, and we contacted them.</span> <span id="s220">And we established communications with Israel.</span> <span id="s221">What we were very surprise is that we were not very much helped by any Jewish organizations in the United States.</span> <span id="s222">I don't recall that any of these organizations came forward with any help for us.</span> <span id="s223">As a matter of fact, I do recall that, that high-S[?]</span> <span id="s224">helped

so that I knew how to spell it, and then I would learn how to pronounce it.</span> <span id="s250">And the pronunciation of course was very difficult once you are more or less an adult, it's very very difficult to forget the uh, idioms of a language that you were trained in, and translate them into a different language.</span> <span id="s251">Uh, but you really don't want me to talk about my time

nationalities.</span> <span id="s270">Many Czechoslovakian, many Hungarian, many Rumanian Jews.</span> <span id="s271">Uh, I don't remember that there were very many north European Jews, but I do remember central and east European Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">SWB: Did you think there was a lack of understanding on the part of the administrators, or the MP's, because many of you were

the people, but I have the impression that is so lasting, as a matter of fact I spoke with my younger sister about it the other day.</span> <span id="s275">And I ask her what kind of impressions she took out of there.</span> <span id="s276">And she confirmed with me that she felt the same way.</span> <span id="s277">So it's not a personal aversion, it is something that was a general atmosphere, a general feeling, that we weren't cared for as human beings, we were just cared for as uh, as-as-as an entity to-to-to-to-to, to-to process more or less, it was a processing feeling rather than caring

how to act and how to uh, relate to the people we have uh met, whether to blow our cover or not, because we really didn't trust the Polish people.</span> <span id="s298">So we decided not to show our-our elation, and to take it with low profile, and that was a very lucky choice for us, because sure enough, somehow or other, the Russian had to re- Russians had to retreat, and the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s299">When the Germans came back we really were very frightened.</span> <span id="s300">We thought that we are going to be renounced by the population, who may have sensed our elation with the Germans.</span> <span id="s301">And uh we decided to go east to move east as far east as we could, but we really couldn't get very far because the front moved, kept moving from one kilometer one way to the one kilometer the other way.</span> <span id="s302">So we went underground, and then we-we-we heard fighting, and we just didn't know what to do, so we hid in-in basements as much as we could, until about few days later when we heard total silence, when we didn't hear any shooting, when we uh sent somebody out to uh find out whether it was safe to come out and when we came out indeed the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s303">And they assured us that they were there for good, and that the Germans retreated for good, and then we really blew our cover, and we felt that we were free to be ourselves.</span> <span id="s304">And then of course, the bittersweet feeling came upon us.</span> <span id="s305">We uh made the decision to return to our hometown, to see whether we can find anyone alive, and then we confronted the rubbles, the physical rubbles and the psychological rubbles of uh, of the aftermath of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">SWB: And so
