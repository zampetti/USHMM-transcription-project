were about 20 miles from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s80">There was a railroad line that went through and had a stop and a couple of hotels.</span> <span id="s81">One of them was owned by a Jewish family distantly related on my mother’s side of the family.</span> <span id="s82">It was not backward.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Did you live near the train station?</span> <span id="s84">Yes we

you?</span> <span id="s99">Were you good in school?</span> <span id="s100">Were you an athlete?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">I think I was pretty fair in school.</span> <span id="s102">I was not an

id="s106">There was a town pool that until the Hitler years you could go.</span> <span id="s107">You have to remember that some towns were much worse with regard to the enforcement and our town was not that bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">What made it not too bad?</span> <span id="s109">People knew each other and there was a Jewish business community and the elected or appointed officials weren’t that serious with regard to the enforcement in the early years.</span> <span id="s110">It got worse in the later 30s.</span> <span id="s111">I had some non-Jewish friends in school when I could still go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Did you go sleigh riding in the snow?</span> <span id="s113">Yes Did you go ice skating?</span> <span id="s114">Yes, there was a pond that froze

on to your shoe?</span> <span id="s118">Probably.</span> <span id="s119">I don’t remember Did you play volleyball or ping pong?</span> <span id="s120">I played ping pong.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">How tall are you today?</span> <span id="s122">Oh, I shrunk.</span> <span id="s123">I’m probably 5 foot or a little under.</span> <span id="s124">I was 5 foot 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Do you remember any of your grandparents?</span> <span id="s126">I remember my maternal grandparents vaguely.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Do you know what your grandmother’s name was?</span> <span id="s128">17: 27 Um, my father’s parents were dead before I was born.</span> <span id="s129">My father was the youngest of ten children.</span> <span id="s130">He didn’t marry until his early forties, so…it’s a little hard to go back that far, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Do you know the names of your mother’s parents?</span> <span id="s132">Yes, um.</span> <span id="s133">Adolph Simon and I think it was…it may have been Freida.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Okay.</span> <span id="s135">What do you remember about your grandmother?</span> <span id="s136">That she was not well.</span> <span id="s137">I mean she died when I was quite young.</span> <span id="s138">I don’t remember who died first, but he was killed in an accident and she died soon after in the late twenties, I think, so I was very young at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Do you think your grandmother wore anything on her head like a sheittel?</span> <span id="s140">Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Where did your grandparents live?</span> <span id="s142">They lived in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">What do you remember about your grandfather, Adolph?</span> <span id="s144">Not much.</span> <span id="s145">Nothing pertinent.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Do you know what they did for a living?</span> <span id="s147">He was a cattle dealer.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">How many children did Adolph and Freida have?</span> <span id="s149">Actually, that was the second marriage.</span> <span id="s150">Adolph’s first marriage…she died very young and she had had with him four daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Do you know their names?</span> <span id="s152">Yes.</span> <span id="s153">Those were my aunts, I knew all of them.</span> <span id="s154">What were their names?</span> <span id="s155">When Adolph remarried they had two sons because somebody, you know how to take care of the young children.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">So was your mother from the first wife?</span> <span id="s157">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Do you know the name of the second wife?</span> <span id="s159">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s161">That was the one who I thought was my grandmother because I didn’t know the first wife.</span> <span id="s162">The first wife died when my mother was a kid.</span> <span id="s163">So there were four girls and then subsequently there were two boys out of that marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Do you know the names of the four girls?</span> <span id="s165">Yes.</span> <span id="s166">One was Selma, that was my mother, and then there was Freida – another Freida – she was called Fridel, f-r-i-d-e-l, I think.</span> <span id="s167">And Eugenia, and uh Julia And do you know the names of the uh?</span> <span id="s168">B: The two men?</span> <span id="s169">Were Alfred and Albert.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">So what do you remember about Freida?</span> <span id="s171">I can’t really tell you anything about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Do you know where she lived?</span> <span id="s173">In the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Do you know if she was married?</span> <span id="s175">I don’t follow what you’re getting at.</span> <span id="s176">We’re talking about the daughters of my grandparents?</span> <span id="s177">Yeah, Freida was married and she lived in Munich and she emigrated in the early thirties to Buenos Aires.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">And do you know her husband’s name or what they did for a living?</span> <span id="s179">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Do you know if they had children?</span> <span id="s181">Yes.</span> <span id="s182">They had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Do you know their names?</span> <span id="s184">Yes.</span> <span id="s185">Gerhardt (sp?)</span> <span id="s186">and Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Are you in contact with them or?</span> <span id="s188">I used to be.</span> <span id="s189">You have to remember they are all in their eighties and some of them have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">What do you remember about your aunt Eugenia?</span> <span id="s191">She had a very interesting life.</span> <span id="s192">She married an American man in the twenties who was connected to the United States consulate.</span> <span id="s193">And she was actually responsible for helping my parents and my younger sister leave Germany in May of 1939 because she had become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s194">She was able to expedite their exit otherwise they never would have gotten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">So would you say she probably saved your life or your family?</span> <span id="s196">Well I wouldn’t go as far as that but she was instrumental in expediting their exit.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Do you know what her husband’s name was?</span> <span id="s198">Casey.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">She lived in America?</span> <span id="s200">No her husband was stationed in Berlin with the United States consulate service.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Did she have children?</span> <span id="s202">She had one son.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s204">Walter.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">And they all survived the war?</span> <span id="s206">Well she divorced Casey, I don’t remember when, probably in the forties and her son survived the war, he became a writer.</span> <span id="s207">He lived in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">What do you remember about your aunt Julia?</span> <span id="s209">I think I liked her best of all the aunts.</span> <span id="s210">She had two sons.</span> <span id="s211">One of whom is still alive and lives in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Where did Julia live before the war?</span> <span id="s213">In Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">And what was her husband’s name?</span> <span id="s215">Werner And what did they do for a living?</span> <span id="s216">I think he was in the retail shoe business.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">And do you remember the names of their children?</span> <span id="s218">Frank and Peter.</span> <span id="s219">Peter and Frank in that order, and Frank lives in Germany now.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Did they all survive the war?</span> <span id="s221">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">What do you remember about your uncle Alfred?</span> <span id="s223">He and his brother were called Fred and Bert.</span> <span id="s224">They emigrated in the late twenties to the United States.</span> <span id="s225">And they were instrumental in getting us affidavits and coming here to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">So Fred, where did he live?</span> <span id="s227">In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">And do you remember what he did for a living?</span> <span id="s229">Fred and Bert were in business together – they were importing and exporting goods, I don’t know exactly what.</span> <span id="s230">A lot of straw goods – I can’t really put a name to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Do you remember their wives’ names?</span> <span id="s232">They got married…when I came here in 1938 there were still single.</span> <span id="s233">They both married…they both married late.</span> <span id="s234">Bert married a woman by the name of Sitta, s-i-t-t-a, and she was also a refugee.</span> <span id="s235">And Fred married a woman by the name of Rose and she was born in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Who do you think came from a more religious family, your father or your mother?</span> <span id="s237">Probably my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Why do you think so?</span> <span id="s239">That’s just the impression I got because some of her extended family, whom I very vaguely remember, they were keeping the holidays more seriously than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Do you know the names of your father’s parents?</span> <span id="s241">Jacob and Bertha.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Do you know where they came from?</span> <span id="s243">No.</span> <span id="s244">I could probably look that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Do you know what they did for a living?</span> <span id="s246">They had started that distillery business.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">You said they had how many children?</span> <span id="s248">I think ten who survived.</span> <span id="s249">I think a couple of them died in either childbirth or…I know of ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">And do you know all the names of the ten?</span> <span id="s251">I would have to look it up.</span> <span id="s252">I have it on paper somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Did you know your father’s brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s254">They were all older.</span> <span id="s255">I knew two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">What were their names?</span> <span id="s257">They were both deported, they never got out.</span> <span id="s258">They were both deported to Thereisenstadt and one of them died in Thereisenstadt.</span> <span id="s259">The other one was able to make it out when she was quite old and sick into Switzerland and she still wrote us a letter or two but she died in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Did she die in Switzerland after the war?</span> <span id="s261">Yes after the war.</span> <span id="s262">She was liberated from Thereisenstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Do you know the names of those two sisters?</span> <span id="s264">The one who lived past the war was Rosa Frei, f-r-e-i.</span> <span id="s265">She was quite religious, she married a cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s267">I think it was Heinrich, the German word for Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Did they have children?</span> <span id="s269">He had children by his first wife.</span> <span id="s270">As a matter of fact she had an interesting life.</span> <span id="s271">She emigrated to the United States in the early part of the century and when his wife who was an older sister of Rosa’s died and left a brood of children, she had to come back and marry him.</span> <span id="s272">I think her history is already at Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Right.</span> <span id="s274">Do you remember the name of your mother’s sister who died in Thereisenstadt?</span> <span id="s275">It wasn’t my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">You’re right, your father’s sister.</span> <span id="s277">B: Her name was – I have to pronounce it in German because I don’t know what it is in English: Hermoine.</span> <span id="s278">She died in Thereisenstadt.</span> <span id="s279">She was never married.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Now, before the war, how did you get around?</span> <span id="s281">On foot or bicycle, streetcar, automobile?</span> <span id="s282">How did you travel?</span> <span id="s283">Well, there was a lot of walking.</span> <span id="s284">We did bicycling.</span> <span id="s285">We walked to school.</span> <span id="s286">My father did have a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Do you remember what kind of car it was?</span> <span id="s288">It was an Opel.</span> <span id="s289">And he had a chauffeur when he first got the car because he didn’t know how to drive.</span> <span id="s290">And then when non-Jewish people were not supposed to work for you anymore he had to learn how to drive, he never became a good driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Did you always have electricity at home?</span> <span id="s292">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">The bathroom, was inside the house or outside?</span> <span id="s294">Inside.</span> <span id="s295">No, we had…I think the house was an old house but my father had a bathroom installed after my father and mother married.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Do you still remember what they used for toilet paper?</span> <span id="s297">B: Toilet paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Like today?</span> <span id="s299">I think so.</span> <span id="s300">I never even thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">And did you always have running water?</span> <span id="s302">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Did you have hot water?</span> <span id="s304">Yes.</span> <span id="s305">We had a boiler in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s306">We had…was like a copper colored tank it was probably copper like a tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Do you ever remember going to a Mikvah, you know, like a public bath?</span> <span id="s308">No, no.</span> <span id="s309">I think there was one in town, but I…we never went, my mother never went.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Do you remember how they washed clothes?</span> <span id="s311">I think in later years we had a washing machine.</span> <span id="s312">We had something I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">What did they do before the later years?</span> <span id="s314">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s315">I do remember that there was a washing machine, but I don’t remember when that came in, but what they did…if they didn’t have it before.</span> <span id="s316">We had a woman who came in once a week who did…my mother had a woman who came in once a week to wash and to iron laundry.</span> <span id="s317">There was a little round pot belly stove that you put the irons on that had handles that you could take off, wooden handles wooden handles that clipped on.</span> <span id="s318">I still have one of them here that…as a doorstop.</span> <span id="s319">Makes a very good doorstop.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Now, do you remember having a telephone?</span> <span id="s321">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">And was that something you could use as a kid or was it just for the adults?</span> <span id="s323">I don’t remember using it as a kid, but I think we could have used it if we needed to – we would have to ask for permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Do you remember the telephone number?</span> <span id="s325">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Now Bea, were you born in a hospital or at home?</span> <span id="s327">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">What would you guess?</span> <span id="s329">B: What would I guess?</span> <span id="s330">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Do you know about your sisters?</span> <span id="s332">No.</span> <span id="s333">The youngest I’m sure was born in a hospital, we had a hospital in town – I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Now, do you remember having a lot of toys to play with when you were little?</span> <span id="s335">Yeah we had some toys, but…we weren’t spoiled kids.</span> <span id="s336">I remember there were a couple of friends of mine who always seemed to have more stuff than I did.</span> <span id="s337">We were a very frugal family.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">So, do you remember anything about what kind of toys you had?</span> <span id="s339">You know, frankly, I hadn’t thought about all this stuff so you’re asking me so many questions that I have difficulty….</span></p> <p><span id="s340">You do the best you can – do you remember anything about what kind of games you played with your friends?</span> <span id="s341">We had a couple of board games, I don’t remember what they were called.</span> <span id="s342">I think we played….</span> <span id="s343">we played some card games too, my father was a card player.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Do you think it was better the way it was when you were little in Germany or the way it is in America where the kids have too many toys?</span> <span id="s345">Well, you can’t even think in terms of comparing that!</span> <span id="s346">It was a whole different time element, I mean that doesn’t fit into this story.</span> <span id="s347">I mean I think the kids here do have a lot too much stuff, but there are kids who are homeless who don’t have a thing, you know you can’t compare; this is the early thirties we’re talking about.</span> <span id="s348">The twenties when I was little, I mean…that’s a whole different life.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">So how did you get shoes?</span> <span id="s350">Did you go to a shoemaker or did you go into a store to buy shoes?</span> <span id="s351">You’d go into a store to buy.</span> <span id="s352">.</span> <span id="s353">!</span> <span id="s354">...Germany was very modern at a very early stage.</span> <span id="s355">You’re referring to areas that I really consider backward, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">So how often did you get new shoes?</span> <span id="s357">I don’t know, it was immaterial; when you needed new shoes you got them.</span> <span id="s358">You had more than one pair.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">How did you get clothing?</span> <span id="s360">Did you go to a seamstress, a dressmaker, or did you go to a store?</span> <span id="s361">Some of it was done by a seamstress and some of it was bought ready-made.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Now did your sisters get hand-me-downs sometimes from you?</span> <span id="s363">Yes, yes; why not?</span> <span id="s364">They didn’t like it and sometimes my mother would dress all of us alike and particularly for some of the… they did a big thing on Channukah or on Purim when you got dressed up for Purim she would try to get us similar things, you know, that were sewn up by a seamstress.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Now, do you remember your parents getting newspapers?</span> <span id="s366">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Do you remember anything about the newspapers?</span> <span id="s368">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Do you know what language they were in?</span> <span id="s370">German Did you have a radio or a gramophone?</span> <span id="s371">We had a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Was it a big radio?</span> <span id="s373">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Did you have a maid or housekeeper?</span> <span id="s375">Yes, we did because my mother tended to business we had help.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Was she Jewish?</span> <span id="s377">No she wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">So what happened?</span> <span id="s379">In the mid30s that became a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Do you remember her name?</span> <span id="s381">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Do you remember where she lived?</span> <span id="s383">She lived in the house.</span> <span id="s384">She had her own room.</span> <span id="s385">We also had a kinderfraulein, someone who was strictly for children.</span> <span id="s386">She was with us when we were really little.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Was she Jewish?</span> <span id="s388">I’m sure she wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s389">By 1933 she wasn’t with us any longer because she was with us when we were really little.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Did anyone in your family play a musical instrument?</span> <span id="s391">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Did you go the theatre or movies before the war?</span> <span id="s393">We went to the movies occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Do you remember going on vacations?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Yes a couple of times.</span> <span id="s396">We never got away as a family because of the business.</span> <span id="s397">There was a time when one of my sisters and I went to a camp for two weeks.</span> <span id="s398">It was run by a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s399">There were 20-30 local Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s400">It was a few hours away near the Alps but in Germany.</span> <span id="s401">We went there by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">What language did you speak before the war?</span> <span id="s403">German Did your parents speak anything else?</span> <span id="s404">They spoke some Yiddish when they didn’t want us to understand.</span> <span id="s405">Or a couple of French phrases that my mother knew.</span> <span id="s406">Before I had to quit school we had an English class so I knew a few words before I got here but I was thrown into an environment in Cincinnati Ohio where they didn’t speak any German and I didn’t speak enough English so I had to learn English real fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Was anyone in your family Zionist?</span> <span id="s408">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Was your family rich or poor before the war?</span> <span id="s410">They were moderate.</span> <span id="s411">There were people in town that were much wealthier than we were but we weren’t missing anything.</span> <span id="s412">And there were people that were much worse off.</span> <span id="s413">It all depended on how my father’s business was.</span> <span id="s414">And as business went down and people wouldn’t come to the store anymore some of them came to the back door sureptiously which was dangerous for them as well as for my parents but they still wanted to get my father’s specialty, kirschwasser, which is made from cherries.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">So how did they make the liquor?</span> <span id="s416">He had a distillery.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Where did they get the grapes from?</span> <span id="s418">Actually it was mostly fruit liquors.</span> <span id="s419">There were farms that sold fruit commercially.</span> <span id="s420">The process of making the liquor I don’t exactly know.</span> <span id="s421">We had these big vats that the fruit was fermented in.</span> <span id="s422">The product of that gets distilled in an apparatus that boils out the product that becomes the alcohol.</span> <span id="s423">If you look it up it will explain better than I can how it is done.</span> <span id="s424">That becomes a clear liquid like when you buy applejack or slivovitz, which is from plums.</span> <span id="s425">If you want a sweet liquor it is colored.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Do you think most of your father’s customers were Jewish?</span> <span id="s427">No, they were largely not.</span> <span id="s428">He sold it in large gallon jars that would go to restaurants and some of it was bottled.</span> <span id="s429">In the distillery in the house there were four rooms with stone floors so you could hose it out.</span> <span id="s430">He had a way of bottling the liquors but he also sold in bulk like to a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Were all of your friends Jewish or were they mixed?</span> <span id="s432">When I first went to school in the late 20s and early 30s they were mixed but then as other people wouldn’t talk to you then they were only Jewish.</span> <span id="s433">The non-Jewish ones wouldn’t talk to you anymore and drifted away.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Do you remember the names of your friends before the war?</span> <span id="s435">Yes, some of them emigrated.</span> <span id="s436">There was Lilo Guggenheim.</span> <span id="s437">She came here and I still saw her for some years in the United States but I haven’t seen her in 50 years.</span> <span id="s438">As a matter of fact she was in touch with me some time ago.</span> <span id="s439">That was one.</span> <span id="s440">I could bring up names of some of the others but I don’t think that matters to your interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">One of them was Hilda Fleischer.</span> <span id="s442">Well, those were my two best friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Did most of your friends from before the war survived the war or no?</span> <span id="s444">B: You mean the Jewish ones?</span> <span id="s445">Well those two did.</span> <span id="s446">They were both married in New York or the area, but I lost touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">What kind of education did you have in Europe?</span> <span id="s448">I finished just about finished high school the last year…you could be out at sixteen and then I went to a business school in Munich for about six months when I lived with my father’s two sisters.</span> <span id="s449">That was in 1937 and then in 1938 I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Before high school, how many years of school did you have?</span> <span id="s451">I guess it was…you know it was one continuous...it must have been ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Was it all in the same school?</span> <span id="s453">No, it was a…it was a small town.</span> <span id="s454">I think it was two different schools; elementary in one building and the…what they would call junior high or high school in another building.</span> <span id="s455">But I never got a diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Why not?</span> <span id="s457">Because I had to leave school before the…you know…I was in eleventh grade and I was…I couldn’t…German Jewish children couldn’t go to school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">When you went to the high school you walked to school?</span> <span id="s459">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">How much time did it take to walk to the school?</span> <span id="s461">Gee, maybe fifteen or twenty minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">And the school, was it all girls or was it boys and girls?</span> <span id="s463">It was…I think it was mixed as I think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">And what percentage of the students do you think were Jewish?</span> <span id="s465">Well in my grade, I don’t…I don’t remember how many people in the class…I’m trying to think…there were only…in my class there were like myself and two other Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s466">In my class of maybe…and I think there was one Jewish boy in the class…you know you’re asking me questions that are really out of my head!</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Do you still remember the names of the two girls?</span> <span id="s468">Well one was Lilo and I think the other one was Hilda.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Did they survive the war?</span> <span id="s470">Yes they were the ones that came here and uh…what we were just talking about!</span> <span id="s471">They married here… So in high school did one teacher teach all the subjects or did they have a different teacher for each subject?</span> <span id="s472">We had a couple of different teachers.</span> <span id="s473">I remember the English teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">What do you remember about the English teacher?</span> <span id="s475">Somehow or other…I don’t know she just…because it was important that we…knowing that we may leave it was important that we learned English so I learned a little and she sort of made an impression.</span> <span id="s476">I wanted to learn it so at least I knew a few words before I got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">What was your favorite subject in school?</span> <span id="s478">I don’t think I had a favorite subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Did you have your own desk or did you share a desk or?</span> <span id="s480">No you had individual desks…this was a modern town!</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Do you still remember how they have out grades?</span> <span id="s482">Were they number or letter grades?</span> <span id="s483">Um, I think it depended on the subject.</span> <span id="s484">I think in math you got number grades and in some other things you got letter grades.</span> <span id="s485">I think!</span> <span id="s486">But Think that’s very unimportant!</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Did they have gymnastics in school?</span> <span id="s488">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Was that inside or outdoors?</span> <span id="s490">Inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">So how did you learn about religion?</span> <span id="s492">Oh we had a separate religious school in the synagogue, in the temple.</span> <span id="s493">We had a synagogue that was burned down on Kristallnacht when I was already here and we had a cantor and a rabbi and the cantor gave lessons and the rabbi also so we learned religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Now, do you remember anti-Semitism before the war?</span> <span id="s495">Of course.</span> <span id="s496">When your friends didn’t talk to you anymore that was all part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Do you remember being called names because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s498">No, not really.</span> <span id="s499">We just knew that people were leaving you alone.</span> <span id="s500">They just…it really got bad after I left.</span> <span id="s501">My sister who experienced a lot more of that, my younger sister, she had a terrible time during 1938.</span> <span id="s502">I left in July ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">What happened to her?</span> <span id="s504">She experienced all that when my father was picked up on Kristallnacht and she could tell you the details of that much better than I could, but I think she’s already been interviewed and she works as a volunteer at the Leo Beack Institute in New York so she’s up on all that.</span> <span id="s505">But, I would…I did not feel that much of it because as I said some towns…by that time, by mid ’38, some towns were much worse than where I was and when my parents enrolled me in this business school in Munich because I couldn’t go to finish high school they were able to keep that fairly secret so I didn’t make any friends there but people let me be.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Where you ever afraid to go out on any of the holidays like on Christmas or Easter because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s507">I don’t think we went out on Christmas.</span> <span id="s508">We just stayed home, particularly in those years.</span> <span id="s509">Early on we may have gone out.</span> <span id="s510">My parents had friends in town whose children were either a year or two older or younger and we got together with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">What do you remember about Shabbos in Europe?</span> <span id="s512">We weren’t religious.</span> <span id="s513">We didn’t go to services on Friday nights or Saturday.</span> <span id="s514">The synagogue had an upstairs section.</span> <span id="s515">It was not segregate but downstairs the men sat on one side and women on the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">On Shabbos did you have special food?</span> <span id="s517">No.</span> <span id="s518">But we always had a special meal on Friday night because it was tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">What did you have on Friday night?</span> <span id="s520">We always had chicken made a certain way.</span> <span id="s521">We really didn’t have any special food.</span> <span id="s522">We didn’t have pork in the house but we didn’t keep kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">The last time we were talking, what do you remember about Purim in Europe?</span> <span id="s524">We had a congregation in Goeppingen.</span> <span id="s525">I really don’t know how many Jewish families were there in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s526">Most of them had not emigrated yet between when I was really young and 1936 or 37.</span> <span id="s527">There were some Purim celebrations.</span> <span id="s528">There was one Jewish run hotel and they were second cousins on my mother’s side of the family.</span> <span id="s529">They ran a hotel and restaurant and we had some celebrations there for Purim, kids dressed up.</span> <span id="s530">There were other functions there when Jewish families got together or else people celebrated at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">What do you remember about Succot?</span> <span id="s532">It was observed like the other holidays What about Pesach?</span> <span id="s533">It was observed but it was private family.</span> <span id="s534">My father never made a seder.</span> <span id="s535">It wasn’t his thing.</span> <span id="s536">He observed the high holidays.</span> <span id="s537">We were palmed off on other families, we as children, so we could experience it.</span> <span id="s538">I remember having to go to Uncle Morris.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Do you remember anything about Yom Kippur?</span> <span id="s540">Yes, we went to synaogogue What do you remember about the synagogue?</span> <span id="s541">Oh, we had a beautiful synagogue but it was destroyed on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s542">They do have a small memorial there.</span> <span id="s543">When I was back in the year 2000, or whatever year it was.</span> <span id="s544">I got to see it in 1979 when I made a trip with my daughter I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">So where did the women sit?</span> <span id="s546">The men sat on one side and the women sat on the other.</span> <span id="s547">Upstairs it was the same way but there was no barrier, or curtain.</span> <span id="s548">The center aisle separated the women from the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Do you remember anything about Hanukkah?</span> <span id="s550">Yes, we got presents and lit the menorah.</span> <span id="s551">What kind of menorah did you have?</span> <span id="s552">Candles or oil?</span> <span id="s553">It was candles, not oil.</span> <span id="s554">We played dreidel a couple of times but it wasn’t a big deal How did your family take photographs before the war?</span> <span id="s555">I don’t remember whether we had a camera for snapshots.</span> <span id="s556">For formal pictures my mother called in a photographer.</span> <span id="s557">There must have been a box camera that was available because I do have snapshots in an album from Germany so cameras must have been available.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">My father was not very good about mechanics like that.</span> <span id="s559">He was good at other things.</span> <span id="s560">He didn’t have the interest or the patience.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Do you remember being sick when you were little?</span> <span id="s562">You called the doctor and he came to the house.</span> <span id="s563">And he was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s564">Do you still remember his name?</span> <span id="s565">No Did you have any serious illnesses?</span> <span id="s566">No, but my sister, one of us had measles…the normal childhood illnesses.</span> <span id="s567">I didn’t have chicken pox.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t remember which one I had.</span> <span id="s569">It wasn’t that serious.</span> <span id="s570">Somebody had mumps.</span> <span id="s571">I don’t remember which one of them I had.</span> <span id="s572">My youngest sister, she was hospitalized for something for a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">You were never married in Europe were you?</span> <span id="s574">No, I left when I was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Were you working?</span> <span id="s576">No, I was helping out at home in the store somewhat.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Would you say that you had a happy childhood?</span> <span id="s578">Yes, I had a normal childhood until things got tough and your school friends didn’t talk to you anymore.</span> <span id="s579">When I first went to school I had friends in the classroom and you got together with them after school some times.</span> <span id="s580">We weren’t that heavily programmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">When did things get bad?</span> <span id="s582">In our town I would say in the the mid 30’s when all these German rules, you couldn’t do this and you couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">What kind of restrictions do you remember?</span> <span id="s584">You just began to live much more carefully.</span> <span id="s585">You didn’t take chances on going somewhere where maybe you weren’t supposed to go or you weren’t accepted.</span> <span id="s586">It was sort of its like walking on eggs.</span> <span id="s587">There were all kinds of German rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s588">It really got bad after I left Do you remember hearing Hitler on the radio?</span> <span id="s589">Yes How did you feel when you heard him on the radio?</span> <span id="s590">We hated it.</span> <span id="s591">My father kept saying I fought in the World War, I defended this country.</span> <span id="s592">He got very upset and it sort of influenced everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Do you remember seeing people marching in the streets?</span> <span id="s594">Yes, and you tried not to, when you’re looking out the window you sort of looked through the curtains so they shouldn’t see your face looking at them.</span> <span id="s595">And when they had a parade for some other occasion, the Nazis marched in that too, you wanted to see it but you tried not to be seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">What happened to Jewish businesses?</span> <span id="s597">They were boycotted.</span> <span id="s598">As a matter of fact I have a photograph my father had on the main street a small branch store.</span> <span id="s599">And the people who he used to have working there you couldn’t have them work there anymore.</span> <span id="s600">And they posted 2 SS guards in uniform in front of the store so that nobody would go in.</span> <span id="s601">That was in late 38.</span> <span id="s602">But people didn’t want to be seen, even if you had people who wanted to go in, if it was a Jewish store, people were afraid to go in because they weren’t supposed to patronize, or do business with you, so gradually that folded.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Were you allowed to have a radio?</span> <span id="s604">While I was there yes, maybe not after.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Do you remember any other things you saw that were scary?</span> <span id="s606">You saw a lot of flags and official stuff that you hated to see.</span> <span id="s607">They hung their big flags out.</span> <span id="s608">When you went into town there was an open market once a week, like a farmers market, and my mother used to go there and shop.</span> <span id="s609">You didn’t do stuff like that anymore.</span> <span id="s610">You managed to get what you needed otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Was it hard to get food?</span> <span id="s612">Were you hungry at all?</span> <span id="s613">No, I never remember being hungry.</span> <span id="s614">There were certain food shortages, generally, there wasn’t much in the way of oranges and imports, fruits like that.</span> <span id="s615">But I never remember being hungry, I will say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">During that time you said a lot of the non-Jewish people, the gentiles wouldn’t talk to you.</span> <span id="s617">Would some of them still talk to you?</span> <span id="s618">Yes, as little as possible and if no one else was around.</span> <span id="s619">I mean we still had some interactions with some people.</span> <span id="s620">It was a relatively small town.</span> <span id="s621">Geoppingen was an industrial town.</span> <span id="s622">As a matter of fact I have a book that was put out recently that was put out to attract businesses to settle there and do business and evidently it’s become quite a good town.</span> <span id="s623">You knew your neighbors across the street.</span> <span id="s624">I think they were still cordial but they weren’t looking to talk to you at length about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Did you realize how bad that things could get?</span> <span id="s626">Probably not.</span> <span id="s627">That’s why my parents didn’t start to look to emigrate earlier My mother’s two sisters and their families emigrated much earlier in the other 30’s.</span> <span id="s628">One had lived in Munich.</span> <span id="s629">Munich was much worse as far as anti-Semitism was concerned than the small towns like where we lived.</span> <span id="s630">And my mother’s other sister’s family lived in Berlin and they emigrated to Argentina in the early 30s, probably 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Do you remember your parents talking a lot about leaving?</span> <span id="s632">That’s why they let my sister and I go.</span> <span id="s633">My mother’s two younger brothers emigrated in the late 20’s to the United States.</span> <span id="s634">And they set up a business here but neither one of them was married at the time.</span> <span id="s635">They found relatives in Cincinnati Ohio who said that we, the children, meaning my sister and I, she was 15 and I was 17 when we came here, that we could live with them and that would be OK.</span> <span id="s636">They couldn’t take in the whole family.</span> <span id="s637">My mother didn’t want two young teenagers living with two bachelor uncles.</span> <span id="s638">You could understand that I’m sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Do you remember people getting taken away?</span> <span id="s640">No, not when I was there.</span> <span id="s641">That was later.</span> <span id="s642">Or in some towns it may have been earlier but not where we were.</span> <span id="s643">My father was taken away on Kristallnacht but I was not home at that point.</span> <span id="s644">I was here.</span> <span id="s645">And of course I didn’t find out about that until much later.</span> <span id="s646">Mail was censored.</span> <span id="s647">I don’t know whether the Germans censored the mail or the United States censored the mail coming from Germany.</span> <span id="s648">I suspect the mail was censored in Germany so, I’m pretty sure it was so if they wanted to write to us first of all it would be snail mail so it would take forever.</span> <span id="s649">Secondly, stuff was occasionally blacked out but they knew enough not to write anything that would alert the authorities that you were saying something that wasn’t right.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Did you ever see anything where they cut people’s beard’s?</span> <span id="s651">No Were there times when you were very scared?</span> <span id="s652">Yes I’m sure there were times when I was scared.</span> <span id="s653">And people from Eastern Europe and elsewhere were streaming into Germany even earlier.</span> <span id="s654">They had their own problems before Hitler.</span> <span id="s655">They had pogroms in Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s656">That is well known.</span> <span id="s657">And sometimes we would get someone knocking at the door who was in really bad shape and wanted food and my mother would always arrange to give them food.</span> <span id="s658">I don’t think we ever took anyone in.</span> <span id="s659">But stake them in to feed them and let them take something along.</span> <span id="s660">That happened occasionally.</span> <span id="s661">I saw that very occasionally.</span> <span id="s662">Maybe in happened more so after 38 before war broke out.</span> <span id="s663">Germany went to war September 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">So how did your parents reach a decision to emigrate themselves?</span> <span id="s665">Well once they had us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Well how did they decide that you were going to leave?</span> <span id="s667">I had more or less finished school.</span> <span id="s668">I didn’t get a diploma but I had the requisite number of school years and my sister still had to finish school.</span> <span id="s669">You couldn’t go to the high schools anymore.</span> <span id="s670">The Jewish community set up what they could but it wasn’t working very well.</span> <span id="s671">They saw the handwriting on the wall and you couldn’t help but know that you have to leave.</span> <span id="s672">All these rules that the Germans came up with.</span> <span id="s673">I can’t enumerate them to you.</span> <span id="s674">I don’t know who you spoke to and who else you interviewed and what you learned.</span> <span id="s675">But you were restricted as to how much money you could have and you had to give up other things.</span> <span id="s676">And particularly after Kristallnacht it got very bad but as I said I wasn’t there to experience that.</span> <span id="s677">My sister Margot experienced all that.</span> <span id="s678">Even in early 38 when my parents arranged for us… Why did they arrange for you?</span> <span id="s679">Was there a specific event?</span> <span id="s680">Was there something that scared them?</span> <span id="s681">Probably, other people and friends and family were leaving.</span> <span id="s682">My father just never thought it would get bad until Kristallnacht when he was picked up and taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s683">I found out about all that subsequently but at that point they realized they had to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Do you know what he experienced there?</span> <span id="s685">He would never talk about it.</span> <span id="s686">He repressed in totally.</span> <span id="s687">I don’t know exactly how long he was there but my mother was approached about “selling” of course that’s in quotes, giving up the business.</span> <span id="s688">Someone in town wanted it so she told the authorities that were in touch with her that she couldn’t handle that and he would have to train someone and she would take care of it when they released him.</span> <span id="s689">So they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Do you have any idea what he sold it for?</span> <span id="s691">He didn’t really get enough money for it, probably enough to buy passage out.</span> <span id="s692">They were subsequently, sometime in the 60’s I think through a German attorney who did those kinds of transactions, were able to sell the property, the house, which was knocked down.</span> <span id="s693">By the time I was there in 1979 the house was no longer standing.</span> <span id="s694">The house across the street was still there, it was not as old as my parent’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Do you think that your father was hurt when he was there?</span> <span id="s696">I have no doubt.</span> <span id="s697">What they made them do, stand for hours on end.</span> <span id="s698">He didn’t come out with any broken bones or anything.</span> <span id="s699">He probably lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s700">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">When you left was this discussed with you?</span> <span id="s702">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s703">This wasn’t brought on suddenly.</span> <span id="s704">We knew a few weeks before that we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Who did you go with?</span> <span id="s706">My sister Anne who is 2 years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s707">She had been in England.</span> <span id="s708">There was an exchange program of kids being able to go to England for a school year because she couldn’t go to school in Germany any more.</span> <span id="s709">Two years made a difference as far as school was concerned.</span> <span id="s710">They called it the kindertransport.</span> <span id="s711">She was at a school in rural England for 9 months for the school year, probably the fall, part of 37 and part of 38.</span> <span id="s712">When she came back she knew quite a lot of English.</span> <span id="s713">I had a year of English in school in Germany while I was still going to school.</span> <span id="s714">After I couldn’t go to school anymore, my father had a business acquaintance in Stuttgart who ran a restaurant and he sold them liquors and they were able to let me go there for about 4-6 weeks to help in the kitchen and learn cooking.</span> <span id="s715">They did him a favor.</span> <span id="s716">The people who were in that kitchen with me didn’t realize at the beginning that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s717">It was OK.</span> <span id="s718">It wasn’t uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s719">I took the train to Stuttgart every morning for no more than six weeks.</span> <span id="s720">They needed me to have something to do.</span> <span id="s721">I should have been in school but I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Did you look Jewish?</span> <span id="s723">Some Jews have blond hair and blue eyes.</span> <span id="s724">I had dark hair.</span> <span id="s725">Yeah you’re right I didn’t have a big nose.</span> <span id="s726">I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s727">I was good looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">What about the rest of your family did they look Jewish?</span> <span id="s729">No, not particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">When your sister went to England did she stay with Jewish people?</span> <span id="s731">No, that was a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Did she like that trip?</span> <span id="s733">No she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Why not?</span> <span id="s735">Actually my parents did her a favor.</span> <span id="s736">She felt, she’s the middle child, she always felt that she was getting the short end of the stick for some reason, even as she grew up in her 20s.</span> <span id="s737">I think it never left her.</span> <span id="s738">I don’t know if that happens to a lot of middle children or not.</span> <span id="s739">She wasn’t really happy there.</span> <span id="s740">But it was something that was done.</span> <span id="s741">Other parents did the same thing if they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Why didn’t your younger sister Margot go with you?</span> <span id="s743">It was an imposition on the people that took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Interview of Bea Kandell by Brad Zarlin, December 10, 2013 Audio file 2: Part II So you said…why didn’t Margot go with you?</span> <span id="s745">Well first of all they felt that she was too young.</span> <span id="s746">She was only thirteen at the time and the people in Cincinnati said two of us so they thought they would send the two older ones and I don’t think you would let a thirteen-year-old do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">How did you come in contact with these people in Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s748">My uncles…they were distant relatives on my mother’s side of the family you know there was a big wave of immigration to the United States not only from Germany, from other places too in Western Europe in the late 1800s in the 1890s I think it was and my mother’s father, one of the brothers of his, emigrated as a young man at that time and then he married here in the United States and he had a family and some other family who was here from an earlier immigration too knew about that and so the…my mother’s two younger brothers got in touch with them and they volunteered to have two of us come.</span> <span id="s749">As a matter of fact, my sister did not live in the same house with them and myself because she needed to go to school and they placed her with one of their very good friends and she lived with that family.</span> <span id="s750">I mean, I got to see her while I was with this family and I had to learn English real quick because they didn’t speak any German.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">So when you came to America when was that?</span> <span id="s752">In July 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">And did you come by boat?</span> <span id="s754">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">And where did the boat leave from?</span> <span id="s756">The boat left from Antwerp, but I do not remember the name of the boat – I knew you were going to ask me that, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s757">Is it your cousin who put you in touch with me?</span> <span id="s758">Donna Brad: Yeah.</span> <span id="s759">B: She said you know you can research that, but I really don’t know how to go about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Did you speak English at the time?</span> <span id="s761">No!</span> <span id="s762">Just barely.</span> <span id="s763">I mean I spoke…whatever you learn…if you take up a language in high school in a few months how much of it do you learn that you could speak?</span> <span id="s764">You may be able to understand people that are speaking to you if they speak slowly, but how much do you…you’re not really fluent in the language; you follow what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s765">Brad: Amen!</span></p> <p><span id="s766">These people sponsored you right?</span> <span id="s767">I think my uncles sponsored me.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">What was his name?</span> <span id="s769">Bert and Fred (Simon?)</span> <span id="s770">.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">And do you remember how much money you brought with you?</span> <span id="s772">Ten dollars.</span> <span id="s773">I mean the equivalent of…yes, ten dollars.</span> <span id="s774">That’s all we were allowed to take out.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Per person?</span> <span id="s776">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">And do you remember how much…how many belongings or suitcases you brought?</span> <span id="s778">Probably a couple.</span> <span id="s779">I mean, I just brought clothing.</span> <span id="s780">I mean you had to give up all your jewelry in Germany; they didn’t allow you any it was all confiscated that was in the…between the mid to late thirties.</span> <span id="s781">That was already in effect when I was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">So do you remember how you felt about leaving?</span> <span id="s783">I’m sure I was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Were you allowed to tell the other kids that you were leaving?</span> <span id="s785">B: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Like your friends; did you tell your friends that you were going?</span> <span id="s787">My…the couple of Jewish friends that I had at the time, yes they knew.</span> <span id="s788">You’re forgetting we all made arrangements their parents were all making arrangements to try to get out.</span> <span id="s789">I know one family who was quite wealthy and they were able to get money out earlier in the thirties while they could still do it…they left for different places you know.</span> <span id="s790">A couple of people went to England were able to get to England and then subsequently they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s791">Coming back to my learning English when I came back to New York after…when we knew my parents were coming my uncles had asked us to get back here and I took a Greyhound bus from Cincinnati to New York and they picked me up – or, as a matter of fact, another cousin who was working for them picked me up at the bus and took me to their loft where their business was and they had rented a room for me with somebody in Washington Heights until my parents got here a couple of weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">What do you remember about the boat with your sister?</span> <span id="s793">Well that was…not really much.</span> <span id="s794">We met a couple of people who befriended us who were young people, I think it was a brother and sister traveling together unless they were more than that and we didn’t catch on.</span> <span id="s795">They were probably in their twenties and we sort of latched on to them once they realized that we were by ourselves, you know.</span> <span id="s796">And I remember they told us they were from St. Louis – it’s funny the things that you remember.</span> <span id="s797">Fortunately we didn’t get seasick.</span> <span id="s798">The voyage was probably about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Do you remember where you slept?</span> <span id="s800">In a state room a small state room, you know.</span> <span id="s801">Two of us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Do you think that everyone on the boat were Jewish?</span> <span id="s803">No!</span> <span id="s804">As a matter of fact I think most of them were not.</span> <span id="s805">And this young couple they definitely were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">So where did the ship arrive?</span> <span id="s807">In New York on the West Side Pier.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Do you remember what time of day you arrived?</span> <span id="s809">I don’t know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Was it night time or day time?</span> <span id="s811">It was definitely day time.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">So do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</span> <span id="s813">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s814">That was very exciting – yes we knew what that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">So who met you when you arrived?</span> <span id="s816">My uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">(What were their names?)</span> <span id="s818">At least one.</span> <span id="s819">Bert and Fred!</span> <span id="s820">Bert and Fred Simon.</span> <span id="s821">I think only one of them met us.</span> <span id="s822">I don’t think it was both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Had you ever met them before?</span> <span id="s824">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s825">They had made a couple of trips back to visit in the early thirties so maybe as late as ’34-’35 but…and we were in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">So do you still remember what you were wearing?</span> <span id="s827">No.</span> <span id="s828">Ordinary clothes, they weren’t as modern as the ones in the United States.</span> <span id="s829">When I earned some money…I was working for the cousin’s husband in Cincinnati and also going to night school to learn American history and more English and a few things.</span> <span id="s830">They had arranged for that.</span> <span id="s831">I think I took the bus to the classes, I don’t recall exactly.</span> <span id="s832">But I remember going to school a few nights a week.</span> <span id="s833">And then, when I had earned some money that I had a little extra money they paid me, I think, ten dollars a week.</span> <span id="s834">I mean, after all they had…I cost them like whatever, you know, but they paid me regardless.</span> <span id="s835">So when I had a little extra money I bought some clothes like everybody else was wearing here.</span> <span id="s836">I felt like mine were a little (bawdy?)</span> <span id="s837">I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">So where did you stay in the beginning?</span> <span id="s839">In their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Where was their house?</span> <span id="s841">In Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s842">Oh you mean when we first got to New York?</span> <span id="s843">My uncle had rented a room with a family, you know, people had those large (rovo?)</span> <span id="s844">type of apartments with six rooms and they were trying to make ends meet they would rent out a room to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">So how long did you stay in New York for?</span> <span id="s846">B: Before we went to Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s847">Oh I think three or four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">And what did you do during that time?</span> <span id="s849">What was your impression of America?</span> <span id="s850">It was a little overwhelming.</span> <span id="s851">I learned how to ride the subways and we got around.</span> <span id="s852">We knew how to…they told us how to get from where we were living to the subway and to take it downtown to my uncle’s office, we spent time there and then…I think we weren’t here more than three weeks.</span> <span id="s853">Then uh…maybe less…I just don’t recall.</span> <span id="s854">Then they drove us out to Cincinnati, one of them, not both.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Oh you went in a car there?</span> <span id="s856">Yeah, my uncle drove us out that I remember.</span> <span id="s857">I came back by bus when uh…a week or so before my parents came.</span> <span id="s858">And my uncle…they rented an apartment for them.</span> <span id="s859">About 144th street or something like that, on the West Side near Broadway.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Yeah, I mean, back in the thirties that was a long trip in a car.</span> <span id="s861">B: I think it was in one day.</span> <span id="s862">I’m pretty sure it was in one day.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t remember staying overnight anywhere, but by the time I came back and somebody took me to this other room that they had rented until we could get into that apartment the uhh.</span> <span id="s864">.</span> <span id="s865">(*brad interrupts*)…Now let me finish!</span> <span id="s866">The person who took me to that room with my luggage introduced me to the woman who he had rented it from and he spoke in German to her and introduced me as who I was that Mr. Simon had rented the room for me and I answered her instead of in German in English!</span> <span id="s867">I had gotten so used to English that I couldn’t formulate a German sentence and he said…this was a young man who took me up there…my uncles didn’t take me so, but this was a German family so the young man said to me, “You idiot!</span> <span id="s868">She doesn’t understand you in English!</span> <span id="s869">She’s only been here a short time speak German to her so I said to him in English, “I can’t seem to get a German sentence out I have to get used to it again!”</span> <span id="s870">(Brad: That’s funny.)</span> <span id="s871">Yeah, that’s why I remember it distinctly, it was so funny!</span> <span id="s872">The way he addressed me.</span> <span id="s873">Then I started, you know so she could understand me.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">So when you came to America did your parents tell you that they were going to come a little bit later with your sister, or…?</span> <span id="s875">They probably did, but I don’t think it was ever discussed; we just assumed that they would come, but then, of course, when things got bad in Germany and war broke out – the war broke out after they were already here on Sept. 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">So do you know anything about what happened to them after you left?</span> <span id="s877">Mail was slow and they couldn’t write anything – I mean they were carrying on the same way they had when I was still there except things got tougher and tougher and business fell off and then they arranged for…through…they were able to get expedited visas because my mother’s younger sister, I think I told you this in the other conversation, my mother’s younger sister was married to an American Vice Consul who was with the office in Berlin so she went…and she had become an American citizen after she married him and she went to the consulate in Stuttgart and tried to expedite a visa and I’m sure that helped because if she hadn’t been able to do that they might never have gotten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">And do you know anything more about what happened on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s879">Uh, no.</span> <span id="s880">I truly…I knew the windows were smashed and the synagogue was burned, I mean, the same story every place.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Did your sister remember any stories, things that happened to her?</span> <span id="s882">I’m sure she does.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">What happened, again, when you arrived in Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s884">Well, it was scary, you know.</span> <span id="s885">I’m sure I was upset, but I made the best of it – Now you were separated from your sister?</span> <span id="s886">Yes, yes I was.</span> <span id="s887">I don’t know how much more you need to know, but – Ok well why don’t we…Bea, the last time we were talking it was when you arrived in Cincinnati, Right?</span> <span id="s888">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Ok, so what do you remember about coming to Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s890">Well, I met this strange couple and their daughter who lived in a small, nice house and I was given to understand that the mother of this girl was my mother’s second cousin.</span> <span id="s891">In other words, her father or grandfather had emigrated to the United States in the late 1800s.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">So what was their name?</span> <span id="s893">During that wave of emigration.</span> <span id="s894">Um what was their name…well her maiden name was Simmons.</span> <span id="s895">They changed it, my mother’s maiden name was Simon and evidently the parent or the grandparent, now I’m not quite sure if it was the grandparent or the parent, changed it to Simmons.</span> <span id="s896">And she grew up in, I believe it was Denver.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Do you remember what part of Cincinnati they lived in?</span> <span id="s898">It was a nice part; it was suburban.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Was it a Jewish area, or no?</span> <span id="s900">Uh, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s901">And she married a man by the name of Sylvan (sp?)</span> <span id="s902">Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">And what did they do for a living?</span> <span id="s904">Uh, he had a business that manufactured ladies’ hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Did they live in a house?</span> <span id="s906">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Did you have your own room?</span> <span id="s908">No.</span> <span id="s909">I had to share the room with their nine- or ten-year-old daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">So they had how many children?</span> <span id="s911">One?</span> <span id="s912">They had one daughter.</span> <span id="s913">And she probably resented me bitterly, I don’t know, or else I don’t remember, but I could imagine that if a ten-year-old suddenly has to share her room with a seventeen-year-old whom she doesn’t know, she can’t have felt good about that!</span> <span id="s914">Who didn’t speak the language!</span></p> <p><span id="s915">So what did you do in the beginning?</span> <span id="s916">They enrolled me in some night classes and they showed me how I could get there with public transportation; I believe it wasn’t too far, it may have been the local high school and I was taking some English classes and some American history.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Were there a lot of people from Europe in those classes?</span> <span id="s918">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s919">They were small.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Now, we haven’t talked in a while so I forgot – at this time where were your sisters and your parents, where were they?</span> <span id="s921">My sister who came over with me, two years younger, she was placed with one of their friends’ families.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">So was she close by?</span> <span id="s923">That was Anne, right?</span> <span id="s924">She was not close by, but she was still going to high school with the two daughters from that household.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">I mean, was she in Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s926">Yes, she was with me – except not physically in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Did you talk to her a lot?</span> <span id="s928">I think we saw each other like weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">So who do you think was in a better situation, Anne or you?</span> <span id="s930">I suspect she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Why do you think so?</span> <span id="s932">Because she was able to finish high school and then she went on…she put herself through city college later when she got to New York.</span> <span id="s933">I never went back to get my high school equivalency test paper, which I regret to this day.</span> <span id="s934">Obviously, I learned English well enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">What was going on with Margot?</span> <span id="s936">(B response to last question:) Wouldn’t you say?</span> <span id="s937">Brad: Sure, Absolutely.</span> <span id="s938">Yes.</span> <span id="s939">B: My sister Margot was still at home with my parents.</span> <span id="s940">In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Oh ok so they didn’t come over at that point.</span> <span id="s942">B: No.</span> <span id="s943">They were very fortunate that they could get out in May of 1939.</span> <span id="s944">I think I had mentioned that to you; it may be in your materials.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">So were you, did you work in the beginning?</span> <span id="s946">Uh, yes.</span> <span id="s947">My…the man of the house, I mean, I called them by their first names – they said so – and he took me to his business and they gave me clerical work to do.</span> <span id="s948">So that I was occupied part of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">And did you meet any people your age?</span> <span id="s950">Did you make any friends at all?</span> <span id="s951">Not in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s952">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">So what was your impression of America in the beginning, in Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s954">Cincinnati is a good town!</span> <span id="s955">I mean, it’s a town that was built on, they say it’s built on like seven hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">So when you were there do you remember going to the synagogue or on any vacation?</span> <span id="s957">No, not really.</span> <span id="s958">I did go to the…they weren’t observant.</span> <span id="s959">I think I may have gone to synagogue a few times.</span> <span id="s960">They probably went on the high holidays, I suspect.</span> <span id="s961">I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">So how long were you there?</span> <span id="s963">From, I guess it was July or August ’38 until May ’39.</span> <span id="s964">And in that period I learned fluent English.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Really?</span> <span id="s966">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Now had your parents come over yet?</span> <span id="s968">With your sister, or?</span> <span id="s969">They were due in May.</span> <span id="s970">That’s why I came back to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">So, were you writing letters to them?</span> <span id="s972">Yes, but…and I was always waiting for mail from them, but there wasn’t much that they could say, you know.</span> <span id="s973">The mail coming out of Germany was censored by the Germans so it was very…not much information as to how things were going in Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s974">And mail was slow.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">So you came to New York because you knew that your parents were going to be there?</span> <span id="s976">My parents let us go because they were hoping to follow us, but they didn’t have the necessary papers yet.</span> <span id="s977">But they weren’t sure, you know.</span> <span id="s978">This was before war broke out between Germany and…I think they went into Poland first.</span> <span id="s979">And after that, things got very tough, but my parents came out before that, but in 1938 my father still thought maybe things would turn around and he could stay and we might come back; or else they would look to see if they could get out if it was possible.</span> <span id="s980">You know, you had to wait a long time to get a visa and you had to have an affidavit that you didn’t become a ward of the state, and my mother’s two younger brothers weren’t making a lot of money, but they were able to get the affidavits to the consulate in order for them to get out, but I think the only reason my parents and my younger sister were able to come out was because my mother’s younger sister had been married to an American Vice Consul who was stationed in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">So did you come to New York with sister?</span> <span id="s982">Yes with one of my sisters; with Anne.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">So how did you get to New York?</span> <span id="s984">On a Greyhound bus from Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Now when you went back to New York were your parents there yet, or?</span> <span id="s986">No they weren’t there yet, but they were…we knew that they were coming, we knew that they had gotten all the papers and that they had booked passage on, I don’t know which liner.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">So where did you stay in New York?</span> <span id="s988">My uncles rented a room for me, somewhere in Washington Heights where there were a lot of German immigrants who had come here who lived in Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Was Anne still in school?</span> <span id="s990">Yes, she came after the school year ended.</span> <span id="s991">And then my uncles rented an apartment for us and when my parents’ furniture – they were able to take out their furniture – when that arrived, we moved into that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Do you remember where that apartment was?</span> <span id="s993">It was on 144th street, or…it somewhere in the 140s.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Do you remember how big an apartment it was?</span> <span id="s995">It was like you know what they call them, the railroad flat kind of apartments, I think it had…about five rooms, I think.</span> <span id="s996">And a kitchen and one bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Do you remember how much rent they paid?</span> <span id="s998">No.</span> <span id="s999">Haven’t a clue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">What do you remember about your parents arriving?</span> <span id="s1001">It was exciting and it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1002">And I didn’t want to talk German to them because I said, “You have to learn English,” and they were upset, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">I was a teenager and there were the normal frictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">And how do you think your parents felt about arriving?</span> <span id="s1005">I think they were mostly relieved that they got out.</span> <span id="s1006">Particularly as war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Do you think they understood that they could have been killed if they stayed there?</span> <span id="s1008">Maybe not at that time but certainly…I think probably, yes.</span> <span id="s1009">When they, you know… I would assume so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">In the beginning, how did you parents learn to speak English?</span> <span id="s1011">Or did they?</span> <span id="s1012">They did!</span> <span id="s1013">My father didn’t learn very well, but he did ok.</span> <span id="s1014">My mother became quite fluent, she always had a heavy accent, but she became quite fluent.</span> <span id="s1015">My father was never that fluent, but he learned it.</span> <span id="s1016">He used to…what we always kidded him about was that he used the word – he mispronounced the word “miscellaneous” he always called it “miss-uh-neel-ee-us”.</span> <span id="s1017">It was a private joke sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">So do you think your father brought a lot of money with him or very little?</span> <span id="s1019">Very little!</span> <span id="s1020">He couldn’t take any money out, that was the problem.</span> <span id="s1021">You couldn’t take any jewelry out, you came with ten dollars, like.</span> <span id="s1022">You must have heard that from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">What did they do to make a living?</span> <span id="s1024">Were you working?</span> <span id="s1025">They were working with my uncles in that business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">What kind of business was it?</span> <span id="s1027">That was an import/export business.</span> <span id="s1028">Straw good and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">So what were they importing and exporting?</span> <span id="s1030">Some kind of straw, natural goods, straw goods.</span> <span id="s1031">I don’t really know exactly what they…I mean I probably used to know, but I don’t recall what they were…handbags that are made of straw and some other goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Do you have any idea how much money they were making?</span> <span id="s1033">It was always tight!</span> <span id="s1034">No I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">And what were you doing?</span> <span id="s1036">The people in Cincinnati had a connection with a millinery manufacturer in New York and they got me a job there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">How did you get to work?</span> <span id="s1038">On the subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Do you remember how much money you made?</span> <span id="s1040">I think the first year I was in New York I was probably making twelve or thirteen dollars a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Did you have a bank account?</span> <span id="s1042">I probably started what they called the…at that time they called them Christmas Clubs; you put in either a dollar a week or fifty cents a week or whatever you wanted to put in to accumulate a little money by the end of the year.</span> <span id="s1043">And I contributed to the household and I allowed myself about twenty-five cents a day.</span> <span id="s1044">The subway was a nickel, so you spent ten cents for transportation and ten cents for a Chock Full O’Nuts cream cheese sandwich and a drink – all for…you spend no more than between twenty-five and thirty-five cents – you wanted a doughnut, that was a nickel – you spent either between twenty-five and thirty-five cents for a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">So did you like Cincinnati better or New York?</span> <span id="s1046">Well I was happy to be back in New York.</span> <span id="s1047">Cincinnati, incidentally, is a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1048">Have you been there?</span> <span id="s1049">Brad: No.</span> <span id="s1050">B: The model for the – this is an aside – the model for the…Roebling who the built the Brooklyn bridge, built the model for the Brooklyn Bridge in Cincinnati going over the Ohio River – a lot of people don’t know that – and if I had found that out at that time I had forgotten it, but I found it out subsequently; it’s smaller, but it’s the same construction because it was different from any other bridges that had been built at that time, and he tried it out with a small model.</span> <span id="s1051">I got back to Cincinnati a number of years ago for some occasion, I got to see it and I said, “Oh that looks like the Brooklyn Bridge!”</span> <span id="s1052">and that’s how I found out how that happened; it’s a very interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">What exactly were you doing at work?</span> <span id="s1054">I was doing clerical work, listing orders and copying stuff.</span> <span id="s1055">It wasn’t exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Do you remember where the company was located or who the owner was?</span> <span id="s1057">The company was located on 39th street in the millinery district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Do you know what is what called or who the owners were?</span> <span id="s1059">At first I went with one company, and their name was Brandt, and then I went with a (buying) office from there to a different company and they were purchasing hats for different stores.</span> <span id="s1060">Then I got involved with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">How long did you stay in the millenary business?</span> <span id="s1062">Probably until I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Were you still staying at home?</span> <span id="s1064">Yes.</span> <span id="s1065">I couldn’t afford…gradually my salary increased, and I was doing nice work for this (buying) office; taking clients around to different companies, but I couldn’t afford a place for my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Did you have a refrigerator?</span> <span id="s1067">B: In New York?</span> <span id="s1068">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Even in the beginning?</span> <span id="s1070">I think so, but I wouldn’t swear to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">You didn’t have a car did you?</span> <span id="s1072">B: A car?</span> <span id="s1073">No!</span> <span id="s1074">Of course not.</span> <span id="s1075">We had then moved from the 140th up to…we were in the 140s a few years and then we moved to 179th street and Fort Washington Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Why did you move?</span> <span id="s1077">It was…the first apartment was a walk-up apartment and it was difficult for my parents.</span> <span id="s1078">My mother had some kind of a heart condition so…she lived to a ripe old age, 88, but we needed something that had an elevator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Now there were a lot of German immigrants in Washington Heights, so did you make friends or did you parents?</span> <span id="s1080">We had some relatives who were there too, so we got to meet with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Do you remember their name?</span> <span id="s1082">Yeah…Rosenthal and…somebody by the name of…I don’t wanna go into it.</span> <span id="s1083">Too complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">How did you meet your husband?</span> <span id="s1085">I met him through a temple in Forrest Hills, some of the people I met in the millenary business…some of the young women who were working in different offices and one of them was telling me that there is some social evening at one of the temples in Forrest Hills, if I wanna go she can arrange…I can go home with her that evening and stay over at her house and I was there a couple of times – not too often.</span> <span id="s1086">And on one day I met this nice man who took me to lunch a few days later and we started dating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Was he from Germany?</span> <span id="s1088">No.</span> <span id="s1089">He was living with his mother who was widowed in Fresh Meadows, but he had originally lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1090">He had was born in Hartford, CT.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">How much older was he?</span> <span id="s1092">B: Than I?</span> <span id="s1093">Eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">And what was his name?</span> <span id="s1095">Leon Kandell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">And what did Leon, what did he do for a living?</span> <span id="s1097">He was a salesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">What kind of things did he sell?</span> <span id="s1099">Corrugated paper goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Did he have a car?</span> <span id="s1101">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">How long did you know Leon before you got married?</span> <span id="s1103">Probably about eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Did Leon have brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s1105">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">What did his mother think of you?</span> <span id="s1107">You know, you are this refugee from Europe… *Bea laughs heartily* I think she had no objection to that, it was his sister-in-law who was bugged by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">And what do you think she didn’t like?</span> <span id="s1109">Don’t ask me, she was a very peculiar woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">What do you remember…when you would go out on dates, where would you go?</span> <span id="s1111">I don’t know!</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Well what do you remember about your wedding?</span> <span id="s1113">It was a small, small thing.</span> <span id="s1114">Immediate family, you know, and I wasn’t a white bride you know, money was tight!</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Where was the wedding?</span> <span id="s1116">It was in a residential hotel in New York in one of the, what do you call them, like…an apartment…it had a dining room that they rented out for occasions…it wasn’t really a hotel.</span> <span id="s1117">I think they called it that, but I just don’t remember the name of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">How did you get a wedding dress?</span> <span id="s1119">I just got an ordinary attractive pale, beige, short dress and I got a veil, a small hat through the millenary industry with the appropriate veil, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">So at your wedding was there dancing and music?</span> <span id="s1121">If there was it doesn’t really…I think you should leave that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">So did you go on a honey-moon?</span> <span id="s1123">Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">So where did you go?</span> <span id="s1125">We went to Bermuda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Did you go by boat?</span> <span id="s1127">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">So after you got a married, where were you living?</span> <span id="s1129">In Fresh Meadows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">And were you still working in the millinary?</span> <span id="s1131">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Did you have children soon, or?</span> <span id="s1133">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s1134">My daughter was born two years after we were married.</span> <span id="s1135">Brad: Mazel Tov!</span> <span id="s1136">B: Thank you!</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">So how many children do you have?</span> <span id="s1138">Two, I have two children; and my son was born two years later.</span> <span id="s1139">Brad: Mazel Tov!</span> <span id="s1140">*Bea chuckles happily* When did you stop working?</span> <span id="s1141">When we moved to Long Island, which was really right after, let’s see, it was…we bought the house the same year we were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Where was the house?</span> <span id="s1143">Where I am still living now!</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">47:23 – 47:35 * Tape goes silent *</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">…B:Rosalyn Heights, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">So when did you buy the house?</span> <span id="s1147">In 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">And how much did a house cost back then?</span> <span id="s1149">At that time, our house cost about…between twenty-two and twenty-three thousand dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Why did you decide to move to Roslyn?</span> <span id="s1151">Because we wanted to go to Long Island – my husband’s idea, you know.</span> <span id="s1152">A lot of places you couldn’t…as a Jewish couple you couldn’t buy a house in many places in Long Island.</span> <span id="s1153">I’m sure you’ve heard that story often, and we saw this ad in the Sunday Times…we had seem some realtors, but nothing was really right, and we had seen this ad in the Times where the man who was selling it – well the couple – was specifying in the ad how much cash down was required in order to assume a four percent GI mortgage.</span> <span id="s1154">Now you have to realize the mortgages when these houses first went up, they were four percent to GIs and they were considerably, I don’t know how much more for other people, but in order for us to buy…this was a resale in other words, this was not a new house.</span> <span id="s1155">The house was two years old when we bought it.</span> <span id="s1156">And in order to assume the mortgage at four percent rather than paying a higher mortgage, you had to be a GI and my husband was.</span> <span id="s1157">So we looked at it, and he had enough cash for the down payment that this guy wanted and so we bought the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">How many bedrooms is it?</span> <span id="s1159">It’s three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1160">I mean it was, even then advertised as three bedrooms it’s a (Levitt?)</span> <span id="s1161">house, are you familiar?</span> <span id="s1162">There was one room that they called either bedroom, or whatever you want to call it, it had one of those swinging bookcase walls so you could close it up or you could leave it open.</span> <span id="s1163">And we added two bedrooms in the back subsequently, you know, because children were really sharing one bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Now when you moved to Roslyn were there very many Jews there or not too many?</span> <span id="s1165">Yes.</span> <span id="s1166">It had become…the Rosalyn Country Club area which is where I live had become…suddenly when Jews came in the area a lot of people who were at the house when it was new of some plans were moving out and took their gains right away and today it’s not the same anymore, it has changed a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Do did your children go to Wheatley High School?</span> <span id="s1168">Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">So what kind of business did Leon end up doing?</span> <span id="s1170">He stayed with that.</span> <span id="s1171">He was with this firm a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">And what was the name of the company?</span> <span id="s1173">I don’t want you to put that in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">When your children were young, did you tell them what happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s1175">Sure.</span> <span id="s1176">Because my parents were still alive; their grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">And how old did your father live to be?</span> <span id="s1178">Almost 92.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Did they always stay in Washington Heights?</span> <span id="s1180">B: Wait a minute, was it 92?</span> <span id="s1181">...Let’s just say he lived to be in his early 90s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Did they always stay in Washington Heights?</span> <span id="s1183">Yes, they moved to an assisted living residence in later years called Isabella house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Now how did you feel after the war was over and you started to hear about what happened?</span> <span id="s1185">It was all a lot of turmoil, but you’re busy with a young family – though of course my kids were born right after the war.</span> <span id="s1186">I can’t put my feelings into this at this point.</span> <span id="s1187">Brad: No?</span> <span id="s1188">B: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">How did you parents react?</span> <span id="s1190">A lot of the people they knew weren’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s1191">B: That’s right!</span> <span id="s1192">And a lot of families weren’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s1193">When they do the memorial service on Yom Kippur afternoon I see everybody marching past me.</span> <span id="s1194">Something I still remember from when I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Now did you appreciate, after the war, how lucky you were?</span> <span id="s1196">Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Did the war change your belief in god?</span> <span id="s1198">*Bea laughs heartily* You don’t want to know my belief in god.</span> <span id="s1199">I believe in the tradition and that Judaism should survive, but don’t ask me whether I believe in god.</span> <span id="s1200">I can tell you a funny story, but you should probably leave it out.</span> <span id="s1201">Brad: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s1202">What’s the story?</span> <span id="s1203">B: When I was hospitalized a number of years ago Rabbi White came in to see me in the hospital and he, you know, it was a short visit it was very nice that they come to see you and then he said, “Can I make a Mi Sheberach for you?”</span> <span id="s1204">You know what that is?</span> <span id="s1205">Brad: Yeah B: Yeah, and I looked at him and the nurse was standing was standing at the foot of the bed, fixing something or whatever it was, I looked at him, shook my head toward him and then to her and I said, “Not now” and he just laughed.</span> <span id="s1206">He says, “You are my resident atheist.</span> <span id="s1207">You come to services and you do the right thing working on the social action committee…” and it was just very funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Now do you think that this is because of the war, or do you think you would have been like this anyway?</span> <span id="s1209">That’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s1210">I mean I didn’t come from a very observant household, but I mean your opinions change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Now had you ever seen a Black person before the war?</span> <span id="s1212">Likelihood is yes, maybe not in my hometown, but when I was in Munich…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1213">You better leave that out!</span> <span id="s1214">I might have seen somebody but… Now do you ever remember eating oranges or bananas before the war?</span> <span id="s1215">Very rarely.</span> <span id="s1216">Very, very rarely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Was that oranges or did you every have bananas, or?</span> <span id="s1218">I think it was oranges, more likely than bananas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Right, that sounds right.</span> <span id="s1220">Now, would you say that you were an angry person after the war?</span> <span id="s1221">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Were you angry at the Germans?</span> <span id="s1223">Well…I don’t know how to put that.</span> <span id="s1224">I mean I was, I think…just generally everybody was just very upset about the whole thing that happened; you were just glad it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">So would you say you have any injuries from the war?</span> <span id="s1226">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Do you think you have emotional injuries, or no?</span> <span id="s1228">No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">So why did you survive the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1230">Well, because my parents were wise enough to let us leave and that they followed after, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Right.</span> <span id="s1232">So you’ve gone back to Germany to where you grew up?</span> <span id="s1233">I’ve gone back to Germany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">When did you go back?</span> <span id="s1235">B: When?</span> <span id="s1236">I made a trip with my daughter in 1976 to a few places and we stopped there at my hometown once for a couple of hours and I went back the second time in, I think it was 2000, I have to look it up – I really couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">So did you go back to the house where you lived?</span> <span id="s1238">The house was no longer there.</span> <span id="s1239">The house wasn’t there on the first trip either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">*Taping Session Ends* So the last time we were talking it was when you took a trip to Germany?</span> <span id="s1241">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">So what do you remember about the trip?</span> <span id="s1243">Well, the first one was a trip that I took with my daughter and we only stopped in my hometown, that was in 1976, for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s1244">And the house had already been knocked down.</span> <span id="s1245">And I saw the school where I went to school and the main town and… Did you visit a cemetery, or?</span> <span id="s1246">We did visit a cemetery, but when…where some of the old family was buried, that was a little bit out of the town where the original Jewish community of the town I grew up in was formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Who maintains the cemetery?</span> <span id="s1248">Or is it maintained well, or?</span> <span id="s1249">It is maintained yes, or at that time.</span> <span id="s1250">In the 1970s it was maintained, and they also established…that hadn’t been established at that time yet, but it was established subsequently, a Jewish museum in an old church that wasn’t being used and they showed pictures of the old times, and I have a book on that, that was published later that’s called the Jewish Museum in Jebenhausen of Jewish Families from___(1:00:25)___ I don’t have the exact title.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Did you see anybody that remembered your family?</span> <span id="s1252">No.</span> <span id="s1253">We weren’t there long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Are there any Jews there anymore?</span> <span id="s1255">B: Now?</span> <span id="s1256">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">And what happened on your second trip?</span> <span id="s1258">On my second trip we were even less time in that town because I was with some other people, so you can’t even refer to that really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Did you ever visit a concentration camp or no?</span> <span id="s1260">Frankly, no.</span> <span id="s1261">I went to visit the…in Berlin there is, in one of the suburbs, there is a house called the Wannsee House where they formulated a lot of the, the Nazis formulated a lot of the atrocities, the rules…have you heard of this?</span> <span id="s1262">Brad: Yeah, that’s a famous place.</span> <span id="s1263">B: That, I saw.</span> <span id="s1264">Brad: Yeah, there was a Wannsee Conference.</span> <span id="s1265">B: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1266">And I had bought a book there, but I donated it to Temple Sinai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Now have most of your friends in America, have most of them been other Holocaust survivors, or no?</span> <span id="s1268">No, not really.</span> <span id="s1269">Just, whatever…family that moved down.</span> <span id="s1270">My other friends are American friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Do you think the Americans understand what people had to go through in Europe?</span> <span id="s1272">Do you think the American Jews understood or not really?</span> <span id="s1273">I think the ones of my generation or a little younger, they understood.</span> <span id="s1274">I don’t know about the young people.</span> <span id="s1275">I mean is it your cousin who put us together, or?</span> <span id="s1276">Brad: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1277">B: I mean she knows that Temple Sinai has done a lot and they teach the kids the courses in the religious school so I think they have to learn, you know from…hearing from people and reading and hopefully they understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">So have you ever been part of a survivors club or a group?</span> <span id="s1279">No, not really.</span> <span id="s1280">No.</span> <span id="s1281">I subsequently, here, met some people who came out of Vienna and had a real tough time…a friend’s husband who had crossed over the…walking over the Pyrenees on foot and you know…people who went to other countries before getting to the United States, I had heard from some of them, but I was never really friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1282">This woman who was from Vienna, we talked often and she’s had some bad experiences, but she’s been back several times since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">How many times have you been interviewed before?</span> <span id="s1284">I really haven’t.</span> <span id="s1285">Once by Temple Sinai.</span> <span id="s1286">My daughter made copies for the family I told you, now; do you ever have bad dreams at night from the war?</span> <span id="s1287">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Have you ever talked to students in a school about what happened to you?</span> <span id="s1289">Not really.</span> <span id="s1290">As a matter of fact I had an appointment to do it at Temple Sinai to the class once and then I wasn’t well and (Abby?)</span> <span id="s1291">last year asked me to do it sometime this coming March; I hope I’m up to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Do you need any psychological help (because?)</span> <span id="s1293">of the war?</span> <span id="s1294">I guess I could have used it!</span> <span id="s1295">*Laughs* Didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s1296">I think we could all use some psychological help from time to time.</span> <span id="s1297">I regret that I didn’t teach my children German when they were growing up, but my husband wasn’t speaking German – that shouldn’t have prevented me, but I could have taught them some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">How did you feel when you would see older people speaking German?</span> <span id="s1299">In the beginning it sort of bothered me because I felt that we should assimilate, I mean we should become Americans.</span> <span id="s1300">When I came here, I didn’t want to talk German to my family after I had learned English so well in six or eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Now have you read a lot of books on the Holocaust or seen movies?</span> <span id="s1302">Not particularly; I’ve seen the important movies, you know, Schindler’s List, you know what comes out that’s interesting I tried to see.</span> <span id="s1303">But the movie that I haven’t been able to get anybody else to find out about…I was hoping…something about…called Lost Letters, have you ever heard of it?</span> <span id="s1304">Brad: No.</span> <span id="s1305">B: And I…it was an art movie that was maybe ten or twelve ago and it dealt with buried treasure and letters in ___(1:06:58)___ somewhere and someone went back to try to find them, and it really haunted me, but I haven’t spoken to anybody who saw it and I don’t know if it’s around at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Do you find that the movies or the books that you’ve read that they seem pretty realistic; that that was how it was, or?</span> <span id="s1307">Well I wasn’t there at the worst time of it, you know.</span> <span id="s1308">So you can’t… How do you deal when you see Jewish people driving German cars?</span> <span id="s1309">I used to feel terrible about it, years back.</span> <span id="s1310">But after my parents got restitution from Germany, I changed my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">So if you went in the store and you saw something was made in Germany would you buy it?</span> <span id="s1312">B: When?</span> <span id="s1313">Now?</span> <span id="s1314">Brad: Yeah, now.</span> <span id="s1315">B: Now, yes.</span> <span id="s1316">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">In the sixties and seventies I wouldn’t have bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Now do you get money from Germany?</span> <span id="s1319">Do you get restitution?</span> <span id="s1320">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Why not?</span> <span id="s1322">I mean did you try or no?</span> <span id="s1323">Somebody in the family tried, we got very little…my parents got it until they died, but I subsequently did not get it – maybe if I had followed up I might have been able to do something about it, but unfortunately I have to muddle through the best I can without it.</span> <span id="s1324">*Chuckles* …I know that there are people, I mean children like…I’m a child of somebody who really lost his business.</span> <span id="s1325">I know that some people do get it and still get some, but I think at this point it’s no longer…personally, I think at this point it’s no longer necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Now, have you ever experienced anti-Semitism yourself in America?</span> <span id="s1327">B: In America?</span> <span id="s1328">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1329">I mean a lot of people in the forties, a lot of people said, “Oh these immigrants” and they didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s1330">Maybe it was just a feeling because of the jobs and so forth, but I don’t think personally I…didn’t have any problem with it – in my working life I didn’t have any problem with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Are there any things today that remind you of the war?</span> <span id="s1332">Like if you see a policeman or a siren or a train or…?</span> <span id="s1333">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">9/11?</span> <span id="s1335">Did 9/11 remind you of the war?</span> <span id="s1336">It’s a totally different thing.</span> <span id="s1337">Do you get people who, you know, if you ask them that question that they do feel that way?</span> <span id="s1338">Brad: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1339">B: Really?!</span> <span id="s1340">I’m surprised.</span> <span id="s1341">I mean… Brad: Yeah, I’ve interviewed people who when they go in the shower they think about…um, you know… B: Well if that’s what they think about now, then they really need psychological help.</span> <span id="s1342">Brad: You know, well no, there’s a lot of people who if they see a policeman it bothers them.</span> <span id="s1343">Or a siren sometimes it bothers them.</span> <span id="s1344">B: Well, maybe they lived…personally lived through more horrible experiences.</span> <span id="s1345">I can’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Do you have any issues with food?</span> <span id="s1347">Do you buy too much food?</span> <span id="s1348">Do you never throw away food?</span> <span id="s1349">I definitely have what we call a Depression Era Mentality.</span> <span id="s1350">*Laughs* I’m frugal, I try not to throw anything away - but if it needs to be thrown away, it needs to be thrown away!</span> <span id="s1351">*Laughs* Now, when your children were young were you overprotective of them?</span> <span id="s1352">Were you more worried about them than other parents, do you think?</span> <span id="s1353">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1354">Not growing…not with my children growing up in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">What kind of activities do you do?</span> <span id="s1356">Do you play cards?</span> <span id="s1357">Do you walk?</span> <span id="s1358">Do you go to Temple?</span> <span id="s1359">What do you do?</span> <span id="s1360">Well I play cards.</span> <span id="s1361">Right now I’m very limited with what I’m doing.</span> <span id="s1362">I swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">How far do you swim?</span> <span id="s1364">About a half hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Really?</span> <span id="s1366">That’s pretty good at your age.</span> <span id="s1367">B: I hope I am able to get back to it, that’s all I can say because right now I am just…I’m depressed and disgusted with myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Right…so what kind of cards do you play?</span> <span id="s1369">Bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Did you ever play cards for money, or no?</span> <span id="s1371">No.</span> <span id="s1372">I crochet – I used to knit, but now I crochet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">What kind of things do you make?</span> <span id="s1374">Afghans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Like a rug?</span> <span id="s1376">Like a lap robe, you know.</span> <span id="s1377">Temple Sinai has a social action committee and there are a few of us who make lap robes – some people make baby (work?)</span> <span id="s1378">that gets donated, you know lap robes get donated.</span> <span id="s1379">I am a little busy with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Now you have grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1381">Yes, I have two grandsons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">You don’t have any great-grandchildren do you?</span> <span id="s1383">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Now what are the names of your grandsons?</span> <span id="s1385">One’s name is Seth Weil, w-e-i-l, and Josh Weil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Bea, you did a very good job, it’s not easy to talk about this.</span> <span id="s1387">And the reason that you were talking about this, we are going to hope that people are going to listen to what you are saying, and we’re going to hope that the Holocaust, that it never happens again.</span> <span id="s1388">B: Well we do hope so, that’s no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">How old are you?</span> <span id="s1390">B: Now?</span> <span id="s1391">Brad: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1392">B: 92.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">So that’s a long time to wait to be interviewed, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1394">Yes!</span> <span id="s1395">*Laughs* But I never looked into it!</span> <span id="s1396">I mean I was interviewed once by Temple Sinai, but it wasn’t in as much depth and it was more, also, Temple related…how we joined Temple and so forth.</span> <span id="s1397">I have been a member for many years, but I never really felt deeply religious.</span> <span id="s1398">I am definitely not religious, I just believe in the traditions and in the fact that Judaism has to be carried on and survive, and as far as the bible itself is concerned *laughs* it doesn’t mean that much, you know?</span> <span id="s1399">I am sure that there are other people, I mean when you have gone through something like this, how can you believe in god, you know?</span> <span id="s1400">Brad: There are a lot of people that don’t believe in god after that – I have interviewed plenty.</span> <span id="s1401">B: Yeah!</span> <span id="s1402">So that’s exactly how I feel.</span> <span id="s1403">Maybe that’s why the rabbi calls me his resident atheist.</span> <span id="s1404">*Chuckles*</span></p></body></html>
