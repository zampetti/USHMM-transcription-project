need you to start off by telling me your name, place of birth, and date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name David Kochalski.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in a small town called , and I was born May 5, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well, we were very hard working, six children, father and mother and we had a small mill, flour, buckwheat.</span> <span id="s15">We were not prosperous but comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Did you go to a public school, a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I went to two schools.</span> <span id="s18">One was a public school in the morning.</span> <span id="s19">In the afternoon I went to a religious school until almost late at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: So your family was fairly religious?</span> <span id="s21">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And Judaism was important to you?</span> <span id="s23">A: Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Now, when you went to the public school you had a lot of friends who were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: No, the school itself, in this little city, was segregated between Catholics and Jews.</span> <span id="s26">Mind you, it was a small town, and I would say the majority of the people in that small town were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s27">Inside the town, somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us Jewish children and Catholic children.</span> <span id="s28">As you know, most of the people in Poland were Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you have friends who were Catholics?</span> <span id="s30">A: Yes, I used to have friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you feel any anti-semitism growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s33">I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either they were small little -- I would call it -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly got together, and there were incidents.</span> <span id="s34">Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were called in from the house, people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that we were really religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Were there any incidents with your brothers or sisters that you remember?</span> <span id="s36">A: No, other than we were a lovely family.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Were there a lot of cultural or social organizations, political organizations in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes there were Zionists in the city.</span> <span id="s39">There were Socialists, there were Communists, even though at that time Communists had to go underground, and religious institutions.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Were your parents active in the Zionist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What did you know about Hitler and the rise of Nazism before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster.</span> <span id="s44">My father used to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s45">However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things.</span> <span id="s46">They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s47">In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from Germany, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing.</span> <span id="s48">They really went from city to city amongst Jews.</span> <span id="s49">There were so many of them that people had to help.</span> <span id="s50">So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: They told stories of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Definitely, yes.</span> <span id="s53">In a public school, since it was more or less a Jewish school, in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it?</span> <span id="s54">He was not Polish, the guy who was running the school, he was not Jewish, he was Polish.</span> <span id="s55">In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the city very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in Germany might come to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun Poland.</span> <span id="s58">It was known between people that he's not going to stop at that time in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s59">He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted.</span> <span id="s60">So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later.</span> <span id="s61">A few days before the war they already had black outs in Poland, because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement.</span> <span id="s62">It was about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war.</span> <span id="s63">We did not know the particulars of what they signed.</span> <span id="s64">The Germans, the USSR, we anticipated there would be a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Was there anything that the community did in preparation for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s67">The Jewish people naturally were very anxious.</span> <span id="s68">They already knew what happened to the people.</span> <span id="s69">They were thrown out.</span> <span id="s70">They already heard of the burnings of the synagogues and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in.</span> <span id="s71">It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that Germany was going to be defeated.</span> <span id="s72">We were aware and the preparation was made in a way.</span> <span id="s73">People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come.</span> <span id="s74">They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign.</span> <span id="s75">They occupied Poland or part of Poland and it was benign.</span> <span id="s76">In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews.</span> <span id="s77">On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that town.</span> <span id="s78">They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German.</span> <span id="s79">So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over.</span> <span id="s80">Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not going to be that bad.</span> <span id="s81">They did not expect anything very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking?</span> <span id="s83">Were they eager for Germany to come in?</span> <span id="s84">Were they prepared to fight them?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations.</span> <span id="s86">The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in concentration camps and so on.</span> <span id="s87">That they are really against Jews, the Germans.</span> <span id="s88">So, naturally at that point they were united.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Do you remember the day that was occupied by Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: What I remember is one morning, I think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all of a sudden, a great bang in that little town.</span> <span id="s91">A bomb was thrown.</span> <span id="s92">We did not know it was a bomb.</span> <span id="s93">We all ran out and we saw planes going over.</span> <span id="s94">There was near the town, not far from the town were German garrison (ph).</span> <span id="s95">They tried to bomb the garrison but they missed.</span> <span id="s96">They bombed the city.</span> <span id="s97">At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they announced already that the war had begun.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: They tried to bomb a German garrison?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, it was a Polish Army garrison, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but they probably missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Do you remember what was going on at this point?</span> <span id="s101">You went outside, you realized there had been a bomb.</span> <span id="s102">What did you see?</span> <span id="s103">What were people doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Panic, immediately.</span> <span id="s105">There was great panic in town.</span> <span id="s106">People did not know what to do, to stay in that little town or escape to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s107">My parents they went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s108">All the six children and my mother.</span> <span id="s109">My father was in the militia.</span> <span id="s110">He was a young man.</span> <span id="s111">They took him in the militia to watch black outs.</span> <span id="s112">Once the German planes came they either threw out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes.</span> <span id="s113">His aim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who came in there to bomb some bridges.</span> <span id="s114">So my father was there, and my mother was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s115">Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going to happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little city.</span> <span id="s116">Warsaw at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: So, what happened after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I went back with that little city.</span> <span id="s119">My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in the Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there and watched after the mill, which we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: It was still going?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">I stayed there.</span> <span id="s123">All of sudden we heard that Warsaw was surrounded, and here my mother and father were very anxious because five children were there.</span> <span id="s124">We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there were more than a million people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s125">My father and mother decided that I should go back to Warsaw to help the children.</span> <span id="s126">So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it was very tough, tough for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You were talking about you were going to take some food?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard about.</span> <span id="s129">And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in Warsaw in a small room.</span> <span id="s130">So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it even though Warsaw was surrounded.</span> <span id="s131">It was very heavy what they put on, and I remember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never see him again.</span> <span id="s132">But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind of looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there were horses and people on the street massacred, killed on the way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s133">In other words, out of town the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it.</span> <span id="s134">Many people would walk through the streets going to Warsaw you would see carnage.</span> <span id="s135">So, my mother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my father clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked.</span> <span id="s136">I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: How do you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well, I came back from Warsaw, that same day Warsaw capitulated.</span> <span id="s139">I want to tell you first.</span> <span id="s140">I made it into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s141">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s142">It was very hard, but when I came Warsaw was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting to collect the dead.</span> <span id="s143">The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s144">They were surrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance.</span> <span id="s145">However, there was a time when they got the Red Cross or whatever, they arranged a one hour to get the dead out of the way.</span> <span id="s146">Germans and Polish.</span> <span id="s147">At that time, kids like us could go through.</span> <span id="s148">I made it and somehow when I came to a certain bridge, since they bombarded the bridge with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there.</span> <span id="s149">The flour, we got out of it, but we had other food.</span> <span id="s150">The flour went on the floor and I made it and I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation.</span> <span id="s151">Artillery, there were people killed, burned, fire was all over.</span> <span id="s152">However, the Poles at that time they put up a tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I think I remember I was 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: How far was the distance between your town and Warsaw?</span> <span id="s156">A: Not far.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Did you walk or on a train?</span> <span id="s158">A: Only walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How long would it normally take to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It didn't take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great.</span> <span id="s161">The artillery we had to go at midnight.</span> <span id="s162">Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until I made it in.</span> <span id="s163">It was like an inferno.</span> <span id="s164">Warsaw was an inferno.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Weren't you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: What do you think?</span> <span id="s167">I certainly was frightened.</span> <span id="s168">Q: You were a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the street whether the building would collapse.</span> <span id="s170">And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after delivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig ditches in case the Germans advance.</span> <span id="s171">They called anybody who could do something.</span> <span id="s172">I was frightened, that's the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: When you were carrying all these goods to Warsaw, at this time you were asked to help dig ditches?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I helped do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: The Polish people, the Polish Army dig the ditches?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: The Army in Warsaw was preparing ditches against tanks, in case they advanced so any able bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the street, they made him come and do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Were you traveling alone or with people?</span> <span id="s178">A: A party of one.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Tell me a little bit of what happened next, you made it to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no water.</span> <span id="s181">We were hiding in basements.</span> <span id="s182">It was really mayhem.</span> <span id="s183">People would stand in line for bread, and artillery would just mow them down and kill them.</span> <span id="s184">It was an inferno, fires all over.</span> <span id="s185">The funny thing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was, whoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the underground and have the services.</span> <span id="s186">Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the artillery.</span> <span id="s187">Not just artillery, but planes, where they would just circle the city and fire whoever they saw or just at random at any building.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you attend any of these services?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s190">No, I was impatient.</span> <span id="s191">I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I had other problems.</span> <span id="s192">We had no water and there was a river and we were all running for water, to drink water.</span> <span id="s193">That's a very terrible deal when you have no water, and it was also very dangerous because there were not the Germans.</span> <span id="s194">At that time they were shooting the people who came for water.</span> <span id="s195">So, some of them never came back.</span> <span id="s196">I was very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did you see the shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Well, certainly.</span> <span id="s199">It wasn't shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">I either get trapped or I ran away.</span> <span id="s201">If I get trapped, then I wait there.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What else can you describe about conditions at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Jewish people were very scared at that time.</span> <span id="s204">I think, or I heard that most of the bombardment at that time was directed to the Jewish quarter, most of the bombardment and I guess Jews were very much congregated in one area and the Germans were aware -- in fact they were aware of everything, but this in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Were you hiding in this Jewish area?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Yes, I was hiding in the Jewish area wherever I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Do you have any remembrance of any Polish catholic people you knew at this time.</span> <span id="s208">Did your relationship with them change or did you separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the river if they get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference whether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic.</span> <span id="s210">At that point we were all Poles against the Germans.</span> <span id="s211">I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans because they knew that they anticipated bad days.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: How did that relationship start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: At the time of bombardment, I think there was no animosity against each other because there was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of.</span> <span id="s214">There was no real animosity.</span> <span id="s215">People would stand in line for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics, Jews or anybody else.</span> <span id="s216">Each one was miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Didn't that relationship, though, change?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Not really, only after the war.</span> <span id="s219">It always changed later on.</span> <span id="s220">Q: That is not something you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: I did not experience anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: I guess before we continue, when did you get any information about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s224">As soon as the armistice was declared, the same day I picked up -- the rest of the children were still in Warsaw -- I picked up and got through the line, because even though there was an armistice, you didn't cross the line, the Germans.</span> <span id="s225">However, children they let through, and we went through, and we went up a few kilometers and all of sudden I found out what really happened.</span> <span id="s226">I went with another friend.</span> <span id="s227">He was not Jewish, he was Catholic.</span> <span id="s228">We went back to the city and there was a German sentry and he called over because I did not know that they had at that time a curfew in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s229">So, the German soldier just grabbed me and slashed his throat.</span> <span id="s230">So, I understood right now that I have a lot of worries watching myself.</span> <span id="s231">In the morning I walked.</span> <span id="s232">I couldn't go at night, in the evening.</span> <span id="s233">It took me another day to get through to see if I can meet my parents.</span> <span id="s234">In the front of the city I had an uncle.</span> <span id="s235">He had a little restaurant.</span> <span id="s236">I walked into this restaurant, nobody there.</span> <span id="s237">I got into that little city and all of a sudden I see people that don't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s238">Everytime I ask someone you know where are my parents, they took off.</span> <span id="s239">That kind of feeling, maybe they escaped.</span> <span id="s240">So, I went into that little mill and people were robbing and I was just sitting until a man came over, a huge man, and he said "These people are robbing this kid.</span> <span id="s241">He's just an orphan."</span> <span id="s242">I didn't understand him.</span> <span id="s243">Then my uncle came in and he says to me "Don't you know about ," that's the time I got immediately, and I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s244">I asked him where is it that they -- they are digging.</span> <span id="s245">I ran over and there was -- they were trying to dig for the people.</span> <span id="s246">They were just not my parents, there were bombs and maybe thirty people, twenty-five people in my uncle's restaurant's basement that were all killed.</span> <span id="s247">They were all decimated.</span> <span id="s248">I took out and I recognized the skull and half of my father's clothes, a little bit of my mother.</span> <span id="s249">I got very sick, and I walked out, then I knew for sure that I didn't have any parents anymore.</span> <span id="s250">I got sick and dizzy and they took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s251">Then, of course, they were buried in a certain place.</span> <span id="s252">A few days later they took the remains of all the people and I came there and I made a mark so I can find it and well it comes later when I go fifty years later.</span> <span id="s253">That's how I met my parents again.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: How long after the war began in Poland was this armistice when you went back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: The armistice from the beginning it was about 30 days, the whole war, and mind you, from what I found out there were killed about 36 hours before the armistice they were bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: (Can't hear the tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes, uncle, aunt, and other family, cousins.</span> <span id="s258">Q: (Can't hear the tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Not all, but most.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: What did you do after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well, I was there, no communication with the children.</span> <span id="s262">They came about a week later and of course, we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s263">We were orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: I just want to ask you one questions.</span> <span id="s265">In terms of the ages of your brothers and sisters, were you little, were you young?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I happened to be the third.</span> <span id="s267">We were six.</span> <span id="s268">I was the third.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So, you were there and you didn't know what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: We didn't know what to do, and we were very depressed.</span> <span id="s271">Somehow, we found also our apartment was bombed.</span> <span id="s272">We had to go in a little room.</span> <span id="s273">My sister had nothing to survive on -- my sister tried to make some food for people.</span> <span id="s274">Sometimes German soldiers used to come by and she would make some food for them in order to earn something.</span> <span id="s275">We stayed there, what I remember is all of a sudden my sister disappeared, and we were left.</span> <span id="s276">I did not know why, and I was very mad at her.</span> <span id="s277">But later I found out that the German soldiers tried to attack her.</span> <span id="s278">She was then, I think she was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s279">She was six years older than me, so she just took off one day, and run abroad to Russia.</span> <span id="s280">See, the Russians took half of Poland, and the Germans took the other one.</span> <span id="s281">This was the real pact, the map which separated Poland.</span> <span id="s282">So, my sister took off, somehow at that time it was chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Anybody who could run across even though -- it wasn't easy, but she made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: The German soldiers tried to rape her?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: They tried, yes, but she was ashamed to tell us, and she escaped, and she left us five in that city.</span> <span id="s286">She was the cook.</span> <span id="s287">Again, we were out of business I think about two months.</span> <span id="s288">We had to get out of there, out of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: I know this is a difficult question but did you find out later whether the Germans were able to rape her?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s291">Maybe she was just afraid, I don't know.</span> <span id="s292">I asked her and she would never tell me, because she lives in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s293">I keep on asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: So, you decided to get out of the city.</span> <span id="s295">Did you know people there?</span> <span id="s296">Were you neighbors still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: In which city?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: The little city?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: The people were still there, all of them, except those who were hurt by the bombs or those who escaped to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s300">There were more or less -- it was right after the war and they did not suffer too much.</span> <span id="s301">We suffered because we were orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Nobody tried to take care of you?</span> <span id="s303">A: It was just everyone for himself.</span> <span id="s304">Q: So what did you all do?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: We got together the first night, my brothers and sisters, went back to Warsaw, and me and my little brother were left behind we could sell anything we had, and then we went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s306">We all went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s307">And of course, there was no place to be.</span> <span id="s308">It was already around December.</span> <span id="s309">Somehow my older brother, who was a university student got together with this professor to place us in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s310">He couldn't take care of us either.</span> <span id="s311">He was about 19 years old.</span> <span id="s312">So, he took us over.</span> <span id="s313">He had another one by the name of Adolf Therman who was the head of the Health and Children.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: But this is the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s316">I knew him by the name of Adolf, because eventually I worked with him in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s317">They took us over across to place, at that time, and they separated my two little sisters.</span> <span id="s318">Also, at the place there was a place for girls and me and my younger brother over there.</span> <span id="s319">My older brother suffered probably , and I don't remember how he was existing, but later on I think he had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So, you went to the orphanage you think about December of '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: It was close to January already.</span> <span id="s322">I'm sorry the exact dates I just don't know.</span> <span id="s323">I could know if I could concentrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: What was the orphanage like?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: It was a big building, many children over there.</span> <span id="s326">It was an organized like a government inside the orphanage.</span> <span id="s327">Each one had his own supposed to do certain things.</span> <span id="s328">They had a court, they had people older people who took care of the youngsters to see that they washed, they cleaned.</span> <span id="s329">There were people who had to make up the beds.</span> <span id="s330">It was just like an internal -- they had a court, if someone deviated from certain things, he was punished.</span> <span id="s331">The doctor was just going around.</span> <span id="s332">He knew that you're going to do it right.</span> <span id="s333">However, I personally was a rebel in this, because most of the kids were just orphans since they were children.</span> <span id="s334">They knew their ways.</span> <span id="s335">I was very bitter.</span> <span id="s336">I was bitter that all of sudden my father used to care about orphans, and all of a sudden I'm an orphan.</span> <span id="s337">So, I did not go according to regulations.</span> <span id="s338">I used to run away to my brother's all the time, and I did not -- I would say I was not a good boy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Did they assign you certain jobs or duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: We used to get jobs, you know, cleaning dishes.</span> <span id="s341">Cleaning .</span> <span id="s342">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s343">I don't recall, but I tried to get away from it because I was not used to the kids and them with the routines.</span> <span id="s344">To me it wasn't routine.</span> <span id="s345">It was like punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Now, did you get punished by the court?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I was not punished, in fact they made me part of the court, because I was an older boy.</span> <span id="s348">Somehow, the regimentation down there, I wasn't too respected because I was fresh one, you know.</span> <span id="s349">But they tried to give me some responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: How many people were in the court?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I really can't recall, but I would say it was over a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Do you remember liking any of the staff or any relationships with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Oh yes, with the older ones.</span> <span id="s354">We had beds of 30 to 40 in a room, and we had to have friends at night.</span> <span id="s355">We tried to get into mischief.</span> <span id="s356">I know now, kids are mischievous.</span> <span id="s357">On the signal to go to sleep, we pretended we were going to sleep, but we used to talk a lot.</span> <span id="s358">I had friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: What did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, let me tell you, mostly child talk, because these children down there, they were raised differently.</span> <span id="s361">I was born, I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit, but they spoke Polish only.</span> <span id="s362">Their vision of life was different because he taught them he really taught them discipline.</span> <span id="s363">They were schooled and schooled in certain areas, they were way ahead of me.</span> <span id="s364">A few friends I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Were you going to school at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well, from what I know now, officially we're not supposed to have schooling.</span> <span id="s367">There was no schooling any more, no school outside, but inside there were certain people who worked there for years and they were teachers and they gave us lesson.</span> <span id="s368">I wouldn't say that I attended them, but I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: What do you remember about the orphanage that you appreciated?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: First of all the food.</span> <span id="s371">I appreciated the food because three times a day we were eating.</span> <span id="s372">It was just the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s373">America was not at war then and they used to ship from Switzerland or from other areas, they used to ship food, so there was no scarcity of food, but I appreciated that because between the time I got into the orphanage and I lived in a room somewhere with my brothers and sisters, we had no food.</span> <span id="s374">That's what I appreciated.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Any other good memories about the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, I had very good memories, very good memories, but I was bitter because I couldn't-- I think I was bitter because I couldn't imagine that I'll ever be an orphan at one time.</span> <span id="s377">I used to know orphans, you know either the father died, or the mother died and they put them in, but all of a sudden I had both gone, and what hurts me more is that I had a couple of sisters there.</span> <span id="s378">I don't think the very young even knew that she didn't have.</span> <span id="s379">There was a little girl, she must be four years old.</span> <span id="s380">She was taken in, but she was asking a little bit about her parents.</span> <span id="s381">That hurts me, but otherwise I think I was stronger at time.</span> <span id="s382">I took it the way it was, because I was very happy they took me into that orphanage.</span> <span id="s383">I already seen young kids going around and asking for bread, but whether I was happy or unhappy, I don't know, but I appreciated being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Did you spend time with your sisters and brother in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I used to see him not very often because all of a sudden, my older sister was very knowledgeable -- my younger sister.</span> <span id="s386">But the rest of them, they were very young, they got involved in playing, involved in the procedure of the place.</span> <span id="s387">They had little girlfriends.</span> <span id="s388">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So anything else you can remember about the original orphanage, the way it was run, the teachers, the cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I already told you it was run like a government.</span> <span id="s391">This guy, I didn't see him very often I want you to know, but whenever I seen him, he was very lenient man.</span> <span id="s392">He if a kid was sick he would go by and pat him.</span> <span id="s393">He was very good, because I remember he even used to take out the excrement in the morning.</span> <span id="s394">He got up very early.</span> <span id="s395">I don't remember him very well because I was a stranger down there.</span> <span id="s396">He figured that probably that I am not his in Polish they call it .</span> <span id="s397">He did not raise me, you understand?</span> <span id="s398">He more or less, he liked more the kids which he raised.</span> <span id="s399">Don't forget that he was the kind of a man he read a lot of books which as I a child I was reading.</span> <span id="s400">Only of us children, all kinds of mysteries about how children behave and and we used to have theaters there too.</span> <span id="s401">We used to have what do you call , all kind of marionettes.</span> <span id="s402">In the beginning of the war you could do almost a lot of things, but the Germans were not organized yet.</span> <span id="s403">They couldn't cope with a half a million Jews, and the Jews were not, at that time, segregated.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Any other memories of ?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Other than seeing them go out, we were waiting for him a lot of times.</span> <span id="s407">He was busy almost every day, going out and arranging for help.</span> <span id="s408">This orphanage was very organized.</span> <span id="s409">It was, I think at that time, it was even run by the Polish, by the city, but there were many, many orphanages at that time in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s410">I am going to run away from myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">That's how we organized later when I had to leave.</span> <span id="s412">I haven't got too many memories of that man because I was there only a short time.</span> <span id="s413">He would go around and check, ask if we had enough to eat maybe comfort me once in a while, say everything will work out, and the staff was very nice.</span> <span id="s414">The staff there understood that I was just a freshly baked orphan, so they were nice to me.</span> <span id="s415">They knew also that I had a brother, a little brother, my two sisters and so that's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Do you remember any of the in particular, Stephan?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Stephan, yes I saw her once in a while.</span> <span id="s418">An elderly lady who was very nice.</span> <span id="s419">That's all I know, and I used to ask her how my little sisters are.</span> <span id="s420">She said don't worry about them.</span> <span id="s421">They are fine.</span> <span id="s422">I used to come in and she's show me the little children were dancing.</span> <span id="s423">I think my little one forgot all about my parents.</span> <span id="s424">She was involved in the life.</span> <span id="s425">The older one --.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: How long were you in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: The best that I can recall I would say almost two months.</span> <span id="s428">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Then he organized, we must have organized it before, there was a place somewhere in Warsaw, in the Jewish district and they called that -- they took all the older boys down there all the freshly orphans which they took in, boys only, and they organized what they called a House of Boys, under their supervision, but they had a different administrator.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">That administrator was a professor, a Jewish professor.</span> <span id="s431">So, they took us, this guy would and other guys who were approximately over 11 years old, and they organized a new home.</span> <span id="s432">This home was, again, they tried to get us to gover -- which you'll see in this little book and it was very nice, I want you to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What was the name of the Professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: From what I remember, I did not remember, but my friend told me it was</span></p> <p><span id="s435">.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How many boys were at this House of Boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Eventually they took a lot of boys off the street, too, and I would think I would say between 70, around there, 80.</span> <span id="s438">My little brother could have stayed with him, but he didn't want to stay.</span> <span id="s439">He wanted to go with me.</span> <span id="s440">We were both there</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: What was different from this orphanage from the other orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: It was completely different.</span> <span id="s443">The task of this place was we should be more or less responsible even economically for everything.</span> <span id="s444">They used to send children like to barbers where they cleaned up.</span> <span id="s445">They used to send people to shoemakers they should help.</span> <span id="s446">They used to send people out, the little older boys, because they were up to 15, 16, some of them even had a little children.</span> <span id="s447">Normally in Europe, if a kid finished school, he became an apprentice somewhere.</span> <span id="s448">So, people used to make money, kids used to make money and they would take the money and buy food.</span> <span id="s449">In other words, you almost had to be self sufficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I did all kinds of jobs.</span> <span id="s452">My first job was I worked with very responsible people who were directing the food distribution for all orphanages in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Were these Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Jewish people, only in the Jewish district.</span> <span id="s455">I can't tell you when it happened, but I can tell you what happened, because we at that point, a Ghetto, I mean were all together.</span> <span id="s456">Jews were separated, not completely yet, but they were separated.</span> <span id="s457">And we used to go out to all kinds of work.</span> <span id="s458">I worked with this -- he liked me this guy, and he directed the food distribution.</span> <span id="s459">He directed the people, had to hide whatever they had, the Germans would confiscate everything for free.</span> <span id="s460">So, they used to hide things in the cellars, wherever they could and then bring it up, because the American was already working there for orphanages, and I was there working.</span> <span id="s461">They used to bring all their wares, their samples and they would distribute all the samples.</span> <span id="s462">They didn't give them any money, but they gave them certain numbers in Switzerland that later on they'll be able to collect.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Now, I know they never collected.</span> <span id="s464">But my job was .</span> <span id="s465">We used to - - we didn't have any horses or anything, we used to have a little buggy, long buggy, one on the side and I on other side and we would pull from place to place and distribute food.</span> <span id="s466">This I got so many bread.</span> <span id="s467">That was my first job.</span> <span id="s468">It lasted something like three months.</span> <span id="s469">Then I had other jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Do you want to tell me about your other jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: You keep asking me because the last job was the job where I could not come back to the orphanage anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So, let's talk more about the orphanage.</span> <span id="s473">So, you remember, this orphanage were you accepted a little more or were you still --?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: It was more responsible.</span> <span id="s475">We were older kids.</span> <span id="s476">We were reading newspapers.</span> <span id="s477">And I want you to know, it went like a university.</span> <span id="s478">In this orphanage you had the biggest I would say doctors, the Germans as a rule tried to kill whether they were Poles or Jews all the intelligent, all the professors, doctors and colleges, all of them, so at this orphanage we had even though we knew who they were, but we had the very educated, most educated of Warsaw and surrounding.</span> <span id="s479">They were professors, they were the chief rabbis of a city called .</span> <span id="s480">They were they liked me, one guy wanted the best chore.</span> <span id="s481">There were other professors who were hiding there.</span> <span id="s482">They were cleaning, they were cooking in order not to be discovered by these Germans.</span> <span id="s483">And since they worked in orphanages, I don't think the Germans checked too well.</span> <span id="s484">There were a few times they took out some.</span> <span id="s485">So, at night we were not allowed to go to school -- when night came after supper, what I know now how education goes, we had a terrific lectures on everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">In other words, it was something like a university.</span> <span id="s487">All the boys would sit down and they would give us lectures in history, Jewish history and then they would always give us geography and any other arithmetic every other night another professor would start teaching us.</span> <span id="s488">Then the rabbi would teach us Judaism.</span> <span id="s489">It was like a university.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: You appreciated this?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s492">I wouldn't miss those things.</span> <span id="s493">I couldn't understand you know, I used to go to public school and I didn't finish, so I couldn't understand how nicely the interpreter was.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Do you remember what street this orphanages was on?</span> <span id="s495">A: Yes it was on Gesha 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Do you remember any particular professors who were here that you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Those who were officially -- there was like people who worked there and they were also very educated people because they tried to -- you had to a lot of influence to get off the street of Warsaw and work in orphanages.</span> <span id="s498">But at that same time they had to have a certain amount of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: I was just asking for the record were there any younger leaders or professors there that you can remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I really cannot recall names, but I know some of them didn't even give their real names because they were hiding.</span> <span id="s501">They didn't want to be killed by the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: In the orphanages, either of them, did you observe the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Why certainly, definitely.</span> <span id="s504">We were all Jewish kids and there was a chief rabbi down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Friday evening there were special ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: It was special.</span> <span id="s507">We maybe had a little more bread and we were singing the songs.</span> <span id="s508">Q: You rested on Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Not all of us.</span> <span id="s510">Those who had to work, and even some of them worked with the Germans outside the area and they had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What was involved with in this orphanage.</span> <span id="s512">Did he come by?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: He supervised and he came by I would say very often.</span> <span id="s514">He would stop by and check with the and he would recognize us.</span> <span id="s515">He would check to see with they guys who were running it.</span> <span id="s516">He felt that this was his responsibility, because a lot of them other than me they were also his kids who were brought up by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How long did you stay at the House for Boys?</span> <span id="s518">A: I would say about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Your brother also?</span> <span id="s520">A: My little brother, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you make good friends in this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s523">In fact, they used to bring new ones from the area, very nice educated kids, those who were qualified they brought into work.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Was there an effort, now that the war was on and everybody's motives were changed so much, that they let in a lot more people who's orphanages --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: I don't know anything about before the war, but I'll tell you they did not they couldn't get into our place because the rooms, the area was very small and we had 30 40 people in a room.</span> <span id="s526">I don't think they could absorb more but they did not have a place for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did you notice maybe that wanted to protect everyone who needed protection at the time so he opened more places?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I have heard at that time that he was very influential even with the city who was catholic, but they respected him and I think he did open a few more somewhere.</span> <span id="s529">If he didn't open officially, he took them off the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: I've heard some crazy stories about , he's a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, I would compare him to a hippie, I want you to know.</span> <span id="s532">He never dressed, you know, and he wasn't really sophisticated.</span> <span id="s533">He was just like a hippie.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: He seemed to be able to help people, get money and really accomplished something incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: What they tried to do in this orphanage, they tried to make human beings out of us under the worst circumstances because inside we were like an island.</span> <span id="s536">Outside it was hell, a real hell.</span> <span id="s537">People were dying of starvation and even in the beginning they were dying of starvation, people some of their parents left for Russia, left the wife with the children.</span> <span id="s538">It was very bad outside.</span> <span id="s539">Here you tried to organize it in such a way that everyone either worked or if you couldn't find work give him a trade inside.</span> <span id="s540">Little kids became shoe makers, cabinet makers.</span> <span id="s541">They brought up old tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: You said that you had other jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yes, and this was my downfall.</span> <span id="s544">I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what happened is I wasn't strong enough to pull the buggy so they sent me they had other jobs, to send me to people in factories where they were making clothes.</span> <span id="s545">But my last job, that was my downfall.</span> <span id="s546">That was my downfall.</span> <span id="s547">They sent me to a factory outside the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s548">I had to go at 5:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s549">You had to go with the German sentries.</span> <span id="s550">If they wanted to warm themselves up, they would chase me around just for exercise.</span> <span id="s551">They would chase me around and around and made me run.</span> <span id="s552">It was bad.</span> <span id="s553">So, I went through it was a problem in Ghetto a big foundry, a big factory run by Germans and some Jews who before the war were foremen.</span> <span id="s554">I used to get up in the morning hoping that I would get to eat something.</span> <span id="s555">But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid.</span> <span id="s556">I had to pick up 30 or 40 pounds of burned up steel and throw them into the fire walking on the .</span> <span id="s557">I was very week.</span> <span id="s558">I couldn't do the job.</span> <span id="s559">I was always thinking to escape.</span> <span id="s560">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s561">So eventually some Polish people who worked with me, they give me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s562">I was still hungry.</span> <span id="s563">The orphanage -- the people were still sleeping while I was going to work.</span> <span id="s564">I wasn't the only one, in other places they woke up early.</span> <span id="s565">So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I was very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible.</span> <span id="s566">I had to walk up with a load of 40 or 50 pounds.</span> <span id="s567">Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have food and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves.</span> <span id="s568">They were working people, hard working people, and I explained I came from the orphanage because I had to keep up with them and I couldn't keep up.</span> <span id="s569">I think I was about 14 years old, and I wasn't too strong either.</span> <span id="s570">So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little bit, but I was still hungry.</span> <span id="s571">What my downfall is, it started with a dog.</span> <span id="s572">These people who ran the place they had their own big house next to it.</span> <span id="s573">They were German soldiers and German civilians because most of this was going for the armaments.</span> <span id="s574">They were making presses there and everything.</span> <span id="s575">Somehow they were always happened, but I noticed that the dog gets a lot of food after lunch.</span> <span id="s576">The dog got a lot of food but I couldn't reach it.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Everytime I went by I wanted to grab something.</span> <span id="s578">Finally I got acquainted over a week or two he would finish eating I would grab some.</span> <span id="s579">He was happy, and it was good stuff for the dog.</span> <span id="s580">I ate it and I felt good.</span> <span id="s581">So one day, I could always get after he was finished.</span> <span id="s582">If not, he would growl.</span> <span id="s583">That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was Jewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me.</span> <span id="s584">You go taking away the food of the dog.</span> <span id="s585">Don't you get enough food.</span> <span id="s586">I was working there for two weeks, I had no food.</span> <span id="s587">Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he shamed me in front of them.</span> <span id="s588">Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way, but , he had engineering place, all kinds of instruments and a Polish engineer was there and he started hitting me again.</span> <span id="s589">Aren't you ashamed he said.</span> <span id="s590">You're a Jewish boy, to do those things.</span> <span id="s591">When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured that's the end of me.</span> <span id="s592">I grabbed a inch by inch a steel ruler and I grabbed it instantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him.</span> <span id="s593">I escaped.</span> <span id="s594">I could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow, but I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the Ghetto, and I was afraid to go back in.</span> <span id="s595">Then my little brother came out at night.</span> <span id="s596">I was I think sleeping over at my brother's.</span> <span id="s597">He said, don't go there.</span> <span id="s598">The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you might compromise the whole place.</span> <span id="s599">I don't know to this day what happened to that man, but I know the glasses and blood was running out.</span> <span id="s600">From then on I became what we call in the Ghetto, a wild boy.</span> <span id="s601">My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was horrible.</span> <span id="s602">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead people on the street.</span> <span id="s603">Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but everyday hundreds of people would lay down and die.</span> <span id="s604">They couldn't either take it anymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up.</span> <span id="s605">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning, I wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of those half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in Warsaw everybody you couldn't go away without a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s606">I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Sometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself.</span> <span id="s608">That's how I got breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch.</span> <span id="s609">Some of the time I was beaten up.</span> <span id="s610">They used to smuggle in potatoes.</span> <span id="s611">If something fell I would grab and they would run after me and beat the hell out of me.</span> <span id="s612">Hygiene, very dirty.</span> <span id="s613">There was no place to take a shower any more.</span> <span id="s614">You go around desperate.</span> <span id="s615">So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the other side.</span> <span id="s616">I didn't run away but to go out for some food.</span> <span id="s617">One incident I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s618">So, the situation was very bad.</span> <span id="s619">Children, especially elderly people would be laying down there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because they had no place to stay or they gave up.</span> <span id="s620">I decided with other kids we're going to take a chance.</span> <span id="s621">They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went out, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food.</span> <span id="s622">One time, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just the gist of one event.</span> <span id="s623">We're trying to get in and beg for food.</span> <span id="s624">We have learned already a little bit how to greet catholic people in their way.</span> <span id="s625">So, it was about a four or five story building and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a certain gate, and each one of us went to a different floor.</span> <span id="s626">I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s627">A woman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I had to.</span> <span id="s628">She said to me, "Look, you don't have to do that.</span> <span id="s629">I know who you are."</span> <span id="s630">I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up.</span> <span id="s631">A nice woman and the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water and especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive.</span> <span id="s632">We did not look good.</span> <span id="s633">That's how they recognized us anyhow.</span> <span id="s634">So, she said don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s635">Take it off and I'll burn it.</span> <span id="s636">I will cook it.</span> <span id="s637">Then she was cooking for me something like buckwheat.</span> <span id="s638">And they were poor themselves.</span> <span id="s639">She didn't have anything to give other than to cook something.</span> <span id="s640">And I was hungrier than hell.</span> <span id="s641">She sat down with me and I think she was a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me.</span> <span id="s642">She said it's such a pity that you Jewish children can not go to kingdom of heaven and he had to bring Hitler a man, the destroyer.</span> <span id="s643">I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up religious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay.</span> <span id="s644">Well, I understand, but what can we do we're hungry.</span> <span id="s645">All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat yet.</span> <span id="s646">I hear a shot.</span> <span id="s647">The superintendent of the building must have called up the police, the local police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot.</span> <span id="s648">He was shot in the leg and he fell.</span> <span id="s649">I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second floor, but that woman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere.</span> <span id="s650">So, she took me in a closet, in Europe they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have outside, and she put me in there and she locked me up.</span> <span id="s651">She covered me with all kinds of furs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors.</span> <span id="s652">She was afraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too.</span> <span id="s653">So, she went to the neighbors, and I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any air.</span> <span id="s654">I was holding my nose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end.</span> <span id="s655">They'll probably ask the other kid on the second floor what happened, where I am who is the other one because the superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s656">Well, I was there, running was water, I thought this is the end of me.</span> <span id="s657">I couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s658">I think I passed out for a while.</span> <span id="s659">All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was a husband and coming back and screaming.</span> <span id="s660">He was a good man, he says look you have to kill us.</span> <span id="s661">He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him.</span> <span id="s662">When they took me out, I didn't go out, I fell out.</span> <span id="s663">But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors.</span> <span id="s664">Gave me new clothes because my clothes were wet.</span> <span id="s665">He was still cooking and food and everything and at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was very connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food.</span> <span id="s666">He gave me food and everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate.</span> <span id="s667">I had food for two weeks.</span> <span id="s668">What I'm trying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to hell, almost dead.</span> <span id="s669">The guy on the second floor.</span> <span id="s670">I don't know what happened to the first floor whether they took him back to the hospital or not.</span> <span id="s671">I never met him.</span> <span id="s672">This kid, the other one, told on me and again I had to change clothes.</span> <span id="s673">I had to make myself all kind of dirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s674">But I was sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who I am.</span> <span id="s675">Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there.</span> <span id="s676">I am going to die there.</span> <span id="s677">I went over to my brother.</span> <span id="s678">I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were close.</span> <span id="s679">I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other side, some of them recognized, some of them didn't recognize.</span> <span id="s680">I am going to escape.</span> <span id="s681">Whatever happens, happens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids.</span> <span id="s682">So, he says look, tell me something, you go because there's no hope here.</span> <span id="s683">I'll take you through.</span> <span id="s684">The way they took through people was they went to work outside and they could squeeze me, but he was already an educated guy.</span> <span id="s685">He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a Zionist group and I guess he was more or less in underground already.</span> <span id="s686">They had certain connections with people in Slovakia so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over there.</span> <span id="s687">He drew up a map.</span> <span id="s688">You take this boat.</span> <span id="s689">There was a boat going.</span> <span id="s690">There was a rive in Poland which goes through the whole country.</span> <span id="s691">When you hit under the try to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews.</span> <span id="s692">So, he gave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I had, not much, and to go and get a ticket.</span> <span id="s693">I walked out of the group which went to work and ran away.</span> <span id="s694">I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money he had.</span> <span id="s695">He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but shoes.</span> <span id="s696">I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated, I was moving back, because there was a line of people, to go or not to go, because I think only older people go and I was just a little kid in between.</span> <span id="s697">So, I moved out, all of sudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me, don't go in there in German they said they'll you.</span> <span id="s698">They will finish you off in German.</span> <span id="s699">I pretended I didn't know a word of German.</span> <span id="s700">So I was saying again in Czech again.</span> <span id="s701">He got mad and he started talking in Polish.</span> <span id="s702">He knew both languages.</span> <span id="s703">He said you get the hell away from here.</span> <span id="s704">They will kill you.</span> <span id="s705">I have an idea after today, he was an angel and he saved me.</span> <span id="s706">But where do I go.</span> <span id="s707">I had a map, about a journey of two days hit the in Poland, and i don't know where to go so I went to the Central Station.</span> <span id="s708">I went to Central Station but my heart was pumping.</span> <span id="s709">I didn't know whether they would recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid attention to me.</span> <span id="s710">I had a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s711">This was early in the morning when I got out, and where do you go.</span> <span id="s712">Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that Central Station entrance because there were so many German SS around there checking for , which means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are.</span> <span id="s713">They called them , and I had nothing.</span> <span id="s714">Where do you go, so I was just roaming around the street and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him to a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60 kilometers outside of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s715">But they had a little train there.</span> <span id="s716">It wasn't large rails and small and it sort of dragged into that little city.</span> <span id="s717">So I said maybe down there there won't be so many soldiers.</span> <span id="s718">And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it get a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow.</span> <span id="s719">So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a ticket.</span> <span id="s720">I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money and give the conductor.</span> <span id="s721">They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers.</span> <span id="s722">So, I sat down amongst the women.</span> <span id="s723">They were smugglers.</span> <span id="s724">They would smuggle in food to Warsaw and buy clothes there.</span> <span id="s725">This was their job.</span> <span id="s726">So amongst them I sat between them they asked me where do you come from?</span> <span id="s727">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s728">I told them, listen my father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed.</span> <span id="s729">I am looking for my mother because my father lived in the German occupied area and my mother took off and she's supposed to be around this area.</span> <span id="s730">So, they started giving me salami, food, anything what I wanted.</span> <span id="s731">When the conductor came he, they said you don't touch that kid.</span> <span id="s732">In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed.</span> <span id="s733">I don't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what am I doing.</span> <span id="s734">I didn't have a ticket.</span> <span id="s735">I was still scared.</span> <span id="s736">When the rail -- the locomotive slowed down and the front of that city it was called and in the front of that city there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were smuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off.</span> <span id="s737">Where do you go now?</span> <span id="s738">I was just running in the direction of the end of the train.</span> <span id="s739">Dark, I went through a little river up to here, and down across was a forest and I didn't know, you wouldn't believe it, I was hoping to God and I was sorry I left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s740">I was real sorry, because I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s741">It was dark, cold, wet.</span> <span id="s742">I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s743">In the morning some elderly lady, a woman, was carrying a can of milk to distribute.</span> <span id="s744">I asked here where am I. I spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s745">I was very good at it.</span> <span id="s746">She says, first she gave me a little bit milk.</span> <span id="s747">She says you're so wet, what happened?</span> <span id="s748">I said I got in in that river and I don't know where -- I got lost.</span> <span id="s749">There's a little city called Varka (ph), not far, you go there.</span> <span id="s750">I think it was Sunday morning, I figured I'm going to go.</span> <span id="s751">What do you do?</span> <span id="s752">I went to that little city in the morning and the sun came out and I dried out and I see all the people are going to church, so I went down there to.</span> <span id="s753">I was afraid to stay behind someone else's house, and I seen a lot of those very old ladies sat down begging and people would give them.</span> <span id="s754">I sat down too, but on the side I wanted to dry out.</span> <span id="s755">One woman came over and said, "What are you doing little boy here between all these old people?"</span> <span id="s756">I said I don't know.</span> <span id="s757">I haven't got any money and I have a family.</span> <span id="s758">My father was killed.</span> <span id="s759">I used it, I knew it worked.</span> <span id="s760">My father was killed -- they took out pieces of bread they gave me.</span> <span id="s761">Other people said this was an orphan.</span> <span id="s762">His father was killed.</span> <span id="s763">They gave me bread and little pieces of sausage.</span> <span id="s764">In the meantime I dried out and they gave me a few dollars, a few .</span> <span id="s765">The first few dollars I had.</span> <span id="s766">They were selling crosses down there in front of the church.</span> <span id="s767">I gave the few dollars to that guy, and I got myself a very large size of a cross.</span> <span id="s768">I figured it's going to help.</span> <span id="s769">And I continued that day, I stuck around in that city.</span> <span id="s770">I went again, I was afraid to stay there.</span> <span id="s771">I was always worried if they ar going to recognize me or not.</span> <span id="s772">I figured if I keep going, I'll be dried out.</span> <span id="s773">It's a small village.</span> <span id="s774">So, I went through like a forest, and in this forest the German firm was cutting trees, I think for the coal mines, the mines.</span> <span id="s775">There was a sign that was two days later -- there was sign whoever works will get so many marks.</span> <span id="s776">In the mill in the forest they had like a trailer there and it wasn't army.</span> <span id="s777">These were people, it was a company with Germans who were preparing those trees, and a lot of Poles were working there.</span> <span id="s778">I went over and I asked for a job.</span> <span id="s779">I asked for a job and the woman she spoke German and Polish you know.</span> <span id="s780">To the German she spoke German, to me she spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s781">Don't you think you're a little bit too young.</span> <span id="s782">You had to be sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s783">But I was very skinny too on top of it.</span> <span id="s784">Don't you think you're too young.</span> <span id="s785">You can't work because you're too young.</span> <span id="s786">So, one of the other Germans, a foreman said, and I understood what he was saying, tell me you'll take him in and they'll let him clean up around us.</span> <span id="s787">Clean up the trailer.</span> <span id="s788">I'm telling you, as soon as she said can you clean a little bit, nobody ever cleaned better than I did.</span> <span id="s789">I did a good job.</span> <span id="s790">Then she asked me do you have anything to show who you are?</span> <span id="s791">I gave the same story, my father was killed.</span> <span id="s792">I came from a certain city, North Poland, and I have got nothing.</span> <span id="s793">She said, "I'll tell you what.</span> <span id="s794">You work here next week.</span> <span id="s795">I'll go with you to another village.</span> <span id="s796">We'll make a photograph of you, a picture and then I'll send it into the city and they'll bring you a work card.</span> <span id="s797">I don't know, I think luck was with me at that time.</span> <span id="s798">When she said I can have a work card, and she was good to me, because I really washed and cleaned and helped.</span> <span id="s799">It so happened I got a work card, and I worked there for quite a while, maybe five or six weeks, until they liquidated the work place.</span> <span id="s800">We cut enough trees probably.</span> <span id="s801">They hauled them away in trucks.</span> <span id="s802">They hauled them away in trucks.</span> <span id="s803">Now, where do you go now?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Had you changed your name for the work card?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Why certainly, at that time my name was , with a W. I figured I can't keep my real name.</span> <span id="s806">I had to have a Polish name, a Christian Name, and they used to call me , so I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s807">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s808">Finally, they were asking, I went to another village.</span> <span id="s809">I already had a few dollars.</span> <span id="s810">The foreman gave me money.</span> <span id="s811">I was a polishing their boots, they had some horses, I was cleaning the horses, so I had quite a few marks at that time.</span> <span id="s812">So, I went to a small little village and then they had a sign.</span> <span id="s813">I stayed by people.</span> <span id="s814">They slept on the floor and they told me there's a place where they're looking for hands, working hands to help on the farm.</span> <span id="s815">And I have to go to the head of the area, who was naturally a German, a commandant and these people used to come and take the workers.</span> <span id="s816">They wanted them to have a lot of workers, because they were supplying food for the Germans.</span> <span id="s817">The Germans were confiscating food at that time.</span> <span id="s818">So, I came into a big place there, and I registered my name take a look I got working papers.</span> <span id="s819">They didn't ask me any questions.</span> <span id="s820">And a guy on a horse and buggy took me to his farm, and I had to start working on a farm.</span> <span id="s821">They didn't know who I was, whether I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s822">I had certain problems there.</span> <span id="s823">After a week or two I had to go to confession.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Now, my father never went to confession, my grandfather neither, and I didn't know what to say either.</span> <span id="s825">I understood what it's all about because the son of the owner had to go and went with me.</span> <span id="s826">We went later than the people.</span> <span id="s827">He went in down there and I'm telling you my heart is just pumping, what am I going to tell the priest.</span> <span id="s828">What do you tell a priest, you know, I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s829">I never did it.</span> <span id="s830">Somehow I heard it.</span> <span id="s831">I was so scared I put my ear to the little entrance.</span> <span id="s832">It was a little bit ajar and I understood what he said and I asked him, he said just tell him that you didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s833">I went in there and repeated the same thing.</span> <span id="s834">I repeated the same thing and somehow it didn't work.</span> <span id="s835">He took me out, it was a man I would say over eighty for sure, a priest.</span> <span id="s836">And he asked me, tell me your parents were not from the old religion , I understood that if you didn't say they were not Jews I understood right away that he was not such a bad man.</span> <span id="s837">If he would have been a bad man and said they were not Jews, but somehow he was very delicate about it.</span> <span id="s838">I asked what kind of people are those , he kind of winked at me and said if you don't know, you don't know, but an old man wore those long robes, and I think, today, he recognized me, I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s839">I did not do the right thing I know it, but he took advantage of me later, you know every time I had to clean up behind him in his room, he made me do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: When we stopped, you were telling me about the priest who sort of recognized you but didn't acknowledge you.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s843">He never bothered me.</span> <span id="s844">I think he recognized me and I did some chores for him so I didn't have to go back to confessions.</span> <span id="s845">On a whole he was a heck of a nice man, because I used to go every other Sunday to him.</span> <span id="s846">And I worked on a farm, and I did anything people had to do on a farm and of course, since I was not used to it, it was horrid, but I was very happy.</span> <span id="s847">I had food.</span> <span id="s848">The people down there treated me well.</span> <span id="s849">I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed money because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food, clothes, very nice catholic people.</span> <span id="s850">So, I worked for a baker.</span> <span id="s851">I went to work in a small little village not far.</span> <span id="s852">A little city for a baker, the place was called Garbutka (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Working for the baker, he was a very nice man, and I worked all night.</span> <span id="s854">From what I can recollect, that's the first time I found out of the Holocaust with him.</span> <span id="s855">Once we were through we sat down outside to rest.</span> <span id="s856">It was like it wasn't even daybreak yet.</span> <span id="s857">A train went down not far.</span> <span id="s858">A train went down there not far from there and he said you know something, these Germans are going to pay, and they're going to pay heavily for the kind of barbarism they are doing now.</span> <span id="s859">He told me in Polish.</span> <span id="s860">He was mad.</span> <span id="s861">He was a good man, and he said, you know something, these trains which you see going through, they are burning people alive and getting them through the chimneys and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">I heard that and everything inside of me started shaking.</span> <span id="s863">I did not believe it, you know.</span> <span id="s864">I didn't believe it that this could happen, something like that.</span> <span id="s865">They're burning -- I looked at him but I said I got very good information that that's what they do to people.</span> <span id="s866">One day they will pay for it.</span> <span id="s867">I was uneasy already, very uneasy.</span> <span id="s868">And I heard, not far from there there was a little Jewish Ghetto.</span> <span id="s869">That Ghetto was --what they did the Germans got together shoemakers, what do you call it, tailors, other let's say people who were good in certain trades.</span> <span id="s870">They got them together, and they worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s871">This was already after they liquidated most of the Ghettos, and these people were living maybe a couple hundred of them and one man a shoemaker used to come to me the baker and he used to hide his shoes.</span> <span id="s872">I think he recognized me that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s873">A very nice man, and he told me about the Jewish Ghetto, because he used to get out of the Ghetto, all the shoes, bring them into Ghetto, make some money and brought them back to the village, made some money and came back.</span> <span id="s874">One day, being in this little village, something must have happened some provocation or something, the Polish people around there were doing something, the underground which wasn't to the Gestapo liking.</span> <span id="s875">They must have done something bad.</span> <span id="s876">I didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s877">All of a sudden, I want to tell you something, my mother comes to my dream she says listen -- everytime something happened bad my mother came to my dream.</span> <span id="s878">She said in the morning you run away from there, and with that kind of thought I wake up and I , they are shooting people all over the village.</span> <span id="s879">They are shooting people in the village.</span> <span id="s880">I kind of remember, but it was hard to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Who and why were they shooting in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: What I'm trying to tell you is they had some kind --from what I know now, I didn't know then, there was a provocation, the underground, the Polish underground probably robbed or took a lot of food out of the trains which went to the front.</span> <span id="s883">So they brought some kind of punishment, a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing people on the street.</span> <span id="s884">I look out and the priest was even taken in chains.</span> <span id="s885">I was looking out and I figured I'm going to run.</span> <span id="s886">And I think I was running better than Tarzan and I ran, but the wheat was that high and in Poland they did not have big estates, just small little parcels of land.</span> <span id="s887">So, in between there was one parcel of land and the other, there was what they called in Polish , like little streets, and they were having a guns machine guns down there.</span> <span id="s888">Anything moves, boom.</span> <span id="s889">I got in between and I want to tell you I was going and I figured this is the end, and I kind of ducked every minutes.</span> <span id="s890">After they shot, I got through.</span> <span id="s891">I finally got through and where do I go now.</span> <span id="s892">I remind myself about that Jewish Ghetto.</span> <span id="s893">I'm going to run there, and it was about a couple kilometers there.</span> <span id="s894">I was running away in my shorts.</span> <span id="s895">My whole body was full of blood from I was on my chest walking on my chest because I was afraid if I put my head up that was the end.</span> <span id="s896">Well, I finally reached that place and they let me in.</span> <span id="s897">The Jewish people were watching themselves too.</span> <span id="s898">They didn't know yet, but they had an idea.</span> <span id="s899">They heard all the shooting and I told them what happened.</span> <span id="s900">I told them listen I'm Jewish let me into this group, and I told him about that man who used to hold my shoes down there.</span> <span id="s901">Sure enough they went in there and he came in and took me into his house.</span> <span id="s902">It was very early.</span> <span id="s903">I was a stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Everybody was sleeping yet.</span> <span id="s905">His wife, he woke up his wife to wash me up, because I was full of blood, and I was sitting figuring, what kind of life was that.</span> <span id="s906">I was really disgusted.</span> <span id="s907">I could have been killed a couple hours ago.</span> <span id="s908">All of a sudden I seen the same German marching in on this place.</span> <span id="s909">I was a stranger and sitting behind the door and people were still sleeping behind every little house seven Germans, SS men would stand there, their guns pulled out and one of them, all of a sudden I saw that this must be the end.</span> <span id="s910">But I was behind the door, a stranger, and they opened the door.</span> <span id="s911">They went to every home, and all of a sudden one of them walks in and said all the men out.</span> <span id="s912">I never knew that so many men were in one little house.</span> <span id="s913">This guy -- so I look out through that window, through that opening, boom.</span> <span id="s914">Everybody that walks out boom, got a bullet right in the back of the head.</span> <span id="s915">At that moment, you wouldn't believe it, I saw myself dying there, and I saw a film in front me, all my life, I saw like a fast film, my life and I figured this is it there where I lay.</span> <span id="s916">Now, I turned into glue, I tell you.</span> <span id="s917">There was no escape.</span> <span id="s918">One guy was outside chasing out and the rest of them were shooting, one by one, in every house in front of them.</span> <span id="s919">The German who was chasing out, took me by my back and pulled me and I didn't give a damn.</span> <span id="s920">I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s921">I knew I'm going to be dead and I was half conscious.</span> <span id="s922">So, there was one of them in the front a tall SS man.</span> <span id="s923">I don't know what happened but he turns me around and says in German , he's a little boy.</span> <span id="s924">go back.</span> <span id="s925">He looked me in the eyes and go back.</span> <span id="s926">I want to go back, but I'll never forget that guy who chased out everybody from the house, a big German like this, and assessment aren't you killed yet?</span> <span id="s927">I started begging him.</span> <span id="s928">He didn't shoot inside, he was holding the gun like that, but the women all of a sudden they saw what was happening they tore me out of his hand.</span> <span id="s929">The women, because they -- they killed some women, I found out later, those who resisted killing their husbands or their sons.</span> <span id="s930">Somehow there was scattering all those Germans so this German let them tear me out and he went outside to shoot others and they told me in this little room, the next room, the Germans were not there.</span> <span id="s931">They tore off the door and I go in there.</span> <span id="s932">There was a lady there who started crying.</span> <span id="s933">To the other women you brought us an angle of death to me, that I am going to spoil it for them.</span> <span id="s934">And they had a a little basement and one side was a bath the other side and a basement about three by three.</span> <span id="s935">They must have been hiding food or something because it wasn't very deep and the old man, the woman's husband was shaking he was afraid to go down.</span> <span id="s936">He was an old man.</span> <span id="s937">And I got the idea if he go down I'll go down with him.</span> <span id="s938">There was no escape.</span> <span id="s939">These two girls, one that mentioned, the two girls one of them didn't let me in and the other one said let him in.</span> <span id="s940">Finally they pushed the father in because the SS, the Germans were running around looking for men to shoot.</span> <span id="s941">They got him, but the elder sister didn't let me in, so I kind of got in, the girl pushed her away.</span> <span id="s942">I got in with my head down and my feet up.</span> <span id="s943">There wasn't enough space and I held the old man like this.</span> <span id="s944">When they saw the Germans approaching, they closed it, closed it very fast.</span> <span id="s945">They went and the Jewish people did resist at that time.</span> <span id="s946">They were looking around.</span> <span id="s947">I think they were scared themselves too.</span> <span id="s948">They were shooting in one bath if someone is not there, then the other bath, and I laid between and the little girl said I want to go with my Grandpa to that little basement and then I passed out.</span> <span id="s949">I honestly don't remember having any conscious.</span> <span id="s950">I don't remember until about four hours later, these two girls with another woman they pulled me up.</span> <span id="s951">They pulled up their father.</span> <span id="s952">The people were killed already.</span> <span id="s953">I could hardly regain my consciousness because my head was whirling.</span> <span id="s954">I didn't know whether I was still alive or I'm dead.</span> <span id="s955">They pulled me out and there was a heap of dead people, like 120.</span> <span id="s956">They pushed me in between and I took some and I bloodied myself to make sure that the women had to go, they disappeared, most the SS went away.</span> <span id="s957">They did their job, cruelly.</span> <span id="s958">I was laying between the dead and a couple of old local Germans were to write down how many.</span> <span id="s959">They pushed me up, I pretended I was dead.</span> <span id="s960">I was waiting.</span> <span id="s961">They took the women to dig a big ditch for their husband and they put all kinds of lime in there.</span> <span id="s962">That's what i heard.</span> <span id="s963">Then the women came back and they put us out.</span> <span id="s964">I was almost night, and they put us on a big horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s965">All the dead, I pretended I was dead too.</span> <span id="s966">They left a couple of Jewish policeman or ordinals, they left them alive, they helped pull it up.</span> <span id="s967">One of them squeezed me.</span> <span id="s968">I knew that he knew that I was alive.</span> <span id="s969">When we went somewhere I remember because after the war I went to take a look down there.</span> <span id="s970">I was only about 100 meters from the big ditch, and we made a turn after I decided to jump off.</span> <span id="s971">I don't think anybody did any shooting.</span> <span id="s972">Nobody did any shooting.</span> <span id="s973">I ran.</span> <span id="s974">I didn't know where I'm going.</span> <span id="s975">My head was whirling.</span> <span id="s976">All night I was running like a dead person.</span> <span id="s977">I didn't know where I was going and what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s978">Until I finally saw a little man and I told him that I worked for this guy and this guy in this village where I worked for the baker, so they gave me some clothes and they washed me, another farmer.</span> <span id="s979">That's how I survived this massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: What was the name of the village where the Jewish Ghetto was?</span> <span id="s981">A: It's called Garbutka.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Did you have any sense when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: It was somewhere around either July or August 1942.</span> <span id="s984">At that time, we heard, because I related that that they were killing older Jews, or killing all the Jews in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s985">That's how I remember that.</span> <span id="s986">Anyhow, that's was the event, and that's why I told you off camera about this girl, that woman who saved me is in Montreal today, and I recognized it two years ago in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: The woman in the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: The woman who helped me get into the basement.</span> <span id="s989">She had another sister who did not want me to get in there because they wanted to save their father.</span> <span id="s990">Anyhow I got out of this mayhem and I went to work for another -- I think it was again a smaller little farmer.</span> <span id="s991">I was afraid to go back.</span> <span id="s992">Eventually I went back to the camp, but what happened is I ran into another small little city and they took me to a camp.</span> <span id="s993">This was some kind of a camp for Poles.</span> <span id="s994">There was some Jews too.</span> <span id="s995">Not far was called .</span> <span id="s996">I think I was working there only two weeks.</span> <span id="s997">Also, they surrounded the people but supervision was done by Russian P.O.W.s and they were working on -- they were crushing stone to make some kind of a -- to go through some kind of a street.</span> <span id="s998">My job was -- again I was a little boy so they put me on a little lorry to hold the two -- to kind of brake and somehow I forgot my way and instead of braking I pulled the thing and naturally the guy, the foreman, he was German, started jumping and threatening me, and hitting me and bleeding me.</span> <span id="s999">He says I'll take care of you tonight.</span> <span id="s1000">I want to tell you, an hour later I said I have to go to the bathroom, bloody, and I kept on walking and I escaped.</span> <span id="s1001">That was a little camp I wasn't long there, a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1002">Then I remember another event when I was in that village and there I really literally found out about the holocaust.</span> <span id="s1003">We were taken to work down there near a train, and every week a train would come from Holland enclosed wagons, they had some wires across and there was a bag for water, and all the boys, including me, we were running to get some water, because these people I knew they were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1004">They were screaming in Jewish.</span> <span id="s1005">They couldn't talk Polish, half German, but they were from Holland.</span> <span id="s1006">And they threw gold and money and give you water.</span> <span id="s1007">My heart was just the same thing.</span> <span id="s1008">I was crying to myself.</span> <span id="s1009">What the heck is going on, and I knew which direction they were going already.</span> <span id="s1010">The whole families and they were crying and looking through the thing.</span> <span id="s1011">Of course I didn't care about the money but some of the kids cared about the money.</span> <span id="s1012">I didn't want to be different.</span> <span id="s1013">I picked up too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">This was going on for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1015">Every Thursday a train would come and I was waiting with water and other boys were waiting with water too, for money, some of them I felt very sorry for those people.</span> <span id="s1016">One day, a train comes and I waited.</span> <span id="s1017">This was just an event I must tell you.</span> <span id="s1018">I'm holding a bucket of water and a train comes but not that kind of a train, opened, and German police not SS, but police were talking to these people, stop the train.</span> <span id="s1019">They always had to stop.</span> <span id="s1020">I don't know whether they had to fill up with water, the locomotive, so it stopped and I looked in.</span> <span id="s1021">Believe me I hold the bucket of water for I thought first class, all Germans and they talked to each other.</span> <span id="s1022">I was smart enough to know which is an SS man, which is a policeman.</span> <span id="s1023">I had a kind of education over the years.</span> <span id="s1024">So, I was educated in this respect, so I go ahead and I take a look at it.</span> <span id="s1025">I hide my water and take a look what's going on and I look in there.</span> <span id="s1026">They were wearing medals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">There were beautiful people, , so a German, I hesitated, he's going to get like everybody ten marks get in there and bring him the water.</span> <span id="s1028">I took the water out and I started giving they had like little cubicles.</span> <span id="s1029">I walked over to one man and he was religious, religious Jews were they called it, and I recognized that he's Jewish and all of a sudden I look at the rest of the people and all of a sudden I knew they were Jewish, because the guy who was the head, a little guy next to him, he asked me in German , so I told me slowly , means a killing place in German.</span> <span id="s1030">So, I kind of mentioned him.</span> <span id="s1031">But I was very scared saying it when they said , I just jumped off the train with my empty bucket.</span> <span id="s1032">I spilled the water and I ran as far as I could.</span> <span id="s1033">I know my heart was crying because I knew in a couple two or three hours nothing will be out of them.</span> <span id="s1034">They must have been VIPs from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1035">Some of them had medals.</span> <span id="s1036">In other words some of them must have been soldiers in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s1037">This was the last time I went through to the trains.</span> <span id="s1038">I was really afraid.</span> <span id="s1039">But when I found out at this time really about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: How did you or anybody else know where these trains were going?</span> <span id="s1041">A: Where I'm going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: No, how did you know where these trains were heading?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: I told you the first time I found out the truth the baker, he told me that in this direction, goes down there to a place called and from there it goes down to and they knew.</span> <span id="s1044">The local population knew.</span> <span id="s1045">They were witnessing it.</span> <span id="s1046">I don't think they were happy the Polish people regardless of their feeling.</span> <span id="s1047">They still knew that human beings are being burned alive.</span> <span id="s1048">I saw in the eyes of my baker, catholic, I saw he was very angry.</span> <span id="s1049">He said one day they are going to pay for that crime.</span> <span id="s1050">I couldn't say I was Jewish, but my heart and everything in me was whirling.</span> <span id="s1051">I really didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1052">But slowly after the trains, and also there were runaways.</span> <span id="s1053">Jews were hiding.</span> <span id="s1054">Those who jumped out of the trains.</span> <span id="s1055">I can't go into in this interview all of the particulars, but there were incidents -- there were incidents where I saw Russian escapes.</span> <span id="s1056">I gave them bread, anything we had because somehow they were begging for food because they escaped and most of them were caught anyhow.</span> <span id="s1057">But the Russians were really, really treated bad by that time, the Russian POWs.</span> <span id="s1058">They used tell me some of them.</span> <span id="s1059">I worked in the fields and they would somehow run through those fields and ask me if I could bring in a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Was there any effort by the Polish people to sabotage this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: From what I knew, do you mean sabotage the Jewish problem or sabotage against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: There was quite a bit, I want you to know.</span> <span id="s1064">From what I know and from what I observed the Polish people were very patriotic, and they hated the Germans regardless and let me tell you the Germans, the SS, they did not treat the Poles nicely, not even nicely.</span> <span id="s1065">They were killing them off quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1066">They were killing them off.</span> <span id="s1067">And they had their underground, which was run through London and some of them, most of them in the village by us were hiding and we were hiding all kinds of guns and ammunition and I used to be chased out sometimes in the village to find out what time the train goes to Russia to the front, because sometimes this underground would jump on one of the trains, but on the edge of the train and steal whatever they could, food, ammunition.</span> <span id="s1068">So, the Poles, they were putting up a hell of a resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Were you aware of any specific incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Where they put on a resistance.</span> <span id="s1071">Not a specific but I knew and I saw because the people I worked for, they were really engaged in that underground activity.</span> <span id="s1072">I wasn't on a specific did anything specifically because I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: How long did you go from village to village hiding out as a catholic boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: You want to know how much time.</span> <span id="s1075">I was even late before, I was after that I worked in a gun powder factory, and also they had a lot of Jewish people down there working for those good chemists.</span> <span id="s1076">They got together all those people who they didn't liquidate if they asked look what did you do, if he was a good chemist of physicist they needed for armaments so these people worked in a big factory down there, and I happened to go in to them, to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1077">Then I stayed with them a few months and then I escaped back to the villages, but to answer you how many -- what did you ask me again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Were you in hiding essentially for the rest of the war of how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Hiding through the rest of the war is the answer.</span> <span id="s1080">I was never free.</span> <span id="s1081">I either was inside, jail was inside or I was hiding outside.</span> <span id="s1082">I was not hiding because I had to hide, I was hiding because I was scared.</span> <span id="s1083">Just about I would say a year before the end of the year, the Polish resistance was very great, and I was scared at that time they grabbed all youth I was scared they were going to recognize me, so I escaped from there.</span> <span id="s1084">I went back to where the factory was, not far, and I was hiding personally because there was another problem.</span> <span id="s1085">Amy boy whether they were Jewish or not Jewish, any boy was either arrested to kill because the Poles had an uprising in Warsaw and the people they I would say the Polish army was gathering to go help the people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1086">I was afraid that they were going to -- I was with them really, it was called at that time , a Polish Army, but I didn't want to go to Warsaw and I was afraid they were really mobiling young kids to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1087">However, I escaped.</span> <span id="s1088">I was more afraid that they were going to recognize me that I'm not Jewish, because being in the village somehow I knew the people, but strangers, groups, underground there were all kinds of people and some of them were they were very good and recognizing Jews, I want you to know.</span> <span id="s1089">So, I escaped the forest and then I was hiding wherever I could.</span> <span id="s1090">But his was the real way I was saved.</span> <span id="s1091">I was hiding in the haystack and all of a sudden I see two guys.</span> <span id="s1092">I was with another fellow.</span> <span id="s1093">Not to be killed the Germans were after him.</span> <span id="s1094">Germans SS, Gestapo, they had all kinds of you know, people who were looking to kill us.</span> <span id="s1095">So, I was hiding and all of a sudden I seen two guys whom I recognized they worked in the gun powder factory and they escaped from there.</span> <span id="s1096">One guy knew the area very well.</span> <span id="s1097">He's the one who practically saved me.</span> <span id="s1098">He's in Toronto now.</span> <span id="s1099">I was just with him in .</span> <span id="s1100">His name is Silverman He knew the area and we tried to get across the lines, the lines meaning the Russians were advancing.</span> <span id="s1101">We were on the other side.</span> <span id="s1102">The artillery was just unbearable from the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1103">We tried to get through the to go to the Russian side, but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1104">There were virtually hordes of German army which they retreated to this other side of the water so we couldn't.</span> <span id="s1105">They had another line which they were preparing in case they had to retreat.</span> <span id="s1106">So, we were between the first line and the second line of the German defense.</span> <span id="s1107">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1108">It was bad.</span> <span id="s1109">I used to inside I did not look Jewish, I used to go out and somehow organize bread and water and we made bunkers, deep bunkers, winter, deep bunkers and we begged, we got some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">We were hungry all the time and that's how until the Army came across.</span> <span id="s1111">It's a little harder for me, but it didn't take long.</span> <span id="s1112">It was very hard because the German army with their dogs and all that they were retreating and they at that point they didn't especially care who they killed.</span> <span id="s1113">If we were in their way between both lines and that's how eventually I survived.</span> <span id="s1114">I think it's enough for me now.</span> <span id="s1115">I'm getting tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Can I just ask you a couple general questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: There's still a lot more for me to say, but it's very hard for me to go on.</span> <span id="s1118">Q: Did you go back to Warsaw then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Why certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: I wanted to ask you if you saw the city, the Ghetto burning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: The Jewish Ghetto, no, but I saw Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1122">I was aware of the burning and I was aware that there was a Jewish uprising because it was full.</span> <span id="s1123">Everybody was talking about it in the villages and the cities.</span> <span id="s1124">I came back down to Warsaw and Warsaw was completely destroyed because after the Jewish uprising, after the Jewish uprising, then there was a Polish uprising before the Soviet Army came in, and they killed quite a bit of Poles, a couple of hundred thousands.</span> <span id="s1125">They guarded themselves pretty good, but the Germans were overwhelming with tanks and everything.</span> <span id="s1126">When I came back, Warsaw was burned to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: You were liberated by the Russian army, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: I didn't see the Russians, but that was about the time somewhere in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Did you in the time you were hiding, did you feel terribly isolated that you knew you had to be safe that you had to be a catholic boy, but you knew that you're people were somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1130">Was that a strange feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Well, number one it was I wasn't too smart to think about those things.</span> <span id="s1132">I was trying to save myself.</span> <span id="s1133">I knew that I'd never see my brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1134">That I knew, yet the will to live and to one day survive and like now to tell people, it was a certain thought of it and I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: How did you feel about being Jewish at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Well, let me tell you, I went to church for quite a while, but whenever I could avoid, could avoid.</span> <span id="s1137">I never heard because the church never teaches anything harsh against Jews.</span> <span id="s1138">I just felt strange amongst it because I was brought up in a Jewish religion, so I let it go by what the priests say with a grain.</span> <span id="s1139">Let it go, okay, some of it I absorbed and some of it I forgot and that's it.</span> <span id="s1140">But I felt Jewish --not that I felt Jewish, I felt very scared every time I went from village to village and maybe they could recognize me.</span> <span id="s1141">I felt Jewish, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: You didn't resent being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: I was resenting a lot of times.</span> <span id="s1144">There were times when they took kids, in the villages, they took them to Germany and I was very scared because I was circumcised and I thought that whenever they had something like that surround and take the kids to Germany from the villages, I was hiding and very fast because they used to say they take them a certain place and because the Germans wanted only healthy people, so somewhere near they would take them to quarantine and checked whether they don't have any t.b.</span> <span id="s1145">They wanted healthy people.</span> <span id="s1146">So I was afraid if I was going to undress before doctors, they'll recognize that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1147">So, I was very sure, at the risk of my life to escape those situations where they couldn't catch me to Germany.</span> <span id="s1148">Funny thing, sometimes I figured I could have gone because one of my neighbor boy was caught then he escaped from Germany he told me didn't have anything like that.</span> <span id="s1149">They took us straight in there.</span> <span id="s1150">It would have been easier for me if I would have gone.</span> <span id="s1151">I was aware that I was circumcised.</span> <span id="s1152">Every moment of the day, it hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: After the war, were you eager to be Jewish again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Let me tell you, during the war, I really thought that God as a German.</span> <span id="s1155">I thought they'll never be defeated, the kind of cruelties, the way they were.</span> <span id="s1156">I would say the SS and all the Gestapo and all the apparatus.</span> <span id="s1157">I will tell you, you would never they were barbarians.</span> <span id="s1158">They were not human beings, these people who were running Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s1159">The SS, the Gestapo, and all kinds of other names they had.</span> <span id="s1160">I knew how strong they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">To say that I was glad to be Jewish, I want to tell you something, and this is the truth, I was just mad a my God, first of all mad at my father that he made me a Jew, and mad at my God that we had to suffer so much, what for.</span> <span id="s1162">That was my first feeling.</span> <span id="s1163">A lot of time I talked to God.</span> <span id="s1164">When you get desperate you start talking to something.</span> <span id="s1165">You've got nothing.</span> <span id="s1166">I would just put my eyes up and I asked why, why wasn't I born a dog, a bird who could jump over the Ghetto walls or a catholic.</span> <span id="s1167">Why was I Jewish.</span> <span id="s1168">And there were times when I was really thinking that it's not good for me to be a Jew, if I ever live and if I have children, I said to myself, I would never let them be circumcised because this is just showing the enemy that you're not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Well, when I went to America, of course, in American I found out that I would not circumcise my kids if it wouldn't be that they said in America they are circumcising everybody.</span> <span id="s1171">I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1172">I got married and my in-laws they were Jewish too, and I let them circumcise my two sons.</span> <span id="s1173">If I were to live in Poland, in Europe, I would never let my kids by circumcise, in fact I would even try to be a non-Jew, because what for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I guess did it take you a while to readjust to being a Jew again after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Believe me, I knew I was Jewish, because there was some persecution in Poland too, after the war.</span> <span id="s1176">And some of them came back from Russia or those who survived never made it even amongst the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1177">There were some Poles who were not happy yet with Jews surviving.</span> <span id="s1178">I wouldn't say some, majority were just people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: You're tired aren't you.</span> <span id="s1180">Do you want to stop?</span> <span id="s1181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: After you were liberated, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Eventually a year later I escaped from Poland and made my way to Germany.</span> <span id="s1184">Q: Right afterward did you go back to your village to see if you knew anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Definitely I went back.</span> <span id="s1186">I was looking.</span> <span id="s1187">I was trying to find out if anybody's is alive.</span> <span id="s1188">I know they're not, but maybe, of course, I was trying.</span> <span id="s1189">I went from village to village and I even put my name in on certain areas because I was afraid I was taken into the ARmy.</span> <span id="s1190">I was afraid that somehow my sister by the writing on the wall knew that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1191">She came back from Siberia, from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: You're sister is the only surviving?</span> <span id="s1193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Is there anything else you think should be recorded about this whole experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: To record I could just tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1196">The worst for me was the Ghetto Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1197">It was worse than hell.</span> <span id="s1198">You couldn't imagine -- hell was worse.</span> <span id="s1199">I can't imagine that the people could be surrounded, not fed, children my age and worse was smaller children, were just laying in the street begging for food, dying and no body even paid attention.</span> <span id="s1200">They just picked them up in groups, on lorries and they you know when I look I wonder right now, always my heart goes out for them.</span> <span id="s1201">Because what I saw over there, I saw the real stuff, I can relate that to what's happening.</span> <span id="s1202">But the worst was the older people, the epidemic of typhus.</span> <span id="s1203">I want you to know I had typhus at certain time, we skipped.</span> <span id="s1204">I had typhus too, but it was hell on earth.</span> <span id="s1205">The worst was Ghetto, was hell on earth.</span> <span id="s1206">To give you an example, I want to say something.</span> <span id="s1207">After the war I always looked in the eyes of German women.</span> <span id="s1208">Why.</span> <span id="s1209">You'll ask me because I saw one girl, one woman, I'm going to relate it to an incident.</span> <span id="s1210">I know already hungry kids, we knew which are good Germans, w which are bad Germans, who's going photograph us and they used to come into the Ghetto, like tourist, show how Jewish people are dirty, how they live in poverty, how they just are a heap of people who wouldn't be so bad to kill.</span> <span id="s1211">That was their real idea.</span> <span id="s1212">One day like a little truck opened in small little like a pickup and I looked at it from far.</span> <span id="s1213">Everytime a German pickup like this came into the Ghetto, everybody ran because you never know when they're going to catch up, but I was a little from far I could recognize these were airmen.</span> <span id="s1214">They were airmen so I figured I'll wait and I'll beg for bread.</span> <span id="s1215">I wait up there and they stopped and they want to make pictures.</span> <span id="s1216">I thought very good come a little close.</span> <span id="s1217">So, I said they can't photograph me unless they throw me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1218">So one girl came a little close and she grabbed me and hit me right between the eyes.</span> <span id="s1219">A girl, must have been a husband or boyfriend, a German soldier, says "Now tell me why did you do that.</span> <span id="s1220">He's just a little boy," to that woman, and I'll never forget her.</span> <span id="s1221">After the war I was looking in the eyes of every German girl and I couldn't understand why a German woman, maybe she was 18, 19 you know something like this, why she would do it to me and I didn't get any bread and I wouldn't take any bread because to me shame was worse than hunger.</span> <span id="s1222">Then they went on, but she really gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1223">What got into those people.</span> <span id="s1224">What kind of people were they?</span> <span id="s1225">Either they were barbarians or they were just got out of the caves and to go ahead and hate, make us miserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery.</span> <span id="s1226">They brought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I would say prepare the stage where they could kill us because we are not worthy living and they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened everybody in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1227">No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be clean nothing but sickness, people dying on the street, they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in Poland and they couldn't understand, they would not believe that they could do it to us.</span> <span id="s1228">They didn't believe that the German would eventually kill all of them.</span> <span id="s1229">They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the people of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education, making them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured that these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm sure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: You're
