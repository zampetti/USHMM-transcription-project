WITKOWSKI</span></p> <p><span id="s13">September 13, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s14">01:00:50</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s16">A: Uh.</span> <span id="s17">My name is Wallace A. Witkowski.</span> <span id="s18">Q: What was the name you were born with?</span> <span id="s19">A: I was given a name of .</span> <span id="s20">(ph?)</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And where and when were your born?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was born in Kielce on January 12, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Can you tell us first about your parents and what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My father was a chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s25">(Clearing throat) And he worked before the war in the petroleum industry which was concentrated in Poland, southeastern region.</span> <span id="s26">My mother was a elementary school teacher and...uh...my childhood was I think characterized by the very few years during which my parents lived together because of the economic conditions in Poland.</span> <span id="s27">Uh...My father had a job in one town.</span> <span id="s28">My mother was assigned to teach in a school in another part of Poland and it was not until 2 years before the war when we were finally together.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What did that mean for you?</span> <span id="s30">Where were you living as a very young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well...uh...I spent my childhood in...uh...a little town...uh...village of Vilena, in Kielce region which is about 20 kilometers east of Kielce.</span> <span id="s32">My mother taught in the 7th Grade elementary school in the village.</span> <span id="s33">And only during the summers and occasionally during the holidays I remember seeing my father.</span> <span id="s34">I had a nanny, a village woman, who took care of me when mother taught until I went to school at the age of 6 which was...required special permission because children were not sent to school until they were 7 in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Why were you sent so young?</span> <span id="s36">01:03:01</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I guess I was able to read and...and was anxious to learn and...uh...but I guess they let me.</span> <span id="s38">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was those early years like?</span> <span id="s40">What was life like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Uh...It was...uh...a very interesting life from the point of view of...uh...feeling, missing my father without realizing that I missed my father.</span> <span id="s42">Living in a village that was populated by...uh...typical Polish farmers, peasants, but curiously enough, there were several Jewish families that lived in the village.</span> <span id="s43">And one of the most curious things that remained with me is that there would be some of them who were farmers, along with Polish farmers.</span> <span id="s44">In one particular part of the village there was...uh...a family named Koch (ph) a Polish family, farming and right next to them was a Jewish named Katz (ph) and farming also.</span> <span id="s45">And, of course, only later that Koch (ph) and Katz (ph)...the Cat... the same name.</span> <span id="s46">And there were few Jewish...little Jewish stores that were...that were in the village.</span> <span id="s47">And...uh...but the village was obviously predominantly Polish.</span> <span id="s48">My childhood was exploring such things as...as baking potatoes in the fields in the fall after the harvest, going with other little boys and finding potatoes that people forgot to pick or didn't...missed them and baking them in the...in the field, burning my lips and on hot potatoes.</span> <span id="s49">To this day, my favorite food.</span> <span id="s50">(Chuckle) (Pause) I had a younger sister, Helena.</span> <span id="s51">No.</span> <span id="s52">Marga.</span> <span id="s53">Uh...The strongest memories are of holidays.</span> <span id="s54">Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s55">My father pretending to talk to the angel because in Polish Catholic tradition, it was the angel that brought the gifts at Christmas time.</span> <span id="s56">St. Nicholas came on December 6 and put things under the pillows of good children.</span> <span id="s57">Bad children got little twigs.</span> <span id="s58">We got both.</span> <span id="s59">So it was...uh...a rather confusing message that we were getting.</span> <span id="s60">I guess we were getting a message that we were alright, but we were not perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What happened as the war grew closer?</span> <span id="s62">You became older.</span> <span id="s63">Uh...As you became a young teenager, where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">01:06:01</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, I went to school in the village until 1937 and in 1937, after a long struggle, my parents managed to obtain a permission from the Polish...pre-War Polish authorities that my mother could be transferred and could teach in the same town in which my father was working.</span> <span id="s66">Uh...A rather unbelievable situation for us today in America, but it was common place in Poland.</span> <span id="s67">So in 1937, we moved from Vilena, the village near Kielce and we moved to Boleslawiece, which was a sort of a equivalent of Houston, Texas, of...of the United States.</span> <span id="s68">And we...there I lived with my father for the remaining 2 years before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s69">And there I went to a private elementary school which was called (ph).</span> <span id="s70">And...uh...finished the last grade which I believe was 6th and took my entrance examination to what was called gymnasium, beginning of high school, roughly equivalent in the United States.</span> <span id="s71">And that's when the war broke out in September 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Tell us about it, will you?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: About a year...about a month before, obviously...uh...the adults were aware of what was going on and we children were becoming slowly aware of the gathering clouds.</span> <span id="s74">And my father was a reserve...uh...uh...officer.</span> <span id="s75">He was a first lieutenant...I guess lieutenant in the Polish army, and in August...uh...the reserve company in that he was part of went on maneuvers.</span> <span id="s76">I was ll and a half, and that was the last time I saw him until I saw him in the United States in January 1949.</span> <span id="s77">He never came back.</span> <span id="s78">The war broke out.</span> <span id="s79">He was fighting.</span> <span id="s80">Uh...Of course, we didn't know what was going to happen and about the tenor of the pre- war Polish press was...uh...we will fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s81">We will not let them take over the country.</span> <span id="s82">So little did we know how powerful Nazis armies were.</span> <span id="s83">And the war broke out and.</span> <span id="s84">.</span> <span id="s85">uh...(sigh) within a few days, first waves of refugees started coming,...telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army, by the indiscriminate bombing, by the German air force of crowded roads filled with refugees, with.</span> <span id="s86">.</span> <span id="s87">with men, women, children, possessions, animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">01:09:11 Uh...It was extremely scary.</span> <span id="s89">It...Many times I said to my friends who are questioning me about this period that my childhood ended on September 1, 39.</span> <span id="s90">Uh...Within couple weeks, the threat of the advancing German armies were so great that all the able bodied men who otherwise were not in the armies started drifting east to escape the advancing German armies.</span> <span id="s91">To escape...to possibly join the Polish army somewhere.</span> <span id="s92">And that's where...I forget the date, but obviously it's known to history...uh...suddenly as...as.</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">as we realized we were stabbed in the back by the Soviet armies marching into Poland from the east and completely...uh.</span> <span id="s95">.</span> <span id="s96">destroying whatever little resistance there was to...to the advancing German forces.</span> <span id="s97">Only then we learned about the Molitov/Ribbontrop (ph) pact, dividing Poland and within a couple days after this event, the Germans marched into Boleslawiece and...uh.</span> <span id="s98">.</span> <span id="s99">for some reason I remember the...the day very vividly because that was the day that I had to an optometrist to pick up my first pair of glasses.</span> <span id="s100">And they were little beady little things...uh.</span> <span id="s101">.</span> <span id="s102">but I had to wear them and I walked out of the optometrist's shop and the sidewalk kind of looked crooked, but people were pointing out to...to the advancing...marching German.</span> <span id="s103">Actually men...Germans didn't march.</span> <span id="s104">They were riding trucks, and their green uniforms.</span> <span id="s105">People were reaching out to them, and the Germans were throwing cigarettes.</span> <span id="s106">That was my first impression of the German army.</span> <span id="s107">Uh...Within time that I cannot determine and now in retrospect I know that it was pursuant to some agreement between the Russians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s108">The Germans withdrew and the Soviet troops moved in.</span> <span id="s109">They were...uh...they were shabby looking, and they were...they were terribly looking...uh...neglected by our standards, un...unused to western facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Uh...Immediately in ...in private homes, Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">01:12:07 They had to be explained about toilet bowls and things like this.</span> <span id="s112">They didn't know what they were for.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s115">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were.</span> <span id="s116">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days.</span> <span id="s117">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s118">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the schools again.</span> <span id="s119">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to school, encouraged to return to school.</span> <span id="s120">New subjects were introduced.</span> <span id="s121">Russian.</span> <span id="s122">Ukrainian since this part of Poland was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s123">And we were...back in school.</span> <span id="s124">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted.</span> <span id="s125">I was bring nothing but Ds and Cs from school, and I was an A student before.</span> <span id="s126">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something is wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in school.</span> <span id="s127">Uh...But obviously we were in.</span> <span id="s128">.</span> <span id="s129">in...in great fear for what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s130">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little town in Hungary called Yur (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to Hungary and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends.</span> <span id="s131">We were permitted by the authorities to send a wire to my father...in German, and to this day I remember the text of the wire.</span> <span id="s132">Gesei Gesunt (ph).</span> <span id="s133">We are healthy.</span> <span id="s134">We are well.</span> <span id="s135">That's all we were permitted to say in that wire.</span> <span id="s136">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">01:15:01 Uh...In the meantime, the Russian school continued.</span> <span id="s138">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us.</span> <span id="s139">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated.</span> <span id="s140">And...uh...I may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in school.</span> <span id="s141">And uh, we were so involved in our own little world.</span> <span id="s142">Uh...The boys were talking about sex serupticiously.</span> <span id="s143">We were organizing poetry circles.</span> <span id="s144">Uh...We were exchanging letters.</span> <span id="s145">We had school mail where we would write letters to each other and.</span> <span id="s146">.</span> <span id="s147">uh.</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked Russia.</span> <span id="s150">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the city, but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the city, such as a power house and a lot of other installations.</span> <span id="s151">And the German, Nazis returned.</span> <span id="s152">And that is really when the terror started in earnest.</span> <span id="s153">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a..</span> <span id="s154">.</span> <span id="s155">a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s156">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into town and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh.</span> <span id="s157">.</span> <span id="s158">and we, of course, stayed home petrified and just didn't get out.</span> <span id="s159">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed.</span> <span id="s160">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies.</span> <span id="s161">We started getting hungry.</span> <span id="s162">Everything was disrupted.</span> <span id="s163">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh.</span> <span id="s164">.</span> <span id="s165">collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their war machine drive into Russia.</span> <span id="s166">(Sigh)</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:18:07 I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues.</span> <span id="s168">Uh...I do not recall the details.</span> <span id="s169">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom.</span> <span id="s170">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too.</span> <span id="s171">You killed the rest of my family."</span> <span id="s172">That's the only detail that I remember.</span> <span id="s173">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh.</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">desperate.</span> <span id="s176">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food.</span> <span id="s177">I remember through a friend we traded a bicycle that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s178">People were trading furniture, taking them to the village and getting some grain.</span> <span id="s179">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a coffee grinder, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the.</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">the gas burning stove and that would be our food.</span> <span id="s182">So it was really hard.</span> <span id="s183">So then we decided that we have to get back to central Poland where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Before you move, you have talked about the pogroms in Kielce.</span> <span id="s185">Can you tell me, when you came out from your house, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Pogroms in... in Boreslawiece?</span> <span id="s187">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s188">In Boreslawiece.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Uh...What were the...what was it like?</span> <span id="s191">Did you have any Jewish friends at that time, any Jewish acquaintances.</span> <span id="s192">Can you tell us?</span> <span id="s193">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">I had many friends.</span> <span id="s196">I had many friends.</span> <span id="s197">I visited one friend's house after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Uh...And....uh...I came into the house and I remember talking to his mother who was in tears and saying to me...uh...,Look, Panjawatko (ph), Mr. Witkowski (ph),in Polish you would Mr., but you would use the first name as sort of a half way familiar term between first name and using the last name.</span> <span id="s199">They just ran into the house and ransacked it.</span> <span id="s200">Look at this beautiful Trammel (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s201">01:21:01 Trammel (ph) was a long, tall mirror that would have some sort of a pedestal on the bottom, and a little shelf in front of it like a mantel.</span> <span id="s202">They just came in and threw a stone in it and just shattered the whole thing.</span> <span id="s203">Fortunately, in this friend's family nobody was hurt or killed, but I have heard about numerous situations in which people were...were beaten up or killed by the...by the Ukrainian peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Please go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Uh...Those days are pretty much in haze.</span> <span id="s206">Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in Boreslawiece except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were, where the...my mother's family lived.</span> <span id="s207">So on a crowded train at night, I traveled from Boreslawiece back to Kielce some...some time before Christmas, probably in 41.</span> <span id="s208">Eventually, my mother and my sister joined us, joined me in Kielce, and the rest of the war was spent in Kielce, living first with one and...and then with another, having a room in their crowded house.</span> <span id="s209">In those days, it was very lucky if you could have one room to one family.</span> <span id="s210">And the following years until about 1944 was spent primarily Mother working in...uh...in...uh...in a factory and then eventually working her way to a food store that was next to the German controlled factory where she...everybody had rations and everybody was allowed to get only so much bread, so much butter, so much other things.</span> <span id="s211">I learned what ersatz (ph) coffee is.</span> <span id="s212">I learned many other things that I had not learned before in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Uh...Among us youngsters, there were roughly my temporaries among the children of the two aunts, we organized secret teaching.</span> <span id="s214">That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans, of course, closed all the schools and prohibited in the entire country any normal education except the first few grades of elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">01:24:01 Uh...The population of those areas was destined only to be able to read and write so they would obey Germany orders in the future....uh.</span> <span id="s216">.</span> <span id="s217">future world run by the German...by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s218">We knew that we had to move because in the part of the city where my aunt lived, the Nazis were organizing the Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s219">We had to leave the house and move to another part of town and that part of town was fenced in and all the Jewish population of Kielce were...was ordered to live in... in...uh...in that area.</span> <span id="s220">They were guarded by some sort of a uniformed police.</span> <span id="s221">They were not allowed to leave the quarters.</span> <span id="s222">They were required to wear either a Star of David or a arm band with a Star of David.</span> <span id="s223">Uh...The next few years...uh...were characterized by increasing terror, increasing executions, deportations of all the leading citizens of the town to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s224">Not only Mayor and the...and the prominent citizens, doctors, lawyers, teachers,...uh...but even anybody who would be a member of what was called in these days intelligencia, you know, people with higher education were being systematically exterminated by the Nazis, taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s225">At the same time, there was a gradual growth of underground, of resistance, of organizing, not only the adults into groups that would be preparing for eventual struggle because that no one had any doubt that Nazi terror has to end one day.</span> <span id="s226">Not only to prepare for armed struggle but in the meantime to collect information about troop movements, about the...uh...the activities of the Nazis,...uh.</span> <span id="s227">.</span> <span id="s228">documenting their atrocities against the population.</span> <span id="s229">Uh...Learning how to move around the city, including us youngsters who were organized in units of clandestine scouts.</span> <span id="s230">Before the war, Poland had a very active scouting movement and after the occupation many teenagers were organized into units to...to prepare for the eventual struggle against the Nazis, but in the meantime learning, reconnoitring...uh.</span> <span id="s231">.</span> <span id="s232">moving from one part of the city...uh...avoiding main arteries, being able to cross...uh...through court yards and jump over fences and things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">01:27:15 And...uh...eventually learning the Morse alphabet and things like this and eventually we were...a few of us were designated as a unit to provide...serve as...uh... curious when I talk about these times, I'm forgetting some of the English words.</span> <span id="s234">I only remember Polish words.</span> <span id="s235">Word, warshanetza, where the...uh...the people who were runners from one partisan unit to another.</span> <span id="s236">Young boys were chosen for this purpose because they were not adults and they had a bicycle and they could avoid Germans in the country.</span> <span id="s237">But if...in those days, the partisan units had no way of communicating with each other, very few radios, so they were using youngsters to carry a message from one end to another.</span> <span id="s238">And a group of us, about a dozen or so, were sent into the partisan unit that was active in...in the area of Kielce.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: How was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Uh, that was a most curious experience.</span> <span id="s241">We slept during the day.</span> <span id="s242">We marched at night.</span> <span id="s243">I had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s244">Each one of us had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s245">We had no arms, of course.</span> <span id="s246">We were dressed in civilian clothing to look inconspicuous.</span> <span id="s247">I learned how to walk and sleep at the same time.</span> <span id="s248">Walking with a friend, locked in arms, and just marching in a column at night and sleeping at the same time, or leaning on your bicycle and...uh...uh...somehow managing to...to sleep and walk at the same time.</span> <span id="s249">During the day we would lie low because the Germans, of course, controlled the countryside.</span> <span id="s250">Uh...I encountered some Jewish survivors of the ghettos that were in the meantime being liquidated by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s251">I did not know which town they were from but I remember two of the men that were...uh...employed quote unquote by the headquarters...uh...uh...unit of this regiment, that was called regiment.</span> <span id="s252">Uh,...I don't know what they were doing, but they were...they were there.</span> <span id="s253">I remember seeing them.</span> <span id="s254">They looked terribly neglected, terribly impoverished, terribly...uh...they looked like...like driven animals because presumably of the experiences they went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:30:05 I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s256">When most of the group was disband in the fall of 44, presumably they stayed with the group because we, in the summer of 44 were concentrating all of the underground forces to go to help the uprising in Warsaw which broke out among this time, but, of course, that was a unsuccessful attempt because the.</span> <span id="s257">.</span> <span id="s258">the crossings of major rivers were guarded and these partisan units did not have heavy armor or artillery or anything.</span> <span id="s259">So after about 3 or 4 months I returned home to my mother and my sister, covered with lice, dirty, very, very...uh...skinny.</span> <span id="s260">Had some infection in my fingers.</span> <span id="s261">The skin would simply balloon around the fingers and fill with some sort of pus or some sort of fluid.</span> <span id="s262">The nail would come off with the skin when the thing started healing.</span> <span id="s263">I..</span> <span id="s264">.</span> <span id="s265">I couldn't sleep in the bed.</span> <span id="s266">For weeks, I would sleep on...on the runner on the floor next to the bed.</span> <span id="s267">I was just used to sleeping on the ground uh...Just curling up and covering myself with the blanket when I was in.</span> <span id="s268">.</span> <span id="s269">in the forests of Poland.</span> <span id="s270">But we remained in...in town, which was by that time totally terrorized by the...uh.</span> <span id="s271">.</span> <span id="s272">by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s273">From early war...uh...from early days of occupation, the Nazis employed the...the infamous method of collective responsibility.</span> <span id="s274">One single act of hostility against the Nazis or destruction of German property or interference with the war effort would result in the roundup of 10, 20, 40 hostages.</span> <span id="s275">People who simply happened to live nearby where the event occurred, and they would be put against the nearest wall and summary executed.</span> <span id="s276">So the terror of those days and fear that drove us and concern for survival are something that...that only in the last days I brought back to.</span> <span id="s277">.</span> <span id="s278">to my memory having tried to put it out of my mind all these years in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">01:33:05 The war ended for us...the occupation by the Nazis ended for us about January 9 or 10, 1945 seemingly significant date for me because my birthday is January 12th.</span> <span id="s280">The Nazis withdrew.</span> <span id="s281">The Soviet offense had started after Christmas of 44 and within days, Kielce were under Russian artillery fire.</span> <span id="s282">A very curious thing happened to me then.</span> <span id="s283">I was...uh.</span> <span id="s284">.</span> <span id="s285">living with my mother and my sister with one of my aunts who lived in a brick house, much sturdier than surrounding frame houses on the street.</span> <span id="s286">On the Yasna (ph) 27.</span> <span id="s287">Am I getting off the subject?</span> <span id="s288">Your fine, perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s290">You want to pause.</span> <span id="s291">Can we do that.</span> <span id="s292">Barney, I would like to turn off the tape please.</span> <span id="s293">We're having hammering from upstairs.</span> <span id="s294">Can you see if you could find out what's going on?</span> <span id="s295">Thank you dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s297">Alright, we're back.</span> <span id="s298">January of 1945 and the Russians are...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: The Russian artillery is bombarding the city.</span> <span id="s300">We are hiding in...in wherever we can against the brick walls of the house that only has crawl...crawl space in part of the house.</span> <span id="s301">There are fires everything.</span> <span id="s302">Uh...My mother is not with us because a few days earlier she struck out for the cousins that lived in the country and had a flour mill to get some flour for us because, as always, we were short of food.</span> <span id="s303">So she is somewhere, and my sister and I with the rest of my aunt's family are hiding there, plus a number of neighbors that came into hide in the brick house.</span> <span id="s304">Uh...The...the barrage stops.</span> <span id="s305">It's...uh...it's a beautiful, sunny, but very cold January day.</span> <span id="s306">The...the snow is crunching under your feet, but the sun is bright, blinding.</span> <span id="s307">We briefly...two men walk out in front of the house, and I followed them and I stand between them.</span> <span id="s308">And they are looking around and saying, "Oh, look there's a fire near Kinga (ph) gymnasium building.</span> <span id="s309">Maybe it's the building burning.</span> <span id="s310">And there's a fire over there."</span> <span id="s311">And I just stand between them, a kid.</span> <span id="s312">You know 17 year old or...or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s313">1945.</span> <span id="s314">Yes.</span> <span id="s315">And then suddenly I have this feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">01:36:01 I do not hear a voice.</span> <span id="s317">I sense a voice in me saying, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s318">Get out of here?"</span> <span id="s319">So I obeyed it.</span> <span id="s320">I get scared.</span> <span id="s321">I turn around, walk into the very heavy wooden oak gate that is in the center of the very old fashioned, one-story house, take about 3 or 4 steps and suddenly bells are ringing in my ears.</span> <span id="s322">I smell sulphur...uh.</span> <span id="s323">.</span> <span id="s324">plaster from...the ceiling falls on me and it's all over me.</span> <span id="s325">I'm white.</span> <span id="s326">And I cannot hear anything.</span> <span id="s327">I hear ringing in my ears.</span> <span id="s328">And people were rushing by me.</span> <span id="s329">My cousin, Andrew, and others are running out there and dragging in two bodies of the men that stood on both sides of me.</span> <span id="s330">And...uh...one of them is...is dead.</span> <span id="s331">Totally mutilated legs dangle like rag dolls, and the other one just expires.</span> <span id="s332">Uh...That shook me.</span> <span id="s333">And when my mother returned...uh...a day or two later and my family told her what happened, she simply said, "You are not meant to die then.</span> <span id="s334">You are meant to go on until the time for you to die came," because these two men obviously were not meant to live any longer.</span> <span id="s335">She...she has great faith.</span> <span id="s336">But, for us, the war ended that January.</span> <span id="s337">Russian troops moved in.</span> <span id="s338">Some of the uh, Russian organized and controlled first army Polish troops moved in, recruit...recruited or drafted from eastern provinces of pre-war Poland, and trickling into town started coming back first Jewish refugees who were with escaped or got somehow saved by going to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s339">Uh...Most of them, of course, were either in the military units or in the first administrative apparatus of the communist regime that came in and took over Kielce.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">And...uh...my memories is very dim whether school started or not.</span> <span id="s341">I don't think the school... Yes, the school started.</span> <span id="s342">The school started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9, 1945, our gymnasium was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time, April or...or May, us youngsters who only lived this heroic, teenage involvement in.</span> <span id="s343">.</span> <span id="s344">in...in patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh.</span> <span id="s345">.</span> <span id="s346">boy scout units in...in gymnasium and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized, being re...reorganized in gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">01:39:52 And we were, by the summer...by early summer of 45, we were planning our first camp even though we had nothing, but the enthusiasm of the young boys were such that we were just ready to even live without tents as long as we could get out of town and...and go somewhere and do our scouting thing.</span> <span id="s348">So we were planning a week's excursion into the...the mountains in Kielce region...uh.</span> <span id="s349">.</span> <span id="s350">which were called Gory Swietokrzyskie, St.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Cross, Holy Cross Mountains.</span> <span id="s352">And my boys were...if you pardon me the expression, this is how I ever referred to them being their leader.</span> <span id="s353">You know, this just like in the old song...I'll take care of you.</span> <span id="s354">I'm 17, you're 16.</span> <span id="s355">But I was their...one of their leaders, so my boys were already in uniforms and were getting ready to leave the next day.</span> <span id="s356">And I think it was in July, but I'm not sure of the dates again.</span> <span id="s357">When we heard rumors that the...uh...that there is something funny going on, some kind of emotion, riot or civil commotion in.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">uh...along Shenetza (ph) which is a little stream that ran through...through Kielce and...uh...but I went there.</span> <span id="s360">And I started asking people what's going on...and people told me, "Oh, this is a house that is occupied by the Jews."</span> <span id="s361">And...uh and...uh... something funny is going on there because ...uh...a Polish, Christian Catholic boy was missing for a couple of days and...uh...and.</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">uh...he was found and...uh.</span> <span id="s364">.</span> <span id="s365">he said that...that's where he was kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">01:42:01 And of course one of the most pernicious...uh...stories about the Jews...uh.</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">for centuries in Europe was that they had to use Christian blood for religious rituals.</span> <span id="s369">And so, of course, this population of this...of this town, I'm not going psycho-analyze them, but here we are for the first time not really afraid of.</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">of terror of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s372">This population restless, unhappy because communists are taking over and most of the people were anti- communist.</span> <span id="s373">Uh...These...I..</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">I'm trying to understand what happened, but I'm not going to try to understand.</span> <span id="s376">I'm going to try to tell you what I saw.</span> <span id="s377">And the only thing I saw was a large crowd of people surrounding this house and rumors flying back that the...that the military were entering upstairs where the quarters of the Jewish survivors were and the shots were fired and nobody knew who shoot...fired first, but there were casualties and there were arrests.</span> <span id="s378">And I saw one or two of my boys in scouting uniforms in the crowd, gawking.</span> <span id="s379">And I said, "What are you doing here in the scouting uniform?</span> <span id="s380">How can you even be showing around?</span> <span id="s381">Don't you have any sense of responsibility?</span> <span id="s382">This is a mob?"</span> <span id="s383">And I remember sending them home.</span> <span id="s384">Next day, I think we were leaving, out of town, so the...so the...the events moved quickly.</span> <span id="s385">And only when we came back to town we read the official accounts in the local papers that...uh...criminal elements have killed or wounded several Jewish residents of this house...uh...obviously for...for criminal purposes.</span> <span id="s386">But then, 2 or 3 months later, and I'm not sure of the date, one of my boys in my troop and I only remember his first name, Genuard (ph), Gene or Eugene, came to me and said to me, Wallace, I have to tell a very strange story.</span> <span id="s387">My young brother...and I cannot remember the age, but I know it was a child barely 3, 4 or 5 maybe ...that would be a range age....disappeared from the house for 4...3, 4, 5 days.</span> <span id="s388">We were desperate.</span> <span id="s389">We didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s390">We were searching everywhere.</span> <span id="s391">The child just wondered away.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">01:45:01 And then the militiza (ph) came, the...the...the communist militia, the...the equivalent of our police and found him and brought him home.</span> <span id="s393">They never said where they found him, but...and this is my boy from my scout troop telling me...when they started questioning him where he was and he could not tell, they took him to that house occupied by the Jewish refugees, survivors and said and asked him, "Is this where you were kept?"</span> <span id="s394">And the child said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s395">(Pause) I read in the papers later that there were trials and they were not only trials of perpetrators of the killings, but all...also trials or at least retribution by various factions in the communist government, within the communist authority that controlled the city.</span> <span id="s396">And I am sure there are others who followed the events better and have more insight or more contact with the people who participated in these things, but they were some other...some people were trying to use this event for...for other purposes.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe some international party...uh.</span> <span id="s398">.</span> <span id="s399">politics.</span> <span id="s400">But what was curious to me is the fact that I remember what my scout told me.</span> <span id="s401">Distinctly that it was the militzia (ph) that came and planted in a child's mind...the kid was probably scared.</span> <span id="s402">Undoubtedly the militzia (ph) just questioning him, "Were you...that's...Is that where you were kept?"</span> <span id="s403">And the child said, "Yes."</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How did you react when you heard your scout tell you this story?</span> <span id="s405">A: (Sigh)</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You're 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I was 17.</span> <span id="s408">(Pause) To...to be honest, I didn't know what to do with this.</span> <span id="s409">I felt that there was some skullduggery going on in the way the child was being manipulated.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">01:48:01 Uh...But my main concern at that time was for the safety of my boys and that they do not in any way...uh...get in trouble.</span> <span id="s411">That's what motivated me to shoo them away from the...the crowd that surrounded the Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s412">And I sensed the tragedy.</span> <span id="s413">But to a 17 year old, you cannot expect too much and I'm sorry to say that looking at myself from the vantage point of being 62...uh...even if we wanted to have done something with it, who were we to turn to?</span> <span id="s414">Perhaps that is why I am telling it to you today.</span> <span id="s415">Because that may just help unravel the roots of those events.</span> <span id="s416">(Long Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s418">You should go on.</span> <span id="s419">What was Kielce like after these events.</span> <span id="s420">Were there a change at all in the atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: There was a tremendous reaction from the emerging....uh... civic organizations and church authorities.</span> <span id="s422">Uh...uh...Appeal to citizens to...to point out the guilty parties who participated in these events.</span> <span id="s423">And I don't even know how long the...the pogroms lasted, whether it was a day, whether it was 2 days.</span> <span id="s424">I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s425">I remember Bishop Katchmarick (ph) issuing a very strong appeal to people to uphold the law to protect the innocent, to...to report on...uh... commission of crimes to the authorities.</span> <span id="s426">Uh...Kielce to begin was...with was devastated by the war.</span> <span id="s427">There were ruins everywhere.</span> <span id="s428">There were buildings that were lying in ruins.</span> <span id="s429">There wasn't a family that was not mourning a death of a son or a father or a brother that was either killed or executed or deported to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:51:09 Uh...Every family practically was under such enormous, physical and...uh.</span> <span id="s431">.</span> <span id="s432">uh...hardship and...uh...emotional pressure that we were literally survivors in every sense of the word.</span> <span id="s433">All of us!</span> <span id="s434">And it was awfully tragic that victims started turning on...on other victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">And...uh...for some reason...uh...which I don't understand at all, it happened in my native town.</span> <span id="s436">(Pause) Kielce was trying to revive the pre-war community life.</span> <span id="s437">We were trying to catch up with our education.</span> <span id="s438">Some of us lost 2, 3, 4 years.</span> <span id="s439">We had kids graduating from high school who were 22 and 23 because during the war they had no opportunity to...to learn, to keep up with their education.</span> <span id="s440">We were, of course, survivors of a period in which every able bodied person, age 14 and up, had to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Otherwise, we would be shipped to Germany to forced labor camps or to work in factories of the German war machine.</span> <span id="s442">We were given rations of food so...uh...most of us went often hungry.</span> <span id="s443">We were decimated by disease.</span> <span id="s444">Typhus, typhoid fever was prevalent.</span> <span id="s445">My mother...uh...survived typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s446">Us kids did not get sick.</span> <span id="s447">Uh...We were...uh...terrorized by continuous...uh...dragnets.</span> <span id="s448">Wyponokie (ph) we call it in Poland.</span> <span id="s449">You walk on a street from your house to your aunt's house, and suddenly the street is closed by the gendarmes on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">01:54:04 And all the people are surrounded and asked to show their papers.</span> <span id="s451">Are you working somewhere?</span> <span id="s452">Who are you?</span> <span id="s453">What's your occupation?</span> <span id="s454">What are you doing now?</span> <span id="s455">And whoever appeared not employed in a meaningful way that involves supporting the German war effort was being singled up, put in a truck, shipped to the railroad station and put on a train and shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s456">There were hardly any families that did not feel the...the tragedy of war.</span> <span id="s457">(Pause) My own family....uh...we lost two uncles.</span> <span id="s458">Uh...one a pilot and another a..</span> <span id="s459">.</span> <span id="s460">uh...a military man who fought in the Warsaw uprising and died after the war because he was an invalid, wounded, persecuted by the communists in turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Kielce was physically and emotionally devastated after the war, and on top of that the system was imposed on us that was against all the values of the society and that was a very bitter to swallow to learn the outcome of the Yalta agreement.</span> <span id="s462">They were not easy times.</span> <span id="s463">It was only...the only ray of hope for my family personally...for my mother and my sister and myself was that unexpected out of the blue came a postcard from Chicago, USA, saying, "I am Mrs. Wjaworski (ph), and I am looking for a family of Ludwick Witkowski, and if so, please get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s464">It was not even from my father.</span> <span id="s465">So, of course, we were elated.</span> <span id="s466">All that time we were fantasying that he survived the war, that he was somewhere safely and thinking about us.</span> <span id="s467">And indeed he was.</span> <span id="s468">We wrote to this lady who was probably part of some organization that was trying to put families together that were separated by the war and we received the first letter.</span> <span id="s469">(Pause) It was good to see my</span></p> <p><span id="s470">father's handwriting.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">01:56:51 And he started sending packages and...uh...saying that he is in the United States, that he survived the September 39 campaign and was interned in Hungary, escaped from the internment camp to Yugoslavia, from Yugoslavia shipped to Marseilles, France; joined the Polish armed forces...uh...in time for the German attack on France; fought the Germans there; was capture; escaped German...uh...uh...captivity; walked at night through France until he got to southern France; crossed over the Pyrenees to Spain and to the Gibraltar; shipped from the Gibraltar to England; trained in military units in England; never gave up the fight; and was sent with the military mission to Windsor, Ontario, just south of Detroit to recruit volunteers for the Polish armed forces to continue the fight with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s472">That was, of course, before U.S. was attacked in Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s473">So there was volunteers signing up from the Polish-American communities, both in the U.S. and Canada.</span> <span id="s474">And...uh...uh...in the meantime, he met friends...made friends in Detroit and when the mission was disband after Pearl Harbor, he got an offer of a job in the war industry in Detroit and was permitted to migrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s475">Started immediate efforts to try to find out what happened to his wife and children.</span> <span id="s476">And finally by early 45, succeeded, found us, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: At this point, we need to stop.</span> <span id="s478">We're going...it's a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s479">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: We're going to stop and change tapes.</span> <span id="s481">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">01:59:04 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s484">0200:39</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s486">Can you tell us how you left Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: My father, of course, immediately started efforts to bring us over to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Unfortunately, the communist authorities, while giving permission to my mother to leave Poland officially, denied permission to children.</span> <span id="s489">Uh...We reasoned that this was because in those heady days with the communism they thought they could indoctrinate the young generation and...and use them and didn't want to lose them.</span> <span id="s490">A decision was then made that I would escape from Poland and if the road...route was successful, my sister would follow.</span> <span id="s491">So...uh...in the meantime I graduated from high school and made a successful escape from Poland to Sweden in the bottom of a coal freighter on December 31, 1948.</span> <span id="s492">And I was to be followed by my sister in a few months.</span> <span id="s493">I made it to a lovely, colorful, untouched by war, just fabulously looking town in Sweden called Goteborg.</span> <span id="s494">And from there I managed to...uh...to come to the United States within 3 days of my 21st birthday when my non-quota visa, immigrant visa was expiring.</span> <span id="s495">So I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s496">And, I met...I flew from New York LaGuardia Airport to Detroit Old Willowrun airport and looked up my father in the telephone directory and it's a very funny feeling to find your father's name in a strange directory in a strange city.</span> <span id="s497">And...uh...called his number.</span> <span id="s498">There was no answer and I stood at the counter not knowing what to do and I heard my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">02:03:01 He recognized me from the back.</span> <span id="s500">And I was a big strapping 6 footer at the age of 21.</span> <span id="s501">Uh...My mother came in May of that year, 85 officially.</span> <span id="s502">But my sister trying the same route...uh...did not make it, was caught by the communists and imprisoned and eventually came to the United States in 1958 when the conditions in Poland under Gemolka (ph) underwent a famous fall so they would permit families to reunite.</span> <span id="s503">Went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Decided to study law.</span> <span id="s505">Graduated in 56, and started a law practice with then my father-in- law in Polish-American community on the west side of Detroit.</span> <span id="s506">In 62, I was contacted by a Congressman of Polish descent, John Dingle, and asked if I know of any identifiable Polish-Americans who would like to work on a foreign claimants settlement commission in Washington to assist in administering a program of adjudication of claims for properties lost in Poland.</span> <span id="s507">And after looking around I decided that I'm the one (laughing) for other reasons as well.</span> <span id="s508">So I accepted an appointment as a staff attorney on a foreign claims settlement commission and worked on a Polish claims program for about 3 years.</span> <span id="s509">Within 6 months....no, I came in August of 62.</span> <span id="s510">By Spring of 63, I was being sent to our American Embassy in Warsaw to help run our field office to gather documentation to support claims of the American nationals for properties.</span> <span id="s511">A lot of those claims were by the American relatives or...uh...survivors of the Jewish population of Poland...uh...who were claiming properties that were confiscated or destroyed during the war or after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">And for 3 months in 1963, I traveled through Poland collecting documents...uh...seeking evidence because our function was not simply to sit as a tribunal and tell claims...show me, prove to me, but we were actively assisting them in this effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">02:06:14 And at that time I came in contact with a..</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">a..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">personnel of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, and obtained from them a number of valuable documents and...and publications, some of which I have turned over to you for the...uh...Museum.</span> <span id="s518">And it is that period of time that kind of gave me a broader perspective on the enormity of what happened between 1939 and 1945.</span> <span id="s519">Only then when traveling to little towns and villages of Poland, I was able to see the devastation, the...the tremendous...the tremendous losses that were inflicted on the population, especially the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s520">pause</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Do you hear personal testimony as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s523">Testimony was, in most cases, limited to description of property, possessions, but in many situations the survivors of those years...uh...who came to the commission offices here in Washington testified as to their...uh.</span> <span id="s524">.</span> <span id="s525">experiences during the Nazi's occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">And I'm sure the records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the so-called Polish Program have that testimony and they're probably in the U.S. Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: How did you...you first.</span> <span id="s528">How did you handle all of this?</span> <span id="s529">How did you feel when you...your seeing these people and dealing with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: First, I wanted to do a good job.</span> <span id="s531">First, I wanted justice done.</span> <span id="s532">I did want to make sure that if there is any doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the survivors.</span> <span id="s533">There were other families.</span> <span id="s534">We were, after all, involved in a rather futile attempt to at least compensate materially for the...the enormity of evil that happened to these families, both Jewish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">02:09:07 Unfortunately, under American law, we had the obstacles, such as citizenship at the time of loss.</span> <span id="s536">And many, many people did not meet the requirement of U.S. citizenship by the time of loss occurred.</span> <span id="s537">We could not grant compensation award reparations to peoples who were not American nationals or citizens at the time the loss occurred.</span> <span id="s538">I remember distinctly one decision which I, myself, was very pleased about...uh...because we applied a legal principal that permitted granting reparations to a much greater number of people rather than if we simply applied the official date of confiscation of the...of the property...uh...by the communists regime.</span> <span id="s539">We used the concept of loss of use and enjoyment.</span> <span id="s540">Very often, communists in their profidious manipulation of the records and...and the law would leave the title and people, but would so restrict the rights of the owners or the ...uh...benefits that owners would derive from ownership of the property that for all intents and purposes, these people had all the burdens without any benefits.</span> <span id="s541">A rental property for instance.</span> <span id="s542">So we then developed the concept that it was the loss of use and enjoyment of the property rather than the passage of title to the state that determined when people lost their possessions.</span> <span id="s543">And that's how we were able to...to award compensation to people who otherwise would not have gotten it.</span> <span id="s544">On a deeper level (Pause) ....Dr. Kuzmack, it's very hard to think of those times without projecting on those times, what I feel today.</span> <span id="s545">We all evolve and we all become much more sensitized and much more aware of...uh...the measure of tragedy than at the time that we are involved in the mechanics or addressing this or that narrow issue.</span> <span id="s546">I cannot really tell how I felt about it because honestly the same goes for my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">02:12:07 Today, I think I'm a much more aware person.</span> <span id="s548">I'm much more in touch with my emotions than at that time.</span> <span id="s549">That's an honest answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I felt a regret at times and I have tried to put it to rest because it was a naive regret that had I been older maybe I would have been able to do more when I saw inhumanity and evil of those years.</span> <span id="s552">At the same time, I'm...I'm honest enough to admit that it's a..</span> <span id="s553">.</span> <span id="s554">it's a hope tinged with fear because I wonder how many of us would have lived up the ideal of really disregarding our own safety and our own obligation to our loved ones to help a fellow man.</span> <span id="s555">How many of us would really live up to this principle when tested?</span> <span id="s556">I think there is a awareness in Poland today which I sense from letters from relatives and friends and visits from friends and relatives...uh...what...what a great loss Poland suffered because of the extermination of its Jewish population.</span> <span id="s557">As a child, as a youngster, I read...uh.</span> <span id="s558">.</span> <span id="s559">some of the greatest poets and writers of Poland who were Jews, Julian Tooly (ph) and...and so many others.</span> <span id="s560">Uh...Poland is impoverished.</span> <span id="s561">To what extent it could have been prevented or its...its enormity limited, who's to judge?</span> <span id="s562">I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters, that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being, we do it to ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Thank you.</span></p>
