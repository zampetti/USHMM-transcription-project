He was just a simple man doing a simple good, and thereby making himself remarkable.</span> <span id="s22">Hannah Arendts's equation that "Banal + banal + banal = Remarkable."</span> <span id="s23">is applicable and in evidence here.</span> <span id="s24">As a Christian, I could identify with the part Mr. Von Lochen played during this historical interlude, for if I would have lived then I can only hope that I would have the necessary courage to act in this</span></p> <p><span id="s25">example.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">* Also , please note that I transcribed the tape as he spoke, so the sentences are reflective of the fact that he is not a native</span></p> <p><span id="s27">English speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">TEXT</span></p> <p><span id="s29">----</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q- Mr. Von Lochen, we would like a full account of what your rescue</span></p> <p><span id="s31">was, please.</span> <span id="s32">.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A- It has been 45 years since...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q- You know, I'm writing a book for children.</span> <span id="s35">I think its important.</span> <span id="s36">You would be surprised at the number of books coming out now on the Holocaust for children.</span> <span id="s37">What do you think they should</span></p> <p><span id="s38">know?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A- It is important for them to know what happened during the last war.</span> <span id="s40">People have to know this.</span> <span id="s41">The killing, the numbers...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q- By knowing, do you think it won't happen again?</span> <span id="s43">It could</span></p> <p><span id="s44">prevent...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A- That is hard to say.</span> <span id="s46">It would be hard to hate a people.</span> <span id="s47">Now we know the signs of hate to look for.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q- It is important for the children to know that people like you did try and help.</span> <span id="s49">While so much evil was going on, there were some good people living at the same time.</span> <span id="s50">I often ask rescuers what would you like your children to know about the time?</span> <span id="s51">Do you have</span></p> <p><span id="s52">any grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A- Yes, they are still too young.</span> <span id="s54">I have told my own as much as I</span></p> <p><span id="s55">can.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q- Were they interested growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A- Yeah, read books in English.</span></p> <p><span

And can't they read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A- No, I went however, on a trip to Washington to talk about it with the government of the U.S. Also speak often with a man you might be contacting... a Mr. Young (ph).</span> <span id="s63">Ask if he lived in Berlin at the time of the war.</span> <span id="s64">You went to visit him?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q- I don't think that I had an appointment with him.</span> <span id="s66">I don't think</span></p> <p><span id="s67">that he responded.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A- This lady come here.</span> <span id="s69">We had a

<span id="s101">She'd help with what she could do...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">food.</span> <span id="s103">Then we'd have chickens stolen out of our coop.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q- Was

you did heroic things during the war, did you ever do anything remarkable?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A- The times had changed.</span> <span id="s120">My later life was much different.</span> <span id="s121">Cars...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">electricity... I still remember none of it.</span> <span id="s123">There was not much going on living in the country school.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q- So, when war started to break out and the Germans came, you were still living at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A- No, I was in 1936 training in the army, a draft.</span> <span id="s126">Three years later was the 1939 mobilization and I was called up.</span> <span id="s127">Then the Germans came I was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q- And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A- May 10, 1940.</span> <span id="s130">There were always some promises by Hitler... "we don't invade Holland."</span> <span id="s131">But ha!</span> <span id="s132">He did... it was mixed up reasoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">They came to the capitol.</span> <span id="s134">The first days they shot at us and we shoot back.</span> <span id="s135">I was in the Red Cross, but wanted to be in the infantry.</span> <span id="s136">The sky was read and burning.</span> <span id="s137">Bad days.</span> <span id="s138">Live and wake up without sleep.</span> <span id="s139">There was so much going on.</span> <span id="s140">You must watch it.</span> <span id="s141">Close to the hate.</span> <span id="s142">Diplomats, consuls form France, came and told us to go to another airport base, "Shusterberg" and if we have work we can go home.</span> <span id="s143">Some friends help me to get a permit so I can prove I can work, and I get out and go home.</span> <span id="s144">So, that first year Jewish people always in fear about what happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">There were some Jewish people in the army.</span> <span id="s146">I see their faces, they know what was coming.</span> <span id="s147">They know.</span> <span id="s148">I don't know if they died or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">They lost so many.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q- During this time you came home and worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A- Yes, During the first year you had to watch yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q- But you were in no danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A- No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q- Only the Jews were in danger.</span> <span id="s155">.</span> <span id="s156">?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A- The first year the Jews had the thing called the David Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">David Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q- Did you know anyone personally... any friends were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A- You know them, not friends though.</span> <span id="s161">See then in the store, on farms.</span> <span id="s162">They have businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">05:87</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q- How did you get started?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A- In 1941, 1942, Jewish people had to go and hide.</span> <span id="s166">There was a family Rosembaum.</span> <span id="s167">In July 1942, my mother picked up the lady at night.</span> <span id="s168">They walk about 4km.</span> <span id="s169">to our place.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q- So your mom went to get them?</span> <span id="s171">Someone from the underground came to your mother.</span> <span id="s172">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A- No, I don't know exactly how it happened.</span> <span id="s174">Trough friends...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">close to underground.</span> <span id="s176">Another couple had promised to help but then they were too scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q- I see, so then your mother took them to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A- The lady was the same age as Mother.</span> <span id="s179">She is still living today.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">They walked that night some.</span> <span id="s181">She hide herself.</span> <span id="s182">No one else know at first.</span> <span id="s183">You had to be careful.</span> <span id="s184">There were food rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q- So the people in the grocery store knew that you were hiding</span></p> <p><span id="s186">someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A- Yes, as there was Father, Mother, and me.</span> <span id="s188">But we had food ration tickets.</span> <span id="s189">If you have more than appropriate they ask how you get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">They know but say nothing.</span> <span id="s191">Unexpectedly, a little boy found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">He walked in and saw a lady down there (in the basement).</span> <span id="s193">Says, "I have never seen that lady before", and Father was quite nervous about that.</span> <span id="s194">It was the boy of the grocery store.</span> <span id="s195">We had to tell him to shut his mouth and he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q- So now you have just the one family?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A- No, just the lady, Mrs. Rosembaum.</span> <span id="s198">Next month she'll be 97...</span></p> <p><span id="s199">still in good health... in an old age home in Holland.</span> <span id="s200">I still have</span></p> <p><span id="s201">pictures of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q- So who came next?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A- A year later her son.</span> <span id="s204">A TB patient, yet healthy.</span> <span id="s205">He had been allowed for a while by his doctor to stay in the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s206">Then all of a sudden they had to get out.</span> <span id="s207">We picked him up that night and brought him to our place, to his mother.</span> <span id="s208">He stayed for a couple of days and then found another place for him to go.</span> <span id="s209">But not that far.</span> <span id="s210">He was a livestock dealer too.</span> <span id="s211">And he knew a lot of farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">He stayed then on a farm where the farmer put him to work in the</span></p> <p><span id="s213">field.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q- Did your mother know Mrs. Rosenbaum before?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A- Not really.</span> <span id="s216">There was a mailman, and he was her neighbor and he knew all about what was going on.</span> <span id="s217">But he was tight.</span> <span id="s218">He'd bring her letters.</span> <span id="s219">It was nearly the last year... Mrs. Rosenbaum had another son, Max, he's passed away now too.</span> <span id="s220">It wasn't safe where he was hiding.</span> <span id="s221">Sometimes he came in, one or two times, to see his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">And then it wasn't safe, so he came along too.</span> <span id="s223">And then there was another boy.</span> <span id="s224">I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s225">So for not quite a year there were three.</span> <span id="s226">Not much room.</span> <span id="s227">Eventually we had five.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q- Did they have to hide and stay inside all day?</span> <span id="s229">0889</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A- Yes, it was the last two weeks that were the worst.</span> <span id="s231">The last months before the war was over in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q- And so what would they do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A- The last two weeks we had Germans in the house.</span> <span id="s234">German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">She say no, but they move in anyway.</span> <span id="s236">They had the whole front house they took over.</span> <span id="s237">And the Jewish people, they slept in the barn and upstairs in hiding places in straw.</span> <span id="s238">The house was insulated without straw.</span> <span id="s239">There was no special heating.</span> <span id="s240">They had to lie in these spaces created between the straw and the ceilings for nearly two weeks on their back.</span> <span id="s241">The Germans had the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q- So Mrs Rosenbaum did that too?</span> <span id="s243">Hid in the straw...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A- Yes, it was nice and warm there though.</span> <span id="s245">Hade electric blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Safe there.</span> <span id="s247">One day I see this boy sitting down there in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s248">There were good German soldiers too.</span> <span id="s249">I saw one who had tears in his eyes and said how he wanted to go home to his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q- Oh yes, some of them were young boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A- One night they got so drunk and came up not as early as usual,</span></p> <p><span id="s252">about 7 A.M. Before Germans came up, Mrs. Rosenbaum wanted to use the toilet.</span> <span id="s253">She had to come downstairs without a miserable German not to see her.</span> <span id="s254">That morning we heard planes.</span> <span id="s255">The Germans wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Mother had to get Mrs. Rosenbaum out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q- So this is really kind of your mother's idea?</span> <span id="s258">She started this</span></p> <p><span id="s259">... to rescue?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">10:32</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A- No, in agreement with my father too.</span> <span id="s262">I was a single man at this time.</span> <span id="s263">Lived at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q- So you wanted to help your parents do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A- Well, I lived at home and we wanted to help each other.</span> <span id="s266">We tried to make fun too... to escape from all this...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q- It must have felt good, though, doing this with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A- Oh yeah, I had brothers and sisters too, and at first Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Rosenbaum said nobody else in the family has to know.</span> <span id="s270">Father and Mother said we cannot do that.</span> <span id="s271">All must know.</span> <span id="s272">The brothers and sisters... everybody in the whole family had to know.</span> <span id="s273">It was interesting how my sister would cook for visitors and sneak food for the Jewish people so as not to destroy the hiding place.</span> <span id="s274">The last year and a half were critical.</span> <span id="s275">At anytime the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q- Were you afraid a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A- It could cost us our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q- Did you know other people who hid Jews and so were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A- Oh Yes.</span> <span id="s280">Good friends of my father and mother were killed.</span> <span id="s281">And another family, all living there would walk along their country.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">road and one day they picked up the boy and girl living there and the man and put him in a concentration camp in the south of Holland.</span> <span id="s283">He spent 7 months and came out alright as he lied and say he didn't know they were Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q- You mean he claimed that he didn't know those children were</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A- Yeah, but yes he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q- But you think that's why he lived and they didn't kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A- Yes.</span> <span id="s289">Mrs. Rosenbaum had three stepsons and she was married to Rosenbaum as his second wife.</span> <span id="s290">Before the war had lived in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">As German Jews they came and took the Dutch nationality.</span> <span id="s292">The two boys were livestock dealers.</span> <span id="s293">The TB patient, and the other was Max.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Walter was the name of the first.</span> <span id="s295">His wife, her family, and all died in the camp.</span> <span id="s296">Had no children yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q- What about Mr. Rosenbaum?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A- Mrs. Rosenbaum, her husband, had passed away in 1936 before the war.</span> <span id="s299">He is buried in Germany.</span> <span id="s300">Was never in Holland.</span> <span id="s301">The boys had moved to Holland with their mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q- How does this seem to you... the war years?</span> <span id="s303">Does it seem a</span></p> <p><span id="s304">horrible time?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A- A- Well, we knew what was going on in Germany already, how they hate the Jews, and about what they want to do.</span> <span id="s306">Some say a hoax that</span></p> <p><span id="s307">6 million dead...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">12:22</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q- But for you, Mr. Von Lochen, when you think back on the war years, when you were hiding these Jews with your family, what kind of a time does this seem like?</span> <span id="s310">A good time?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A- Good and bad times.</span> <span id="s312">You had to watch it.</span> <span id="s313">Lock the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q- Did your wife suspect what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A- No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q- A lot of people would walk in the farm house.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q- Sometimes I've spoken to some rescuers who said after the war there was no other way to help.</span> <span id="s318">At least during the war you felt like you were doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A- The war was over.</span> <span id="s320">Free.</span> <span id="s321">The boys go to town and all ask them where they had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q- How did your neighbors feel about the fact that you had hid them</span></p> <p><span id="s323">during the war.</span> <span id="s324">?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">12:79</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A- Some thought that it was alright.</span> <span id="s327">Others never suspected it.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q- Of course if this were in Poland, the neighbors would have been angry at you for saving Jews as the Poles were also anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">But in Holland, they must have respected you for doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A- Some not, but not many.</span> <span id="s331">One day, someone came over and we had to hide Mrs. Rosenbaum in the rye.It was the time when the grain was high, and we kept this household inspector chatting over coffee when Mother went to hide Mrs. Rosenbaum in the rye where it would be safe.</span> <span id="s332">So he looked everywhere, the ], and the closets... but he</span></p> <p><span id="s333">couldn't find her...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q- Your mother must have been something...</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A- My parents were sometimes...</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q- Remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A- Well, if one needs a place, and there is not other place to go, you take in a fourth or a fifth one.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q- You were honored for what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A- Yeah, in Washington.</span></p> <p><span
