id="s12">September 6, 1991</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Let me just do a couple of housekeeping things Rae, and and start with uh if you would state your name, both your name today and your name then, in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: OK.</span> <span id="s15">Uh I'm Rachel Goldfarb.</span> <span id="s16">I was born Rachel Mutterperl, and most of my friends and my family call Rae.</span> <span id="s17">I've been known as Rae most of the time since coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s19">And and in Poland you were known as Rachel?</span> <span id="s20">A: Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s22">Uh you were born where?</span> <span id="s23">A: In a small town called Dokczyce.</span> <span id="s24">Q: And where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: It is eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s26">Uh at the time it was about four kilometers from the Russian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Now it's part of Russia, or Belaruse as it is known.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s29">And where...when were you born?</span> <span id="s30">A: Uh December 2nd, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s32">Let me ask you, Rae, first of all uh tell me what life was life before the occupation for...what was life like for you in your...your village as a little girl and what do you remember of life then?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, life was pretty good.</span> <span id="s34">Uh both my parents had businesses.</span> <span id="s35">Q: What kind of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My mother had a yard goods store and my father was involved in several businesses.</span> <span id="s37">He uh supplied meat to the Russian...to the Polish garrison at the Russian border.</span> <span id="s38">Uh I remember he also did some exporting of uh flax and uh oil, uh meat, and apples.</span> <span id="s39">I remember particularly the apples because he used to rent orchards and would sometimes take me to...when he went to oversee the orchards, take me along and uh one of the impressionable things that I remember is seeing the Russians play their harmonicas and uh dance in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: How...how did the Russians treat the Jews of your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Well, they weren't weren't really Russians.</span> <span id="s42">Uh they were the what they call the White Russians, the Belaruskis.</span> <span id="s43">Uh but my family had a pretty good relationship with them being in business.</span> <span id="s44">Uh we had help in the house that were gentiles.</span> <span id="s45">Uh my brother's governess was a gentile woman.</span> <span id="s46">I had a Jewish girl as my governess.</span> <span id="s47">Uh there were laundresses that were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s48">I remember there were several help in the house.</span> <span id="s49">So uh the relationship that my parents had with the community gentiles may have been a little bit different and maybe I had a different impression of it all.</span> <span id="s50">Uh I remember visiting with some of their acquaintances in the villages, surrounding villages, and uh I remember some good times like horseback riding and playing with their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: So life was was pretty good?</span> <span id="s52">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And you had a large Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Uh for a small town, it was a pretty good sized Jewish community.</span> <span id="s55">Uh I remember it as being about twenty-five hundred Jewish people in the town.</span> <span id="s56">Uh I don't know...some of the things I've read about a town, there were anywhere between four thousand...between twenty-five hundred and four thousand Jews in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did life revolve around uh Jewish observances and Jewish holidays for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s59">Very much so.</span> <span id="s60">Uh I think the whole Jewish community was steeped in Judaism.</span> <span id="s61">The holidays were of big importance.</span> <span id="s62">Uh family gatherings, the shabbat...especially in our family.</span> <span id="s63">Friday noon started shabbat.</span> <span id="s64">Preparations were ready.</span> <span id="s65">The table was laid and the candlesticks were on the table and the hallahs were placed near the candlesticks and there was always Friday night dinner and uh shabbat, of course, no cooking was done and uh families gathered.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So you had a very tight-knit Jewish community in your town?</span> <span id="s67">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Were you aware then as a young child and when life was still good, were you aware of any hint of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I really can't recall any of it.</span> <span id="s70">If there was some, I guess either I was sheltered from it or just as any other child involved in her own things.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: You had a close relationship, as you said, with some of the the maids that worked in your house or one maid in particular...</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes...yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: ...who was Catholic?</span> <span id="s74">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: I understand that uh that she had taken you to a Catholic church at one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s77">I knew all the rituals.</span> <span id="s78">She used to...actually my parents from what my mother tells me, uh had forbidden her to take us to church, but she wanted to go to church and uh, you know, in order to uh fulfill her own duties of taking care of us and my brother and I, actually different girl but uh they would steal off to church and take us with with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">And I learned the ritual and it probably helped saved my life eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: How how do you mean helped save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Well, when you go to church and you observe and you know, a child does what everybody else does, so it came naturally to kneel and to cross yourself if if necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: You found that you used those later on when you were fighting for survival?</span> <span id="s83">A: Uh one particular time, one particular time specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Can you tell me about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh that was almost toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s86">Uh we were caught by the Germans and uh brought to our own hometown and uh after we were all housed in some barns with no food and children went out to to try to scrounge food and so did I and one of the priests had given the children food including me and uh everybody knelt and thanked him and did the normal observances, and I knew how do to them properly too.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Uh let me ask you a little bit more about your family life in Poland before the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Uh tell me a little bit about your father.</span> <span id="s89">I understand he was very active in the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Uh he was active in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s91">He was also uh very helpful to some of his uh gentile friends.</span> <span id="s92">Uh whenever they were in need of money to help them through a period, he did buy from them and uh I guess he must have advanced them money.</span> <span id="s93">It...it stood us well in in our escaping from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s94">It probably also cost my brother's life.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Well, my brother was uh left with a family to uh hide him and we are not sure exactly what transpired but uh he was turned over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s97">The story we got is that uh this particular gentleman's mother-in-law was mad at him and uh told the Germans that he was hiding a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s98">Whether that was the exact story or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s99">But uh, you know, we remembered the good things much quicker than the bad ones, and along the way when we escaped from our ghetto to another ghetto, uh we were helped by gentile friends of my father's.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Uh how old...how old was your brother's name?</span> <span id="s101">A: My brother's name was Shlomo.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: How old was Shlomo when he was killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Uh three years younger than I, so in 1942 I guess he was about eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did your family ever find out any of the facts or any of the rumors or or any information involving him being turned over?</span> <span id="s105">Did he go to a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s106">Did you ever find out what actually happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s108">None of the people in our hometown went to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s109">In uh our part of Poland uh there were no concentration camps.</span> <span id="s110">There was no industry.</span> <span id="s111">There was no need for labor and uh what they basically did is they gathered the Jews and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">They eliminated everybody by the bullet and sometimes they'll...some horror stories were they left bodies on top of live people and they just suffocated.</span> <span id="s113">Uh they also...a few people that I know that had managed to crawl out from under these dead bodies at night and get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So the the Nazis would do a round-up?</span> <span id="s115">A: Do a round-up and uh shoot the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Did your family find out what happened to the family who who sheltered your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Uh my mother went back after the war but uh (sigh) it's difficult to get the story straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">My brother's governess did go into town immediately uh to find out what happened to him and the only thing she would tell my mother when she came back is that she was sure he was shot.</span> <span id="s119">When we escaped from the ghetto and uh on the way, we stopped at at her house and uh she hid us...I don't remember for how long, whether it was hours or overnight and she went into town to find out what happened to him and uh she told it was not safe for her to keep us because everybody had...knew the connection and she had just come from town inquiring about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: I know that you were a small child at that time.</span> <span id="s121">You must have some impressions of what it was like.</span> <span id="s122">Uh how do you think that your mother was able to hear this and still go on in her own fight for survival for herself and for you and for the family?</span> <span id="s123">How...how did...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Uh I know from...from my own feelings, the the desire to live and to protect someone is great and I think at that point it was a matter of protecting me and getting me through it that kept her going.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did it sharpen the will to live, knowing that that death could be so imminent?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I think the will to live is something that does not need to be sharpened.</span> <span id="s127">I think it's there all the time and uh I think what happens is is they...the closer one feels that upon one's self, the the stronger the fight is.</span> <span id="s128">I've watched friends that had cancer and passed away and their will to live was so strong that uh one does not believe that death is around the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: How did it affect you and your own struggle as a little girl at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I don't even know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s131">How it affected me?</span> <span id="s132">You just do the next thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So do you think that...of course, looking back because it would be hard to recall exactly what happened, but do you think that you you had to distance yourself or tuck it away in a part of your mind until you could deal with it and and just take the next step?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I don't even think one thinks.</span> <span id="s135">I think or at least I felt that uh when danger is there you try to to stay...stay alive, stay out of it.</span> <span id="s136">I know one particular circumstance where I lost my mother, got separated in the forest.</span> <span id="s137">Didn't know where I was, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s138">All I could hear was the Germans calling and shooting, and at that point...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Calling and shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Calling.</span> <span id="s141">Uh they knew people were around there.</span> <span id="s142">We were in the partisans at that time already and they were calling out give yourself up and you will survive, and, of course, spraying bullets over the the area, and I remember going out to the clearing.</span> <span id="s143">I forget...it's better to get shot than be lost in the forest, and going out to the area and watching the bullets hit the dirt in front of me.</span> <span id="s144">It sort of makes a little puff when it hits the dirt.</span> <span id="s145">Then I heard my mother calling me.</span> <span id="s146">It didn't take me (laughter) a split second to turn away and run, and that I remember very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: When you thought about that decision, uh being lost and alone in the forest or giving yourself up to be shot...</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, not giving myself up.</span> <span id="s149">Sooner be shot than give myself up.</span> <span id="s150">Q: So you were going to willingly walk into...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Into a bullet...yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And...and why?</span> <span id="s153">Why...</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Uh you have to understand that at that point we were very much aware of what Germans did to Jews and even though at that point there were no Jews alive that we knew of in any of the surrounding towns, knowing that I'm Jewish and knowing what awaited me, don't you think it's easier to take a bullet at random than to have somebody point a gun between your eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Your family...you had a father and mother and a brother before the occupation and uh... A: There were uncles and aunts and grandparents...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: An extended family....</span> <span id="s157">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Let me go back chronologically a little bit in time and talk about how there became an awareness in your community and in your family that the occupation was coming.</span> <span id="s159">Not everybody believed it, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Uh you mean the German occupation?</span> <span id="s161">Well, once uh the Germans started to fight the Poles, once they declared war on Poland, we knew that the Germans would be coming.</span> <span id="s162">Uh you must understand that we were already occupied by the Russian forces.</span> <span id="s163">Poland was divided and it wasn't a matter of, you know, will they come.</span> <span id="s164">It was a question of when they will come, how quickly they will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did your community...the Jews in your community...you talked about toward the end knowing at that point what they did to Jews, but in the beginning you didn't really know?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Stories filtered down.</span> <span id="s167">Uh stories filtered down about the fact that uh the Jews in Germany were being taken out of their homes.</span> <span id="s168">Uh Jews from Poland had run away uh because the Germans were coming in and occupying.</span> <span id="s169">Uh some of them who came returned back because the conditions under the Russians were so bad too.</span> <span id="s170">Uh my family especially since we were called bourgeois (ph), rich Jews or rich people period, uh we were packed and waiting to be taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s171">That's what they did with with the rich people, uh resettling them.</span> <span id="s172">Probably would have been a blessing in disguise.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So you were a community knowing that your fate lay either in the hands of the Germans or the Russians, and at that point, did...was there an awareness of what would be better or what would be worse, what your...?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: There was an awareness of oppression under the Germans, but I don't think anybody uh thought of being just shot to death, being eliminated or wiped off the face of the earth.</span> <span id="s175">I don't think...as a child, of course, I didn't think about it, but I don't think the general community was prepared for the type of holocaust that that happened and remember something else...all that did not start until a little later.</span> <span id="s176">The concentration camps...I mean we had no knowledge of concentration camps at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: But there was a ghettoization (ph) process?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Ghettoization process was not immediately.</span> <span id="s179">That was oh several months later.</span> <span id="s180">Uh the Germans came in in I think July and I know it was summer.</span> <span id="s181">And the ghetto was not organizing...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What year do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No.</span> <span id="s184">That was 1941, and the ghetto did not get established until the wintertime, so there were several months, maybe not...six months maybe, five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: In the time between the time the Germans came in and occupied and the actual ghettoization, what was the transformation that took place in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Well, everybody became aware of the fact that the Jews were not treated well.</span> <span id="s187">Uh there were incidents of beatings.</span> <span id="s188">Uh the next thing was the edict to wear the the yellow star.</span> <span id="s189">No Jew was to uh venture out without the yellow star.</span> <span id="s190">If you were caught, they would get beaten.</span> <span id="s191">I don't recall but I think there were even a few instances where people were shot, Jewish people were shot.</span> <span id="s192">One of the things that stands out in my mind is uh Russian prisoners of war that were driven through the town and they were in just terrible condition, uh without shoes, without proper clothing, hungry, looking dilapidated and drawn and went begging, of course, for food and water and if somebody attempted to give them...or couldn't hand it to them, throw toward them, uh anything, any food and if they caught it or even if they didn't, the Germans beat them and even shot several people if they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food, they shot them, and that was I think the first awareness of the brutality of those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Was there a systematic attempt to set apart and segregate and identify the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Uh yes.</span> <span id="s195">If a Jew had to wear the yellow star, he was set aside...he was set apart from the community.</span> <span id="s196">He was pointed to.</span> <span id="s197">To me it means being pointed to someone, there is a Jew.</span> <span id="s198">Uh probably there must have been an accounting.</span> <span id="s199">Uh I recall quite early where some of the...of our possessions were taken, uh valuables.</span> <span id="s200">The Germans uh had...I guess there was some sort of an organization that was uh formed from the Jews or appointed as a leader of the Jews and the the intermediary between the German command and the Jewish community where the Jewish community was taxed because I remember having to give up some valuables to help with the war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So the Jewish community was organized as a community and in that way was uh there was a liaison to the Germans.</span> <span id="s202">Is that how it worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No.</span> <span id="s204">The Jewish community was always organized.</span> <span id="s205">The Jewish community has always had its own organization where if help was needed uh even to the point of sort of like a banking system, gmiluth chesed, where if someone uh found themself in dire need and needed money to to tide him over, he could go to the Jewish community and get some of it.</span> <span id="s206">Uh that establishment had existed and uh I don't recall whether the same person was head of the Jewish community when the Germans came in or whether somebody else was appointed, but there was a liaison.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Do you remember when the edict went out that all Jews had to wear stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I don't remember exactly when but within a short period afterwards, maybe within a month or six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Do you remember what it was like wearing the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Very much, because that was my first feeling of uh being singled out and pointed to.</span> <span id="s211">All of a sudden I was less, you know...living in a family that was quite comfortably uh situated financially and uh feeling...being the upper crust to becoming the the lower crust.</span> <span id="s212">All of a sudden wearing the Jewish star made me less of a..</span> <span id="s213">.</span> <span id="s214">of an important person than I was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did your fellow villagers react in that manner to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Uh yes.</span> <span id="s217">Remember it it wasn't really that small a village.</span> <span id="s218">There were probably about nine thousand, ten thousand inhabitants total, so if there were one-third of them Jewish, two thirds were not and in a community like that, of course, there are all kinds.</span> <span id="s219">I remember very much being spit at.</span> <span id="s220">I remember having to get off the sidewalk when I walked on the sidewalk and a non-Jew was approaching.</span> <span id="s221">Part of the the prescribed new behavior was that one had to accommodate the non-Jewish person.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: So before this process, you didn't feel anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Not as such because being within the family and the school, uh you know, if I ventured out into the non-Jewish community, it was normally my parents' acquaintances.</span> <span id="s224">Uh with my parents having businesses and especially my mother had probably the largest yard goods store in the area, there were always non-Jewish people coming and going and the store was uh in front of the house.</span> <span id="s225">It was sort of connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And now things were very different, now that you were set apart and identified as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Uh it started actually when the Russians came in, because all of a sudden we were identified as bourgeois.</span> <span id="s228">The store was closed.</span> <span id="s229">Our circumstances were quite different, so it was sort of a degrading of circumstances starting with the Russian occupation, and that proceeded into the German occupation, the conditions constantly getting worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Let me ask about some of the religious and cultural observances that were common in your town and how you kept them under the occupation.</span> <span id="s231">Now your father was a Zionist, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And how did he practice or promote that Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: I know that I was taught Hebrew at an early age.</span> <span id="s235">I know I spoke fluent Hebrew and remembered enough of it that after liberation, uh I met up with Isra...actually when we came across the border into Italy, we met the Hebrew brigade and uh I had no difficulty communicating.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Were any other ways in which your father observed Zionist teachings and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, I think probably he always contributed to the Jewish community and uh to Israel.</span> <span id="s238">I remember the the little box, tzedoka, the discussions about Israel in the house.</span> <span id="s239">Uh some cousins had uh gone to what was called a kibbutz, preparing to go to Israel, uh kind of getting training, mostly agricultural training and living in communities.</span> <span id="s240">Uh I remember the hallutz (ph) movement, patriotic songs, uh learning about some of the the heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And there were also Jewish Socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I'm sure there were.</span> <span id="s243">I know that I had a cousin who had uh gone to Russia uh in the revolutionary period.</span> <span id="s244">We never heard from him.</span> <span id="s245">All I did was see pictures of him.</span> <span id="s246">I never actually knew him, but that was my uh father's sister's son.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Was it hard to maintain Jewish observances after the Germans came and how did you do that specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Uh much of it...the synagogues ceased to exist as they did before.</span> <span id="s249">Uh much of it was in the house.</span> <span id="s250">I remember a seder.</span> <span id="s251">I also remember wall to wall beds and that the table was set up and everybody sat on the beds, because that was in the ghetto, probably the the last seder in ghetto.</span> <span id="s252">And uh I remember that it was conducted.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: What do you remember about that seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Probably for the first time in my life, I observed the baking of the matzoh and it was done at night in hiding.</span> <span id="s255">You know, couldn't remember before now that...you kind of jogged my memory to it.</span> <span id="s256">I remember the baking of the matzoh at one of the houses where they uh...the baking was set up and I remember everything being blacked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Now you were in hiding at this time?</span> <span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">That was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I'm talking about during the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: You had to hide the fact that you were observing passover?</span> <span id="s263">A: The fact...yes, that matzoh was being baked for passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So it had been...the the observance of Jewish holidays had been outlawed at that point?</span> <span id="s265">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s266">I don't know why else it had to be done at night and in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And shabbot?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Shabbot was a a normal observance.</span> <span id="s269">Nobody worked on shabbot.</span> <span id="s270">If any Jew worked on shabbot, he was looked down upon and pointed to by the rest of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Were you allowed to observe shabbot or was that also something that had to be done in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s273">I am sure that the Germans took all the people to work.</span> <span id="s274">Uh a certain segment of the population from the ghetto was taken to work either cleaning or doing whatever the Germans needed done...laundry or uh some of them were shoemakers or uh tailors.</span> <span id="s275">Those fared a little better because they were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Going back to that passover seder for a minute, uh do you remember what it meant to you as a child observing how life had changed from one passover to the other?</span> <span id="s277">How it...what did it mean to you that that Jews were gathered, not enough to eat, in a crowded situation and and trying to maintain that that observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I'm not quite sure, I'll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s279">I just...you know, it's a memory of what the seder was like, a memory of the fact that uh you were not with just family.</span> <span id="s280">Actually not with family, only the people that lived in the house.</span> <span id="s281">Some were family, some not.</span> <span id="s282">Uh it was more what I remember is the fact that it was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Would you...do you think that it had special meaning then or only when you look back on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I think at this point only when I look back at it.</span> <span id="s285">It was...it was so long ago I don't really remember what my feelings were.</span> <span id="s286">Just the fact that they were strange.</span> <span id="s287">It wasn't the way it used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What else did you remember how long a period of time, from the beginning of the ghettoization to to that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Uh the ghetto started in the wintertime and it was summer.</span> <span id="s290">I know it was after Shavuot and it was around May that the ghetto was liquidated, so I would say probably six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s292">So this was a process that took six months.</span> <span id="s293">What happened in that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">How was twenty-five thousand people or three thousand people...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Twenty-five hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Twenty-five hundred...excuse me...liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, you...we had certain small groups that were shot.</span> <span id="s298">Uh I remember stories that uh people were made to dig their own graves.</span> <span id="s299">Uh in front of the cemetery, there was a big pit...I guess a sand pit.</span> <span id="s300">I just remember there was a pit and from what I heard that is where the majority of the people were shot.</span> <span id="s301">Uh I know...I remember hearing that some of the people...uh Jews had to to throw dirt or sand or whatever over the bodies.</span> <span id="s302">Uh those people had been at the edge of that pit and had come back.</span> <span id="s303">Uh there were small groups that were killed and then there were what they called uh reducing the numbers, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: What did that...what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: They had taken away the the the uh the less able and uh the smallest and uh shot them.</span> <span id="s306">It sort of was a a process that they went through by eliminating people and making the ghetto smaller, easier to control.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: How were Jews identified in the various phases to be executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I think it was who was available, who they could get hold of and uh normally the strongest ones were the ones that survived because they could use them.</span> <span id="s309">The Germans uh needed some people to do their chores and kept up...kept out the the most able.</span> <span id="s310">Uh every time that the people in the ghetto became aware that uh there was going to be some uh some cleaning out, that they were going to to take some of the people away, whoever could hid and if one was in hiding, if they didn't find them, managed to survive.</span> <span id="s311">Actually we survived because we were in hiding...hiding uh at the time when the final phase of the ghetto was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: When...approaching the final phase, what was the the mentality?</span> <span id="s313">Was there an awareness that eventually your number would be up, that eventually in not too long a period of time that that it would be your turn to be eliminated and and was there fear?</span> <span id="s314">Was there uh...was there an awareness that you had to get out?</span> <span id="s315">What was the mentality like at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Well, of course there was awareness and there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s317">Uh a few people did manage to get out and uh the reprisals were very very high and that probably kept other people from from leaving if they could get out, because the first ones that would uh be used in the reprisal would be the family.</span> <span id="s318">I guess it's very difficult for a person to to save his life knowing that his family is going to to pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Were you scared?</span> <span id="s320">You were a little girl at the time.</span> <span id="s321">How much of this were you...did you know and and and how did you deal with it?</span> <span id="s322">Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s324">Of course.</span> <span id="s325">Uh it's fear but it's almost an accepted fear at that point.</span> <span id="s326">You do things because you have to do them.</span> <span id="s327">I remember incidents where...I'd be jumping the gun.</span> <span id="s328">We escaped from one ghetto and we were in another ghetto and we knew that there was going to be a reduction again and a cousin had a studio and the Germans had told him that that night he was to spend at his studio and he took me along with him and I wasn't allowed to walk with him.</span> <span id="s329">I had to follow at a distance, and he hid me and uh we went up to the attic of the house and watched what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, we saw the Jews being gathered into one open field.</span> <span id="s332">We watched them being separated, a group here, a group there, examining their papers and some taken away and some returned back to the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What happened to the ones that were taken away?</span> <span id="s334">A: They were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you see this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No.</span> <span id="s337">I don't know whether he did or not.</span> <span id="s338">He survived, by the way.</span> <span id="s339">Q: Your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">He survived.</span> <span id="s342">He was an excellent photographer, and the German made...the Germans made full use of his uh talents.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: As people were being reduced or eliminated in your ghetto, first of all, did you know some of the people and when did it start to encroach on the people that you knew, your neighbors, the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Actually nobody from my family uh was eliminated in in the reduction of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Everybody lived to the final liquidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Let me ask you about when the decision was made by your family to go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: It wasn't a matter of decision.</span> <span id="s348">The ghetto was surrounded.</span> <span id="s349">Word had it that uh something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s350">Nobody ever knew how much of what would happen, and when that was announced uh my family had built a double wall in a uh...it was a warehouse at one time.</span> <span id="s351">Of course, it was used for quarters at that point.</span> <span id="s352">Our house somehow was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s353">Uh the ghetto was around the synagogue courtyards because that was the concentration of Jews and along the street so that it had some sort of division, dividing line, and the houses on our side of the street, all of them had uh enclosed courtyards to the street, so it was easy to close off that particular part, so in the warehouse uh there was a double wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Now when you say a double wall, how big a space do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: How big a space...probably just a matter of a couple of...I'd say about two and a half, three feet wide.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And your family hid there?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">Not just my family...quite a number of people.</span> <span id="s359">Whoever could get in.</span> <span id="s360">It wasn't a matter of...when that was announced and when the Germans started to knock on the door, it's it's who could make it, and at a certain point, the door was closed and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: So one day the Germans came and knocked on the door and your family...?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Uh one morning, word had it that something was happening.</span> <span id="s363">I really can't recall whether we went in there.</span> <span id="s364">Sometimes we would sleep in there.</span> <span id="s365">If there was any kind of word that something was going to happen, we would not spend the night in the house but in this hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: How long did you live or hide in this hiding place?</span> <span id="s367">A: At that particular time, I think it was about a week.</span> <span id="s368">Q: You spent a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: About a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And how many other people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I'm aware of my mother and myself and my brother, my grandmother and some other people.</span> <span id="s372">Just how many other people, I don't know because it seemed like whenever somebody went out, they just didn't return.</span> <span id="s373">If somebody went out to investigate...uh I know that my grandmother was caught and of course she would not tell.</span> <span id="s374">She just said she was the only one and she hid and she would not point out as to where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: How do you remember that your grandmother was caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Uh I remember because that...it was a very traumatic time.</span> <span id="s377">Particularly remember my mother trying to to reach for her and trying to protect us at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Now your mother was in this hiding place?</span> <span id="s379">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And you grandmother went out and and encountered German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: My...no.</span> <span id="s382">What happened was is uh we could hear quite a bit with what was going on.</span> <span id="s383">We couldn't see.</span> <span id="s384">There was a lot of shooting going on and uh then it became quiet.</span> <span id="s385">We did not have any more bread or water and how long can you stay in a hiding place.</span> <span id="s386">Also we could hear voices and we could hear the discussion of the the gentiles.</span> <span id="s387">Everybody came to loot and I guess our house in particular.</span> <span id="s388">(Laughter) And uh I remember at some point I guess it was felt that uh it's time to to get out and and go.</span> <span id="s389">Uh one of the dangers was that...I don't recall exactly what happened but it seemed to me that my mother overheard somebody saying that uh everything is, you know, is...everybody's gone from here and it's time to to occupy the house, to take the house.</span> <span id="s390">Then it would be very difficult to get out.</span> <span id="s391">And the decision, I guess, was made to try to get out and also there was more than one hiding place in a house.</span> <span id="s392">Normally there were several so what we tried to do is get out from that one and get into the house.</span> <span id="s393">There was another hiding place in a pantry under the ground...under the floors and we were going there and I don't recall whether my grandmother was first or last but I know...I remember hearing her.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Hearing her as she encountered Germans...?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: As she encountered...not just the Germans.</span> <span id="s396">Uh we lived in a situation where it wasn't just the Germans that were against us.</span> <span id="s397">The Poles in the community, the the gentiles in the community were against us too.</span> <span id="s398">I'm not going to say all of them.</span> <span id="s399">I wouldn't be alive today if it were all of them, but a great number were and uh our part of the country was a very poor part of the country and I guess the the looting is what uh what appealed to a lot of the people, being able to uh to accumulate somebody...you know, take over somebody else's wealth and even though by the time we came into the ghetto a lot of it was stripped, but it was still some things.</span> <span id="s400">When you talk about a community where people didn't even have shoes...uh my husband still kids me about I come from a small town where you walk barefoot.</span> <span id="s401">You only put on your shoes when you came to the market place.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Your grandmother left the hiding place, and then you knew something happened.</span> <span id="s403">You'd heard...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We knew that the...that she was caught.</span> <span id="s405">Whether it was Germans or whether gentiles, we were...I I don't know, but I know that she was caught because she was carried away.</span> <span id="s406">She was pulled away, and she was beaten and she said I don't know.</span> <span id="s407">I was by myself.</span> <span id="s408">That I remember very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And do you remember being with your mother at the time and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: My mother was with us.</span> <span id="s411">See what happened was is whenever something like this happened, the women and children were the ones that were put into hiding and the men, the big protectors were were left out.</span> <span id="s412">There was just so much space to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Where was your father at this time?</span> <span id="s414">A: By then he was no longer alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Was he killed in the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s416">Was he taken away or eliminated?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I don't even remember the circumstances.</span> <span id="s418">I just know he was...he was not with us.</span> <span id="s419">Q: But at one point you became aware that your family...?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Uh the...(sigh)...I don't know how to explain it to you.</span> <span id="s421">When something like this happens, in the first place you're not really sure of what the circumstances were.</span> <span id="s422">It's not...it's not a normal occurrence.</span> <span id="s423">All I know is that the family became smaller.</span> <span id="s424">At that point frankly it's it's just a nightmare.</span> <span id="s425">That particular incident is a nightmare.</span> <span id="s426">The things that I remember is even when we were running out from the second hiding place, crawling over bodies, the things that stand out in my mind is that we crossed the river, which was one of the boundaries of the ghetto, after crawling over bodies and hiding in the shadows and uh encountering two men with rifles, and my mother had some valuables on her and she said look, I I can make you rich.</span> <span id="s427">Put out your hands and I'll give it all to you, and they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">They slung their rifles over their shoulder, and within the period of time that they put away their possess...our possessions I should say, not their possessions, uh we managed to escape so it was known that we were someplace around and I don't know if they recognized my mother.</span> <span id="s429">They could easily figure out where we were going to, who the friends were and which particular village we would go to.</span> <span id="s430">I remember hiding uh in a bathhouse in a nearby village and I remember a man coming and telling us that every...they know that you're still alive and that you're around here someplace.</span> <span id="s431">You'd better run.</span> <span id="s432">You better hide.</span> <span id="s433">That was after my mother had left my brother with my father's very good friend to hide him.</span> <span id="s434">She took me to this particular man's sister, and by the time we got there...remember we can only do it at night, not during the daytime...and don't ask me whether it was the same night or the next night.</span> <span id="s435">Uh by the time she brought me there, uh this man told my mother that he had just come back and noticed that my father was...my...sorry...my brother was caught by the Germans and that we better run from this village because we're not safe here.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So at this point, it was just you and your mother?</span> <span id="s437">A: It was just my mother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And where did you run to?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, the next place...well, we hid.</span> <span id="s440">I remember hiding in...the wheat grows pretty high in our part of the country and I remember hiding in the wheat, in the field, and I remember gentiles passing, farmers passing and talking about what was happening in town, the fact that all the Jews were were killed.</span> <span id="s441">They really did a clean-up job.</span> <span id="s442">Uh at night we managed to get over to my brother's governess' house and we must have hid the night someplace nearby because probably the next night we got news that my brother was no longer alive and ventured further.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: So that night before you had seen your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s445">We were all three of us together until my mother left me in this bath house and took my brother to place him into hiding.</span> <span id="s446">I guess she figured she'll place him and place me someplace safe and then she'll fend for herself.</span> <span id="s447">Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So you were left alone for a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I was...yes.</span> <span id="s450">Actually no...there were two other children that somehow managed to to get out with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: It's easy to figure out.</span> <span id="s453">It was 1942.</span> <span id="s454">The win...the...not...not quite twelve.</span> <span id="s455">Eleven years old.</span> <span id="s456">Q: When your mother left you...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s458">It was 1943, so I was twelve years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: When you were left alone for that period of time, what was your reaction?</span> <span id="s460">Were you...did you feel that you were strong?</span> <span id="s461">Were you especially frightened do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Just waiting and and hoping my mother comes back.</span> <span id="s463">Q: Were you not sure that that would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I don't think I was sure of anything.</span> <span id="s465">I think one becomes numb.</span> <span id="s466">You...you don't feel a thing.</span> <span id="s467">You just...you just take it as it comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: So from there after your mother and you received this news about your brother, where did you go next?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Next we went to another gentile family.</span> <span id="s470">Again my mother started to choose very, very carefully as to where to go, who she would think would be the the least uh belligerent and we went to this woman's house.</span> <span id="s471">Uh she was a widow and my father had helped her out greatly when her husband passed away and my mother felt that uh that was a good place to go, and uh when we got there uh she wasn't home.</span> <span id="s472">Her daughter was home and her daughter must have been just about a couple of years older than I and uh the daughter knew us very well too, and she hid us and uh I remember the the center of the house...most of the houses had like a fireplace, an oven.</span> <span id="s473">Everybody had to bake bread.</span> <span id="s474">It was like an oven and to keep warm.</span> <span id="s475">It was built out of bricks and it had sort of like a uh a a level area.</span> <span id="s476">A lot of the uh farmers would sleep there in the wintertime because the oven would be heated up, so she put us there and normally there was some sort of a curtain that was drawn across it, so that's where she put us and that's where we stayed and uh the mother came back and as in many villages, the big pastime was to get together and to talk and uh we were up there and this woman crawled up and sat down right in front of the curtain and talked to the people that were sitting on benches and they were discussing about what happened in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And she didn't know you were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Oh, she knew we were there because when she came home her daughter had informed her that uh we had come and she put us...where she put us to hide us.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: We stayed there probably a couple of nights, until things quieted down because uh this woman had sent a son...she had two sons and a daughter and we actually saw her after the war too.</span> <span id="s481">Uh we know she left Poland because my mother corresponded with her and after a while the letters just came back.</span> <span id="s482">Uh she was actually of French extraction.</span> <span id="s483">She married her husband who was Polish and was living there, and she had talked about going back to her people anyway.</span> <span id="s484">So I suppose she must have gone back, but what she did was is she uh sent us by horse and wagon, giv...giving us her clothing, her documents, her daughter's documents, and sent her son with us to take us to another village.</span> <span id="s485">Uh actually she scouted.</span> <span id="s486">Uh my mother told her who she wanted...where...where the next stop could be for us and she had gotten in touch with those people.</span> <span id="s487">She went over there and just spoke and she says yes, it's safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What would have happened to her if it had been found out that she did all that to hide you and save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Our lives and hers would have been ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Why do you think she she did that, that she risked her life...?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: She was...she was a righteous person.</span> <span id="s492">She was a good person.</span> <span id="s493">That's why I said that thank God that there are some people who did not side with the Germans and who had a conscious and uh who had love of humanity and and wanted to help people.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Were those people...those righteous people...were they extraordinary?</span> <span id="s495">Were they few?</span> <span id="s496">Uh how did you know or did you know who would would would put their own lives on the line to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: You didn't know.</span> <span id="s498">You didn't know.</span> <span id="s499">It was a matter of I guess luck.</span> <span id="s500">Q: So these were people that you had known before...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: ...but one may turn you in and the other may save your life?</span> <span id="s503">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: You said that your mother chose very carefully.</span> <span id="s505">Do you think she sensed about this one woman that that this would be...?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, the circumstances were such that she figured if anybody had any kind of a debt to pay and they were...and they were good, they would do it, if they would turn us in.</span> <span id="s507">At that point this particular woman had nothing to gain by turning us in.</span> <span id="s508">Uh the next family...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: But she had a lot to loose by helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: She had a lot to loose.</span> <span id="s511">It was just that uh I remember her telling my mother that uh my father had come to her aid when she thought that life was over for her and she'll do anything she can to help us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: There was a big realization of informers.</span> <span id="s513">There were a lot of informing going on which would help?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Quite a bit.</span> <span id="s515">The Germans rewarded the informants.</span> <span id="s516">Q: How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: There was an incentive.</span> <span id="s518">Well uh one of the things is uh whatever the possessions that remained from the Jews, they would share in those, uh the houses.</span> <span id="s519">They...the property.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So if you turned in a Jewish family, you might stand to gain some of their wealth?</span> <span id="s521">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s522">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: It was a direct benefit?</span> <span id="s524">A: Direct benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Were you surprised that some people took the incentive or or sided with the Germans, people you had known before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: You know, there is no surprise.</span> <span id="s527">In the first place, the age that I was at, I don't think I knew enough about human nature to really realize any of it.</span> <span id="s528">I think I was more aware of what was happening, what it took to survive, than what people would do.</span> <span id="s529">I think a lot of it...you know, it's the same as here.</span> <span id="s530">You see people who have very little and yet they go out and help the more needy and you see people who are very well off and they look the other way.</span> <span id="s531">I think it's the same thing with then.</span> <span id="s532">It...it was more as to how people perceived themselves.</span> <span id="s533">Uh sometimes the most religious were the ones that uh that probably would would turn on someone quicker and then there were some that uh truly believed in in saving a human life.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Because you're not necessarily talking about helping somebody in need.</span> <span id="s535">You're talking about really a tremendous personal sacrifice to to help someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well, it's risking your life.</span> <span id="s537">Anybody...anybody saving a Jew, collaborating with a Jew uh stood to loose his life.</span> <span id="s538">If not his life at least his health because a good sized beating can leave one maimed, uh or worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: What kind of brutality during those times did you witness, did you observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Well, as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through, were driven through the town and the treatment of them.</span> <span id="s541">It was so cruel.</span> <span id="s542">I mean people who were so hungry and thirsty and if someone uh went for for a bit of food or for a cup of water...I mean the Jewish people have always been taught to help, and uh you see people driven through...people ran to the house to get especially water and something to drink with, and uh the Germans just turned on them.</span> <span id="s543">I don't recall them turning on the ones that were trying to give them the food.</span> <span id="s544">I remember them turning against the ones that went for the food, and I think this is probably why it left such a lasting impression on me is that if if a man is hungry and reaches for something, he gets beaten and and in some cases shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: What other methods did the Germans have keeping...to keep the Jews in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Mostly by retaliation.</span> <span id="s547">Promising that nothing will happen to the Jews if they cooperate and uh if anybody uh...if they found that something was done against their orders, by retaliation.</span> <span id="s548">I recall a few men who had escaped to the forest and uh actually the first partisans I guess I would call them.</span> <span id="s549">Uh when that became known, the first thing they did is gather a certain amount of people, took them out into the the main area, the the open area was the the synagogue courtyards...all the synagogues were located around a large courtyard, and shoot them or take them away to be shot.</span> <span id="s550">Uh what they did is to make sure if...I don't recall...I think they took them away to be shot.</span> <span id="s551">They may have shot several in the ghetto itself but the majority of the time they would take more people and then have the...some return to tell the stories, to tell of the...of the manner in which the the others ones died.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Rae, we're going to change tapes now and uh that's only going to take up a couple of minutes, and then we're going to...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Gosh, has it been that long... Q: It's been an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Rachel, I want to ask you...going back for a minute, uh under the ghettoization, there were Jewish leaders, there were liaisons to the Germans among the Jewish community and I understand that some of them argued against resistance, against fighting.</span> <span id="s556">Do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Probably so, because every time that there was any kind of a stand, uh the Germans would uh inflict some deaths and injuries, so it was a matter of I think conscious.</span> <span id="s558">I was much closer to that when we were in the second ghetto, because at that time my mother had made up her mind that she's going to try to uh get out of the ghetto and join with the partisans and uh the leader of that particular ghetto uh was a a very...I don't know how to put it...uh not really defiant but someone who who had the understanding of what was happening to others and a brother-in-law of his was a physician.</span> <span id="s559">My mother felt that if she, as a woman coming into a group...who wants a woman...who wants a woman with a child that's a responsibility, but if she brought someone with her who could contribute (cough)...excuse me...who could contribute, that uh she would be more welcome and this particular leader's sons also wanted to get away and uh I remember his answers.</span> <span id="s560">We used to meet in his house and he had a daughter my age and he wanted his children very much to survive and I understand one of his sons did survive.</span> <span id="s561">However uh would...and possibly the the daughter too, but uh they did want to be in touch with anyone because there were some Jewish people who had hard feelings against their father, but uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Because he had been the liaison to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Uh yes.</span> <span id="s564">Because in that position I guess there were sometimes when he knew about things and uh it was a matter of uh saving the majority.</span> <span id="s565">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So was that the underlying...the underlying way of thinking...saving...what was good for the greatest number?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: What was good for the greatest number.</span> <span id="s568">Actually, he was taken away before the second ghetto was uh liquidated.</span> <span id="s569">He was taken out of the ghetto with his whole family.</span> <span id="s570">I don't know what the circumstances were but the two sons defied the Germans and managed to run away from them.</span> <span id="s571">I don't know whether the the father would have been taken to another ghetto, whatever.</span> <span id="s572">It ended up that the father was killed and uh the wife...the mother too, but the two sons and a daughter escaped, ran away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s573">The older son was shot.</span> <span id="s574">The younger one and the daughter were not, and they were hiding out in the ghetto for a little bit and all the Jews there were so scared of their own well-being, of their own survival, they were ready to to uh give them back to the Germans, give them away, and the son did escape and uh really became a hero in the in the partisans, but we don't know for sure whether they survived or not, but that was a very good example where what do you do for the good of the community.</span> <span id="s575">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: The the reason I asked that question is because when we look back at that time in history in retrospect, a question that always comes is why wasn't there more resistance.</span> <span id="s577">Why didn't the Jews fight?</span> <span id="s578">What was it at that time that allowed this to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Well, there were several things.</span> <span id="s580">One of them is the family unit.</span> <span id="s581">Uh it wasn't every...everybody for himself...maybe more people could have survived if they would have left their families and gone on.</span> <span id="s582">Uh if you try to escape with a family and with children, it becomes much more difficult.</span> <span id="s583">The men did not want to leave their wives and children.</span> <span id="s584">Some of them did.</span> <span id="s585">Some of them figured they'll get out and maybe they'll bring their families.</span> <span id="s586">Some of them did bring their families.</span> <span id="s587">But it was a matter of how do you put yourself in the position of perhaps being the cause of somebody else's death.</span> <span id="s588">How do you live with yourself the rest of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: You mentioned that the Jewish community had been very tight-knit, very well-organized and I guess the question also arises, why didn't the Jewish community organize against their oppressors?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Remember that they were surrounded by people who were not looking to help them but to hinder them.</span> <span id="s591">There was not really any place to go.</span> <span id="s592">The partisans did not really get organized very well until probably the fall of '43.</span> <span id="s593">Uh there were little groups here and there.</span> <span id="s594">They were hit and miss.</span> <span id="s595">Uh the first partisans, and my mother was very much in touch with them...there were a few of the young men who escaped to the forest and the way they accumulated a few weapons was by uh staking out some roads and finding a lonely...a lone I should say...German soldier who would pass by that they could uh kill and take his weapons, because that was the only way to take the the weapons from a soldier.</span> <span id="s596">Uh (laughter) I don't know whether...at that point I think it was a matter of kill or be killed.</span> <span id="s597">Uh they accumulated a few weapons.</span> <span id="s598">Some of the Russians...Russian prison of wars also had escaped.</span> <span id="s599">Uh you know, when when people are treated like this, it doesn't matter...life or death...uh the line between life and death becomes very, very narrow, and uh it's a matter...well, do I get killed and end my suffering or do I escape and have a chance to live and uh then then it's much easier to escape, but when you're the cause of the rest of your family's deaths, I mean it it's very difficult.</span> <span id="s600">Also there was no place really to run.</span> <span id="s601">You lived in a..</span> <span id="s602">.</span> <span id="s603">amongst the population that was ready and willing to hand you over to the Germans again.</span> <span id="s604">It was only under the threat of fear that those people provided the food to the partisans.</span> <span id="s605">Once the partisans were able to get some weapons and once they had made contact with the uh Russians behind the lines, then it became much easier because at that point the Russians had already sent...when the front was organized, uh the Russians had sent uh leadership, ammunitions and some supplies.</span> <span id="s606">Other than that, whatever supplies, whatever fighting supplies there were, were only very primitive or what was uh taken from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Was there also in this...in this lack of resistance, a denial that we are, as you say, the upper crust, the the bourgeois?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I I don't see that way.</span> <span id="s609">I don't see that way.</span> <span id="s610">I..</span> <span id="s611">.</span> <span id="s612">maybe...maybe I'm naive or maybe I was naive as a child.</span> <span id="s613">Uh I remember quite a number of people who would...wanted to get out of the ghetto, wanted to escape.</span> <span id="s614">Some of them did.</span> <span id="s615">From the second ghetto, that particular time when we tried to organize an escape, some of the people were caught.</span> <span id="s616">It just so happened we...we were the last wave to get out and by then we knew we couldn't.</span> <span id="s617">It was organized that that particular night, a group was going to leave and some of them got caught and uh this particular leader was was taken at that point.</span> <span id="s618">He was blamed for it.</span> <span id="s619">He did not oversee the people well enough, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, I mentioned to you he got killed.</span> <span id="s622">He and his family were taken whether in retaliation or whatever, but his sons fought back and uh and managed to escape.</span> <span id="s623">I know that one had died of his wounds and uh the other...the the younger son and daughter I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s624">Word had that they escaped but he was so afraid to to be in contact with any of the Jewish.</span> <span id="s625">But there was really no place to go.</span> <span id="s626">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s627">You...you were in a uh...you were in a situation that you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.</span> <span id="s628">You don't want to die.</span> <span id="s629">You know you're going to die.</span> <span id="s630">It was just a question maybe.</span> <span id="s631">You know, hope is what keeps us all living and the hope was that maybe, maybe the the Russians are going to regroup and uh and liberate us before the Germans have a chance to kill us.</span> <span id="s632">And as long as the Germans could elicit some sort...some sort of labor or some sort of uh uh valuables from the community, we were still of some use.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: I'm going to ask you, Rae, to sit up a little bit straighter.</span> <span id="s634">You're leaning to one side.</span> <span id="s635">Is that...how does that look?</span> <span id="s636">OK.</span> <span id="s637">Uh you talk about their keeping hope alive in such dire circumstances, when you've lost your father.</span> <span id="s638">You've lost your brother.</span> <span id="s639">You're living in the forest.</span> <span id="s640">You're living in the woods.</span> <span id="s641">You're living in hiding places.</span> <span id="s642">How do you keep hope alive?</span> <span id="s643">What constitutes that hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Getting through the...to the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: And and how do you do that?</span> <span id="s646">How...how do you find the strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: You don't know any Yiddish.</span> <span id="s648">I could give you a very good expression.</span> <span id="s649">I'll try...I'll try to translate it.</span> <span id="s650">You don't know how you will react until you find yourself in the situation.</span> <span id="s651">Uh look...I was what...twelve, thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s652">I I worked during the day in a spinning mill and managed to...my mother couldn't knit for the life of her and the only...the only way you could...you could stay in a ghetto and uh and survive there was to to be worth something, so I would knit scarves and and socks and I hated to to knit gloves.</span> <span id="s653">Those fingers...they were complicated, and yet be able to read.</span> <span id="s654">I have learned in the ghetto to knit and to read at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Were there times when you felt or maybe even that you knew that your mother felt that this that this spare was greater than the hub?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s657">I don't know.</span> <span id="s658">All I know is that my mother had pushed very hard to to survive and to not just to survive by herself but also to save me and it it's an obsession to to try to stay alive and uh she kept in contact.</span> <span id="s659">She managed to to find acquaintanceship through the gentiles that she knew uh who owed her favors.</span> <span id="s660">Actually one family that had a lot of our possessions and it was a big risk because they would smuggle food to us in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s661">They had actually smuggled a gun in to my mother and they helped smuggle us out, and that was taking a very great risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I want to talk about when you were with the partisan group.</span> <span id="s663">When did that happen?</span> <span id="s664">How did you first join up?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Uh after...from the second ghetto, the ghetto at Glemboke, uh that ghetto was going through the same process as our ghetto where it was being consolidated.</span> <span id="s666">Uh people were taken away.</span> <span id="s667">Uh the the living quarters were pushed in.</span> <span id="s668">It was made smaller and smaller and all the signs were that uh it's not going to be long before that ghetto is liquidated too, and as I told you uh before, a cousin was a photographer that uh the Germans had used quite a bit and I guess they liked him too and he could come and go from the ghetto at will.</span> <span id="s669">I mean he he was free.</span> <span id="s670">His studio was outside of the ghetto and uh it was known that uh who he was and what he was.</span> <span id="s671">Even though he had to return every night to the ghetto, nonetheless uh there were occasions where the Germans actually demanded that he stay outside of the ghetto for their purposes and uh he he was able to communicate with the outside much easier and he sort of helped communicate so that we could escape.</span> <span id="s672">We knew where the partisans were at that point and uh took the chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s674">Tell me that...the story of that night when you made your...was it a run to the woods to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: It wasn't at night.</span> <span id="s676">It was in the daylight.</span> <span id="s677">We had uh dressed, gone outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s678">I went out to work every morning to the spinning mill and my mother got dressed to go like to work too and then just skipped off to the side, uh prearranged to meet with a gentile woman who was to lead us out of town and I guess nobody questioned...come to think of it, if if my memory serves me right, we even hitched a ride with the Germans on a truck, but it was not...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: You hitched a ride with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: On a truck.</span> <span id="s681">They were going down the road.</span> <span id="s682">They stopped.</span> <span id="s683">We were walking with this woman.</span> <span id="s684">They asked if we wanted to ride, where we were going...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You weren't wearing your star at this...?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s687">(Laughter) No.</span> <span id="s688">Dressed...dressed like a peasant.</span> <span id="s689">This woman met us and brought us some clothing and we quickly changed into uh peasant clo...clothing.</span> <span id="s690">I mean it wasn't much different from what we wearing, but nonetheless uh a little bit more...how should I say...to hide our identity.</span> <span id="s691">And uh she took us to a village eventually and uh from that village...Mother had already contacts and from this village uh we went on and I don't remember the circumstances, but I remember leaving that ghetto in in broad daylight.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s693">So what does it mean to to join up with a band of partisans?</span> <span id="s694">What...what was that kind of like?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, it was also a matter of being accepted.</span> <span id="s696">You know, you've got to...you've got to have value again.</span> <span id="s697">You've got to be able to do something to to have somebody keep you, and uh well Mother had known quite a number of people and she had been in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">They knew that uh she had tried to get some other people out.</span> <span id="s699">Of course, the doctor is the one that they wanted and uh he he perished in the ghetto and never got out.</span> <span id="s700">He was too known a personality and uh when we came there, there were a few Jewish men there and they kind of uh eased it for us.</span> <span id="s701">Mother did the cooking and I did whatever I was told to do.</span> <span id="s702">Uh the partisan group that we were with were at the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s703">We were not with the main group.</span> <span id="s704">What they basically doing is uh disrupting communications, communications meaning train deliveries.</span> <span id="s705">Uh they would go out and uh loosen the bolts to some of the railroad tracks so a train could not go on.</span> <span id="s706">Disrupting the delivery to the to the front lines, sometimes managing to blow up a couple of car loads of ammunition.</span> <span id="s707">It always had to be done in a manner that would not be too suspicious, that uh kind of could be accepted as possibly even an accident because of retaliation.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: How did you live?</span> <span id="s709">In a house in the woods or were you camping?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: In villages.</span> <span id="s711">In villages.</span> <span id="s712">Sometimes in uh house, dirt house.</span> <span id="s713">Sometimes just under the stars.</span> <span id="s714">It all depended on on what what happened.</span> <span id="s715">Remember the Germans were occupied at the front lines, so it wasn't that they had uh you know, they had Germans living in every house, in every village, in every so forth.</span> <span id="s716">They were afraid of those deep forests.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">The forests were so thick and not only thick.</span> <span id="s718">Uh that area is known as the Polotski Bloty.</span> <span id="s719">Uh the the marshes.</span> <span id="s720">You could sink into those marshes and never come out.</span> <span id="s721">They could not go in with a vehicle.</span> <span id="s722">You must realize that the Germans prided themselves on on their cleanliness.</span> <span id="s723">If they got dirt on their boots, they didn't like it.</span> <span id="s724">They were not very apt to uh to venture in.</span> <span id="s725">They would venture in every so often just to hit sort of an area and get out to discourage the partisans to coming to close to to the railroad stations, to the to the railroad tracks and when they hit, we would run into the forests and that's when we would live, you know, under the stars and when that would recede, uh we would come back out into the villages.</span> <span id="s726">Those villagers...I don't know whether they really received the partisans with open arms, however they they had to go along with the tide too.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well, you know, it's it's who puts the highest fear into you, and at that point the partisans put the greatest fear into them, that if they ran to the Germans, that they could not return to their homes and their families and then again how well would the Germans treat them.</span> <span id="s729">By then the Germans were feeling pretty much the uh the heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Were all the partisans Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s732">I told you...a lot of...there weren't that many Jews.</span> <span id="s733">A lot of them...</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did they accept...the the the partisans, did they accept...did they know you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s735">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: And they accepted you as part of their band?</span> <span id="s737">A: Uh yes.</span> <span id="s738">As I said...</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: ...unified, the partisans...the Jews and...I mean I..</span> <span id="s740">.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Not unified them.</span> <span id="s742">Probably what unified them was the desire to get rid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s743">Uh should I say that the Jews were very welcome...I don't know.</span> <span id="s744">I don't know.</span> <span id="s745">Uh there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in the partisans too, but it was a matter of who did what.</span> <span id="s746">There weren't too many Jewish...too many women.</span> <span id="s747">My mother did the cooking and uh she was needed, so she did it.</span> <span id="s748">Uh I sometimes peeled potatoes until I couldn't feel my fingers.</span> <span id="s749">Sometimes I would uh I was taught to to to do some things with the ammunition.</span> <span id="s750">I could take apart a rifle and clean it probably faster than (laughter) than a soldier could.</span> <span id="s751">My little fingers managed to to get into places where big fingers couldn't get in and it was a matter of what was your worth.</span> <span id="s752">Everybody had to to have a certain worth.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: How old was your mother at this time?</span> <span id="s754">A: Mother was born in 1906.</span> <span id="s755">1943.</span> <span id="s756">Thirty...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Mid-thirties.</span> <span id="s758">She was a young woman at the time.</span> <span id="s759">And when you look back on how...how she was able to survive and save you, what what kind of strength did that take as a young woman and what kind of young woman was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Uh mother was a child during the 1st World War.</span> <span id="s761">She uh she helped with the family.</span> <span id="s762">She went into business rather early in life.</span> <span id="s763">Not only did she run a business but uh she also helped a sister get into business in a neighboring town.</span> <span id="s764">Uh Mother was a woman who ventured out into the world.</span> <span id="s765">She used to go to Lodz to buy uh yard goods...Warsaw...Vilna was the main place, so she wasn't somebody that came from the hinterlands and just stayed in the hinterlands.</span> <span id="s766">She had a very good head on her shoulders.</span> <span id="s767">I can only tell you that the war ended and my mother fell apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Now tell me about that.</span> <span id="s769">She had struggled so long for survival, as you said, the one day...from one day to the next just surviving, so what happens when when that is no longer there?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: (Sigh) A very sad story, very sad story.</span> <span id="s771">Uh my mother always had this feeling that because of who she was and what she was that she should have...she should have saved everybody, and to this day uh she she still keeps on talking about what she should have done and what she could have done, but of course if she could have done it she would have done it.</span> <span id="s772">Uh she lives with with this feeling of inadequacy of then, not of now.</span> <span id="s773">She never really adapted here.</span> <span id="s774">She was never any longer what she was.</span> <span id="s775">She had to struggle to to earn a livelihood.</span> <span id="s776">I mean since coming to this country, I'll tell you I've worked...I don't remember ever not working.</span> <span id="s777">I went to high school and worked.</span> <span id="s778">I went to school...we moved to New York.</span> <span id="s779">Mother thought that she was going to be able to get a job there and and manage better.</span> <span id="s780">The language was not as much of a problem.</span> <span id="s781">Washington really isn't a city where somebody without without money and without a profession can can easily survive and she did not want to be dependent on my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s782">Uh we didn't find it that easy in New York.</span> <span id="s783">Uh I hated New York.</span> <span id="s784">As soon as I graduated from high school...in the first place I wanted to go to college and my only ability to go to college would be with my uncle's help.</span> <span id="s785">I came here to Washington and managed to get a very good job and go to school at night and uh really liked this environment much better than the New York environment.</span> <span id="s786">So Mother came back with me and and she really could never get a uh a decent job here, so it was sort of a matter of just surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What in those immediate days following the war...now now first of all, let's go back, uh take a step back...you're with the partisan group.</span> <span id="s788">Do you know who led that group that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Uh at that point...I mean toward the end, by the time we came into the partisans, they had a pretty much uh uh a command.</span> <span id="s790">The commanders came from Russia.</span> <span id="s791">Uh we were with a special group so there was just one commander over this small group of people, but uh there was a chain of command that uh from from the brigade, and there were several brigades.</span> <span id="s792">The one that we were with was called Medvedev, but there were several brigades.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Were...were any of the partisans ever captured?</span> <span id="s794">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Were you ever captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Oh we were captured during a blockade, but when partisans went out on assignments uh to do their either demolition or uh sabotage, uh many of them were captured.</span> <span id="s797">I remember one woman was captured.</span> <span id="s798">She was Jewish too and uh she was returned in a potato sack in pieces and uh that that was the the lesson the Germans were trying to teach is that if you tried to do that to us and we'll show you what we can to do you.</span> <span id="s799">It never stopped anybody going out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What did...what effect did it have on all of you, on you in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I think the effect it had is rather than intimidating, it became a challenge, that I'll go out and I'll do you even worse and I'll get away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: So it galvanized you?</span> <span id="s803">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s804">Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Uh was that the normal fate of a partisan who was captured, some horrible death?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Of course...some horrible death.</span> <span id="s807">Uh towards...closer to liberation in early 1944, uh the Germans tried to rid the forests of the partisans because they were already in retreat and in order to to be able to fight the war, they had to get rid of this monkey on their back, somebody that that was inflicting all kinds of uh disruptions and they had...uh in addition to the Germans there were some Russian groups, actually it was a Ukrainian group in our part of the of the country...where a whole military unit had turned themselves over to the Germans and they were fighting on the side of the Germans and uh they were doing the dirty work for the Germans, and those people had what they called the blockade.</span> <span id="s808">They surrounded every exit from the forest.</span> <span id="s809">They kept on pushing the partisans into the into the forest deeper and uh managed to to capture quite a number of us.</span> <span id="s810">Uh we were captured together with at that point some partisans and some of the villagers because the villagers ran too.</span> <span id="s811">They were afraid to stay and also some of the partisans made them go with them because this was a protection, having, you know, blending into into the population and we were brought back to our home town and at that point uh I had uh typhoid fever and I was shaven.</span> <span id="s812">My head was shaven, so dressed in boy's clothing, I looked very much like a boy and they were separating men and women.</span> <span id="s813">The Germans had this uh I don't know...phobia I guess, not to keep men and women together, even boys and and and their mothers, and they were going to separate me from my mother and that was my my biggest fear and they were arguing...junge madchen, madchen junge…,boy, girl, boy, girl.</span> <span id="s814">Guess what I did?</span> <span id="s815">(Laughter) I said I was a madchen, a girl, and uh since my mother identified herself as my mother, uh they presumed that she was gentile and she was harboring a Jewish child.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: How did they know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Because I said the word madchen.</span> <span id="s818">Where do I know it from?</span> <span id="s819">Q: That's a Yiddish word?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Well, it's the same.</span> <span id="s821">It's very similar.</span> <span id="s822">You must realize that most of the gentiles in that part of the country are pretty illiterate and uh did not catch on to German.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Oh I see.</span> <span id="s824">You understood the German...?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I understood the German conversation.</span> <span id="s826">If I understood the German and when the cards are down, you kind of come up with an inner strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What effect do you think it had on your mother and yourself to know that the key to your survival meant denying being a Jew?</span> <span id="s828">To vehemently...vehemently deny being a Jew.</span> <span id="s829">In fact, at that moment your survival depended on convincing someone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Oh that part was easy.</span> <span id="s831">That part was easy.</span> <span id="s832">Surviving is what mattered.</span> <span id="s833">But I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s834">As much as surviving mattered, we had very little to eat and the only thing available was pork and I would not eat pork and neither would my mother.</span> <span id="s835">My mother cooked it for the partisans but we never ate it.</span> <span id="s836">We'd sooner eat just a potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: So in your own ways, you kept your Jewish observances, what you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Uh adhered to the Jewish principles.</span> <span id="s839">I wouldn't say we kept the Jewish observances.</span> <span id="s840">We adhered to Jewish principles wherever possible.</span> <span id="s841">Uh if it was a matter of life and death, it's a different story.</span> <span id="s842">Probably if somebody would have told me to eat pork to prove that I wasn't Jewish, I would eat it.</span> <span id="s843">Maybe I would be sick to my stomach later but I would eat it but when there was a choice, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Uh let me ask you about what happened when the war ended...and how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">How did the news reach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Well, what happened was is that we...eventually we joined the partisans again.</span> <span id="s847">We had to.</span> <span id="s848">We couldn't...now long can you hide amongst a population of non-Jews, especially for my mother where she was known throughout the area.</span> <span id="s849">Eventually somebody recognized her and she overheard some women talking.</span> <span id="s850">She thinks that nobody knows it.</span> <span id="s851">There were no Germans around.</span> <span id="s852">That was the...that was our luck.</span> <span id="s853">She says nobody knows that...no...she thinks that that you can fool everybody.</span> <span id="s854">Mother tried to stay out of the way.</span> <span id="s855">I was...at that point I was the one that had to organize some food and I was the one that that went out and brought news.</span> <span id="s856">Supposedly she was sick and couldn't move, but nonetheless, you know, you you stay in villages.</span> <span id="s857">Uh somebody sees you and uh Mother overheard that uh that somebody recognized her and at that point there were some people, of course, that were sympathetic too and uh told us where there were some partisans beginning to organize again, and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s858">We went and I joined up with them and uh actually had a very long march to to try to to get out of the way of the armies.</span> <span id="s859">Tried to to join a unit and uh at that point, I mean there was communication.</span> <span id="s860">There were radios, because they...the group communicated with the...actually with the Russians behind the lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: So before that time you survived for that short period of time actually living with</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Germans...German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No.</span> <span id="s864">Living with the peasants.</span> <span id="s865">But with the Germans being very close by.</span> <span id="s866">Q: And you mother was a cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No.</span> <span id="s868">In the partisans, the Germans...but when I'm...after the blockade when we were caught by the Germans...that's when we lived amongst the villagers, before we rejoined the partisans again.</span> <span id="s869">But in the...with the partisan group, Mother was a cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Now you're with the partisan group and the Germans are now retreating and somehow's there a sense that the end of the war is coming.</span> <span id="s871">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s873">See by...by the uh latter part of the occupation, uh when the Russians were already advancing, we had communication.</span> <span id="s874">The partisans had communication with the with the Russian armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: So you knew the war...the end of the war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: We knew that the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s877">We knew where...which direction they were coming from, and we were actually heading in that direction to join up with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s879">So there was one day where the war ended for you.</span> <span id="s880">Do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Vaguely.</span> <span id="s882">Very vaguely.</span> <span id="s883">All I remember is sleeping...sleeping in a house and not worrying about anything.</span> <span id="s884">It was still very unsettled.</span> <span id="s885">To give you an example, no sooner did the war end when we had to again be very wary because some of the population, when they realized there were some Jews that remained alive, uh tried to eliminate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s887">Why did they care at that point?</span> <span id="s888">A: Anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s889">Hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Hate that that...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: That Jews...(sigh) I don't know if any of you can possibly understand what it is like to live in a community where there is so much belligerence, where you're so despised, where you're not wanted.</span> <span id="s892">I mean we read in the papers about the the the uprising in Poland and so forth, but you also realize that the same people had called on all the Jews to leave the country and that is already during the the affiliation with Russia, after the war, many years after the war, twenty years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So the anti-Semitism was fueled by the hardship imposed on the Polish people by the war?</span> <span id="s894">It was always there, but you didn't feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: It...it...it was always there.</span> <span id="s896">It's just that probably as a child in a protective environment, I didn't feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So there was still a threat.</span> <span id="s898">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: I mean what what what constituted safety?</span> <span id="s900">What what...after the war was over and and you faced yet another threat...?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: After the war was over, it was a matter now of how to get out of where you were.</span> <span id="s902">Uh my mother particularly wanted to get out from the Russian area and uh she was able to uh dig up some valuables that were hidden and uh managed to bribe uh...was a work...working train.</span> <span id="s903">You know, the the stations were pretty much uh destroyed, and uh the only movement of troops was by by railroad and uh restructuring the the stations and the railroads was of primary uh need in order to move towards the front lines, so Mother signed on...signed on...bribed somebody to accept us as part of the workforce and we were heading toward Central Poland.</span> <span id="s904">Her main objective was to get as close to the line...we knew that the Americans were pushing from the other side, so we knew that the Russians and the Americans were eventually to meet, so the idea was to get as close to that area as possible and to go over to the American side.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Where did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: For us, it didn't happen that easily.</span> <span id="s907">It happened in Italy, but uh...there was...it was a long way from eastern Poland to Italy.</span> <span id="s908">Uh our first direction was toward the Baltic Sea actually.</span> <span id="s909">Uh Mother thought by going straight toward Germany...and that's where the train was going, however, when we came to Prussia, conditions were terrible.</span> <span id="s910">The Prussians had mined anything and everything that they could.</span> <span id="s911">They mined the chandeliers.</span> <span id="s912">They mined the the equipment in the houses.</span> <span id="s913">They mined themselves so when the Russians went to remove the bodies, they they killed themselves and mined themselves.</span> <span id="s914">They were blown up.</span> <span id="s915">Uh it became very dangerous and also my mother ran into a general, a Jewish general, and uh after a conversation, a short conversation, he kind of alluded to it that he was Jewish and he said if you think that the Germans were bad, wait and see what awaits us.</span> <span id="s916">He advised her to to head south.</span> <span id="s917">He heard there were some Jews in southern Poland, and the next thing was he actually arranged for...brief...we lived in a box car with another Jewish family...for that box car to be hooked on to a train heading that direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: What was he alluding to...awaits you where?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: The anti-Semitism and the hardships, if we remained in in Poland.</span> <span id="s920">Q: In Poland.</span> <span id="s921">And he was...he was a general with the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: With the Russian army.</span> <span id="s923">No more Polish army.</span> <span id="s924">No more Polish army.</span> <span id="s925">Q: So your mother headed south to Italy.</span> <span id="s926">That's...?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Now we headed south.</span> <span id="s928">We found ourselves in Lublin, which is southern Poland.</span> <span id="s929">Uh over...when we came to Lublin, actually the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s930">Uh we were in Czechoslovakia by the time we heard that the war was coming to an end and we actually crossed into Italy just about...when we came to Italy we found out that uh the war is ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What was the like for you to receive that news that the war had ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I remember more coming into Italy, coming through the Alps.</span> <span id="s933">Uh the the trip was rather trying.</span> <span id="s934">Uh we stayed in Hungary for a while where Poles in general were not very much liked and Jews definitely not but at that point uh the Israelis have already sent uh people to to organize the Jews, to uh to take charge sort of, to make the the trek toward Israel, and our intentions were not to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s935">Our intentions were to reach Israel.</span> <span id="s936">That was the only haven.</span> <span id="s937">Uh when we came to Lublin, uh there were already a few Israeli uh people, not necessarily Israeli-born, probably Polish born, but who came to organize the Jews and prepare them for the trek to Israel and uh from there we went to Czechoslovakia and then to Hungary and it was all on on the way to uh to get across into the occupied zones other than the Russian occupied zones.</span> <span id="s938">And there are certain incidents that stand out in my mind.</span> <span id="s939">One of the incidents that stands out in mind is uh coming to...sort of getting across the border between Hungary and Austria and hitting upon British troops who sent us back to the Russian side because we were in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s940">And uh at that time we already had the guides uh that were sent by Israel and we had to cross the Alp...the Alps.</span> <span id="s941">We went through some of the passes in the Alps and the thing that stands out most in my mind is crossing into Italy.</span> <span id="s942">We were cold.</span> <span id="s943">We were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">We were frozen, not just cold, and I saw an Israeli flag, the blue and white flag with the Jewish star and I was sure I was hallucinating and uh, you know, all of us sort of...do you see it?</span> <span id="s945">What do you see?</span> <span id="s946">See blue and white flag with with the Jewish star on it.</span> <span id="s947">Well, it was the Israeli brigade and I didn't tell you how well we were received, but not only that.</span> <span id="s948">Of all the people there, everybody...where are you from?</span> <span id="s949">I come from a little town nobody heard of.</span> <span id="s950">And of all the people to meet, my governess' brother.</span> <span id="s951">I couldn't get over it.</span> <span id="s952">I ran for my mother.</span> <span id="s953">Mother met him.</span> <span id="s954">Mother remembered him when he left for Israel and uh he gave me and I still have it, the soldiers had a little tiny bible.</span> <span id="s955">It's about that big.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Probably three by four inches...that he carried and uh he gave it to me, so that I would not forget my studies, and the fact that I had not spoken Hebrew since 19 probably 41, to be able to to communicate, to be able to speak, to be able to get my...my feelings across and to understand what was being said, probably the the most joyous time that I know of.</span> <span id="s957">I think it was more joyous than coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: So was your intention at that time to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: So how...what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: What happened.</span> <span id="s962">We stayed with the brigade for about three days.</span> <span id="s963">We were put in trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A boat was waiting some place in Italy, and our truck broke down.</span> <span id="s965">There were quite a number of Jews that were collected near Bologna in Italy and uh needless to say when a truck breaks down, you don't go any further.</span> <span id="s966">We missed that boat.</span> <span id="s967">We missed three boats.</span> <span id="s968">We even missed the Exodus.</span> <span id="s969">And by then uh things became pretty clear that uh it was difficult to get into Israel.</span> <span id="s970">Somehow my mother got sick.</span> <span id="s971">Mother was very sickly after that.</span> <span id="s972">Uh I would say more dead than alive and uh she...she developed asthma which was probably psychosomatic.</span> <span id="s973">At least it was diagnosed psychosomatic asthma here in the United States, but it seemed like the slightest...slightest excitement would bring on an attack, and unless I got her a shot of adrenalin, God knows what would happen.</span> <span id="s974">And uh we were supposed to leave to to meet the Exodus when she had a very bad attack of asthma and she was taken to the hospital and I thought the the world came at an end because we were not going to get out of there.</span> <span id="s975">We were not going to get to Israel, and uh at that point, we managed...somehow Mother had heard about that you could put in an ad into the forwards and she remembered writing the address to my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s976">Actually my aunt was my father's sister...that it was Washington, DC, so somebody saw our name in the paper, happened to alert my uncle to it and uh he wrote to the forwards who could forward the letter to us and we made contact and uh he was willing to...he wrote us not to try to go anywhere and he would try to to get us over.</span> <span id="s977">He made out papers but the Polish quota was full, so we couldn't come.</span> <span id="s978">They were letting just a trickle in and I'm sure if we would have waited for the Polish quota, I don't know when we would have gotten to the United States, but because my mother knew, you know that we were so close to Russia and convinced the Council that uh she actually was born on the Russian side, that uh we were able to come on the Russian quota which was open because very few people immigrated from Russia to the United States over quite a number of years, and uh so we came in November 1947.</span> <span id="s979">November 17, 1947 we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Throughout the war and the hiding and the freezing and the starving, your mother remained strong and was able to go forward.</span> <span id="s981">After the war, she became sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: I guess coming to the realization that in the first place the struggle to survive kind of ended and missing everybody and as I've mentioned to you, she kind of felt that uh she was a big business woman and she she could do most anything and the thing that would have mattered to her the most, she wasn't able to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Saving her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Do you think it was only then that she allowed herself to experience her loss?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s989">You know, we're all strong during bad times, but we fall apart during good ones, and I think that's the time when when it finally hit her.</span> <span id="s990">I've survived, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: What did it mean to you to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I don't know whether it really meant anything to come to America.</span> <span id="s993">It's what what I've experienced in America that became to mean quite a bit to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And what's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Oh...going to school, freedom, uh being able to walk the streets, being able to hold my head up high, being an equal even though I wasn't an equal.</span> <span id="s996">I was still living a _nightmare, but nonetheless I had all the opportunity and could take advantage of those opportunities.</span> <span id="s997">I was an equal in respect with being able to do what I..</span> <span id="s998">.</span> <span id="s999">the goals that I had set for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Did you return to religious observances that you weren't able to during the war?</span> <span id="s1001">A: Oh I'm probably less observant now than I was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Uh I think integrating meant an awful lot.</span> <span id="s1004">Going out on a date and having to go to a kosher restaurant and uh not be able to go out on a Saturday night up until a certain time, not being able to get a job that I needed so badly other than working on Saturday.</span> <span id="s1005">My first experience was I went with a friend of mine from school to to look for for a job, a summer job, and every job I went for I had to work on Saturday.</span> <span id="s1006">I had to ride on Saturday to get to my job.</span> <span id="s1007">I think it's little by little uh those feelings uh break down.</span> <span id="s1008">You know, you take...you do one thing and then you're allowed to do the next one.</span> <span id="s1009">It's...unless you keep a very strict observance, there's no such thing as just slightly strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Uh the adjustment...there were good...there were many good things about being in America, but the adjustment was not easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: It really wasn't too difficult for me because when I came to my uncle's house, I became the fourth daughter.</span> <span id="s1012">Probably being a little bit resented by the others but uh my uncle was a a very...very smart and good natured man.</span> <span id="s1013">The first example...was very important for young ladies on their sixteenth birthday to get their first fur coat.</span> <span id="s1014">Well low and behold, his daughter was made to wait to get her first fur coat until I came here and we got identical ones.</span> <span id="s1015">Needless to say, I can understand now why my cousin resented me a little bit.</span> <span id="s1016">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Uh what is your life like today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: What is my life like today?</span> <span id="s1019">I guess the same as any American family.</span> <span id="s1020">My children went to college.</span> <span id="s1021">They've got nice professions.</span> <span id="s1022">They are devoted children, to a point.</span> <span id="s1023">We try to let them live their own lives, and sometimes they think we...they probably put more...more requirements on them than what they would like but uh nonetheless we have a good relationship with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Why is it important for you to do this, for you to document your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Well, when I survived the war, probably not until I finished school I should say...even in school because uh when I went to high school uh Hebrew was offered and uh I needed a language requirement and that was an easy language requirement.</span> <span id="s1026">I could get a lot of...a lot of credits by just taking one semester and taking the regent's examination, but I became very much aware of the fact of of passing on Judaism.</span> <span id="s1027">Uh amazingly enough, there was a a German woman.</span> <span id="s1028">She was my counselor, and she was very apprehensive at first when she found out...when I was assigned to her.</span> <span id="s1029">Ms. Reef (ph) felt like she had to set things straight and probably helped me a great deal in judging people uh on their merits.</span> <span id="s1030">She helped me a great deal get through school and adjust to school and uh accept I guess some of the prejudices, I guess, in school and deal with them and make me aware that I have some...something to pass on too.</span> <span id="s1031">Uh she got me to substitute in Hebrew class.</span> <span id="s1032">If the teacher couldn't make it, there were very few Hebrew uh substitutes, and I guess I was a better substitute than anybody they could get to babysit and that's sort of like passing on.</span> <span id="s1033">I remember saying...her saying to me, well you know it and you can impart more than somebody else.</span> <span id="s1034">It became a matter of imparting.</span> <span id="s1035">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: What is important for you to impart to future generations about the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Oh, our heritage.</span> <span id="s1038">The the Jewish experiences.</span> <span id="s1039">I think those experiences repeat and repeat themselves.</span> <span id="s1040">I hope they never...will never have to experience anything even remotely similar to to what happened in Europe.</span> <span id="s1041">I think there is an underlying anti-Semitism no matter where we are.</span> <span id="s1042">I think it comes a lot from jealousy.</span> <span id="s1043">Uh I really feel that in Poland it came a lot from jealousy.</span> <span id="s1044">The Jews were...they were not allowed to own land.</span> <span id="s1045">It was...it was by necessity that they became the trades people.</span> <span id="s1046">Uh by necessity that uh they they were the merchant class.</span> <span id="s1047">They were the middle class.</span> <span id="s1048">There were a lot of poor people too, but there were also a lot of quite well-to-do Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: There's Judaism in passing on observances, but there's also...what is the the importance to you to pass on your experiences of the Holocaust to maybe your own grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1050">What is the value in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: The value in that is to beware if...if you see anything leading in that direction to take steps before it happens.</span> <span id="s1052">Uh I'm very much for B'nai B'rith (ph) because they are...they're on the look out for anything that may develop into something that can go further, that that can become destructive and detrimental.</span> <span id="s1053">Uh I think...I think hate comes from jealousy.</span> <span id="s1054">Uh there's no question about it that Hitler's being able to control and uh being able to get the Poles to do what they did against the Jews, came from the fact that uh taking...taking away the the focus on where the people should focus and focusing it on hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Do you think it could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: It's happened how many times before?</span> <span id="s1057">They say history repeats itself.</span> <span id="s1058">I hope not in my times and not in my children's times and my grandchildren's times.</span> <span id="s1059">And I hope this country continues to to be watchful and that we'll never know anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1061">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: We have one more question.</span> <span id="s1065">OK.</span> <span id="s1066">It is...OK.</span> <span id="s1067">Your cousin the photographer, was he taking Nazi propaganda photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1069">I'm not sure what kind of photos.</span> <span id="s1070">I think he took mostly photos of the Germans to send back home.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't think that they were propaganda.</span> <span id="s1072">He was...he was a portrait photographer.</span> <span id="s1073">He lives in Israel now and uh he had two sons.</span> <span id="s1074">Uh his wife survived.</span> <span id="s1075">She was a telephone operator and she was hidden by by the man that ran the the telephone office and we didn't know that she survived until much, much later.</span> <span id="s1076">They left Poland.</span> <span id="s1077">She met her husband.</span> <span id="s1078">They are slightly related actually.</span> <span id="s1079">They are sort of distant cousins.</span> <span id="s1080">Uh they met back again in Poland and married and when they were...when the Jews were I should say not so kindly asked to leave, they immigrated to Israel and they've been living there since.</span> <span id="s1081">But I know he was an excellent portrait photographer, because in Israel he made his living also as a portrait photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1083">Were there other mothers and children in the partisan group or were you the only ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s1085">Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So you are...you were the only mother and child...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: In our...in our group...in our area.</span> <span id="s1088">Nobody that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1090">Do we have any other questions.</span> <span id="s1091">OK.</span> <span id="s1092">I think that you address this to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Let me ask you uh why do you feel that the partisans made an exception and accepted you into the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: I'm not sure really why.</span> <span id="s1095">I think Mother knew a lot of the people.</span> <span id="s1096">Uh she was in contact with them.</span> <span id="s1097">She tried to get some people over.</span> <span id="s1098">I really...I can't guess at this point.</span> <span id="s1099">And there were...there were several Jewish people from our area there, so that may have had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s1100">The men trying to to protect the only woman there, the only Jewish...well, there were several Jewish women.</span> <span id="s1101">I shouldn't say the only one, but there were not uh...they had male protection.</span> <span id="s1102">We didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: I was looking at you...it's amazing how I can talk and not cry and you were crying, and you know, I was thinking to myself...I don't know...I guess at this point I'm hardened to it, to a point where the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
