Q: So up to that point, aside from the teacher that you had in school, who di -- who spoke to you that way, yi -- yi -- how would you describe your childhood, as something pleasant and that you could do what you want?
A: It wasn't too pleasant. There were many anti-Semites between the P-Polish neighbors, and it wasn’t too pleasant, but we were used to it. I remember one day, I was child, I -- I t -- probably 10 years or nine years old. And down the street went a Polish clerk with a suitcase, and I just told him -- this was on April fools, and I told him, sir you lost your suitcase.

A: No, I didn’t hear about th -- about the Kristallnacht.
Q: What did you -- what was your -- your reaction when you saw your first German soldier? What was your reaction when you saw your first German soldier?

Q: He would come home at night?
A: He came home at night, yes.
Q: What’s it like for a child to see the father going off to do something like this?

Q: How did you feel that school was closed, was that upsetting to you?
A: No, we knew fr-from newspapers, whoever it is, they closed, the Germans closed all the s -- all the schools.
Q: Let’s back up a little bit. When germ -- the Germans came into Poland on September first, what -- do you remember what your thoughts in Sanok were?
A: The Germans came first to the border with Poland to the west of Poland, this border. They came to Poland and I remember this from the newspapers from the -- they were advancing, advancing and eventually they going to come to us.

A: Oh, my parents. They told me to stay home, not to go out and not to get in trouble with them.
Q: And then your father continued to clean the streets. Did you ever see him cleaning streets?
A: No, I never saw him. He just told us that he’s cleaning the streets. I never saw him cleaning, I didn't go out of the house.
Q: How was his health, your father’s health?
A: He was in good health. He was in good health, but he didn’t complain too much, he just -- he just said that they gave him to clean, he has to clean.
Q: How did he clean the streets, do you know?
A: They gave him a broom, and with the broom he cleaned the streets.
Q: Did you have any contact with your friends, then?
A: No, I have no contact with nobody then.
Q: Cause you were staying inside the house.
A: I was staying inside because my parents told me not to go out.
Q: What does a German soldier look to a 12 and a half year old boy?

Q: Were you afraid of them?
A: We were afraid of them, yes.
Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah in December of ’39?
A: No, I did not have a Bar Mitzvah, because in December we weren’t any more in Sanok.
Q: Wh-When did you leave Sanok?
A: I think we left about two months with the Germans. The Germans told us that whoever -- what’s happened -- I’ll give you the [indecipherable] -- what’s happened, German took half of Poland and the Russians took the other half. So Sanok was actually on the border between the Russians and Germans. So the Germans told us one day, whoever wants, all the Jews, whoever wants to leave Sanok can go to the Russians. So we went to the Russian side. My mother had over there two or three sisters, in Lvov, which this was occupied by the Russians then. So she went to stay with the sisters.
Q: And were you in Sa-Sanok when the synagogue there was destroyed?
A: I don’t remember when the synagogue was destroyed. This I don’t remember.
Q: So, after two months your family tells you you’re going to be leaving. What was your reaction to be leaving the town that you were born in?
A: I think I was happy because we hated the Germans. I figure maybe I’m going to have more freedom.
Q: But you’re leaving your friends.
A: We didn’t see friends any more because everybody was afraid to -- to go out, the Jewish people.
Q: You said when you were younger that you had g-gone to your grandparent’s farm. Had you done any other traveling outside of Sanok besides going to the farm? This is before the war.
A: Yes, I remember traveling once to a hospital in Lvov. I put some cotton into my ear and I couldn’t get it out. So they had to go to the hospital in Lvov and over there they took out the cotton.
Q: And any other experiences of traveling besides that?
A: No, I didn’t go no -- no other places. Yeah, if I went to the farm, we stopped over in my uncle’s town Rymanów. But usually we went every year to the farm.
Q: So here you’re asked to leave your town that you grew up in and to go to Lvov, and you --
A: What?
Q: Now you -- you’ve been asked -- your parents are telling you that you’re going to be leaving Sanok and going to Lvov.
A: Lvov.

A: More -- more free.
Q: More free. Did you take anything special with you? What did your family take, what did you take with you when you left?

A: No, nobody else. Only me, my brother and the parents.
Q: How did you get to Lvov?
A: We took the train to Rymanów, where my uncle lived. From there, horse and carriage.
Q: And tha --
A: To -- to the [indecipherable]
Q: And then you get there and you stay with your aunts? Your mother’s family in Lvov?
A: My father’s family.
Q: Oh, it was your father’s family in Lvov?
A: Family -- no, Lvov? No, Lvov was my -- my mother’s family. Oh, yes we stayed in their apartments. Only me, me and my mother stayed in one sister’s apartment. My brother stayed in another sister’s apartment and my father, he stayed with some club over there because was no room for all of us to stay in the same apartment.
Q: Was it dangerous for your father to leave Sanok since he -- since he had been doing forced labor? Was it dangerous for him to go?
A: No, they -- they let him go. They told whoever is Jewish, wants to go to the Russian side, is welcome to -- to leave. Take just your clothes and you can leave.
Q: And how many days did they give you to do this?
A: I think about few days, not too long. Maybe less than a week.

And over there she brought be -- bread and cookies home. So we had the holiday then. Don’t forget, during the war this was, when the Russians were at war with the Germans. Was no too much food, even for the Russians they didn’t have food. So to work in a bakery was something very good then.
Q: What were the Russian soldiers or Russian guards like to you in that village? What was the treatment of the Russian guards to you in that village?
A: The treatment was good. I -- I remember I got sick from the cold weather, I ha -- I had -- I had ne -- pneumonia. The Russians sent a doctor and they -- they gave me injections and I became healthy, yeah. No, then -- the treatment was good from the Russians, oh yeah, cannot complain.

A: No contact.
Q: Did you, when you were in the mountains, did your mother try to observe any holidays?
A: Nobody observe holidays, we even didn’t know probably how to observe holidays there. Nobody knew about holidays there. They knew about Russian holidays, but not about religious holidays.
Q: So there was no such thing as Shabbat or Passover for you --
A: No.
Q: -- during those years?
A: Passover wa -- the Russians didn’t supply us m-matzos. We were lucky we have bread.

Q: -- that those Russian guards treated you better than the Russians did in Russia.
A: Correct.
Q: How did the Russians treat you in Russia?
A: They knew -- th-they were free people, the Russians in Russia, in that town. We were on -- on a work force like -- my mother, not me, we were in a camp, outside that village. We were in a walled camp. So we didn’t have no connections with the Russians who were free.
Q: Did you have to wear any identifying mark on your clothing showing that you were in that camp?
A: No. No, we di -- no IDs on the coats or whatever it is.
Q: Did you have special idife -- ID papers?

Q: What was your brother’s state of mind?
A: My brother didn’t bother too much. He was -- he wanted also that the father should come back, but he probably went to school also there already. This I don’t remember. But he -- he was resigned whatever it is. He was four years younger than me.

A: In the summer, no, we just had -- we just had vacation and that’s all. We didn’t go no -- we couldn’t go nowhere. We not -- we’re not allowed to go nowhere, we’re in a camp. They treat us as nice, but we -- still we’re in a camp, in a walled camp.

Q: Did you celebrate in any way?
A: No, we didn’t celebrate. We just -- the -- the Russians were d-dancing that I remember, they were very [indecipherable] but we weren’t [indecipherable] we didn’t celebrate. We were just -- I -- I think in that camp we were about a couple hundred people just, that’s all. We didn’t celebrate.
Q: It was a small -- it was a small camp.
A: Yeah, it was a small ca -- no, there was outside the town -- the town wasn’t so small. It was outside the town just a -- a -- a walled camp.
Q: But you said there were a couple hundred people in the camp.
A: Yeah, I think so, there was a couple hundred people.
Q: So you hear the war was over, and then what did you do?
A: When the war was over the Russian told us if we want to go back to Poland, we can go. So we went on a train. We told all the people and we went -- but thi-this wasn’t a freight, this was already a regular train, and we went to Poland with the train from there. We came to -- you want -- we came to Poland. In Sanok was already non-Jewish people [indecipherable]

Q: Did you go back to your house -- your apartment?
A: No, we didn’t go -- maybe we g -- went -- go apartment. The apartment, somebody else lived already. Maybe we went back to the apartment, didn’t think about it. But then I think it was we still could feel the anti-Semitism in Poland, there were always anti-Semites in Poland, even when -- but they -- they -- then we could -- we heard that mostly Jewish people are going to Germany by tr -- by train because Poland was no Jews.
Q: When you said you could feel the anti-Semitism, can you give me an example?
A: It was only two days when I came back, but I -- I remind myself now the Polish people, I da -- wouldn’t say all of them, but a lot of them were anti-Semites. They didn’t -- they hate the Jews.
Q: Did you have any particular experiences of that?

A: Well sh -- it was very bad. She -- we -- we felt very bad in Sanok. We felt like we became strangers over there.
Q: Did it look at all familiar?
A: And may -- and mine was up -- maybe somebody of the Polish people say to my mother, why you came back? I -- they didn’t say it to me, I think they said it to my mother. Then my father was also ready, he was united with us, he also came.
Q: To Sanok? A: No, he ca -- they let him go first to the place where we went.
Q: He -- he -- in -- in the mountains?

A: Other di -- other people went to that town, so we went to that town.
Q: What were your thoughts about leaving Poland a second time? A: Oh, we were happy then. We heard on the newspapers they had -- they had the big pogrom in Kielce, if you n -- they had the big pogrom in Kielce, from -- also the Jews who came from Russia, they went through Kielce and then the Polish people made the pogrom, they killed something there, I don’t remember how many. So after that we saw we are lucky that we are leaving Poland.
Q: How long did you stay in Russia after the war was over, before you went back to Poland?
A: Listen, I think it was in ’40 -- May ’45 the war was over. I think it was in the beginning ’46.

A: Very good. The Americans took care of us with the -- with the food, with the --we have rooms over there, we used to -- we lived in a -- used to be over there a -- a -- a -- German soldiers used to live, so they gave us that thing, we -- the conditions were good. Plenty of food we had already there, and this was the best conditions in the war since the war started.

A: I went -- I went to ORT school -- ORT. This is --
Q: The ORT. ORT school.

A: From that camp wer -- in Russia.
Q: But were there -- were there any other people in Noyome from other places?
A: They were from other places also. I don’t remember what places, but those two, we were friends even in that camp in Russia, so wo -- we decided probably with my parents, all together to go to that Noyome camp.
Q: And so you stayed there and you said you went to the ORT school?
A: I went to ORT sch -- I went to ORT school. I picked up some trade which I don’t remember, I never used the trade, I don’t remember what was it. And I don’t think I finished that school because in ’48 they came from Israel and they ask -- Israel became -- wa-wanted to be independent, and they ask if we want to go to Israel, so I went.
Q: Why did you want to go to Israel? Had your parents been Zionists when you were young?
A: A little bit on a volunteer, and a little w-was pressure. The Israeli government pressured th-the young people -- I was 20 years old, pressured the young people to go to Israel [indecipherable] to be soldiers.
Q: Were your parents Zionists back in Poland when you were a child? Were your parents Zionists when you were growing up, when you were a child? A: I don’t think so they were Zionists, I don’t think so. I never heard them talking about Zionism. May -- if they would be Zionists they would leave Poland, they would go to Palestine then. I don’t think they were Zionists.

A: My -- I didn’t want to leave to -- my family, but I was a -- probably by then a little Z-Zionistic inclined.
Q: Did you speak Hebrew at that point?
A: No. I learn Hebrew in -- in the army, in the Israeli army.
Q: When did you leave Germany to go to Israel?
A: In 1940 -- I think was May -- May or m -- or April s -- it doesn’t --
Q: Before independence?
A: Before the independence, yes.
Q: And how did you get there?
A: The very Israeli people who took us to the border with the train, to the borders of Czechoslovakia, France, Italy and then with a ship to go to Israel, at night.
Q: So this was done in secret?
A: Nobody should -- nobody should know. At night we used to travel with the train to those three countries, Czechoslova -- Czechoslovakia, France, Italy.

A: Wasn’t a city. It was a camp, in Beriakof. It wasn’t a city, was a little village, or whatever was it.
Q: W-We’ll get to Israel in a minute. What I wanted to ask you was, when you left Poland and came to Germany, and you put your foot down on German soil in this camp, what was it like for you? Here it was that it was the Germans who had waged the war, the Germans who had caused you all these troubles, and now you’re in their country of Germany. Was -- was that difficult for you to be in Germany?
A: It wasn’t too difficult. I wasn’t thinking that way. I was thinking we are free, we have food, so it’s better than it was til now. Ca-Can you close it? I have to take -- [tape break]
Q: I had asked you about what it felt like to put your foot down on German soil after the history of Germany. Now I’d like to ask you, what was it like to put your foot down on Israeli soil when you arrived --
A: It was very exciting. We are very happy, excited to be on our ow-own homeland.
Q: You felt that this was your homeland?
A: Yes, I felt this was my homeland. I became a Zionist.
Q: So after all you had been through during the war, you felt like you were home?
A: I felt that it’s time to be home.
Q: On the voyage over, on the boat, did they do -- teach you anything, or --
A: No. They started teaching us in that military camp in Beriakof. M-Military exercises.
Q: And did you wear a uniform?
A: Yes, we all got uniforms.
Q: What’s it like to put on an Israeli uniform?

Q: Can we talk now a little bit about your feelings and your thoughts about what you went through during the war? Do you feel you would be a different person if you hadn’t gone through the experience that you went through?
A: It’s very hard to say. Maybe I would go to college, maybe I would be a lawyer or a doctor. But otherwise, I don’t know, because I -- I like -- even today I like the law studies, and maybe I would be something else.
Q: Do you feel that you lost your childhood, because this happened when you were very young?
A: Yes, I feel I lost my childhood. First, I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah, this is already a big loss. And then I had to finish high school in two countries. So I think I lost my childhood.
Q: Did you ever get it back?
A: Never got it back.
Q: When your children were your age when you had to leave your home, did that bring back memories for you?
A: When I?
Q: When your children were your age when you had to leave Sanok, you know, when the Germans came in and you had to leave Sanok?
A: Yeah.
Q: When your children were that age, did that remind you of what you went through when you were their age?
A: No, because I were -- because I left Sanok under different circumstances. They were here -- they were born here, they were free to do whatever they want. They didn’t have g -- Germans over their head.
Q: No, no, no, but I meant, when they became the same age you were in -- in Sanok. You were --
A: 12.
Q: -- 12 or 13. When they were 12 or 13, did you think about what you had gone through when you were 12 or 13?
A: No, I don’t think so. I didn’t think th-that way.
Q: How do you describe yourself now? Are you Jewish, are you Polish, are you American, are you Israeli? How do you describe yourself?
A: I am Jewish. In the beginning I used to say I am Israeli, but how long can you say you’re Israeli when you live here? So I’m Jewish.
Q: Do you feel any connection to Poland?
A: No, not whatsoever. I would never visit them even.
Q: Why not?
A: Bad memories. I always knew the anti-Semite, most of them anyway. And I didn't have good memories from Poland. This -- this doesn’t -- I di -- even don’t think to visit them.
Q: Did you tell your children about what you went through when they were growing up?
A: Oh, I told my daughter. My son is already quite a few years in Hawaii.
Q: No, but while they were growing up. When they were young --
A: No, I didn’t --
Q: -- did you tell them what your background was?
A: No, I just in -- I just -- my daughter knows everything what’s happened to me all during the war. But I don’t think it -- maybe my -- my son knows about it. But I didn’t specially told them. Maybe wa -- during the -- just accidentally I put some words there. I was in Russia, I was in camp, or the Germans, whatever it is.
Q: How did you impart Jewish religion, Jewish culture to your children?
A: They both -- my daughter went to a Jewish Hebrew school here. And in fact is also my son went to a Hebrew school here. They know they are Jewish, but observant Jews, I don’t think they are. I -- I don’t know if I am observant now.
Q: Do you think about your experiences and what you went through, often?
A: Sometimes. I think what I went through during my years. But it brings me bad memories.
Q: Is there any noise or any sight today that triggers you? Do you see something today, or hear something that makes you think of what you went through?
A: Where, United States?
Q: You know, a certain sound or a certain sight or a smell that make -- that reminds you.
A: Sometimes when -- when I reme -- when I rema -- bring me thoughts about it when President Reagan went to -- to the concentration camp over there. So maybe I was thinking about it.
Q: But there’s no specific -- I mean, like for instance when you see snow, or something like that, does that remind you of the work camp in the mountains?
A: No.
Q: Is it difficult for you to be on a train?
A: On a tr --
Q: Is it difficult for you to be on a train because you were in a train when you went to the mountains?
A: No. I don’t remember when I was on the train, I -- in New York I am going by train every day. No.
Q: Do you think you were at an advantage that you were so young when this happened, that you really weren’t aware of the danger that you were in? You were a young -- you were a young child then.
A: Oh, sure.
Q: Was that an advantage?
A: Probably was advantage. I didn’t go to work with the Germans. I didn’t go to work with the Russians. So, because I was young, this was a advantage.
Q: Are you angry that you had to go through these experiences and other people didn’t, let’s say people, Jews in the United States. Does that make you angry that you had to go through that?
A: No, no. Look, some people go here, some people go their way. I don’t think this would be any [indecipherable]. No.
Q: What were some of your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?
A: I wanted he should get the death sentence, which he got. He deserves it. I was watching on TV the trial every day and I thought, oh, how good is that th -- that they got him.
Q: Do you think that you have more sensitivity to what’s happening today in other countries because you lived through a time of restrictions and difficulty and danger?
A: Other countries. Look, I think have to be very careful and other Hitlers wouldn’t come up.
Q: Is that possible, for another Hitler to come up?
A: It’s possible if -- it’s possible if -- they shouldn’t let another Hitler to come to power.
Q: What should people do?
A: Vote the right way.
Q: Pardon?
A: Vote the right way.
Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today?
A: What do I think about Germany today? I think they are forgiven because Israeli government, they took reparation for them. Once you take reparation, you have to forgive the person. And they forgive. They forgive Germany. They have diplomatic relations with them and everything, so I go along.
Q: So you forgive also?
A: So I go along. If they -- if they forgive, I forgive.
Q: Do you get any reparations?
A: No, I didn’t get. I don’t think I was in the concentration camp, so if -- if -- people who were in concentration camp, they deserve it.
Q: Are you more comfortable today around people who came from Europe and experienced the war than you are among people who did not?
A: Yes, I am more comfortable today.
Q: A-Are you more comfortable today being with people who experienced the wartime --
A: This --
Q: -- than with people who did not experience the war?
A: No, no, I don’t think this is any -- and fact is, I have more friends Americans than people who were in concentration camps. This is not affect -- affected. People are people.
Q: What language do you think in?
A: I am thinking mostly in Hebrew and in English. I never -- I never think nothing -- I still speak a little Polish, but I never think Polish and I never -- I don’t have with whom to talk for if e -- to speak Polish I don’t have with whom. But my mostly thought is in the -- is in Hebrew, in -- oh, sometimes in Yiddish. I’ve also s-start forgetting the language already.
Q: What about Russian?
A: I don’t remember. And I finished high school and I don’t remember Russian. My wife remembers few Russian words, she was also in Russia, but I don’t remember nothing.
Q: Do you think that the political views that you have today, your political views are influenced by what you went through?
A: My political views?
Q: Are they influenced by what you went through and the dangers you faced as a young person?
A: Some places, some thing. Like I would never -- I would never vote for somebody who belonged to KKK. Like what’s his name, Duke, or even Pat Buchanan. He doesn’t get my vote.
Q: During the Civil Rights movement here in the United States --
A: In the 60’s.
Q: -- what were your feelings then? Because you had lost your civil rights in Poland.
A: The truth is, I didn’t have no views whether Civil Rights. I just was -- I just came to this country and I didn’t have no views on the Civil Rights.
Q: How often do you think about those war years? Do you think more as you’ve gotten older, about what you went through?
A: Which years?
Q: The wartime years.
A: I think I’ve forgotten about them. Maybe years ago I was thinking more.
Q: Well, is there anything else that you want to say about the interview?
A: [indecipherable]
Q: Want -- wait a moment? [tape break] I had asked you if there was anything else you wanted to talk about.
A: Yes, I remember my Aunt Et -- my mother’s sister from Lvov, she used to tell us that -- how she survived the Nazi Germany. She -- she was a blonde woman, she didn’t look Jewish and she was hired by the German officer’s club to be a chef. And she cooked for them, she baked for them and this how she survived the Nazi regime. And she became such a good cook that after she came to the United States, we used to go for Thanksgiving to dinner. This the ever -- the best dinners what we ever had.
Q: And what about her family? Her husband?
A: She passed away.
Q: No, did she have a husband?
A: Husband was killed one day before the end of the war. She -- he was walking the streets, he thought that the war was over. In the meantime a Polish man saw him, he recognized him, he called down a German s -- officer or soldier, he said, he is Jew. The offi -- the German soldier t-took him and we never saw him since then.
Q: What happened to ma -- other members of your family?
A: My other sister, where we stayed in Lvov was int -- and two other -- there were five sisters. Two survived and three were killed.
Q: Do you know where they were killed?
A: They were killed in -- in Lvov, when the Germany occupied Lvov. Only survivor is my mother and the one who was a cook for the German officers.

A: Sapka, Tonka, and Ithka, the three other ones.
Q: Wa -- any other relatives that you know about?
A: Now, from my father’s, the -- the -- the gran -- the grandparents were killed. Now, my f --
Q: Y-Your father’s parents?
A: My father’s parents were killed.
Q: How?
A: I don’t know. Nobody knows. My father’s brother did -- from Rymanów was killed, with his wife. How, nobody knows. Only w-we survived who -- because we were in s -- in -- in Russia, in Soviet Union. And the other way, Etka survived because she was a chef for the German army and they didn’t know that she is Jewish.
Q: Do you think about the relatives that you’ve lost, frequently?
A: I don’t remember them too much already. I was only 12 years old. I don’t remember those too much. Happened to be -- you know, happened to be I remembered those names, but I -- I didn’t think about those names for 30 - 40 - 50 years.
Q: Has the world learned lessons? The lessons it should learn?
A: I don’t think so. They still have all kind happening -- I don’t -- I don’t think so, they all -- the only lesson what the world should -- should learn, not to let another Hitler to come to power. Whoever country it is.
Q: And that they can do by voting the right way, you said.
A: What? Q: And you said they can do that by voting the right way.
A: By voting, yeah, th -- by voting their conscience, the right way. Not to give a -- no dictatorship to come to power.
Q: Does education play a role?
A: Education plays a big role. Educated people know what’s going on.
Q: Yet Germany was a very educated -- Germany was a very educated society.
A: Yes, Germany came to power because Hitler promised them he will make big Germany, everybody’s going to be rich. And he -- he -- that he came from -- to power. Then he wanted occupy one land after another, and one country after another, and this is now very important, the -- the United States shouldn’t let another -- as a bold power, shouldn’t let another country to come a Hitler as the head of the state.
Q: If you were to meet a German on the street today, would you be uncomfortable? Do you st --
A: No --
Q: -- do you hold -- hold a grudge against the Germans? A: No, I used to work with -- when I came to this country, I used to work with two Germans, non-Jewish. I was -- I didn’t feel nothing abou -- about them. Okay, maybe because they were many years here, and they w -- have nothing to do with the German Hitler, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable. Like I said before, it’s forgiven. You take money, it’s forgiven. I didn’t take money.
Q: So why do you forgive them, you did not take money.
A: Well, you cannot hate somebody forever. Can you hate somebody forever? Has to c-come an end to it.
Q: Well, is there again, as I said, anything additional that you wanted to say that we haven’t talked about?
A: I’d -- I tried to remind myself something, but I think everything what I remember, I said it. Don’t forget, this is already 60 years ago, I cannot remember everything.
