CLARK INTERVIEWER: KAETHE SOLOMON CAMP: MAUTHAUSEN DATE: MAY 21, 1981</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: My name is Kaethe Solomon.</span> <span id="s3">I am interviewing Mr. Franklin Lee Clark, who lives at 4 Lasser Drive in Cartersville, Georgia.</span> <span id="s4">We are sitting in his lovely kitchen.</span> <span id="s5">His date of birth is 9/16/15.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Clark's age at the time of liberation was 29.</span> <span id="s7">His prospective profession at the beginning of the war was that he was a college student and at that time Mr. Clark was a part-time clerk.</span> <span id="s8">He is a graduate of William and Mary College.</span> <span id="s9">Mr. Clark is now retired, but his profession before his retirement was sales manager for the Even Metal Reel Company, a subsidiary of Goodyear.</span> <span id="s10">His military unit was commander of Headquarters Battery, 11th Armored Division Artillery, part of General Patton's 3rd Army.</span> <span id="s11">His rank at the time of liberation was Major.</span> <span id="s12">He shared with me that he came in at the bottom as a private and left as a Major.</span> <span id="s13">He was part of the liberation effort at Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.</span> <span id="s14">Mr. Clark, first of all, let me thank you for going to the trouble of collecting all that material.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I am glad to find it.</span> <span id="s16">Q: This is very precious.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Benny Stein, whom I mentioned, is a friend of mine and he got involved a little bit in this.</span> <span id="s18">Sometime in a conversation it would come out, and he said, “You were involved in that?”</span> <span id="s19">and I said, “Yes, I got pictures.”</span> <span id="s20">“Oh my Lord,” he said, “get those.</span> <span id="s21">I'd love to see those and then pass them on.”</span> <span id="s22">And I looked and looked and looked and I couldn’t find the pictures, and then last night my wife remembered we had an old refrigerator down in the basement and I gave it to somebody who needed it.</span> <span id="s23">Right next to it we had an old chest of drawers and it came to her mind, I bet that stuff is in the chest of drawers.</span> <span id="s24">So we went down and looked in a couple of waste baskets, and here was all this stuff, where she had hastily put it in there, and I was so tickled to find these pictures.</span> <span id="s25">I don't have as many as I’d like.</span> <span id="s26">There is a picture I took of the interior of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Let me start with a few questions first and then we'll be able to use those pictures to refresh your memory.</span> <span id="s28">How did you find out about this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: One of my good friends is Major Bousch who was in charge of the division of Military Police.</span> <span id="s30">The minute that the Infantry got there and took the place over it was turned over to the M P's immediately to handle.</span> <span id="s31">He called me on the radio and he said, “You won't believe this, come down here and take a look at this.”</span> <span id="s32">He told me where it was, so I hopped in a jeep and went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: That was a personal call?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: From this Major who took it over.</span> <span id="s35">Q: Were you the only one he called?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I can’t say for sure.</span> <span id="s37">I know that I’m one that he called.</span> <span id="s38">I am sure that he reported it right into Headquarters and to the medical people, etc. because the whole Corps, not just the Division -- all the medical officers, the doctors, and corpsmen, and the technicians, and everything -- were immediately sent down there, because of course typhus was a big fear, and there were stacks of bodies that had not been buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Their information about the camp then was gotten because somebody happened to stop along.</span> <span id="s40">[Unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: To my knowledge there was no previous...we were just advancing.</span> <span id="s42">An Armored Division clears the road to the ditches, then the Infantry comes on behind and cleans out the woods, because we have to stay on the roads because we have these big vehicles.</span> <span id="s43">Combat Command A of the 11th Armored Division, which was commanded by General Holbrook, was the one that actually had that sector and discovered the camp.</span> <span id="s44">He is unfortunately dead now, but I kept in contact with him for a number of years after he retired from the service, but he was a fine gentlemen.</span> <span id="s45">Anyway, as soon as that happened, they brought in supplies and food and what clothing they could gather because they had both men and women in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: If you were to take yourself back to that t ime....</span> <span id="s47">A: We are going back, you know, almost 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: That's a long time, and certainly not the easiest time to go back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No.</span> <span id="s50">As a matter of fact, when I sent these pictures to my wife, I told her to look at them so she would see what was going on, but then burn them because I didn't want them around.</span> <span id="s51">I didn't even want to be reminded of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And that's why we so appreciate your willingness to review that part of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I haven't talked about it for years and years.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s55">If you think about that time you entered that camp.</span> <span id="s56">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: When I got there, this gate was open and controlled by the Military Police.</span> <span id="s58">This was the main gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: It was swung back.</span> <span id="s61">It was open.</span> <span id="s62">Q: A wooden door?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s64">Heavy wooden door.</span> <span id="s65">I walked in and the first thing that I saw was this on one side of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Are these pictures labeled on the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, they are not.</span> <span id="s68">But you can label them any way you like.</span> <span id="s69">Q: Is that okay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Sure, fine, you can do anything with them you like.</span> <span id="s71">This is the gate to it, and I don't know what that wording up there is.</span> <span id="s72">Maybe you can find somebody who can read that.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: It's hard to decipher right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I don’t even know what language.</span> <span id="s75">It’s not in German, I don’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: No, it’s not in German.</span> <span id="s77">It looks like Italian or Spanish.</span> <span id="s78">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: There were also Polish people in there.</span> <span id="s80">There were Hungarians in there and Yugoslavians and Austrians....</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Austrians.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Strictly laborers.</span> <span id="s83">Q: Slave labors?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Slave laborers.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: You went in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: [Unintelligible] And here are these barracks, lines of them, and you know where the word deadline came from?</span> <span id="s87">It came from this notorious southern camp during the Civil War.</span> <span id="s88">They had a line, and anyone who crossed that line -- you were dead.</span> <span id="s89">And that's where the word deadline came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: I have never heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: This is the deadline.</span> <span id="s92">This fence was not electrified.</span> <span id="s93">This fence was.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">You could walk in between it, but you didn't dare touch this fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s96">Did somebody tell you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No, we found out.</span> <span id="s98">You could see it.</span> <span id="s99">The generators are here.</span> <span id="s100">Q: When you walked in, were you by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No.</span> <span id="s102">I had my executive officers with me all the time.</span> <span id="s103">There was Lt.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">McCurry, who was my Battery Executive officer, and I am sure I had a jeep driver.</span> <span id="s105">I am sure it was an Italian boy from New Jersey named Lupinachi, which is Italian for “Night Wolf.”</span> <span id="s106">He was a remarkable guy.</span> <span id="s107">He had the best night vision of anybody I ever had seen.</span> <span id="s108">We could drive blackout over these shelled-out roads and things, and I couldn't even see the road and he would be driving, dodging holes.</span> <span id="s109">So he had the right name, Lupinachi, Night Wolf.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: When you walked in there, were there guards there?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No, they had already rounded up the German guards and one of them almost got away, and that's another story in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: A day later I was just west of Linz, along the Danube River, and there was a group of these obvious concentration camp people.</span> <span id="s114">They had rounded up the German camp commander and by the time I got there, it was too late.</span> <span id="s115">Otherwise, I would have done something about it.</span> <span id="s116">They drowned him in the Danube River.</span> <span id="s117">I could have scared them away because I had three men with us and we had machine guns and all that, but I would not have shot any of them anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You say a day later?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: This was a day later, but evidently he had gotten out before the troops got there and was trying to work his way someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And how were you informed about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I was just driving down the highway and I saw it.</span> <span id="s122">There was some commotion going on between the highway and the river, and I looked down and there was a bunch of inmates.</span> <span id="s123">And by the time I got there, they had gotten him into the Danube River and held him under until he drowned.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: How were the inmates dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Very, very poorly.</span> <span id="s126">Many of them naked.</span> <span id="s127">Q: Any type of uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No.</span> <span id="s129">I walked into one of the girls' barracks or whatever it was with Major Bousch.</span> <span id="s130">They were three tiers high, and just wide enough apart that you could get in and climb to the top bunk, and many of them were quite sick.</span> <span id="s131">Probably from malnutrition and everything else that went with this whole thing.</span> <span id="s132">Their clothes, what they had, was in tatters, and some of them were hurrying up to cover them.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How many inmates did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I would estimate males probably 800 to 1,000 and females maybe 300 or 400.</span> <span id="s135">Q: Any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I didn't see any children, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: In the barracks, when you went in there, was there anything else besides the bunks that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: There was a little room in the girls’ barracks -- and I have always wondered about this, because I didn't inquire -- like a little orderly room, a little private [unintelligible] at the end of the building that you would normally go in.</span> <span id="s139">And there was a young Jewish lady who spoke English there, and evidently she was an inmate that was kind of in charge of that barracks for the Germans.</span> <span id="s140">As I say, I didn't inquire into the story of it, of why she should be in there and not somebody else.</span> <span id="s141">I wondered in my mind whether she was collaborating to a degree to make life easier which could be understandable.</span> <span id="s142">I can understand it completely.</span> <span id="s143">In the first place, most of the Jews, particularly the German Jews, didn't believe this could happen.</span> <span id="s144">“It wouldn't happen to me, because I am a doctor and I’ve saved all these people and none of these kinds of things...” Like in the movie Holocaust.</span> <span id="s145">That was a perfect example of it.</span> <span id="s146">And it brought back a lot of memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Did you watch it?</span> <span id="s148">A: You bet I watched it.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: When you went into the camp, did you expect to see what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I’d had a little prelude to it.</span> <span id="s151">As we were crossing central Germany, we were heading south down through Bavaria, and the notorious Dachau was north of us.</span> <span id="s152">And we're in the Third Army, and the Seventh Army broke that loose.</span> <span id="s153">And it so happened that prisoners I’d say who had been released from Dachau were heading for Switzerland, which put them across our path.</span> <span id="s154">Of course they were walking so we ran across quite a number of those.</span> <span id="s155">Apparently, as the American Army approached, they revolted against their guards, and many were machine-gunned down by the guards.</span> <span id="s156">As a matter of fact, I saw a couple that had machine-gun wounds that they had bound up, like a hit in the arm with a bullet, which wouldn't be fatal, but it was bound up for bleeding.</span> <span id="s157">I picked up one man who was an Englishman, who had gotten caught over there when the war started and somehow ended up in Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s158">I took him to my friend, Major Bousch.</span> <span id="s159">I talked with him quite a little bit on the way.</span> <span id="s160">We could converse because he spoke English of course.</span> <span id="s161">And I told Major Bousch to check him out, but get him back to England.</span> <span id="s162">That's where he belongs.</span> <span id="s163">As far as I know he got back there, but anyhow, that was my first view, and he was telling me how the guards were just machine-gunning them down, just as fast as they could as they broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: As the Americans....</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: As they were approaching.</span> <span id="s166">It was obvious that they were going to be there like in the next few hours or something.</span> <span id="s167">This was my first contact with inmates of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you have an opportunity to talk to any of the inmates at the Mauthausen camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Not too well, because of the language barrier.</span> <span id="s170">When you would walk into a barracks, the minute you stuck your head in, every hand would start clapping, as weak as they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Did they try to touch you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s173">Pleading and thank you and all this.</span> <span id="s174">You knew what they were saying, even if you couldn’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: How did you feel when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I felt great that we were able to do that.</span> <span id="s177">I felt great pity and sorrow for the ones I saw, and even further as I toured through this installation where they killed them.</span> <span id="s178">They had a photographic laboratory, and the inmates would come in and sit in the chair, ostensibly to be photographed.</span> <span id="s179">There was a tripod camera and everything set up, but behind them was a canvas partition, as a background, then a hole about that big around in it.</span> <span id="s180">As they would sit down and face the camera, someone would shoot them in the back of the head.</span> <span id="s181">And there were bodies there that still had a hole in the back of their head.</span> <span id="s182">They hadn't had a chance to dispose of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And how were you made aware that that took place?</span> <span id="s184">A: Bousch showed it to me.</span> <span id="s185">He toured it already.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: He had toured it before?</span> <span id="s187">A: Before I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s189">When you saw these inmates, did you feel towards them as if they were a fellow human being?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Even in their particular stages of malnutrition?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s193">Walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s194">As you can see, probably, some of these look fairly healthy, but there is a guy whose ribs you can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: And of course you are talking about survivors here who....</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes, those are survivors, and they may not have been in there too long, for whatever reasons.</span> <span id="s197">Let’s see if I’ve got anything else here.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What about the dead?</span> <span id="s199">What did they look like?</span> <span id="s200">What form did they take?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: They were just dead.</span> <span id="s202">Q: And piled up.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Piles.</span> <span id="s204">There were piles like cordwood to the point that they had to bring in bulldozers and make mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Were you a witness to the mass graves?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I was a witness to the digging of the mass graves.</span> <span id="s207">I didn’t watch them actually bury the dead, because I actually had other things I had to do.</span> <span id="s208">Having a unit of my own, I had to spend time with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What did you do when you finally reached the camp?</span> <span id="s210">Were you able to do anything for them?</span> <span id="s211">Did you give them food?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: The medics had taken over completely.</span> <span id="s213">Q: They had already taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Were taking over.</span> <span id="s215">Bousch was in command, and his instructions were no food, no nothing until the medics get there.</span> <span id="s216">They had gathered in the town of Linz quite a lot of garments for both male and female and had passed those out so that these people that were naked had something to put on.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: And they were strong enough to dress themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Not all of them, no.</span> <span id="s219">Many of them were very, very weak.</span> <span id="s220">Very, very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Were there any Austrian citizens there at the time of your occupation?</span> <span id="s222">A: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did you speak to any citizens at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I did after the war.</span> <span id="s225">I was a military governor of a small area south of Linz called Gmunden.</span> <span id="s226">Most of them confessed not to have known about it.</span> <span id="s227">Some admitted yes we knew there was a labor camp down there, but we had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s228">Nobody dared go near it.</span> <span id="s229">And it was kind of sitting out from nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Were there any ovens in that camp?</span> <span id="s231">A: I did not observe any crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Any gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s234">I am sure they disposed of bodies in some manner.</span> <span id="s235">They didn't bury them.</span> <span id="s236">I am sure there must have been, but I just did not see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And do you remember any stone quarries or huge steps in [unintelligible]?</span> <span id="s238">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s239">I know what you are referring to, but I didn't see what they had people do around there.</span> <span id="s240">It was strictly a flat land, agricultural area.</span> <span id="s241">I don’t know whether they raised food or what they did with the slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did you see any of the slave laborers?</span> <span id="s243">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: They were just wandering around, because at this point, they didn't have to do any more.</span> <span id="s246">I suppose they were just trying to survive, and now that the Americans were here it was going to be all right, and it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: You went in with this Major?</span> <span id="s248">A: Bousch.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did you talk about it after you left the camp?</span> <span id="s250">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: What type of reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Bousch’s reaction to me was something like "can you believe it?"</span> <span id="s253">And I said, “No I can't.”</span> <span id="s254">He said, “I have seen lots of things during this war, but I can't believe it either but here it is.”</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: How would you describe your reaction, your feelings at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Almost nausea.</span> <span id="s257">It's just hard to believe that man’s immorality to man.</span> <span id="s258">It was very impressive to me.</span> <span id="s259">I still find it difficult that one person can do this to another for whatever reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: It’s hard to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: And of course from what I understood from people I talked with, they used these laborers as long as they were able to labor.</span> <span id="s262">And they fed them very meagerly, and when they got too weak to work, they got rid of them, they shot them.</span> <span id="s263">You’re no good to me any more, you can't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Do you have any idea of what the [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s266">I really hadn't noticed at all.</span> <span id="s267">I had to refer back to this thing.</span> <span id="s268">“Liberation of tattered, starving looking slave laborers, mainly Russians, Poles, Yugoslavians and priests of turmoil.</span> <span id="s269">They started dancing in the streets.”</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Where are you reading that from?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: That's an excerpt from Stars &amp; Stripes.</span> <span id="s272">Q: The date on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: May 5th, Linz Austria, by Reynolds Packard.</span> <span id="s274">Q: That's May 5, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: May 5, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And that was the date of liberation at the Mauthausen camp?</span> <span id="s277">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Were there any smells?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s280">Oh yes, the stench was vulgar.</span> <span id="s281">You just felt like you wanted to put a handkerchief over your nose.</span> <span id="s282">Not as much outside as inside the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Any sounds or was there silence?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No, by the time I got there, most of them were kind of happy, because they were now going to be free and they knew that so it was a more relaxed attitude than you would normally have under a normal such situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: We have already gone over what the prisoners were doing.</span> <span id="s286">At this point, they were sort of milling around and trying to take the next step in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes, that's right, trying to tie things together, as they say.</span> <span id="s288">This was particularly true in the girls barracks I went in.</span> <span id="s289">And many of them were too weak to get out of their bunks, but as you walked by they would try to tug at your sleeve or your pants leg or something just to show happiness.</span> <span id="s290">And of course they brought in immediately the same day a whole medical team, like this M.A.S.H. deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: A mobile medical unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: A team with nurses, doctors, and aid people, and they immediately started inoculating, prescribing food diets, depending on their physical conditions.</span> <span id="s293">They kind of had to be very careful about what they ate and how much they ate, and they checked every living person there.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Did you know whether or not this medical team had been to Dachau or other camps before?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s296">It was a corps outfit.</span> <span id="s297">I had to keep track of my own army.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s299">I’m sure.</span> <span id="s300">When you and the other Major went to see this, were there any other soldiers that [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: I think Lt. McCurry, as I remember, was with me.</span> <span id="s302">And the jeep driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">But now later on others wanted to go and see it which I gave them permission to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And what were their reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: The same basically as mine, but of course this would be another day.</span> <span id="s306">And some cleanup had been done.</span> <span id="s307">The bulldozers were ahead trying to dispose of the bodies, because they feared disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You mentioned there were no guards there.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No.</span> <span id="s310">Now this was dug by the Germans.</span> <span id="s311">That isn't the one that we dug.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">That's the way they were lying when I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: You took this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s315">And it would be May 5, 1945.</span> <span id="s316">Q: [Reading inscription on photo] “Grave dug by the Germans.</span> <span id="s317">Mauthausen.”</span> <span id="s318">Did they also place the bodies there?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes, they were in there.</span> <span id="s320">Yeah.</span> <span id="s321">They were apparently in the process of cleaning up.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Did you see them do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I didn't see them do it, no.</span> <span id="s324">I was told by Major Bousch that this is what we found when we were here.</span> <span id="s325">It had to have been the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: You have viewed this labor camp as did others.</span> <span id="s327">Were any of the men who you visited given any opportunity to talk about it in order to cope with an experience such as being...?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: We certainly discussed it among ourselves, and half the time we were awfully mad at the Germans anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: You were awful mad at the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: We were awful mad at the Germans.</span> <span id="s331">They had been shooting at us.</span> <span id="s332">As a matter of fact, approaching that...this was Linz which is I'd say no more than 15 miles west of there.</span> <span id="s333">Linz and [unintelligible], on each side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Linz and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Urfahr.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: It’s Like Buda and pest.</span> <span id="s337">It’s the same thing, on each side.</span> <span id="s338">But anyway, there’s a string of mountains going north out of there up towards Czechoslovakia, and the Germans had dug in concrete implacements, 8mm guns, which is a very horrible thing.</span> <span id="s339">We had come from Passau to come in to take Linz, and we were thoroughly bombarded.</span> <span id="s340">We called the air strikes in and everything, but just couldn’t get to these dug-in concrete implacements up these hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: You had your fill of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Oh Jeez.</span> <span id="s343">It was one of my hottest times of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: You were a college student when you entered the war?</span> <span id="s345">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And at that time, had you any idea of what you wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No, I was in Business Administration, and I knew I was going to be in business of some kind.</span> <span id="s348">I didn't realize at the time it was going to be sales, but it turned out to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What I was trying to get at is whether or not this experience at this camp had an effect upon...?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Oh yes, I think it very definitely did.</span> <span id="s351">It created in me a little sensitivity for the other man.</span> <span id="s352">There is no question about it.</span> <span id="s353">I couldn't even stand to watch anybody hurt a dog without doing something about it and I attribute a lot of it to this.</span> <span id="s354">Who knows, it is hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: But, probably, when you think of that experience, you feel that sensitivity.</span> <span id="s356">Are you a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I am an Episcopalian.</span> <span id="s358">Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Were you a devout or traditional Episcopalian before you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I was a Baptist then.</span> <span id="s361">I was raised in the Southern Baptist church.</span> <span id="s362">No, I didn’t become an Episcopalian until I moved down here.</span> <span id="s363">I did it because I liked the minister.</span> <span id="s364">Am I religious?</span> <span id="s365">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And do you remember having this feeling before you entered the armed services?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I was fairly active.</span> <span id="s368">My mother saw to it that we always went to Sunday School.</span> <span id="s369">We didn't have to go to church unless we wanted to, but by George if you are going to do anything this weekend, you’re going to go to Sunday School and so we did as kids and I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s370">I told my kids when they were younger and my grandchildren now that everything I know about religion I learned in Sunday School.</span> <span id="s371">I learned very little bit in church.</span> <span id="s372">But I learned it in Sunday School.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Did you think this experience, specifically your labor camp experience, has had any effect upon your religious beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: That's a tough one to answer.</span> <span id="s375">It was a very shocking experience, and again as I say, man's inhumanity to man, and then you think about an All-seeing, All-knowing God and you have to accept the fact that there is a reason for everything.</span> <span id="s376">But sometimes it is mighty hard to find a reason.</span> <span id="s377">Whether you say it has an effect or not, I don't think it has diminished my belief in one God.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Are you involved in any way in the community as far as community organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Just things like Kiwanis.</span> <span id="s380">.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Do you see the need for this information to be shared with a Kiwanis group or any other type of group in the community to create a greater sensitivity for this past Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I did when I returned from the service in February, 1946.</span> <span id="s383">I was living then in Geneva, Ohio.</span> <span id="s384">Two or three times clubs asked me to say a few words about my Army experiences, and I always brought this in.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: And all you could get was shaking of heads, you know.</span> <span id="s387">Just disbelief almost.</span> <span id="s388">But then that died down.</span> <span id="s389">The notoriety of coming home -- leaving a Private and coming home as a Major -- began to die out.</span> <span id="s390">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did you share this experiences with your gal?</span> <span id="s392">Were you married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I was married, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did you have any children before you went into the service?</span> <span id="s395">A: Yes, I had my oldest daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You obviously sent pictures home.</span> <span id="s397">Sent to your wife.</span> <span id="s398">A: I did.</span> <span id="s399">I sent to my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: And did you share these experiences with her when you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s402">I'm sure someplace I've got the letters that I wrote her, talking about it, but I haven't been able to find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did you write letters concerning Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s405">I had to get it off my chest someplace.</span> <span id="s406">She was the logical one.</span> <span id="s407">I sent her these pictures and as I say I told her to look at them, so she'll know what I am talking about, then get rid of them because I sure didn't want them around.</span> <span id="s408">Didn't want my children to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: That brings me to my next question.</span> <span id="s410">Did you share this experience with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s412">Since they have become adults, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Do you remember the reactions that they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Again, the same reaction, almost disbelief.</span> <span id="s415">How can that be possible?</span> <span id="s416">Q: Did they watch the Holocaust movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Do you believe that the Holocaust experience was peculiar to the Jewish people as opposed to the general [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, from what I know of what happened in those years in Germany, in Poland, and Czechoslovakia, Austria.</span> <span id="s420">I got one picture here.</span> <span id="s421">There was this guy named Corporal Wartell who was a PhD.</span> <span id="s422">And I was his commanding officer.</span> <span id="s423">This is the picture.</span> <span id="s424">There’s a group of Hungarians who escaped from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t know which one.</span> <span id="s426">But we ran across them and of course had to check them out, and then we gave them food and things to make their way back to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And these were Hungarian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I would presume that they were Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: When you went into Mauthausen, was there anything special about the Jewish [unintelligible]?</span> <span id="s430">Ostensibly, was there any anti-Semitic talk as far as the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, not within the camp.</span> <span id="s432">As I say, this one girl was a Jewish girl who was kind of [unintelligible] one particular barracks and she spoke very good English, obviously an educated girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So that was sort of a surprise for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes, and she told me some of the things that had happened in there.</span> <span id="s435">Q: What did she tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I remember basic things.</span> <span id="s437">For instance, periodically the guards would come in and select girls and take them to their barracks for the night, which I think was probably common to most of them.</span> <span id="s438">She mentioned that.</span> <span id="s439">She said it wasn't easy to be a girl.</span> <span id="s440">Of course, they didn't get enough to eat, their sanitary facilities....</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Probably what that little girl was for too.</span> <span id="s442">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: How old is this girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I would say she would be under 30.</span> <span id="s445">Maybe late 20s would be my guess.</span> <span id="s446">Q: Is there anything else she shared with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: She was very attractive, dark-haired, seemed to be better-fed than the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: She was performing a service.</span> <span id="s449">She was taken care of.</span> <span id="s450">A: Yes, I presume so.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: There were no names?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I had no names.</span> <span id="s453">I probably would have been smart to make notes, but I</span></p> <p><span id="s454">...</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Who knows?</span> <span id="s456">At the time [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s457">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s458">But I really get incensed when I read about these Neo-Nazis and their thing about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s459">The thing I remember mostly about the Holocaust...and parts of it just so embittered me.</span> <span id="s460">There was a scene where they were bringing these older people out, women in particular, and setting them down in a chair, blindfolding them, then shooting them.</span> <span id="s461">They would walk out one at the time, knowing that is what was going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s462">And then there was an article in Life magazine about what happened in the Ukraine where they would line them up in a dug trench, then shoot them in the back of the head so they would all fall in and they wouldn't have to have to go to the trouble of pushing them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: They had that pretty well organized, didn't they?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, they had pictures in the magazine of it too.</span> <span id="s465">You might be aware of it.</span> <span id="s466">I still have the magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I am sure I do, let me take a look.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: If any of those pictures come up at any time, if it’s not too much trouble, [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Oh no, I will be happy to.</span> <span id="s471">Yes.</span> <span id="s472">I have a strong feeling on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Yes I see that.</span> <span id="s474">I asked you if you saw this entirely as a Jewish persecution.</span> <span id="s475">The next question here is did it cause you to change your attitude towards Jews and how?</span> <span id="s476">When I say change, I don't know what your attitude was to begin with.</span> <span id="s477">But a candid response would be very informative.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Surely.</span> <span id="s479">A little background on myself.</span> <span id="s480">When I was growing up in Williamsburg, Virginia, one of my favorite people ran a bake shop.</span> <span id="s481">She was Rose Douglas and she was a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s482">Her husband was not, but she was.</span> <span id="s483">She had a nephew that she was raising and he was one of my best friends.</span> <span id="s484">After I had finished the Officers Candidate School...I was a [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s485">By act of Congress an officer and a gentlemen.</span> <span id="s486">But anyhow, they were breaking up what they called the CTPT Program.</span> <span id="s487">This was where I got this PhD, but anyway, at that time my unit was being filled down in Leesville, Louisiana at Camp Pope.</span> <span id="s488">They were shipping in a lot of these educated boys who they had taken off of special technical training and many of those were Jewish.</span> <span id="s489">I would say predominately Jewish.</span> <span id="s490">I would say over half of my unit was Jewish boys and some of my greatest...I’ve told you my first Sergeant, Myer Lipton, was Jewish.</span> <span id="s491">A fine Jewish fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: You came from a Baptist background.</span> <span id="s493">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And that's why conflict usually exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s496">But it always made no difference to me.</span> <span id="s497">Even if he was a Moslem.</span> <span id="s498">I will tell anybody I think your God and my God are pretty good friends.</span> <span id="s499">Anyway, I don't know that it altered my feelings at all, except it gave me a great feeling of sympathy which I still have.</span> <span id="s500">Look at the mess that is over there now.</span> <span id="s501">May be a war tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: How do you feel about the State of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I wish our country had the guts the Israelis have to stand up for what they believe in and be willing to fight for it.</span> <span id="s504">And they certainly are good fighters.</span> <span id="s505">I think that Entebbe raid was the most classical piece of work.</span> <span id="s506">It was a tremendous accomplishment, and I was saddened when this commanding officer got killed.</span> <span id="s507">That young fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Did your experiences in any way change your political views, civil rights movement, Vietnam War, Cambodia?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: It enhanced my fear of a police state and often with stuff like this mess we got in Atlanta now with these kids which is certainly a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s510">Yet I am not willing to say give the police more power because this thing can grow and mushroom into something that you can't handle.</span> <span id="s511">Argentina now is a perfect example of that.</span> <span id="s512">It’s a military dictatorship and police state.</span> <span id="s513">They do what they want to, no laws pertaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: We know that in Nazi Germany where all this began neighbor was turned against neighbor.</span> <span id="s515">Do you think we could ever be involved in something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I suppose anything is possible, but I think it is very far-fetched.</span> <span id="s517">I really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s519">Side Two continues as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: With the attempted assassination of Reagan, there is much talk of gun control.</span> <span id="s521">How do you feel about that in light of the question I just asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I feel very strongly that handguns should be outlawed.</span> <span id="s523">Granted, it’s not going to keep them out of the hands of a criminal.</span> <span id="s524">He is going to get them anyhow.</span> <span id="s525">But it is going to limit the number of them.</span> <span id="s526">And there's always knives and everything else that you can kill people with, but I see absolutely no use in the world for handguns and I would like to see them outlawed.</span> <span id="s527">I don't say that for shotguns and rifles for sport, for hunting.</span> <span id="s528">But what can you do with a pistol except at target practice or kill somebody?</span> <span id="s529">That goes back to the old Army days that when you point a gun at somebody, you had better get ready to pull the trigger because [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: I remember you made a statement that before you went into the camp you were armed.</span> <span id="s531">You were always armed.</span> <span id="s532">You were sure to be armed before you went into that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s534">I was in combat for just about two years.</span> <span id="s535">Your biggest buddy was your weapon and you never went anyplace without it.</span> <span id="s536">I had a jeep that I’d had armor-plated underneath, because I had a fear of running over mines and blowing up underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: That was a very sensible fear to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: So I had them put a three eighths inch armor plate underneath it, and we were supposed to turn them in, but I wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s539">I had a Thompson sub-machine gun called Chicago Chapper round...30 bullets in a round canister that goes up under the wooden stock and you couldn't hit the broadside of a barn with it, but you would spread a lot of lead fast and then I had my carbine in a post on the inside of the machine.</span> <span id="s540">Then I had a 30 caliber machine gun on a pedestal mount.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: You were ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I was ready, plus my sidearms.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: The reason I asked that question is because in one of our other interviews that I heard, somebody who went into Buchenwald camp said they were told not to bring arms in, and that was the first I had heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Is that right?</span> <span id="s545">What I was leading up to was you would go no place without your arms.</span> <span id="s546">As a matter of fact, after the war ended in Europe, .</span> <span id="s547">me and the guy -- I say he and I won the war together -- who lives in Huntsville, Alabama now...he saw Mauthausen too.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s549">Can we get in touch with him also?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Paul Gordon Chase.</span> <span id="s551">I’ve got his address and phone number if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: I'll take that afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Anyhow, we went to Paris and I had a little 25 caliber Walters Automatic that I had taken off of a German medical officer that we captured.</span> <span id="s554">Apparently they all carried those, and if the wound was too bad they would shoot the guy.</span> <span id="s555">They’d move on.</span> <span id="s556">But I carried that in my pocket wherever I went.</span> <span id="s557">Even to Paris when the war was over.</span> <span id="s558">I would feel naked without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: How did you feel when you returned to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: A good example of that is that a friend of mine up in Ohio and I went to see the Cleveland Indians play a baseball game.</span> <span id="s561">A night game.</span> <span id="s562">They had a fireworks display after the game was over, but when they put on this display, Spike and I both, the first boom, we flattened on the floor, on the bleachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: How long was that after you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: This was six months.</span> <span id="s565">I returned in February, and this had to be like June or July , which is baseball season.</span> <span id="s566">Anyway, it was just a reflex action.</span> <span id="s567">Just a complete reflex action.</span> <span id="s568">As a matter of fact, I would wake up at night -- Marie would tell me.</span> <span id="s569">I wouldn’t remember much of it myself -- and sit up in bed.</span> <span id="s570">I’d been dreaming about something that had to do...and it took a year or two years to wear off.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you ever have nightmares about this particular camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Not in the way of nightmares.</span> <span id="s573">I think about it periodically, but they are waking thoughts, and you remember nasty little things the Germans could do and would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You commented on your reactions to the inmates that drowned the German officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes, he was the camp commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Had you been there, what would you have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I told you how my jeep was armed.</span> <span id="s578">I 'd have gotten their attention by spreading a lot of lead and I would have taken him capture.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: The inmates’ attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s581">I would have held them off because I had two other fellows with me in the jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: You are talking about a German camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: The German camp [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s584">Mauthausen Camp.</span> <span id="s585">I would have gotten them away from there, and I would have gotten him and turned him into Major Bousch.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Do you have any feelings about what they did to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s588">I feel a little ashamed that I was not there a little sooner, to be honest with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: So they would not have taken his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: So they would not have taken his life.</span> <span id="s591">They may have taken it anyway, but the authorities may have...he may have been in Nuremberg Trials.</span> <span id="s592">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: But you didn't feel the inmates had that right to kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I don’t think that anybody has the right to kill anybody except in self defense.</span> <span id="s595">He was defenseless against them There must have been 15 or 20 of them in this group, and he had no arms.</span> <span id="s596">No one man can defend himself against that.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: And if you think about his position in the camp, in relation to the inmates [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I can understand that, I can understand that then.</span> <span id="s599">Quite likely had I been an inmate, I would have felt the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Looking at it from a military objective.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Objectively.</span> <span id="s602">That’s right.</span> <span id="s603">That isn’t the way Americans do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">This is what occurred to me.</span> <span id="s605">We do it the legal way.</span> <span id="s606">He would have paid his price, but it was not up to me to do it.</span> <span id="s607">It was up to the laws and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Is there anything else perhaps that I haven’t included that you would like to share with us about this experience at the camp or any experiences that you had with the Austrian citizens that may have shed some light on what this labor camp was all about?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s610">The Austrians that I got to know and I got to know quite a few of them very well, being military governor and so forth...and I used to hold forth every Wednesday in the courthouse and anybody in the whole district that had anything they wanted to complain about or talk about or ask about were welcome to come.</span> <span id="s611">I had an interpreter, a real nice little 17-year-old girl that had studied English in school and she spoke it very very well.</span> <span id="s612">Of course she knew German thoroughly.</span> <span id="s613">These people would come in.</span> <span id="s614">They had nothing to eat, and I would arrange to get them food.</span> <span id="s615">We had a frozen food locker.</span> <span id="s616">The guy I appointed as chief of police was in charge of it and he would arrange to have food for them, and we could get in army supplies.</span> <span id="s617">We’d scrounge around and keep things...well, anyway, I'd knew nothing, no German at all, but it started out they would ask a question to my interpreter, who would then interpret in English to me, then I'd answer her in English and she would answer them.</span> <span id="s618">Pretty soon, it got so they would ask a question, I'd give her the answer, and she'd try [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s619">And it wasn't too long before they asked me a question in German and I answered in German.</span> <span id="s620">By the time I left there, I would handle German pretty well.</span> <span id="s621">I couldn’t read it but I could speak, could understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And would the conversation [unintelligible] come up about the Mauthausen camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes, the Austrians were, I think, in a peculiar situation in that they were occupied also by the Germans.</span> <span id="s624">They didn’t want to be but they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">The Anschluss, I guess they call it.</span> <span id="s626">They were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s627">Some knew of it, or had heard stories of it, and they too felt appalled by it -- most, practically of them I talked to.</span> <span id="s628">As a matter of fact, Hitler's sister lived in Gmunden.</span> <span id="s629">She was a school teacher, and the feelings ran so high that I had to post a guard 24 hours a day around her house so that some trigger-happy G I didn’t try...because she was Adolph Hitler's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And how did you feel about having to post a guard around her house?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: The first time I interviewed her I think she said she hadn’t seen Hitler for something like 30 years, and just really barely remembered him when they were children.</span> <span id="s632">So she had no feeling one way or the other about Hitler.</span> <span id="s633">He was her brother, but she knew nothing really other than what she read, or what she saw happening around her.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What can you tell us about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I would guess she was at least 60.</span> <span id="s636">Had apparently been teaching in the Gmunden school system for her whole career as a school teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: What did she look like ?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: How does a 60-year-old lady look?</span> <span id="s639">I would say I could see no resemblance to the pictures of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What type of a person did she strike you as?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: A nice person, a person you would kind of like to know.</span> <span id="s642">It was a very favorable impression of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Did your interpreter keep in touch with her, communicate with her, on and off?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Periodically.</span> <span id="s645">As a matter of fact, that was one of the reasons.</span> <span id="s646">I had just learned that she was there, and I didn't want any problems, and so I found where she lived in Gmunden and I went to see her.</span> <span id="s647">We visited for about an hour.</span> <span id="s648">One of the things that impressed me was she made us a cup of tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: That felt good at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: And she had some little sweet biscuits some how she had made.</span> <span id="s651">Q: Was she, at any point, taken away by the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, no, she was questioned by the military, but never incarcerated or taken under their control.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: And you had no more than a sort of bowing acquaintance with her.</span> <span id="s654">No information about her life, or background...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s657">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: [Unintelligible] somebody who’s been so close [unintelligible] A: Yes.</span> <span id="s659">First time I’ve thought about that in years.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Hitler’s family.</span> <span id="s661">Most interesting.</span> <span id="s662">I would like to thank you very much for taking this time, for sharing this material with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Let’s see if there’s any picture you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: This will be used for students as an original source of information, and hopefully people will learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Well, I can say it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: You can say it happened.</span> <span id="s667">Thank you once again.</span> <span id="s668">A: You are quite welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You said you had grandchildren?</span> <span id="s670">A: Yes, I have five of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: How wonderful</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Three boys and two girls</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Marvelous.</span> <span id="s674">Have you ever discussed this experience with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s676">The oldest one is 13 years old, and the youngest one is 10.</span> <span id="s677">I have some twins in there, a little boy and little girl, but I don't recall that I have ever discussed it with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Now that we have talked a bit, if the occasion should arise, would you choose to share this experience with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Oh yes, if I think they are old enough to handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Because when events like this are forgotten, [unintelligible] [Unintelligible] and education is what we’re after.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s682">Of course it is.</span> <span id="s683">That’s the truth.</span></p></body></html>
