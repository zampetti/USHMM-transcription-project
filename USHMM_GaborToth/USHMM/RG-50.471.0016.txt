December 11th - In the ghetto they started to orga, organize concerts in order to forget the situation a bit. And also tomorrow there will be a dinner for doctors. They are pre, preparing sandwiches, tea and a program from the works of the ghetto. Poems and songs.
This way people forget themselves for one evening as if they were in an entirely different world. Although people from the lower classes get angry about this, they are not justified.
December 14 - Firewood is running, running out. Our stove still isn't ready and when it is, there won't be any wood. If there is food, there is not wood. That's the way life is.

And now finally I have a goal in life: to struggle, to learn, and to directly my energies for the betterment of my people and my land.
August 10 - Outside it is raining. it has gotten cold.
The wind is blowing with rage, rush. Fall is getting nearer. I have distanced myself from nature. Is it possible that already before winter comes we will be freed from captivity. Is it possible that we will be able to fly out free to the heavens? Is it possible that the chains will fall from our arms?
No it is hard to believe. They mock us, our work and our hopes. It is all a lie. Yesterday,an excursion of Hitler Youths came to the the workshops. They came as if to a zoo, to look at the Jews at work. For them it
is a joke!
September 3 - Rain. The sky is gloomy. Terrible things are happening. I hear the Germans are talking children age 2 10 far away. Transports of children are coming to Lith, Lithuania and some are murdered and other sold for 2 or 3 marks. Your hair bristles on hearing these things. There was Western European culture come.

The men had control of themselves, they faces were frozen. No tears. And the transports arrived, one after another. The men went up on the transports, li, lifted their belongings, gave one last glance at the ghetto and the transport moved.

December 24 - A quiet Christmas Eve. The ground is decorated with a white cloak. The stars are smiling looking down at the decorated earth. But the green fir tree with it, its golden decorations which peeps out of every window, pains my heart the most. This is their holiday not ours. It is their Jesus who was born, and our Jesus yet to be born. They didn't established God's ten commande, ments. They don't love their broth- ers as theirselves. They murder them. You are happy with Jesus on account of the holiday, on account of your brandy, but you don't observe the commandments.
You don't love your Jesus and he curses you. We also curse you. "Let you be damned, damned for ever." January 1 a thousand nine hundred forty four - In the page of history the year 43 will be designed, designed as a period of the cruelest blood letting of the Jewish people. There is so much evil! There were aktions against Vilna Hey, tell me What did you do to the Geist family? And what about the people who were taken to Keiden? Answer me. And when they sold the Russian children. And when they cut apart families? And the black could and the terror of the concentration camp.
And the day of October 26th. Three thousands of souls ripped away from their families and brothers and sent to the land of Estonia. And the orphans. There were burned at last, last in the large bonfire! And again 300 men to Mariampole! We have to thank you on the behalf of Goeke! You 43. What, you are silent? Yes silent! Because there are not words in your mouth.
you are not used to justifying yourself. you are guilty, cursed year! I call you to judgement! : You the year 43. Steeped in blood!
After three years of deceit, there is not more hope, there is not faith. Everything is lie! One lie on top of another. One lie under another!
March 27 - Aktion. Thousand five hundred little chil- dren and older ones were taken to the Forts. 40, 40 policemen ended their lives in the 9th Fort. The others were held a few days longer and were freed in exchanged for the information which they delivered. The younger generation up to age 12 was killed. The older ones were killed with them and we were also killed. But the

But there were heroic mothers, that strangled their children with their hands! The mothers ordered the Germans to kill them first and only from their corpses could the Germans take their children. Eternal honor to these mothers! And the sons? Sons. The youth handed over all that was dear to them with his own hands his elderly, crippled parents to the truck and the women waked in terror holding their babies i their arms. Awful! And what a sun shines on this same day!
And she smiles down from the sky, until the laughter overcomes you. H, ha, ha...and also the sun laughs at

March 28 - A bloo, bloody tragedy. There are no words to describe it. Oh, the mothers, the the wretched mothers who returned from work and didn't find their children! God does not exist. He sent the sun to laugh. God, brotherhood and ideals - all of these are finished. All capitulate under the instinct of life
and death.
April 4 (last entry before escape) - On the face of it, everything seems quiet. Those whom the calamity didn't not affect stay quiet, and those who had their heart wrenched out -- will the wound scab over from sorrow? Not, it will not scab over.

October 6 - There is a new decrees which orders to turn in all raw materials, machines and money.
October 13 - Rumor has it that 300 ghetto inmates will be sent to Riga. The ghetto is restless.

Threats are spreading about Riga.

Everybody is discussing the news in the ghetto. But we have no use for it. It doesn't help.

September 13, 1942 The weather is nasty. It rains and rains every day.
Fall has come early. At home, there is nothing to eat: no flour nor potatoes.
September 14 Despite the regulation against bringing something into the Ghetto, people smuggle food through the gate or over the fence. Here, I say, this is a people! The Jewish people will never obey and they will live forev- er. The Jewish nation will never be destroyed.
September 24 Fall weather. Rain is fighting sunshine, the wind is spreading yellow leaves, and people are digging pota- toes. There was trouble in the ghetto today. Somebody tried to bring firewood from town and flour hidden under the wood was detected at the gate. This will not go away unnoticed. Five people have already been ar- rested. They may be executed.
September 27 People are restless. Today 200 women were deported to
Palemonas.
October 1 A beautiful day, so warm that one could go swimming.
When I came back from town, I carried 10kg in my hands.
We have sold Daddy's coat so things have improved.
That's why we've had great meals. But how long can it last, a week or so, and then hunger again.
October 6 There is a new decree which orders to turn in all raw materials, machines and money.

November 6 There is big victory in Africa. We hear that the Allies have conquered Algiers and Morocco. Everybody is dis- cussing the news in the ghetto. But we have no use for it. It doesn't help.
November 15 The mood in the Ghetto is gloomy. People talk of actions in Poland and fear they will happen here.
Today I worked a lot. Bread that you earned by the sweat of your brow tastes good.
November 19 Against my will, the hanging keeps returning before my eyes. And what is life compared with death? What's the purpose of living? To suffer, to struggle? And anyhow, death waits for you. You disappear from the world, as if you never existed.
November 24 It's been a long time since I read any books. Besides that, at home it is dark in the evenings because they shut off the electricity. I lie in the darkness, assaulted by memories of the past, and there is no way I can quiet them and shake myself from them.

January 1, 1944 January 1, a new page in the life of the Jews. The morning burst forth of the new year.
In the pages of history, the year 1943 will be desig- nated as a period of the cruelest blood-letting of the Jewish people. There is so much evil! There were Aktions against Vilna. Hey, tell me.

After three years of deceit, there is no more hope, there is no faith. Everything is a lie! One lie on top of another. One lie under another!
January 11 What a horrible period. What cruel hearts! What are they doing in the 20th century! It is cold. Ice pinches the hands and legs. Ten degrees below zero.
January 23 And still every day you go to the brigade and count the hours. It is already noon, already lunch. A few more hours.... Already 5 o'clock -- 6 o'clock, and finally -- blessed is the hour -- we go home and the path!
Splashed with mud, trampled with puddles, the curses, sighs of weakened creatures. At long last the gate, the Ghetto. Here is the house! Happiness? But no, because tomorrow the same trip. One day is as identi- cal to the next as two drops of water. A day of black labor, a day of wretchedness. And the same outcry for bread, for light. All around is just hunger and dark- ness. There is no culture. No food for the soul.
There is not even a drop of enlightenment. The human machine dies quickly. the factory destroys its health.
The black, murderous factory. it sucks up a young, strong, healthy person, possessed of happy dreams, drunk with life, and spits out a crippled man, who face is plowed with wrinkles and aged before its time, whose eyes are extinguished. Everyone will end up this
way...
But I don't agree. I want to learn. I want a differ- ent path so badly! I want to be a scientist. I want to bring light to the world.

October 12, 1944 (first entry after liberation) Five months have passed. The sun fell on the earth.
The life of the young springtime was extinguished.
Yellow leaves are under the feet. The view changed.
Men died. The Ghetto which was drowned in flames, left footprints that destroy wisdom. No house was left. In place of where they stood tall and proud, there are only darkened gloomy chimneys facing the heavens; witness that this place -- is a graveyard. They extend across the sky, as if they are pleading for the heavens to revenge the injustice that was done. We are now free. It is now five months since the handcuffs have been removed from my hands.

I am a lonely orphan in the world, like a stone.
Daddy, my misfortunate one! Mommy! There were not
able to escape...
In the sorrow a familiar oak forest rustles on the side of the path. Only a few oak trees are left. They complain about their brothers who were cut down. And I go to become comforted with them... Do you hear me, oak trees? Am I lucky? No I don't consider myself lucky. One after the other images hover across my eyes: Images of the happy, recent past. Why do I say "happy past"? Yes, perhaps happy. Because my arms and legs were chained, but my heart was free. And now my heart is chained. Only inside a thick forest do I look for the path to my recent heart, the heart of the
mother.
-- My child, what more do you want?
-- You mother, -- I quietly answer in my heart.
Explain to me nature, is it possible that a man is so weak, so powerless? Why then should you struggle, work and suffer? Why be happy or sad! Is this not all the same?

And is it better to see the limitless sorrow of a mother before the body of her child? Is it made easier by seeing the suffering in the death of infants, in flesh and blood? No. A hundred times no! But for what purpose are the tears?
The earth will receive you, the tired, in its bosom, and the skies will water you with at least one tear -- and that is how your path on the face of this earth will end. Why decay in rot, why mourn? Why love or hate? There is no need! All of this is just a dry section in the fields of life. But mankind, here is
mankind!
December 25, 1946 I am not able, as the heart grows older, to feel youth, to feel joy; as it is without feeling.

passes to man.....
