Fried.</span> <span id="s13">Could you please give me your name, your date of birth and your place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Viliam Fried.</span> <span id="s15">I had been born in 1919, October 25th, in a small village, Lozin.</span> <span id="s16">It's in the East Slovakia, County Michalovce.</span> <span id="s17">In that village and around this village was living most people of my family until we can say '39, until the Slovak state.</span> <span id="s18">After this time many moved from this place and according to all the sisters and brothers of my mother, my mother was leaving, after my father died, to a place near Cragovsky Hermits.</span> <span id="s19">It's a very small town in South Slovakia, but mostly Hungarian communities.</span> <span id="s20">And she was there up to '38.</span> <span id="s21">Myself, I was living there by my grandfather up to '33 and in 1933 when I finished something like junior high school here in the States, I went to work to the Battah Company in Bohemia.</span> <span id="s22">And this was the first short part of my ride and the main things, but maybe it's necessary to say, that the community around was Slovak.</span> <span id="s23">And in the villages around there have been two, three, four, maybe five Jewish families, mostly working like farmers, except maybe they had their little shop or they, something else, a bar, selling cigarettes and so.</span> <span id="s24">Only in.the cities.</span> <span id="s25">In Michalovce or Koshitse, the Jewish community was stronger, more families and, of course, all what it means to be Jewish, was concentrated in these towns.</span> <span id="s26">My father died when I was five-and-a-half years old.</span> <span id="s27">My mother stayed with three children and she was working in a hospital in Ungrad, like a nurse.</span> <span id="s28">After she, I don't know how she came to this place, two villages, looking for a nurse who can deliver babies.</span> <span id="s29">So my mother went to work for these two villages.</span> <span id="s30">The name of the villages was Arcan.</span> <span id="s31">And my brother and my sister and my mother, they had to, they lived in this village up to 1938.</span> <span id="s32">Myself, I came home once or two times a year on vacations.</span> <span id="s33">Otherwise I was working in Zlene, it's the heart of the Battah concern.</span> <span id="s34">Maybe you heard about the Battahs, or not.</span> <span id="s35">I'm sure that yes.</span> <span id="s36">And working, going to school and living like all the other young people.</span> <span id="s37">All the other members of the family, I mean, my uncles and their children, my aunts and their children, were living all around me, (?)</span> <span id="s38">.</span> <span id="s39">It was always so in Slovakia that they married to somebody from the next village because the communication wasn't so easy at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your job in the Battah factory?</span> <span id="s41">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Your job at the Battah factory.</span> <span id="s43">Can you tell me a little about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: In the Battah factory I started to teach and to work in the Department of Chemistry.</span> <span id="s45">Tire and Rubber .</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">Department, and it was so that every day at six o'clock we went to make a little sport 15 minutes, then take a breakfast, went to the factory, working until two o'clock, take ahlunch, and at five o'clock it was finished with the work, and at six o'clock we went to school, every day up till ten o'clock at evening.</span> <span id="s48">And on Saturdays, the whole day, it was school.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What kind of work did you do in the factory?</span> <span id="s50">.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I was learning how to build tires, how to build, it's a kind of, you have it in the engine, belts, rubber boots, and I was learning these professions and except of this in the school, I wanted to achieve, graduate, in chemistry.</span> <span id="s52">It was, I was very ambitious, I can say, when I was young and I have done everything to be a good scholar, a good worker.</span> <span id="s53">And I was saving money from my wages to help my mother.</span> <span id="s54">And except of this, if you are wanted by the company, after you have been half ready to move forwards, you must have money because you must show the bosses in these factories that you are able to make money and to spend money in a good way.</span> <span id="s55">I was working there up to '38.</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">In 1938 I have to go to the Army.</span> <span id="s58">I was 19.</span> <span id="s59">And so I came home to my mother, because I have to go to the Army November 1, 1938.</span> <span id="s60">But, if you remember, 1938 was a heavy year in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Czechoslovakia was partly occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s62">Part of the South Slovakia was occupied by the Hungarians and so it came through that in 1939 I think it was in February or so, the country was divided in two parts.</span> <span id="s63">One part .</span> <span id="s64">.</span> <span id="s65">was fully occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s66">It was like a Gubernia.</span> <span id="s67">And Slovakia should be a self, a sovereign state.</span> <span id="s68">But it was built under the parasol from Mr. Hitler.</span> <span id="s69">And it was very bad for us.</span> <span id="s70">Because, as I told you before, my mother was living with the two younger brother and sister in a Hungarian community.</span> <span id="s71">Each was occupied by the Hungarians in 1938, on the end.</span> <span id="s72">And because my brother and my sister, they went to Slovak schools.</span> <span id="s73">My mother had very near to some, the bureaucrats was in the village, it was mostly Slovak and Czech.</span> <span id="s74">So when the Hungarian come in, they gave us about 48 hours time.</span> <span id="s75">We could take 40 kilo luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">They took us on cars with horses to Cragovsky Hermits, concentrated with other groups of Slovaks and Czechs, and carried us by track, near to Ushahrot.</span> <span id="s77">Usharot was a bigger city on the, in Putkarpaskaros.</span> <span id="s78">It was a part of Czechoslovakia, but mostly the community was half Ruttish and half Ukraine.</span> <span id="s79">And then we came at night to the border and they told us, "You have to go in this direction."</span> <span id="s80">We had been more hundred people, we have to go in this direction.</span> <span id="s81">And so we came to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s82">It takes about maybe three hours or so.</span> <span id="s83">It was a terrible night for us because it was the first step to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s84">I will explain you why.</span> <span id="s85">For example, my brother, he's younger than I am, now he is living in Florida.</span> <span id="s86">He was a professor of chemistry here in the United States.</span> <span id="s87">And my sister, she is living here, mother of my nephew.</span> <span id="s88">My brother became sick.</span> <span id="s89">And so my mother put him on her .</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">[ shoulders and she was carrying him.</span> <span id="s92">He was about maybe 100 | pounds or more.</span> <span id="s93">The whole night, through a land which was frozen and falling down and so.</span> <span id="s94">My sister, she went by mother and [ taking her skirt, and I was getting the luggage, what we had.</span> <span id="s95">We .</span></p> <p><span id="s96">l came on the other side of the border.</span> <span id="s97">We didn't know if we are in Hungary or in Slovakia, but we saw lights, we came to a village and it was a village called Vishna Yametskayorso.</span> <span id="s98">And there we find people who were in the same situation as we.</span> <span id="s99">Many, many, many, many of them.</span> <span id="s100">And so we get some help.</span> <span id="s101">And the next day we move by a bus to the city Michalovce.</span> <span id="s102">And why to Michalovce?</span> <span id="s103">Because it was the first place where we have some relatives.</span> <span id="s104">And of course we wanted to come to somebody who was able for a short time to give us help.</span> <span id="s105">So it happened that our family, from all the families belonging to our big family, as it was so, wanted to help us.</span> <span id="s106">But we had divided.</span> <span id="s107">Mother went to one brother.</span> <span id="s108">My brother went to another uncle.</span> <span id="s109">My sister went to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Because nobody was able to take the whole family.</span> <span id="s111">And I, in a short time, about in, I was living by my friend, Mr. Klein, he was the last years in Canada, and from this time in about 10 weeks or so, I went into the Slovak Army.</span> <span id="s112">I became a soldier.</span> <span id="s113">After two weeks I went to officer's school.</span> <span id="s114">And I was in the Army like a normal soldier maybe up to September.</span> <span id="s115">But it's not exactly, nearly so.</span> <span id="s116">Then it came, in Slovakia, the Nuremburg rules, made by Mr. Gerbers and his friends.</span> <span id="s117">The Slovakian government take it over.</span> <span id="s118">And tpey .</span> <span id="s119">.</span> <span id="s120">started to write in the newspapers, "We will make better rules than Hitler made.</span> <span id="s121">No Jew can stay in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s122">He cannot longer stay here because the land belongs to our Christian people."</span> <span id="s123">And the effect of this was, for example, that all the Jewish 6 soldiers, they take away from the Army and put in a, um, in working groups.</span> <span id="s124">I But it's very interesting that, for example, me, I was S in the so-called labor camp, but I stay in the same office as I | was before in the Army.</span> <span id="s125">I was handling the same (?)</span> <span id="s126">papers as | before, see?</span> <span id="s127">Because I don't know why, but it was so.</span> <span id="s128">And it was until 1940.</span> <span id="s129">So I went from the Army.</span> <span id="s130">It came a new rule | that all the young men have to go to civil labor camps.</span> <span id="s131">And so I [ went to work on a railway building camp.</span> <span id="s132">It was a railway | between Stratski and Preshov.</span> <span id="s133">And I stayed there a longer time.</span> <span id="s134">[ I had luck, because some of the engineers, they had been my | friends, school friends, for the first years, since I was 12, 13, | 14.</span> <span id="s135">And so I worked there, I get money, I could make a normal living.</span> <span id="s136">It was until 1941 or so and between, as I was a soldier, 1l so the Germans had partly occupied Slovakia before they started F the war against Poland.</span> <span id="s137">And not far from Michalovce, where I was | a soldier, it was a place where it was an airport for the Army F only, a field airport.</span> <span id="s138">And you know how it is, if you are young | you sometimes get in troubles.</span> <span id="s139">And we get once in troubles with such soldiers.</span> <span id="s140">And so I get a big help from my commandant.</span> <span id="s141">I | told him early in the morning what happened, and he was helping .</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">me, but it's not important.</span> <span id="s144">| And from this time, as I went from the Army, it doesn't take too many times, you could hear that something will be done with the Jews.</span> <span id="s145">Nobody, one said that we have to go to Poland to 7 1, build a new life in Poland.</span> <span id="s146">Somebody thought we stayed in Slovakia, but in some labor camps.</span> <span id="s147">And on the beginning of 1942 one of my friends in a village, I don't remember exactly, Lustotsi or so, it was.</span> <span id="s148">They told me, "Viliam, you have to be prepared that they will take all the young boys and girls to Poland."</span> <span id="s149">I ask him from where you have the news, so he told me, "I have connections, I know it."</span> <span id="s150">So I was contacting my mother and told her that maybe I will go to Hungary and maybe even to Yugoslavia to try to go to the Middle East because many of young people went this time from Czechoslovakia to Palestina, and to, it was Egypt, on the front, between Egypt and Libya.</span> <span id="s151">It was a place where they have concentrated soldiers, officers, people who would run away from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s152">My mother started to cry, "What shall I do here with the kids?"</span> <span id="s153">They were not kids.</span> <span id="s154">My brother was about 19 and my sister 16, yeah, 16.</span> <span id="s155">So I told my mother, "I don't know exactly, but it will be very bad."</span> <span id="s156">I will take my sister, Rose, with me, and she will stay in Hungary.</span> <span id="s157">Maybe she could make a normal life in Budapest or Asven.</span> <span id="s158">And, really, it came very soon.</span> <span id="s159">They took the young people who was not married to a town Popravitz in the high Tatras.</span> <span id="s160">From this place they make, they organize transports .</span> <span id="s161">.</span> <span id="s162">and send them to Midonic.</span> <span id="s163">It was in Poland, and to Denbrin.</span> <span id="s164">The place, Midonic, according to what I, as I heard, they killed there about 250,000 young people during the half a year.</span> <span id="s165">They was not really killed.</span> <span id="s166">They must work, and they didn't get l | nothing.</span> <span id="s167">They couldn't sleep even in a barrack.</span> <span id="s168">Outside, only.</span> <span id="s169">And you know how it is, it comes typhus, and then you lose every | night a hundred souls.</span> <span id="s170">| When I heard that it happened, I have a girlfriend, I W went to her parents and I told them I am moving to Hungary and if you want I can take Edith and the same day I went to my mother, I told her I take Rose with me.</span> <span id="s171">So it happened this, my friend, | made me a meeting with the police and they told me between 10 and 11 o'clock you can pass the fronchar from here up to here, kilometer, this and this, because nobody will be there.</span> <span id="s172">So we passed the fronchar, we went to the next village in the Hungarian territory before it was Slovakia, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s173">It was a family, we came in, they knew about such transportations because they used the people, the young people used this channel very often.</span> <span id="s174">The girls stayed by this family.</span> <span id="s175">I came back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s176">I came to my mother.</span> <span id="s177">She was living in Sejose, and told her that Rose is in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s178">And the next night I moved again to Hungarian and take her to do something else.</span> <span id="s179">And you know what the first question from my mother was?</span> <span id="s180">It was Saturday, and, "How do you came here?"</span> <span id="s181">I told her, "By a train."</span> <span id="s182">And she told me, "Today is Sabbath."</span> <span id="s183">It was very, very heavy for me, but it was, as I told you, the next night, with the help of my friends, I passed again the fronchar, came to Michalani, we had some Hungarian money, and the next day we went with a bus to a town, Shatarajawihe, and by a bus to Koshitse.</span> <span id="s184">Koshitse, it was a bigger town in the East Slovakia, about 60,000 inhabitants, and to stay there and to decide what to do further.</span> <span id="s185">It's, maybe it is a question of why I went so around and not straight with the train.</span> <span id="s186">Because the village where the girls have been, in Koshitse, the train went through Hungarian territory that used to be before Czechoslovak territory.</span> <span id="s187">And custom officers went together.</span> <span id="s188">So it was a danger that we would be detained, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s189">So we went by bus to Koshitse.</span> <span id="s190">We stayed there about three or four days in Koshitse.</span> <span id="s191">The girls have been by the grandmother of my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s192">And me and the old friend of mine, an older gentlemen, Mr. Greenstein, he helped me to get some money.</span> <span id="s193">So we went to the synagogue and during one hour we had money for a taxi.</span> <span id="s194">Because for the same reasons, we have to go to Usharot where we had a very large family.</span> <span id="s195">My mother, cousins and adult children and we wanted that one of them should go to the village where we used to live before we must go to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s196">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s197">To get some papers that we were living in this place from 1927 until 1938.</span> <span id="s198">It was true.</span> <span id="s199">But he couldn't arrange it, Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Greenstein.</span> <span id="s201">He died here in the States.</span> <span id="s202">We arranged the next route to Budapest.</span> <span id="s203">We were very good in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s204">We could speak Hungarian like all other people.</span> <span id="s205">But sometimes it, the police made controls in the trains.</span> <span id="s206">We came from the front, from the towns from the fronchar.</span> <span id="s207">And we heard the people talk about the problems in Slovakia, what they are doing with Jewish 10 people, and that many are running to Hungaria, so we have been afraid.</span> <span id="s208">But we came through, and in Budapest I have a halfsister.</span> <span id="s209">We had the same father but not the same mother.</span> <span id="s210">The mother of my half-sister died.</span> <span id="s211">We came there and we asked her to help us.</span> <span id="s212">So my sister stayed on this place, and I went with my girlfriend, she had an uncle there.</span> <span id="s213">He was a very good situated man and she went to visit him.</span> <span id="s214">I went with her.</span> <span id="s215">I was sitting outside and she was talking inside, and she told my uncle don't want to help her.</span> <span id="s216">He's afraid.</span> <span id="s217">"Why is he afraid?"</span> <span id="s218">"Because he belongs to the over 10,000."</span> <span id="s219">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s220">It's the highest, in Hungary it means the highest shift of the socialty.</span> <span id="s221">The lords and the groves (?)</span> <span id="s222">and I don't know.</span> <span id="s223">So she told me that he promised he would give me some money.</span> <span id="s224">But we didn't need money.</span> <span id="s225">We needed a place where we can sleep, and maybe some papers to find a job.</span> <span id="s226">So she wanted to travel to another place where she had a friend.</span> <span id="s227">The village was Silakovo.</span> <span id="s228">We came there, she stayed, my girlfriend, she stayed by her friend.</span> <span id="s229">She was a teacher in this village.</span> <span id="s230">And I moved about 20 kilometers, it's about 12 miles, to another place where I had an aunt and a cousin.</span> <span id="s231">I came to them, and my aunt went to the same place as my .</span> <span id="s232">.</span> <span id="s233">family from Usharot to take the papers.</span> <span id="s234">And they have women who came in every morning to help in the kitchen or some things.</span> <span id="s235">And she saw me there.</span> <span id="s236">And maybe she heard that we were talking about our problems.</span> <span id="s237">I don't know, but maybe, and the next day my aunt 11 went to this Tarkan, and my uncle went to the city, to the town, Luchanets, and the house was on such a small hill, I was looking out, and I saw that three policemen are coming to the house.</span> <span id="s238">So I have to decide what I can do.</span> <span id="s239">I can escape through the windows in the back.</span> <span id="s240">But I wasn't afraid, but I would do some problems, maybe I will make some problems to my aunt and to my cousins.</span> <span id="s241">So I opened them the door.</span> <span id="s242">They came.</span> <span id="s243">"Are you from Slovakia?"</span> <span id="s244">"Yes, I am."</span> <span id="s245">"So you come with me."</span> <span id="s246">And so they take me to a prison, and that evening they take me to the frontchard and they tell me again, "You have to go in this direction."</span> <span id="s247">I came to a small town in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s248">I know the names very well because I, many times I was in these places after, no, not late.</span> <span id="s249">And a patrol of border soldiers came.</span> <span id="s250">"Your papers, please."</span> <span id="s251">I didn't have any papers, so they took me and they sent me from one county to the other county.</span> <span id="s252">And so I came again to Michalovce, but not on free legs, but in prison.</span> <span id="s253">So this is what happened with me until I was removed to Poland with the regulary transport to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s254">Now, what's happened there, I send, from Trebishov, I send the phone message to my mother that I am again here.</span> <span id="s255">And the time moving from Trebishov to Michalovce she came to Michalovce to the .</span> <span id="s256">.</span> <span id="s257">prison and my mother wasn't looking like a Jewish lady, so she was moving also without the (?)</span> <span id="s258">like me.</span> <span id="s259">And I ask what is with my brother.</span> <span id="s260">She told me he is in the school because they are concentrating people from the county preparing a transport, too.</span> <span id="s261">12 l | E And, as I was in the prison, we went, we had been there, maybe 20 or 25, mostly Jewish, the same faith as I was.</span> <span id="s262">And one old man was there.</span> <span id="s263">I knew him.</span> <span id="s264">He was a lawyer from the next town.</span> <span id="s265">And the President of the Jewish association, from Michalovce, his name was, I think so, Mr. Lanc.</span> <span id="s266">He came, and he was interested only about Dr. Devie.</span> <span id="s267">All the other people, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s268">So I am getting very angry and I went to him and I told him, "I asked you to help my brother.</span> <span id="s269">He is at school.</span> <span id="s270">He is not learning, but he is prepared for transportation to take him out."</span> <span id="s271">When not, I will escape from here, and I don't recommend you to meet me.</span> <span id="s272">Really, I was very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s273">The next day my mother came and she told me that my brother Baila is out.</span> <span id="s274">So it was, I was, I had an opinion that it is a child's play to escape from here.</span> <span id="s275">It really was.</span> <span id="s276">But as we came to the same school from where they take my brother out, I find there the brother of my father with his family, two old people, and two old other people, Greenfeld, and Mrs. Greenfeld, also very good friends of our family.</span> <span id="s277">So they were very happy that somebody young is coming with them.</span> <span id="s278">And I was foolish, or I don't know what happened with me, so I went with the transport to Poland.</span> <span id="s279">I could escape even in Chilina.</span> <span id="s280">We can move free on the railway station.</span> <span id="s281">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s282">I was, maybe I was too much trusting in my ability.</span> <span id="s283">And I had the opinion that if I want I can escape when I want.</span> <span id="s284">13 And from there we went, we passed the fronchar.</span> <span id="s285">We saw that we are in Poland.</span> <span id="s286">But the wagons, they are not wagons for a personal train, but for goods, for transportation for different kind of goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What year, what time is this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: It is exactly the 4th May, 1942, as we moved from Michalovce, this transport.</span> <span id="s289">And it takes about two days, as we arrived to Milingihed Sporlavski.</span> <span id="s290">It was a small Jewish town where they concentrated some people from Roge.</span> <span id="s291">It was a big town in Poland.</span> <span id="s292">The Jewish people from Indirhed.</span> <span id="s293">And then about 1,000 people from our transport.</span> <span id="s294">It was exactly 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s295">25 wagons per 40 persons.</span> <span id="s296">We arrived in the station and we fell in German hands.</span> <span id="s297">The S.S., dogs, schnell, schnell, schnell, and before you could see what's happened somebody kicked you in your leg or in your ass and we saw that it's not a joke.</span> <span id="s298">And so we went in such a group to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s299">It was a big building.</span> <span id="s300">We came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Some old people were sitting in.</span> <span id="s302">And I saw the first time fully digressed people sick, full with this, I don't know how you call it, but you have in your head, if you are not clean enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Lice.</span> <span id="s304">.</span> <span id="s305">.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Lice.</span> <span id="s307">And not only in their head, but even inside the skin.</span> <span id="s308">I was sick when I saw this.</span> <span id="s309">So I was sure that it will not be a joke to stay here.</span> <span id="s310">Then we moved on different places to different codes, in houses.</span> <span id="s311">And as I saw what kind of 14 VILI ~ FRIED accommodation we get, I was sure it was only for summer.</span> <span id="s312">That we have not make any questions how it will be in winter, because I was sure that in winter nobody will exist from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">The next day came the president of the Udenterat.</span> <span id="s314">It was also the Jewish, uh . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">He spoke very good Czech because he was in Prague like a student.</span> <span id="s318">He had a big drugstore in Minziret.</span> <span id="s319">He was a nice man.</span> <span id="s320">And they take everybody who was able to work, men.</span> <span id="s321">We had been about 310 girls and we went to a place called Rogosnetchka and Visokov where it was only one big barrack.</span> <span id="s322">And near to this place was beginning the big forests and the river.</span> <span id="s323">And we started to work in these forests making wood.</span> <span id="s324">I don't know for whom.</span> <span id="s325">And the part of us were working to building a bridge for this river from wood.</span> <span id="s326">It was in the middle of May, 1942.</span> <span id="s327">Nearly to the end of July we get information that the families left in Milingihed Sporlavski was taken away to, away.</span> <span id="s328">Meanwhile, we could go to Milingihed to take what was left from ours, and so.</span> <span id="s329">You know why it's crazy to tell it, but the only way to come through the first month in Poland was to sell everything what you have on you.</span> <span id="s330">First the jacket, then a shirt, then the shoes.</span> <span id="s331">Because the people, I mean, the Polish people was all so poor.</span> <span id="s332">And if you want to have a little milk or you want to have maybe five kilo potatoes, you have to give up a pair of socks.</span> <span id="s333">No money.</span> <span id="s334">15 So we take some things and went to, back, and then sometimes we can go to this town, to Milingihed Sporlavski.</span> <span id="s335">It was not permitted, but not on the main road, through the forest you can achieve it.</span> <span id="s336">And we went, we had some connections to a family, they had a small factory for landscape matins.</span> <span id="s337">We met, his name was about Yaborchek or Yaborsky or so.</span> <span id="s338">And they explained to us what is Treblinki.</span> <span id="s339">Because two brothers who went with the same transport as our families in July, they came back.</span> <span id="s340">We wouldn't believe that all is true what they told us.</span> <span id="s341">We asked if it is so that they have there so many S.S., so many Ukraine policemen, so many Lithuanian killers.</span> <span id="s342">How could you escape?</span> <span id="s343">And so the younger told me it was very easy, but others, Jewish members help us out.</span> <span id="s344">We are working in a group which was loading shoes, clothes and other things what the people bring to Treblinki.</span> <span id="s345">And in the last wagon, it was evening, we stay in the wagon, but they didn't close the wagon.</span> <span id="s346">And so when we moved from Treblinki we could open the wagon to jump from the wagon and came home.</span> <span id="s347">But in a few days I heard that somebody was telling that they escaped from Treblinki and the German S.S., they take them.</span> <span id="s348">So we have been sure, and so we have very good contact to the Polish people around.</span> <span id="s349">So, for example, in this forest was a man, his name was Hijuc, he was very sympathy.</span> <span id="s350">He has a big sympathy to us.</span> <span id="s351">And he allowed us to make a bunker in the forest and my cousin and two other men and one boy from a village, I 16 don't remember exactly, but the name of this boy was Edek.</span> <span id="s352">He was about, say, 17, 18 years.</span> <span id="s353">He helped us to make the bunker, to buy some food, I mean, potatoes and such things.</span> <span id="s354">And we are expecting when they came to take us.</span> <span id="s355">And I came not very often but once, two times a week, but in connection with a German and Polish administration of the camp.</span> <span id="s356">So if I would go away, so maybe it wouldn't be so good.</span> <span id="s357">But these three boys, they went away and they stay in the bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">And the next day, I don't remember, it was maybe a week or ten days or so, really one day afternoon came trucks, Latvanian and German S.S. men, and they started to shut and take us away.</span> <span id="s359">They took us on the tracks and they brought us, on each track, to soldiers with guns.</span> <span id="s360">They took us to Milingihed Sporlavski and we stayed on the square sitting on the stones and waiting.</span> <span id="s361">I have seen there very many awful things.</span> <span id="s362">I saw how they killed small children one year or so only, take by the foots and broken their heads.</span> <span id="s363">It was awful.</span> <span id="s364">I knew that it is the beginning of the end.</span> <span id="s365">At evening we went to a big barrack and put, we spoke about that we destroy the barrack.</span> <span id="s366">It was only from wood, and we try to escape.</span> <span id="s367">But then somebody from the Germans and we saw that machine guns had been around, five, six machine guns, we .</span> <span id="s368">.</span> <span id="s369">could do it, but the percentage of success, maybe five, maybe ten percent, not more.</span> <span id="s370">The next day we went on the railway station.</span> <span id="s371">They put us in wagons.</span> <span id="s372">We came then to Lukof.</span> <span id="s373">.</span> <span id="s374">In Lukof they connected more wagons.</span> <span id="s375">And the train went slowly, slowly, 17 slowly.</span> <span id="s376">We saw that we are passing railway stations Cherletz.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">And we knew that from Cherletz is a railway station, the next railway station on the right side, not the railway station; but the railway road, is to Markeniza.</span> <span id="s378">And before Markeniza was the next station Treblinka.</span> <span id="s379">And we knew what Treblinka means.</span> <span id="s380">So everybody started, we was thinking how to, what to do.</span> <span id="s381">And on the windows on the wagons they have been not covered already, but only wires with nails.</span> <span id="s382">So we tried to lock them.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Maybe we could do it.</span> <span id="s384">But after Cherletz we passed a main station.</span> <span id="s385">As we came out you feel it because when you are going through this crossingways.</span> <span id="s386">So the train made a stop.</span> <span id="s387">And somebody opened the door from outside and a German soldier came in and asking, "Schnell, schnell, schnell."</span> <span id="s388">And somebody gave him 500 Latien.</span> <span id="s389">So it was not enough for him, so he was always urging, "More, more money, more (?)</span> <span id="s390">."</span> <span id="s391">And between we heard that the train is moving, "Whoo," that it wants to move.</span> <span id="s392">I don't know what happened, but it happened.</span> <span id="s393">I was there, very near.</span> <span id="s394">Somebody took a wire on his neck, we called it a Satirian tie, and the German was ready, he couldn't make a noise or something, and the wagon was open.</span> <span id="s395">So it was the way for us to escape.</span> <span id="s396">And so the people, the boys and the older people, started to jump.</span> <span id="s397">And of course I have done the same.</span> <span id="s398">I was lying a short time until the train passed away, and then I stand up and near to me a second man that came to me, "Where we go?"</span> <span id="s399">I told him, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s400">I don't know where I 18 am."</span> <span id="s401">But I told him, or he told me, first, far, we have to go from the railway road because it's dangerous to stay here.</span> <span id="s402">So . . . that, doggies.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Dogs barking.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s405">So I said, "Where is the dog?"</span> <span id="s406">So they leave people.</span> <span id="s407">So we went in this direction and we came to a farmer house.</span> <span id="s408">And we didn't go inside, into the house, into the code.</span> <span id="s409">We went to the place where he had the horses or a cow and on the top, on the stable, was what the cows are eating, hay, yes.</span> <span id="s410">And we went in, waiting, because it was cold outside.</span> <span id="s411">And maybe we had been there two or three hours, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s412">Somebody came.</span> <span id="s413">And it was the son of the owner.</span> <span id="s414">He was a young boy.</span> <span id="s415">He was asking, "Who are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s417">I told him, "We are from the transport.</span> <span id="s418">We are from Czechoslovakia."</span> <span id="s419">So he told us, "You have to stay here, not to move, because if my father would see you, he is calling the Germans."</span> <span id="s420">So we stayed there.</span> <span id="s421">In the morning he brought us soup, potato soup, and the whole day we were sitting, not sitting, but being like in a hole.</span> <span id="s422">At evening he came in.</span> <span id="s423">It was afternoon, towards four o'clock or so, he told me, "I have, I know a family in the next village and I know the man, he will certainly help 19 you.</span> <span id="s424">He belongs to a political group.</span> <span id="s425">He is working on the railway road, and we know that he is helping for such people as you are."</span> <span id="s426">The other man, he was from Poland, he doesn't came with me.</span> <span id="s427">I went alone.</span> <span id="s428">We came to a house.</span> <span id="s429">He went in, he came out with a man, he was only about 40, 42 years old, dressed in the uniform of the people who are working on the railway roads.</span> <span id="s430">And he took us to the stable, took me to the stable, I was sleeping there.</span> <span id="s431">He has a full house of girls there making from linen, homemade linen.</span> <span id="s432">And the next day I get a good breakfast, and he gave me something which we call, if you are putting out potatoes from there on this old style, you need a, it's what you are doing, it's something, you see it by the constructors, they are working with such things.</span> <span id="s433">: A shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: A shovel, yeah.</span> <span id="s435">And I put it on my, and went like a Polish man.</span> <span id="s436">I meet some people.</span> <span id="s437">I say, "Gendobre, gendobre."</span> <span id="s438">It's Polish.</span> <span id="s439">And I went from village to village, but not on the main roads.</span> <span id="s440">And so I went so maybe four, five, six hours.</span> <span id="s441">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s442">I have to pass the main, to cross the main road.</span> <span id="s443">I was, and I saw that it came so long, about maybe seven or eight racks of German gendarmarie, (?)</span> <span id="s444">.</span> <span id="s445">gendarmarie.</span> <span id="s446">So I was standing near to the road and saying, "Gendobre, gendobre," like a Polish slave, and one of the men, "Come here."</span> <span id="s447">And so I came near to the guard.</span> <span id="s448">"What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s449">"Oh, I was working," I said, in Polish, not in 20 German.</span> <span id="s450">"I am going home."</span> <span id="s451">"Where?"</span> <span id="s452">"Oh, here, not far."</span> <span id="s453">"So come with us."</span> <span id="s454">So I jump on the place where the driver was.</span> <span id="s455">I said, "I am not going in car because it's not far."</span> <span id="s456">And you can imagine what is going on in my head, but it takes about maybe, I don't know how many minutes.</span> <span id="s457">They went to Tresk.</span> <span id="s458">It was a village where they have their camp.</span> <span id="s459">I jumped down and say, "Thank you very much."</span> <span id="s460">"Danka, danka, danka."</span> <span id="s461">(He sighs.)</span> <span id="s462">made so, and went to the other side of the road and straight to the forest.</span> <span id="s463">I came to a village, I don't know what the village it was, but I don't went into the village.</span> <span id="s464">I went to the first house which was a little bit isolated from the village.</span> <span id="s465">I came in.</span> <span id="s466">So I wanted to buy a little milk and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s467">I explained that I'm working there and there and I'm going home.</span> <span id="s468">And the lady told me, "Oh, you are not going in a good direction."</span> <span id="s469">I told her, "Why not?</span> <span id="s470">am living there.</span> <span id="s471">I don't know another direction where I should go."</span> <span id="s472">"So take care because in the forests around the last night went many transports from France and from Greece to the camp, to . . . " She doesn't tell me to the camp.</span> <span id="s473">"In this direction.</span> <span id="s474">And many of the people jump from the train."</span> <span id="s475">From France and from Greece, but mostly from France, they brought the Jews not in wagons like us, but in regular coaches for, like for civil people, for civilians.</span> <span id="s476">And so it was easy for them to leave the train.</span> <span id="s477">And she told me, "And the gendarmarie is in this forest and they are shooting a lot of people."</span> <span id="s478">"Oh, it doesn't connect 21 me.</span> <span id="s479">What have I to do with the transportations or so?"</span> <span id="s480">Maybe she believed me or not.</span> <span id="s481">So I take the milk and the bread, I was going away.</span> <span id="s482">And the next night, I stay in the free.</span> <span id="s483">I didn't went to a house, only between wood, it was cold, but I, the next day I went in the direction of Minziret.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">And I knew that on this part, I mean, Minziret, in direction to Shedletz, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s485">And our camp was Minziret in direction to Breslitoks, to the former Russian (?)</span> <span id="s486">.</span> <span id="s487">So I knew that there were working a big group of Jewish, Polish, some Polish prisoners, especially Jews.</span> <span id="s488">They were working by a company which was building roads.</span> <span id="s489">The name was Stuach.</span> <span id="s490">Strass und (?)</span> <span id="s491">.</span> <span id="s492">And I want to achieve them before they finish the work.</span> <span id="s493">And together with this group of two or three hundred people, to go in Minziret, because I was afraid to go alone.</span> <span id="s494">And it was good.</span> <span id="s495">I came there and I started to, not to work but to do as I would work, and I came between them and told them, Polish and Jew and Yiddish, that, who I am.</span> <span id="s496">And I went with them.</span> <span id="s497">So I came to Minziret, and in Minziret I went to the boss, who was, he was a Polish engineer and he was the boss of the camps in Visokov in Rogosnetchka.</span> <span id="s498">I sold him some things and he doesn't give me money.</span> <span id="s499">So I was so naive I went to him to ask him if he will give me the money because I need the money.</span> <span id="s500">I came in, he was very surprised, his wife and children were home, he told me yes, "(?)"</span> <span id="s501">I am going, I will take the money.</span> <span id="s502">He went away.</span> <span id="s503">It was 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.</span> <span id="s504">I told 22 his wife, "He maybe will be a long time in the city, in the town.</span> <span id="s505">I am going to have a look, and coming back."</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Would you continue your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: And, as I mentioned before, I was not sure if Mr. Borlinsky, or what was his name?</span> <span id="s509">He will come back with the money or not.</span> <span id="s510">So I decided to go away without money but with my, on my legs and healthy.</span> <span id="s511">And the next way, my way was to go to the forest where Mr. Hichug was the boss and where we had the bunk, to my friends, and to arrive there and to try to jump on a plane, not on a plane, but on a train, to try to come backeto, not to Czechoslovakia, but to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s512">I was sure that if I will come back I could stay alive in Slovakia because I had some good friends and I could have Christian papers and it would be not a problem for me to stay there.</span> <span id="s513">But as I came in the bunker to Mr. Hichug, and to this bunker, to my cousin and two other boys, they told me they tried, it's impossible because on some places where the train is breaking and going slower that you can jump on the train, it's impossible to go in, because the Germans are very, they are, they have special guards on these places.</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">So I talked to this Mr. Hichug and he told me that maybe it would be good for you and for Edek, it was these Polish people, to make some contacts here in this part, in direction Grodava in this big forest.</span> <span id="s517">I heard that there are some Soviet 23 soldiers and they are living in these forests and maybe you could go to them.</span> <span id="s518">So why only me and this Edek?</span> <span id="s519">Because the other people, they're too, I would say, too Jewish.</span> <span id="s520">And so I decided with Edek that we will go.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: What do you mean by "too Jewish"?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: You have to know that the Polish people, and even some Ukraine people, they don't like Jews.</span> <span id="s523">They have been, I would not say the whole nation, but many of them have been very big anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s524">And by the word Jew, sometimes they wouldn't help you, and not only help you, but even they, it has been many cases.</span> <span id="s525">I could speak about the actual cases.</span> <span id="s526">That a family, take a Jewish family, and in the first 100 meters of the forest they kill them and took away what they have.</span> <span id="s527">It happens, such things.</span> <span id="s528">So I went with Edek and we came to Gerotine, and to a family.</span> <span id="s529">And the next night we met two Russian soldiers, not partisan this time, and we spoke to them.</span> <span id="s530">Ah, so and so, but have you weapon, have you this?</span> <span id="s531">No, we haven't.</span> <span id="s532">"Have you been a soldier?"</span> <span id="s533">I told yes, I was a soldier.</span> <span id="s534">I was in an officer's school.</span> <span id="s535">"So come with me, come with us."</span> <span id="s536">And so they took us to their group.</span> <span id="s537">It wasn't a real group of organized partisans.</span> <span id="s538">I say it was a group of people who want to live, and the only one .</span> <span id="s539">.</span> <span id="s540">way how to come through was to have a gun and to fight.</span> <span id="s541">And because my situation was the same I didn't went to them for a reason that I will fight again Germans, becauss it, what can do I alone against the Germans.</span> <span id="s542">But I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s543">And to stay in 24 2 this bunk in the wintertime, it was not very good because first of all the snow on the bunk wasn't so constant-like around.</span> <span id="s544">The second, if you are going here and there you will leave, yes.</span> <span id="s545">So I saw that even Mr. Hichug wasn't happy that we are on his territory.</span> <span id="s546">I mean, this Mr. Hichug, he was the boss about the forest.</span> <span id="s547">So I decided to stay with them.</span> <span id="s548">I told them that I am from Czechoslovakia and so, but only the truth, because I knew that they have been so afraid, as I was, because their life was not guaranteed.</span> <span id="s549">So we went together.</span> <span id="s550">They have certain places in the forest where they have their bunkers and what they have done, they have built some good connections with certain families.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did these soldiers know you were Jewish at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I didn't tell them, they didn't ask.</span> <span id="s553">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s554">I, maybe that, yes.</span> <span id="s555">But according what I spoke to them it was about 20 people or so, I know that in name only, not in the family name, but only on Peorta, Avon, Volodya, Rishar, and so.</span> <span id="s556">One man, I mean, Peorta Dugi.</span> <span id="s557">He was a very tall.man.</span> <span id="s558">He was working like a commandant.</span> <span id="s559">But he was not in a shot that he was a lieutenant or something like this.</span> <span id="s560">He was the strongest and he was maybe clever enough.</span> <span id="s561">He knew something about how to move irregular.</span> <span id="s562">And he was quite good in preparing, preparing material for destructions.</span> <span id="s563">And this was very important.</span> <span id="s564">And then, as I told, as I mentioned, they had to many families very 25 good connections to Polish people and Togram people.</span> <span id="s565">And these connections was made on the fact that if they had something from the Germans so they divided it with the people around, because they had been very poor.</span> <span id="s566">And except of this, they need weapons.</span> <span id="s567">The Poles, I know why, but this time I couldn't understand, because it was a big danger for them.</span> <span id="s568">And so, if this group decided to do something it was not because they get some orders from higher commandant oW so.</span> <span id="s569">Only to get everything what they need for their, for our living and then to show the Germans that somebody is there, is here, who can do something against them.</span> <span id="s570">It was very good.</span> <span id="s571">I personally had very good, also very good connections to some Polish families.</span> <span id="s572">I, from the day as we came to Poland I learned Polish.</span> <span id="s573">I read newspapers.</span> <span id="s574">I read books to learn the language.</span> <span id="s575">Because I know that the language can help me very much if I have to live between them, because such a possibility was here.</span> <span id="s576">But this winter was really a very, very strong winter, '42, '43.</span> <span id="s577">Outside it was sometimes 25, 30 degree celsius.</span> <span id="s578">I don't know how much, but it's more, it's hundred, I don't know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Below zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Below zero, yes.</span> <span id="s581">And we have been unable .</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">to live so.</span> <span id="s584">So some of this group went to Polish families and they have been hidden and so I told them that even I have the possibility to move and promised that in the Spring we will come back.</span> <span id="s585">And I come back to this bunker, to Mr. Hichug, but my 26 friends haven't been there.</span> <span id="s586">They have been in another bunker, in a stable.</span> <span id="s587">In such a house where in the summertime the horses have been, the horses which were working in the woods.</span> <span id="s588">And so, as I came there, we decided to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s589">It was not a decision, but I thought, "I am going back."</span> <span id="s590">And we send, Mr. Hichug arranged us, that somebody went to Minziret and was going around the ghetto to look if there is alive, or who is there, and so, and he came back and told us yes, he saw people in the ghetto and the gates were not closed, so that the Jewish people who stay in the ghetto can move free.</span> <span id="s591">So I decided to go back.</span> <span id="s592">I came into the ghetto, but it was the end of February, middle of February.</span> <span id="s593">And I met some people who I knew, even from our transport.</span> <span id="s594">It was a boy from the next village, Freddie.</span> <span id="s595">I don't remember his other name.</span> <span id="s596">And then the second one, Joseph.</span> <span id="s597">And later came my cousin, and to this ghetto, Victor.</span> <span id="s598">It was good, because we hadn't been outside, but we haven't a place where to live because all these barracks have been full with people sick, and typhus was very strong.</span> <span id="s599">And my cousin died on typhus on this place.</span> <span id="s600">After the Spring, it was coming.</span> <span id="s601">So, and we were working in the houses where before have been Jewish houses, and some bring all what it was in the houses left.</span> <span id="s602">The commandant of this works was a German gendarme.</span> <span id="s603">He was, I wouldn't say that he was good, but he was very correct.</span> <span id="s604">A very simple man, very correct and I wouldn't say that he was very lucky, what happened to part of people like 27 we are.</span> <span id="s605">And he was also every evening collecting from us all the things.</span> <span id="s606">Some money, what we found, or some rubles in gold, or some Polish money or some jewelry.</span> <span id="s607">Because we have to go through all the pieces of cloth.</span> <span id="s608">And, of course, we were working something, even of our own invoice, but not very much.</span> <span id="s609">And in the middle of, it could be spring.</span> <span id="s610">It was spring, it was warm.</span> <span id="s611">Maybe April or so.</span> <span id="s612">One of our Czechoslovak, from our transport, was in, he was a tailor.</span> <span id="s613">And, you know, "Kraviats, kraviats."</span> <span id="s614">It means a tailor in Polish.</span> <span id="s615">He was working by the farmers and if we had in the forest not 200, only 185 people, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s616">So he was working and getting food and so bringing for us, and he send a lady, she was a widow, a farmer.</span> <span id="s617">I think her name was Stefaniska.</span> <span id="s618">She has a son, he was nearly the same age as I am.</span> <span id="s619">I was sometimes, as we worked in the forest, maybe two or three times in their house.</span> <span id="s620">She came in near to the ghetto, and she asked for me.</span> <span id="s621">They called me Panvilek, Vilek.</span> <span id="s622">So somebody told me, "Here is a Polish lady.</span> <span id="s623">She wants to talk to you."</span> <span id="s624">A Polish lady, to me.</span> <span id="s625">So I went to her, I talked to her, and she told me that Kraviats is very, very (?)</span> <span id="s626">.</span> <span id="s627">Yes.</span> <span id="s628">That he wants that I come to him.</span> <span id="s629">So I told her, "I don't know, I talk to my friends, if yes or not."</span> <span id="s630">But later, in a few days, I decided to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">.</span> <span id="s632">.</span> <span id="s633">Mrs. Stefaniska came.</span> <span id="s634">I told her that I will go, but I will move alone.</span> <span id="s635">And so one night I packed my things, what I have and went at night on the other, on the other, on the (?)</span> <span id="s636">.</span> <span id="s637">part of the road to Brest, to Rogosnetchka, to the house of Mrs. Stefaniska.</span> <span id="s638">We 28 called her, "Mamousha."</span> <span id="s639">And then I talked to her son and he didn't tell me directly, but I could understand that he had some connection to real partisan groups.</span> <span id="s640">So I mentioned I had an opinion that he is on the side of the so-called Army Algudobrit.</span> <span id="s641">It's the People front, the army of the people.</span> <span id="s642">And it was, really.</span> <span id="s643">So he told me yes, if you want, we can go.</span> <span id="s644">So we went the next day or night or afternoon and in two days, not even in two days, but about before 36 hours we arrived in a certain place, and I met the first time two men from a regular partisan group.</span> <span id="s645">I told them that I am from Czechoslovakia, how I came, I came with the transport.</span> <span id="s646">"What kind of transport?"</span> <span id="s647">I explained what the transport, it was.</span> <span id="s648">"Where did you live the last weeks?"</span> <span id="s649">I told them in the ghetto, and former I was here, and I was in connection, and I worked together with your friends on this part.</span> <span id="s650">They told me, "Okay."</span> <span id="s651">We went in, in the forest, and after three, four or five hours, I don't know how exactly, we came to a place where there have been bunks, and I was waiting.</span> <span id="s652">And the next day I spoke to a man, according to his, I don't know how to explain, he was, I saw that he was an intelligent man.</span> <span id="s653">He knows something about Czechoslovakia and about different things.</span> <span id="s654">I know because he was asking me.</span> <span id="s655">And he told me, "Okay."</span> <span id="s656">.</span> <span id="s657">.</span> <span id="s658">And so I didn't get any weapon.</span> <span id="s659">I started to work first near the kitchen and so.</span> <span id="s660">And then I don't know, I cannot remember exactly how it happened, he came to me.and he told me, "You speak German?"</span> <span id="s661">I told him, "Yes."</span> <span id="s662">"You speak German?"</span> <span id="s663">29 "Yes, but I am not a German.</span> <span id="s664">I speak German because I went to school, and except of this I came with the transport.</span> <span id="s665">I am Jewish."</span> <span id="s666">I told it to this commandant, but not in that way as I am telling it to you.</span> <span id="s667">So he was looking at me, told me, "Okay."</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: What were the other people like in the woods.</span> <span id="s669">What was the environment in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Was it . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: In that part of the Vitrosher, and I think so it was even so in Ukraine, the Germans didn't make any difference between a friend of Germany and an enemy of Germany.</span> <span id="s672">For them it was only a Ukraine or a white Russian, you see.</span> <span id="s673">They don't like them, they hate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">And they don't, they don't act with the people like with human beings.</span> <span id="s675">The horse had a bigger value for them like a man.</span> <span id="s676">And so it happened that the whole territory was a hell to the Germans.</span> <span id="s677">They have been, they have occupied the whole territories.</span> <span id="s678">But they have been the bosses on the roads only until the night.</span> <span id="s679">When the night came, no German could move alone.</span> <span id="s680">Even if he could, he was afraid to move.</span> <span id="s681">Because everybody was his enemy, every tree, every ten years old boy was his enemy.</span> <span id="s682">Not because they hate the Germans, because they are Germans, but they hate them, what they have done.</span> <span id="s683">For example, if we made an attack on a German group.</span> <span id="s684">The village which was near to this place, the people was killed and they burned up the houses.</span> <span id="s685">Because their mind was that if somebody has done here, has made here an attack against us he must have connection with the people.</span> <span id="s686">They have been right.</span> <span id="s687">But 30 the connection was only with few people, not with the whole people in the village.</span> <span id="s688">And so it happened that families with children came in the forest because they haven't got other choice.</span> <span id="s689">They couldn't live alone outside.</span> <span id="s690">And, of course, who was able to fight, he was a partisan who not the boys, 10, 12 years, they have been very good spies.</span> <span id="s691">You could send them here and there to have a look what's happened here, how many soltdiers are on this bridge, how it looks there.</span> <span id="s692">And this, my commandant, later, I don't know if it was at the same time as I came, he should be in his hands.</span> <span id="s693">Many of the intelligence things, what have been done.</span> <span id="s694">If in the first time the program of the partisans was, it's only my combination.</span> <span id="s695">I have no documents to, if in the first time was to fight the Germans, at this time, when the Germans came, they have been bitten by Moscow and by, I don't know, and different other places to (?)</span> <span id="s696">.</span> <span id="s697">So the Soviet army was more active.</span> <span id="s698">So the main, uh, the main, I can say it in this way.</span> <span id="s699">The main thing that the partisans have to do to protect the people which was living around, and to enable for the enemy, I mean, for the Germans, to send troops to the East, to enable them to send ammunition, food and everything.</span> <span id="s700">It means to spoil the roads, to spoil the bridges, to spoil the railroads.</span> <span id="s701">And by this .</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">Mr. Gulevich, our group was about 12, 13 in this 100, 120 group, was to, if they catch the German or two Germans or more, to press them to get information from which battalion they are, what they are doing here, if they are expecting reserves.</span> <span id="s704">Everything what, 31 | | if you have been a soldier you know what it is to assemble information about your enemy.</span> <span id="s705">And to translate it, if we get a | map.</span> <span id="s706">If we get some other documents to make translations, yes.</span> <span id="s707">g If we, we had a radio station and they always try, they was try | to catch something in German.</span> <span id="s708">And then from this small 0 information, to translate it, and to do something with this.</span> <span id="s709">So it was very good for me that I didn't, I never asked nothing.</span> <span id="s710">I get . . . Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Let me take you back just a little bit to your group.</span> <span id="s712">What nationality, do you know the nationalities of the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s714">It was, the normal soldiers had been partly from Russian prisoners who run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">From young men and some girls from the counties around.</span> <span id="s716">But the top organizatorsf they came by parachute, paradesance.</span> <span id="s717">It was mostly the commandant and the professional soldiers.</span> <span id="s718">They came, the professional officers, they came from, with parachutes.</span> <span id="s719">But the commissar, you know what the commissar means?</span> <span id="s720">The political leading came mostly from the place where we have been working because they knew everybody and I think that the organization of the communistic party was nearly the same as it was in the pre .</span> <span id="s721">.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">.</span> <span id="s723">.</span> <span id="s724">war time, but not with the same people.</span> <span id="s725">Somebody was the president of the communist party in a county.</span> <span id="s726">When the Germans came in, when the invasion was, when the war was, so he was still the boss, and his word was the last word.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Most of the civilians were Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Not most.</span> <span id="s729">It was mostly white Russian and Ukraine people.</span> <span id="s730">Q: Let me, can you pinpoint the geographic area now?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: The geographic area was if you take the map you see the city Breslitoks.</span> <span id="s732">It's on the river bank on the other side.</span> <span id="s733">And it's main traffic point where the roads and the railway roads are dividing in different places.</span> <span id="s734">If you are looking directly to the east there are the roads and other communications through Pinsk, on the southern border of white Russia.</span> <span id="s735">In the northwest direction the roads and rails to Vitepsk, to the middle of white Russia, and more to the left to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s736">It was the capital of white Russia.</span> <span id="s737">Between Pinsk and this road to Vitepsk, this was the place where we moved.</span> <span id="s738">kll the groups, even, it means our group has more places.</span> <span id="s739">It is to explain so, that you have to build a part of our soldiers, of our members, they were mostly working on a replace basis.</span> <span id="s740">It means that if you want to move from this place to another place you must know where, and you must have a depot with food, with ammunition, because you, sometimes you haven't time, if you are running away from this place, to take everything with you.</span> <span id="s741">So we .</span> <span id="s742">.</span> <span id="s743">had maybe sometimes 50, 60 kilometers, it's about 30, 40 miles, an area, and we had three, four reserve places where we could move only with our, with a gun, and with the necessary personal things.</span> <span id="s744">All other was on these places.</span> <span id="s745">So that the part was building these bunkers under there and taking there ammunition reserves, what we need.</span> <span id="s746">This was one.</span> <span id="s747">So that if we want to move from village, Kopanitse to a village, I don't know where.</span> <span id="s748">We knew that we have to move to this place.</span> <span id="s749">And the exact place where it was, we knew from the, not we knew, but the information, we get the information from the people living around in villages or in isolated places.</span> <span id="s750">And then we have to do something.</span> <span id="s751">I'm in an action to operate.</span> <span id="s752">It was impossible to do something, the same thing on the same place two times, or three times.</span> <span id="s753">So if we, at evening we went out and prepared action to catch one or three German trucks which went alone on the road.</span> <span id="s754">So we went to a certain place.</span> <span id="s755">We have a certain style how to do it.</span> <span id="s756">Mostly it was made so that in the forest, in the middle of the road, here was trees on this side and on this side, and you take a very strong wire, you take it on a tree and when it was late evening, late afternoon, and you saw something, so somebody run on the other side and take the wire on the other, and the truck was maybe 50, 60 or more kilometers he came to this wire and, you know, it was like a knife.</span> <span id="s757">And then the 20 people from one side, 20 from other side, but not everybody, if somebody was officer it was a very good fish for us, or if somebody has this, well, he .</span> <span id="s758">.</span> <span id="s759">has the maps, it was also very good.</span> <span id="s760">So mostly we take these people and we don't need nothing from them.</span> <span id="s761">Maybe some food or some weapons or some 34 ammunition.</span> <span id="s762">Nothing.</span> <span id="s763">And you have to run away.</span> <span id="s764">Where?</span> <span id="s765">Not to the nearest base, but somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the leader of your group and some of the other missions that you participated in?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: So my leader, he was an officer.</span> <span id="s768">They called him Coroner.</span> <span id="s769">If he was a real coroner or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s770">He was about 35 years old, a nice man, educated.</span> <span id="s771">And he knows very well about radio and this connections what you use in a rod if you have to give through information.</span> <span id="s772">And he was the owner of the code.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Gurevich.</span> <span id="s775">If it was his real name or not, everyone called him Tovaish Comrade Gurevich.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">I had a friend, he was, I think so, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s777">He didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s778">He was a Czech.</span> <span id="s779">His name was Schlezinger.</span> <span id="s780">We had been together, he came from Burno.</span> <span id="s781">It's a town in Bohemia, a big town.</span> <span id="s782">And we had been together, but after a certain time they take him away to another group.</span> <span id="s783">And we met after nearly eight months, again, in the Czechoslovak army.</span> <span id="s784">And meanwhile it was so that the Germans have moved too many men and ammunition and weapons to the east, and from the information we saw that they prepare something in these parts.</span> <span id="s785">And I don't know exactly when it was, the date, but it was a very, very hard fight in which the Russians take about 50, 60,000 prisoners.</span> <span id="s786">If you know more about the second World War, it was the group which Stalin decided that, it was 11 generals, third marshals, high officers, a lot of them, and soldiers, and it was the group which usually has been the nearest to Moscow.</span> <span id="s787">And Stalin in his big speech, he told, "You are the generals and the marshalls who want to see Moscow.</span> <span id="s788">So I will enable you to see Moscow."</span> <span id="s789">And they took them and they was 24 hours marching through Moscow like prisoners.</span> <span id="s790">You know how it was for such gentlemen like these Marshalls were, have been, not were.</span> <span id="s791">And the, you know what they had already done, when they went through so many cars which are in towns washing the streets.</span> <span id="s792">I don't know how you, they are spraying water to clean the streets, went after them because nothing can stay in the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Must be cleaned when the Germans went through Moscow.</span> <span id="s794">So after this big fight more of the groups, we have neighbors on the right side and on the left side, but I will tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s795">I didn't, I mentioned it, I didn't want to ask very much, because it was not good, especially for me.</span> <span id="s796">And, because I wasn't Soviet and it was, I wanted, I don't know what I wanted, I wanted to came over the war.</span> <span id="s797">So we passed through the rest of the German groups.</span> <span id="s798">They have been totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s799">The morale and everything.</span> <span id="s800">We came to, it was near, I think so, it was near to Orsha.</span> <span id="s801">It's a town in white Russia.</span> <span id="s802">And we passed through the Soviet side, all, mostly all, I mean, our group.</span> <span id="s803">And then we went to the next commandatura.</span> <span id="s804">It was the institution which was collecting, not soldiers, and prepare them 36 to take them into the army.</span> <span id="s805">And the partisans was not really real soldiers.</span> <span id="s806">And there I said that I'm from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s807">They asked me if I wanted to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s808">I told them yes.</span> <span id="s809">I couldn't say no, because otherwise they would take me to forced labor, I don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: What time frame are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Oh, it's beginning '44.</span> <span id="s812">Meanwhile I was, I had typhus and I came back.</span> <span id="s813">I was hidden by this Mrs. Stefanska, and she helped me to come through.</span> <span id="s814">I lost my hairs, and it was very, very complicated.</span> <span id="s815">And as we have been by the reserve regiment for training, one of my commandant was Lieutenant Schufman.</span> <span id="s816">He was such a very nice, intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s817">He was talking to me, and so and so and so.</span> <span id="s818">And he told me once, "Tell me, Viliam, why you didn't go to the Czechoslovak army?"</span> <span id="s819">I told him I heard that in the Soviet Union we have, has to be a Czechoslovak army, but I didn't know it until yet, if it is true, I know that our army is in the Middle East, in Palestina, and then near to Tobrouk.</span> <span id="s820">It was mostly Czech and Slovak people who have been abroad, and some Jewish people from Israel who left Czechoslovakia in '37, '38, '39.</span> <span id="s821">They went to Israel.</span> <span id="s822">-I told him if it was possible I would like to go.</span> <span id="s823">And after a few days, I don't remember how it happened exactly, they called me on the commander tour, why you want to leave our Army?</span> <span id="s824">I don't want to leave our Army, but if it is a Czechoslovak army it would be much better for me to go there.</span> <span id="s825">So in a few days I get a 37 .</span> <span id="s826">~ commandirovka, papers to go to Novokopesk.</span> <span id="s827">It was on Ukraine, it is a river Hobersk, and on that river is such a typical Ukraine town.</span> <span id="s828">It's not big, but it's like a big village.</span> <span id="s829">And there was prepared the so-called Second Brigade of the Czechoslovak army.</span> <span id="s830">It was a parachute group.</span> <span id="s831">It was mostly from Slovak soldiers which have been getting in prison, because the Slovak army was fighting against the Soviet Union on the side of the Germans.</span> <span id="s832">And then one group, about 600 men, they escaped from the Slovak army to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s833">And I will tell you the truth, that I was not very happy when I arrived there, because I met some officers who I knew from the year '38 and so, from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s834">And then it was in the, it was once a day the soldiers get an order, they are reading what you have to do the next day, and so.</span> <span id="s835">It was, if somebody's artilleries, he was working with artillery, has to go to this and this department.</span> <span id="s836">I was in artilleries, I went there and they sent me to come in Expodorsk, in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s837">From there, in the other place, to Rvono, they made a very strong proof my person.</span> <span id="s838">I don't know how they have done it.</span> <span id="s839">I told you the same as I told today to you that I worked in Zlene by Battah and there I told that I am Jewish, and they found people who was working .</span> <span id="s840">.</span> <span id="s841">also by Battah, and they came to light me through.</span> <span id="s842">They were not asking what I was doing, but if I knew these people, this man, and this boss, and with whom I was working.</span> <span id="s843">And then I went to my, to the place where the regiment was.</span> <span id="s844">It was Mogilef Bodosk, 38 and when the front moved a little bit south to Sadagoura.</span> <span id="s845">Sadagoura, it was a place near to Chernovitza.</span> <span id="s846">It's in Basarabia.</span> <span id="s847">Today it's Ukraine, it is the state where they are fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Basarabia and Bokovina.</span> <span id="s849">And there I became a regular man of the Czechoslovak army.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">They gave me something here and my commandant in this place was a Major Vochek.</span> <span id="s851">He came from England.</span> <span id="s852">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s853">And so I was one of the first members of this regiment.</span> <span id="s854">And we made very well, and after a short time we went into the fight against the Germans and we had not very much success.</span> <span id="s855">We had been beaten in one place where we lost a lot of people.</span> <span id="s856">And at this time have been made some changes in the army and we get about 15 new officers to my regiment.</span> <span id="s857">They came from England and from the, how do you call this territory, near 0st.</span> <span id="s858">Where is Rialis and Turkey?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Remia?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Near east.</span> <span id="s861">Many of them have been Jewish officers.</span> <span id="s862">It was mostly higher educated people and the reserve officers.</span> <span id="s863">And there in our regiment we had also many officers from Slovaki, from the Slovak army.</span> <span id="s864">And once we have been starting over there, and it was the first time as I noted it, .</span> <span id="s865">.</span> <span id="s866">one, a lieutenant told me, "Tell me, Viliam, how it is possible that we have so many Jews?"</span> <span id="s867">So I was very angry.</span> <span id="s868">I told him, "What are you asking me?</span> <span id="s869">You have to ask your father, that so many Jews still, from Slovakia, are here.</span> <span id="s870">He was not a good killer.</span> <span id="s871">Maybe he could kill more."</span> <span id="s872">So, "You are also a Jew?"</span> <span id="s873">I told him, "Yes, I am, but I am a soldier first and not a Jew.</span> <span id="s874">Secondly I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s875">And I was very angry.</span> <span id="s876">I went to the commandant, to the Major Vochek and I told him.</span> <span id="s877">I told him, "Look, if it has to be so, I don't want to be more a member Of this army.</span> <span id="s878">Why should I fight with such a man?</span> <span id="s879">I must be afraid that he could kill me, not the Germans."</span> <span id="s880">And it was a little bit, a big discussion between the officers and some of them has been, they lose their officer arrange (?)</span> <span id="s881">.</span> <span id="s882">And it was getting better when these people came from England, and they have been more . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Because in the mountains of Slovakia it was very hard to fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s884">But I met one cousin in Poprat.</span> <span id="s885">He was a partisan in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s886">He wants to go to the Army.</span> <span id="s887">I told him no, you have to go home.</span> <span id="s888">Because maybe you'll be the only one who came back from your family.</span> <span id="s889">He's now living in Israel.</span> <span id="s890">He's 70 years old.</span> <span id="s891">Carmal Letko is his name.</span> <span id="s892">And then I came also to Zlene where I should work by the Battah factories, like a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">.</span> <span id="s894">.</span> <span id="s895">But I forget one thing.</span> <span id="s896">When we have been on the Slovak border and we have occupied the eastern part of Slovakia, so I went to this Major, he was a Colonel at this time.</span> <span id="s897">I ask him for three or four days vacation.</span> <span id="s898">He gave me, and so I went to the villages in County Michalovce to have a look if somebody is from the family.</span> <span id="s899">I was in three or four families, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s900">Everybody told me, the neighbors, "Oh, we are so sorry that they are away."</span> <span id="s901">You know, they have been so good people.</span> <span id="s902">They have been good people, but in the same minute that they left their houses the neighbors come in and took away everything.</span> <span id="s903">And I was visiting the commissar of the village, of one village.</span> <span id="s904">The commissar, it was like a mayor.</span> <span id="s905">And I came in, he was working on corn.</span> <span id="s906">And it fell down from his hands as he saw me.</span> <span id="s907">"Hey; come in!</span> <span id="s908">Are you hungry?</span> <span id="s909">Do you want to sleep or to eat something?"</span> <span id="s910">"No, no, no.</span> <span id="s911">I don't want.</span> <span id="s912">I want only you have come with me to the house of my uncle and you have to arrange that after tomorrow morning it will be empty because they are coming."</span> <span id="s913">It was not true that they are coming, but he came.</span> <span id="s914">And I saw this man who was in, he was a big (?)</span> <span id="s915">S.S. man, in Slovaki.</span> <span id="s916">And I told him, "Look, now it's six o'clock afternoon.</span> <span id="s917">At five o'clock in the morning it must be empty."</span> <span id="s918">It will be.</span> <span id="s919">I think the whole night they were moving out.</span> <span id="s920">And when I went back to the Army, then we came to Prague.</span> <span id="s921">I ended the war in a village Dornyemchitse-onMoravia.</span> <span id="s922">And I was just three days on a bunk where you have to look.</span> <span id="s923">It's a point, an observation point.</span> <span id="s924">And I was that time the chief of the intelligence, of the regiment.</span> <span id="s925">And then I, after three days I come back, I was very tired.</span> <span id="s926">I went to sleep in a house.</span> <span id="s927">And so at, later it was night.</span> <span id="s928">It was every, from each window I heard the people were shouting.</span> <span id="s929">I was afraid, what's happened.</span> <span id="s930">The Germans came in back.</span> <span id="s931">So I went down and across the street was our radio location center.</span> <span id="s932">And the commandant was a very good friend of me.</span> <span id="s933">Lovenschtein was his name.</span> <span id="s934">He was Jewish, but a very clever boy.</span> <span id="s935">I ask him, "What's happened?"</span> <span id="s936">"You don't know?</span> <span id="s937">It's one hour we have peace."</span> <span id="s938">Of course, I was very happy.</span> <span id="s939">I took vodka.</span> <span id="s940">(He laughs.)</span> <span id="s941">It was a very nice feeling.</span> <span id="s942">It was the first or the second nice feeling.</span> <span id="s943">And after 14 days we had a big parade in Prague and we moved to a place, it was an army camp, and we stayed in Prague.</span> <span id="s944">After a week or so the chief of the, the boss of the administrative, in the army, in our regiment.</span> <span id="s945">His name was, he was a second lieutenant Wolfe.</span> <span id="s946">He was an attorney, he was.a very clever boy.</span> <span id="s947">We spoke often together.</span> <span id="s948">He was calling me on the regiment.</span> <span id="s949">I came here, he told me, "Viliam, have you some information about your family?"</span> <span id="s950">I told him, "How can I have information here from Prague?"</span> <span id="s951">"Why you didn't come earlier?"</span> <span id="s952">"Why should I come to you?</span> <span id="s953">What's happened?"</span> <span id="s954">So, "Give me the name of your family, of your mother, your father, your sisters and brothers."</span> <span id="s955">"Why you need it now?"</span> <span id="s956">"Yes, because we have an agreement with the broadcast that every day two hours or so they will send messages to families according to the notice what we .</span> <span id="s957">.</span> <span id="s958">get from you."</span> <span id="s959">So I gave him, and maybe in 10, 14 days he called me again, and he told me, "So, I have good news.</span> <span id="s960">Your mother is living in Koshitse.</span> <span id="s961">Here you have an address and here you have commandeer of car.</span> <span id="s962">You can go for 14 days to go."</span> <span id="s963">It was not easy to travel after the war because the railroads have been destroyed.</span> <span id="s964">I came to Koshitse.</span> <span id="s965">(He pauses.)</span> <span id="s966">I met my mother.</span> <span id="s967">She couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s968">The time, the first one she met from her children after the war.</span> <span id="s969">She told me, "Your sister is living.</span> <span id="s970">She's now on this and this place.</span> <span id="s971">Your brother is living.</span> <span id="s972">We expect him, that he will come also to Koshitse.</span> <span id="s973">Of course they came after a short time.</span> <span id="s974">I went back to Prague, then I came back to Koshitse with a group because we have been and the newest location was Koshitse.</span> <span id="s975">I get a new, not a new, but I get an apartment.</span> <span id="s976">I get furniture, I get everything, and my family, mother, sister and brother, we met and lived a short time together.</span> <span id="s977">Then I was, I left the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Even they wanted that I would stay in the army, I didn't want to stay in the army.</span> <span id="s979">I went back to Zlene.</span> <span id="s980">I started again to work by the Battah Company.</span> <span id="s981">My sister, in a short time she married a boy from East Slovakia who was an American soldier.</span> <span id="s982">And after a short time she moved here.</span> <span id="s983">Mother stayed in Koshitse, my brother went to the school.</span> <span id="s984">He finished his abator.</span> <span id="s985">And he went to the university.</span> <span id="s986">He finished the College of Chemical Research.</span> <span id="s987">He was working like a professor in Prague.</span> <span id="s988">In 1964 he moved illegally to the United States with his family.</span> <span id="s989">In a short time he was professor at Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s990">Later on the other place, I don't know exactly, I know he's retired, living in Sarasota, in Florida, teaching at the University of Sarasota.</span> <span id="s991">He is very sick, and this is one of the reasons that I came.</span> <span id="s992">My sister is living in New York, near to New York.</span> <span id="s993">Her children are living, Jerry is living here and the second brother in California.</span> <span id="s994">And my mother passed away, it's about 21 years, here in the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Thank you very much, Mr. Fried.</span> <span id="s996">(Break in tape.)</span> <span id="s997">We have about one more minute.</span> <span id="s998">Holly would like to know a little bit about your life since.</span> <span id="s999">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: My life in Czechoslovakia, I decided to stay there.</span> <span id="s1001">I could, I had an affidavit to come to the States.</span> <span id="s1002">But my mother was old, my brother went to school there.</span> <span id="s1003">It was in 1948 or so.</span> <span id="s1004">And I couldn't leave my girlfriend because it wouldn't be, I am a little bit conservative in these ways.</span> <span id="s1005">If we are living together I cannot say one day, "It's finished.</span> <span id="s1006">Everything went well.</span> <span id="s1007">But it came the years 1951.</span> <span id="s1008">It was, I went back to the Army.</span> <span id="s1009">They took me again to the Army.</span> <span id="s1010">And maybe this was my luck.</span> <span id="s1011">Otherwise, maybe you know about Slantsky and all them things.</span> <span id="s1012">I wasn't Slantsky.</span> <span id="s1013">But very many smaller people like Slanstky ended up in jail, and maybe . . . So.</span> <span id="s1014">It was very heavy days, we came through.</span> <span id="s1015">The second problem was when my brother left .</span> <span id="s1016">.</span> <span id="s1017">Czechoslovakia illegally because he was in a high position, not in a position that he was a boss, but he was a leading person in the Chemistry, especially in the thermo-dynamic.</span> <span id="s1018">And as he left Czechoslovakia, so there had been maybe a threat that he would talk about something, and so.</span> <span id="s1019">And because they couldn't nothing do for him.</span> <span id="s1020">So I was, (he laughs), the man whom they had in their hands.</span> <span id="s1021">But I came through because I have, I have had, I explained it, I told it that I had very, they don't need Viliam Fried like a person, but many of them need Viliam Fried like a chemist, an economist and maybe for some other things.</span> <span id="s1022">So that I came through.</span> <span id="s1023">We are living in a normal way, have two children, four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1024">The son is also working in chemistry.</span> <span id="s1025">He is today working for an Italian company.</span> <span id="s1026">He is specialized in organic chemistry.</span> <span id="s1027">My daughter is deputy principal in a senior high school teaching English and Latin.</span> <span id="s1028">The grandchildren are going to school, very good.</span> <span id="s1029">Of course, yesterday I said we are talking about my wife is not Jewish, but she's a better Jew like many Jewish.</span> <span id="s1030">These are the words of my mother.</span> <span id="s1031">It's not mine.</span> <span id="s1032">She is satisfied she is here with me.</span> <span id="s1033">She is writing books for children, making for television grammar, books for television.</span> <span id="s1034">And so we are living.</span> <span id="s1035">And we are very close to our family here.</span> <span id="s1036">WE have nobody else.</span> <span id="s1037">Nobody from our family, 87 percent of our family doesn't come back from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1038">It was a big family.</span> <span id="s1039">My mother had three sisters and four brothers.</span> <span id="s1040">Everybody had children.</span> <span id="s1041">I was, it's finished or not?</span> <span id="s1042">I was with my wife four years ago in Poland.</span> <span id="s1043">I was visiting these places.</span> <span id="s1044">I was in Treblinki.</span> <span id="s1045">And when I stood on the bottom by this big statute in Treblinki, in my head was that my aunts should be here.</span> <span id="s1046">But I had luck.</span> <span id="s1047">How many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Thank you very much, Mr. Fried.</span></p></body></html>
