"P." Date: July 9, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Interviewer: Elaine Snyderman (Please tell me the earliest things you can remember about your childhood in Minsk?)</span> <span id="s17">I was born in 1946 and I remember my grandfather and my grandmother on my mother's side, especially my grandfather.</span> <span id="s18">He was very steeped in Jewish education.</span> <span id="s19">He was a very educated man.</span> <span id="s20">He collected books, he knew Hebrew and he told me a lot of times about the history of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s21">And we, our family, my mother and father and his sister and brother, we celebrated some Jewish holidays at their house, with their parents in a private house.</span> <span id="s22">That was in my early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Then I remember that when my grandmother died my grandfather gave her a traditional Jewish burial.</span> <span id="s24">They didn't use Russian, they used Jewish.</span> <span id="s25">They used the Jewish Star and they made a special like order of Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s26">Then my grandfather moved from this private house, and I remember each time I visited him in the apartment he presented me with some books of Jewish history and each time, he knew Hebrew, he was a religious man, and he tried to teach me Hebrew.</span> <span id="s27">At the time this was not allowed.</span> <span id="s28">He would teach me and my cousin together.</span> <span id="s29">And all the time he tried to tell us that we should move to Israel and not stay in Russia.</span> <span id="s30">He would switch on the radio sometimes, and then explain to us the history and even try to explain Hebrew.</span> <span id="s31">But he was afraid that his neighbors might report him.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">(What did you mean when you said 'private house'?)</span> <span id="s33">I think that my grandfather had a private house near the center of Minsk on Kamarovska Street and after that the government decided to build a farmers' market so the farmers or somebody else could come into the city to sell their produce.</span> <span id="s34">So when they did this they destroyed a lot of old houses.</span> <span id="s35">A lot of Jewish people had lived in this area.</span> <span id="s36">I know some of them are still in Russia and would like to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">This had nothing to do with the collectivization of the farms, they just wanted to make a new city.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">I just remember that when it was a private house a lot of people gathered there.</span> <span id="s39">They celebrated things together.</span> <span id="s40">My grandfather read things.</span> <span id="s41">But when he got a one room apartment it was difficult to get together with a lot of people for these celebrations.</span> <span id="s42">I remember that one time he took me to the synagogue - but it was not a real synagogue, because synagogues were not allowed in Russia.</span> <span id="s43">But it was a big house where people gathered together, it was like a big house and they had to keep the meetings secret.</span> <span id="s44">This was in Minsk, when I was a little boy.</span> <span id="s45">They davened with the Torah.</span> <span id="s46">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">My grandfather was a very educated man.</span> <span id="s48">All his life, before the war, my mother told me that he had been like the director of a cultural book store.</span> <span id="s49">All his life he read a lot of books and he collected a library.</span> <span id="s50">All his life, he presented books to people, to me, to my son, to my cousin.</span> <span id="s51">Even a few days before he died, when my wife and I visited him, he could no longer see but he gave us some books.</span> <span id="s52">All his life was in books.</span> <span id="s53">He was a huge influence for me.</span> <span id="s54">All my life I have loved books, so I feel that something inside of me is a part of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I guess my grandfather had some education in business.</span> <span id="s56">All his other education he got from books.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">My father grew up in a family with nine children.</span> <span id="s58">So he started to work early, as far as I know, and then there was World War II and he was in the War.</span> <span id="s59">Then, after the War --, he was a soldier from the second year of the war.</span> <span id="s60">During the war he finished some course but I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s61">But he never finished an institute.</span> <span id="s62">He was like a salesman, in some kind of job.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">My mother was educated, first of all in the Leningrad Academy of Biology and Psychology.</span> <span id="s64">She spent all the World War II in Leningrad where she was a student.</span> <span id="s65">She survived, though she told me a lot of times that she buried a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s66">After that she graduated the Byelorussia Technological Institute.</span> <span id="s67">So she is educated.</span> <span id="s68">All of the children of my grandfather were educated in different Technological Institutes.</span> <span id="s69">So they have a variety of educations.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">My grandparents from my father's side were both killed in World War II so I have never seen them.</span> <span id="s71">I was born after that.</span> <span id="s72">I just heard that the Nazis killed one brother in Chosnicki, the mother and father during the war.</span> <span id="s73">And, a lot of times, my father told me how his brother was killed about a mile from the place where he was stationed.</span> <span id="s74">They were in the war together but they did not know that they were stationed so near to each other.</span> <span id="s75">In Russia, you never know, you don't have the right to know, you just know the number of the place to write.</span> <span id="s76">After the War when my father studied through inquiries about his brother he realized that his brother was killed about a mile from where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">My father only told me a couple of stories about those times.</span> <span id="s78">It was a very difficult time and he doesn't like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s79">He spent the time of the war near Leningrad, too.</span> <span id="s80">But my mother and father never knew each other in Leningrad.</span> <span id="s81">They met in Minsk after the War.</span> <span id="s82">He said he spent a lot time in the snow; there was a lot of death all around him.</span> <span id="s83">So sometimes it was a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s84">He didn't know where the Germans were or where the other Russians were.</span> <span id="s85">It was a very confusing situation there, a lot of officers died.</span> <span id="s86">It was a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s87">But, he was a good officer, as far as I can understand.</span> <span id="s88">He was a captain after the war, but at the time of the war he was probably a lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">You know, the Jewish people are usually brave soldiers.</span> <span id="s90">For instance, I know that my mother's sister's husband was a pilot and he was one of the first pilots who bombed Berlin.</span> <span id="s91">But nevertheless he was treated as a Jew.</span> <span id="s92">The Russians did not give much recognition to the contribution of the Jews in their armed forces during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">My father had a lot of medals.</span> <span id="s94">He had medals for Leningrad and he valued these medals more than others.</span> <span id="s95">It is not like the modern medals which Brezhnev and the others give out.</span> <span id="s96">They had a lot of meaning for my father.</span> <span id="s97">He actually wore some of these medals during the battles.</span> <span id="s98">I'm not sure if we brought his medals here, some people were not allowed to bring their medals to the United States.</span> <span id="s99">I will check on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">My mother was in Leningrad and was not allowed to leave the city during the War.</span> <span id="s101">So she stayed in Leningrad and she buried her friends.</span> <span id="s102">She is like self-made.</span> <span id="s103">She gave almost her last piece of bread to help bury her friends.</span> <span id="s104">It was a terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">After the war, all her family returned to Minsk so she moved from Leningrad to Minsk to live with her family.</span> <span id="s106">I don't know exactly how my parents met.</span> <span id="s107">Her aunt's husband was the uncle of my father and so they met.</span> <span id="s108">You know, Jewish people would like to marry Jewish people.</span> <span id="s109">For instance, I don't -- we are trying to keep family traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">I remember quite well that when I was a child, third grade, there were a lot of Jewish kids in my class.</span> <span id="s111">And when my parents moved near the plant then there were Russian kids and I was probably the only Jewish kid in the class.</span> <span id="s112">I remember quite well that my teacher (you know in Russia, the derogatory name for a Jew is zhid) so my teacher just one time before the class, she started to analyze the parts of the words with zhid and so on and the class started to laugh at me.</span> <span id="s113">I remember that I hit my neighbor with a pen!</span> <span id="s114">After that, he understood that I was fighting for something important to me and he was almost my friend.</span> <span id="s115">You have to understand that this was before ballpoint pens and the pen had a sharp point!</span> <span id="s116">I was not afraid to pick out the point.</span> <span id="s117">Actually, there was some blood and afterwards I didn't go to the school for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s118">My father had to go to the school and talk with the teacher and all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Then, this guy started to respect me and we were almost like friends, he was Russian and I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s120">And I remember that when we were grown up at the Institute we still had a good relationship.</span> <span id="s121">I was probably about eleven or twelve when this happened.</span> <span id="s122">Between the two of us, he knew that I would fight, and he started to respect me.</span> <span id="s123">He realized that I was a strong guy and that I wouldn't accept any stuff like that.</span> <span id="s124">But the teacher was really anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s125">So I just hated her and then I dropped that class and went to another class.</span> <span id="s126">It was not a good experience.</span> <span id="s127">But this guy and I were friends until I left that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">After seventh grade I left this school and went to a technical school.</span> <span id="s129">My parents decided to give me some kind of specialty.</span> <span id="s130">There is anti-semitism in Russia and they wanted that I should be able to work even if I won't be able to get a good education.</span> <span id="s131">You never know what will happen.</span> <span id="s132">So I went to technical school to get some kind of profession.</span> <span id="s133">At the age of thirteen I went to work at a plant, but that was good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">You know, somethings I didn't like when I was growing up, but I didn't have a lot of knowledge at that time so I did what my parents told me.</span> <span id="s135">I probably would have liked to do something different now and then but -- You know, in Russia the system is different.</span> <span id="s136">For instance, my wife finished scohol with gold medals, and wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s137">She was an excellent student in school.</span> <span id="s138">But a medical education for Jews is very difficult.</span> <span id="s139">Her mother was a doctor and her aunt is a doctor and they would like to see her be a doctor, but her parents died and she was alone and they decided that she wouldn't go all through the exams for the medical school and she had to go to the Byelorussian Polytechnical Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">I will explain why.</span> <span id="s141">When you have an examination in the Polytechnical Institute, you have a written examination and they don't know your name on the sheet of paper, just a number.</span> <span id="s142">But when you have the exams for the medical institute, or, let's say into a Byelorussian university, (they don't like Jews in the university either) so they talk with you like an oral exam and even if you have a good knowledge of the subject they won't give you an excellent mark.</span> <span id="s143">So they put you down, so you cannot enter.</span> <span id="s144">That is why almost all Jewish people are educated in a Polytechnical Institute or a Technical school and have a technical education.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">My brother did this too.</span> <span id="s146">He wanted to be a doctor too, but he went for a technical education.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Right now I am happy with the education and career I have, but when I was young I might have liked something else, but I didn't have a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">I lived at home when I went to the technical school.</span> <span id="s149">There were no Jews there either.</span> <span id="s150">You never know why.</span> <span id="s151">All my brothers they would have liked to be journalists or something like that.</span> <span id="s152">But I went to a technical school so I could get the knowledge to hold a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">I was the oldest child in the family and thirteen years later my brother was born.</span> <span id="s154">I have no reason why there were just the two of us.</span> <span id="s155">I know my mother constantly worked, and my father constantly worked.</span> <span id="s156">My mother was pressured into her job so she has a talent for science and that is why I pick up, I tend to have knowledge more and more.</span> <span id="s157">She went to a botanic garden to work like a research biologist.</span> <span id="s158">And she was pressured into leaving her job, so she never got a science degree -- The same story happened with me, almost, I was just lucky when I entered into this institute, I graduated from an difficult institute with excellent marks, so I got a diploma.</span> <span id="s159">All the marks were excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">But I would have liked to study more and more, to do post-graduate courses at the Institute from which I graduated.</span> <span id="s161">But I was a Jewish kid and they don't like to accept Jews in postgraduate work.</span> <span id="s162">Moreover, there is protection for kids of the high ranking government workers (rectors, ministers, and so on, and the kids of them were with me in one and the same class.</span> <span id="s163">Once upon a time, I went to a Jewish concert so probably they discussed something.</span> <span id="s164">The Jewish concert was in Minsk and they took pictures of me at the synagogue with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s165">The KGB had these pictures.</span> <span id="s166">I was between seventeen and nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s167">And they refused to give me the possibility of this course, this was during the Khrushchev years.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">But I had practice in the Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer.</span> <span id="s169">And the director of this Institute was a very old, intelligent man.</span> <span id="s170">He finished the old Russian school, before the Revolution.</span> <span id="s171">He knew French and, I guess, he worked with Jewish people or he grew up with them but he was not anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s172">He said, "I don't care about nationality."</span> <span id="s173">But, of course, he was pressured by other people around him.</span> <span id="s174">But if you were a talented man and I worked at his institute and practiced and he said he would take me in for post-graduate work.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">So I was lucky that my teacher was head of the institute and he made them take me in for the post-graduate work.</span> <span id="s176">But after he died, (his name was Lykoff), I had to leave the Institute.</span> <span id="s177">My chief of the area, just rushed me off.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">My father, in his work, was like a salesman.</span> <span id="s179">He was not interested in the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s180">Michael one time, went from school and said to me, I will be a Communist.</span> <span id="s181">This was because his teacher told him, "The first people in the country are Communists."</span> <span id="s182">And he said that he knew I would never be a Communist.</span> <span id="s183">He was probably right, because there were many things I didn't like.</span> <span id="s184">At that time we tried to leave Russia, ten years ago.</span> <span id="s185">So he was only one year old when we were going to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s186">Now he is eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">So my wife could not find a job in Russia because of this.</span> <span id="s188">We tried to leave Russia in 1979.</span> <span id="s189">They pressured me out of the Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer, and then I applied to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s190">I did my thesis, and research in a very interesting field.</span> <span id="s191">It was on the Effect of Reiner, he is an Israeli professor, Max Reiner, and he found a very interesting behavior of Air.</span> <span id="s192">I read his research.</span> <span id="s193">It was in articles which were published and I knew this professor from Haifa Technological Institute in Israel.</span> <span id="s194">I just continued to do research in this field.</span> <span id="s195">So Mr. Lykoff believed it was a very interesting field to work in.</span> <span id="s196">But after Mr. A.V. Lykoff's death the chief of my laboratory closed my research in this field.</span> <span id="s197">He didn't give me any more possibility to work in this field.</span> <span id="s198">I would have had to work in another field.</span> <span id="s199">And actually, he pressured me to leave the Institute.</span> <span id="s200">And my wife was a student, so I left the Institute, in which I would have liked to work, I would really like to work in this field.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">So then we applied for leaving Russia in February 1978.</span> <span id="s202">We stood in the line almost one year just to give our documents.</span> <span id="s203">There was a line, you know.</span> <span id="s204">I put the stamps from my job in the staff department on my documents saying that I was going to leave Russia and Minsk for Israel.</span> <span id="s205">At that time it was terrible, what they did to the people.</span> <span id="s206">They treated us like they hated us, my wife and myself.</span> <span id="s207">Michael was not even one year old at that time.</span> <span id="s208">My wife, myself, my mother and my father we all took care of Michael at different times.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">So we were standing in line in February.</span> <span id="s210">We applied to get our documents in November and we were refused in December and without any reason.</span> <span id="s211">They treated us like animals and it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s212">I applied for revision a couple of times.</span> <span id="s213">I told them, we sent letters, we asked for a reason for why we could not leave Russia.</span> <span id="s214">We had meetings with high officer of OVIR, but they never talked with you, it was like we were dogs.</span> <span id="s215">It made you feel less than human.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">My wife lost the job, she never - for two years she was not able to work.</span> <span id="s217">After she finished the Institute she was like a young electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s218">She worked for the Bio-technological Institute.</span> <span id="s219">She just made some designs and drawings and schematics and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">I worked then at different places.</span> <span id="s221">I drew some projects for students, I translated some articles from English, from Minsk to Moscow there are some jobs in translation.</span> <span id="s222">Sometimes, I worked in some shops to repair some things, radios, small appliance.</span> <span id="s223">Then, about a year after refusal I found a job as a design engineer and then I started to work again as an engineer.</span> <span id="s224">It was a very small position with a very low salary.</span> <span id="s225">And, almost to the last day I kept two jobs, to feed my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Before we were refused, let's say, I had 300 rubles before, and afterwards, only about 125-150.</span> <span id="s227">Almost half what it was before.</span> <span id="s228">My wife could not even find a job after the refusal.</span> <span id="s229">In the last years when perestroika started, but it is was in another field, like a salesman, not in engineering.</span> <span id="s230">It was a planning job, just collecting the numbers and distributing the information.</span> <span id="s231">She was not able to find a job because any organization considering hiring her made inquiries to OVIR and called on previous employers and because we were going to leave Russia and we had been refused, nobody would accept her for a job.</span> <span id="s232">But her friend helped her to find a job because he worked in this organization.</span> <span id="s233">It has a low salary.</span> <span id="s234">Like 110 or 105 rubles.</span> <span id="s235">In the technical institute they pressed my wife to leave this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">They had two other people who left from this institute and went to Israel.</span> <span id="s237">And they simply pressed her, they said, if we don't put stamps on your documents you are not able to apply for leaving if you don't leave the Institute.</span> <span id="s238">That's how is was.</span> <span id="s239">You have to live in Russia to understand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">My mother helped, with some food, other things.</span> <span id="s241">It was a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Before we were refused, we lived in a one bedroom apartment on the first floor.</span> <span id="s243">It was a five-floor apartment building with four apartments on each floor.</span> <span id="s244">In each apartment there were three, four or five people.</span> <span id="s245">And each apartment has a small compartment in the basement and people keep potatoes, and different kinds of vegetables in the basement.</span> <span id="s246">And the smell from this in springtime, would come into our apartment.</span> <span id="s247">And Michael was crying from this.</span> <span id="s248">It was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Our daughter was a couple of years older and it was not so bad for her.</span> <span id="s250">Of course, she went to school from this apartment and that was not good for her.</span> <span id="s251">You know, they grade Jewish kids, so if you are Jewish and you try to be one of the best pupils in the class, you have to be a couple of grades above your friends.</span> <span id="s252">You have to do much better work to be considered equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">We had lived there about one or two years and I had a terrible conversation with her teacher.</span> <span id="s254">He discussed Helen before the class!</span> <span id="s255">For visiting a Jewish concert again.</span> <span id="s256">He said things like, "Just remember everybody, what she did."</span> <span id="s257">She went to the concert with me.</span> <span id="s258">He said, remember what she did from first grade and each of her classmates started to tell different things.</span> <span id="s259">He said, we should discuss this in a class meeting.</span> <span id="s260">So I went to the school and said I would like to see this guy, in the presence of the director of the school.</span> <span id="s261">I said that it was not 1937, they told me that when I applied to leave Russia, it was a three hour meeting and they told me that if it was 1937, we would kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">I was quiet, when it comes to conferences, I speak softly.</span> <span id="s263">And they spoke loudly, and they said, you are like Sakharov, everybody around you is wrong but you are never wrong.</span> <span id="s264">They were pressuring Sakharov at this time, in all the papers.</span> <span id="s265">These people just spoke openly about how bad I am.</span> <span id="s266">They felt I was even worse than Sakharov.</span> <span id="s267">They felt that if it had been 1937, they would kill him too.</span> <span id="s268">I was sitting right there and there were about forty people in the room.</span> <span id="s269">They shouted at me, it was like a meeting of the Union committee.</span> <span id="s270">I was not a member of the party so it was like the meeting of a professional committee.</span> <span id="s271">So, I am a scientific engineer so they should discuss me.</span> <span id="s272">It was in an auditorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">If you are not a member of a professional committee, they won't pay you for your service.</span> <span id="s274">So, I had to go to this meeting, if I didn't go, they would just throw me away.</span> <span id="s275">I was the only Jew on this committee.</span> <span id="s276">My wife was not working, because she had lost her job, and I have to keep my job, I have to feed my children, so I have to go to this meeting to keep my job.</span> <span id="s277">Of course, they shouted openly.</span> <span id="s278">But I just said that it was not 1937, which was the purges under Stalin.</span> <span id="s279">But I told them I was not going to cross the border like a spy.</span> <span id="s280">I told them openly that I would like to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s281">I did everything according to the law.</span> <span id="s282">So, I thought, if you talk like this, I will go to another place and ask if they will try to punish them, because it is not 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">There was a large round table, with people sitting around it and standing around.</span> <span id="s284">It made me feel horrible.</span> <span id="s285">I was sweating.</span> <span id="s286">I kept myself cool and collected, to be more wise than these people.</span> <span id="s287">Not to break, and to show that I am a strong man to conquer my feeling in this situations.</span> <span id="s288">It ended at the order of the director, that I had to leave my position.</span> <span id="s289">To go to a lower position.</span> <span id="s290">The director was not at this meeting but he made the ruling after the meeting, and before the meeting too, of course.</span> <span id="s291">So I left my position, I quit my job, and that's how this happened.</span> <span id="s292">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">I tell you the truth, there was one guy in Russia who sort of befriended me.</span> <span id="s294">He was a drunk, and not a Jew, but he was an honest man.</span> <span id="s295">He liked to drink.</span> <span id="s296">His speech was not clear and he worked in one of the same rooms with me, but he called me Zakarich, (in Russia my name is like G. Zakarich) and he said, "They tried to ask me to tell something against you."</span> <span id="s297">So he had an honest, simple mind, but he didn't go to this meeting, and he told me about it.</span> <span id="s298">So some people are honest, even in Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s299">We worked together, we did the same kind of work, and sometimes we helped each other on job.</span> <span id="s300">He respected me and, even though he liked to drink, I respected him because he did a good job.</span> <span id="s301">I see that he is a good specialist and he probably had a good reason to drink.</span> <span id="s302">He lost his wife, she died, and he has two children and it is difficult without a wife.</span> <span id="s303">I just understood him, so I had some sympathy for him.</span> <span id="s304">I was not like all the other people around him.</span> <span id="s305">Some other people around me may have liked me, or my character, I felt this from a lot of people but no one ever said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">(How would you explain your job to a non-technical person like me?)</span> <span id="s307">When I left, in the Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer, I was in very interesting research, in the aerodynamics field.</span> <span id="s308">After that I went into the very technical field of the drying of building materials: concrete, chalk, like kaolin, that was my field.</span> <span id="s309">You know, some bricks are made from powders.</span> <span id="s310">So my field was spray drying and drying of materials.</span> <span id="s311">Then I was into different kinds of kilns and furnaces, press equipment, pump systems, sprays, so it was with heavy-duty equipment.</span> <span id="s312">So it is definitely not scientific research in the field where I worked before.</span> <span id="s313">In my field I was very comfortable, but I worked in the other field and I did my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">I would have never had the opportunity to join the Communist Party, this never came up.</span> <span id="s315">There is no possibility of a Jew joining the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s316">First of all, you know that probably, in Russia they kept an eye on you all your life.</span> <span id="s317">From when you first go to school, everything goes on your record.</span> <span id="s318">The fact that I had stabbed another child with a pen was on my record.</span> <span id="s319">There was a characteristic on the record even of my son.</span> <span id="s320">Once when I read the records, I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s321">I saw, once upon a time, actually it is in the record of my daughter and this characteristic is written down.</span> <span id="s322">I felt that they kept this record year by year for you, so I never tried to join the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s323">I never even had even been in Komsomol.</span> <span id="s324">And this is probably one of the reasons why they didn't accept me in post-graduate course at the Institute, I guess.</span> <span id="s325">For me joining was not a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">My children's records were made difficult because of what I had done as a child.</span> <span id="s327">And because they were Jews, too, they would be held back.</span> <span id="s328">This was in Minsk, and I felt that during the last year the anti-semitism in Minsk had gotten quite terrible.</span> <span id="s329">I feel it was much worse since 1964.</span> <span id="s330">I felt it at the technical school.</span> <span id="s331">And I told you that everybody has to work on the plan after technical school.</span> <span id="s332">They have like some government direction.</span> <span id="s333">So they send you and at this point, I heard this direction and I went to the plant and they would not accept me for three months, for just a simple job.</span> <span id="s334">So I went back to the Institute and told them that all my school mates are working but they would not accept me.</span> <span id="s335">They would not give me another direction to another job.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">I met my wife in 1973.</span> <span id="s337">We met at a wedding of my friends.</span> <span id="s338">We went together for three months before we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">After 1979, we lived in Russia for ten years.</span> <span id="s340">We lived in the same apartment until 1984.</span> <span id="s341">We changed apartments for Michael's health.</span> <span id="s342">We collected some money from a private exchange in Russia.</span> <span id="s343">There were advertisements in the newspaper that someone would like to change their apartment.</span> <span id="s344">And we found one in which the man had lost his wife and he had two adult sons and since they had married and left his apartment he was alone so he decided to change his apartment.</span> <span id="s345">So we went to his apartment and we paid him money for it.</span> <span id="s346">At that time our friends had just gone to the United States, and they sent us some post bonds.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">It was a slightly better apartment, about the same size as the other.</span> <span id="s348">I spent a lot of time with my son in a water pool and he started feeling better.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">We had been refused with another family, our friends -they are now living in New Jersey - but when we moved to the states our guarantors were in Chicago and they were our cousins.</span> <span id="s350">But my wife just applied for here.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">When I was in Russia, I went to OVIR, a police agency, the previous chief of OVIR died so we went a lot of times and we sent a lot of letters.</span> <span id="s352">It was like this.</span> <span id="s353">I went to chief of OVIR and he refused me to be a possibility.</span> <span id="s354">Two weeks later, my friend went; two weeks later, I went again, and we continued this way.</span> <span id="s355">It was like the spring of 1988, they said, well, things are changing maybe it will be possible to leave.</span> <span id="s356">We came in January 1989 to the United States so this was in Spring of 1988.</span> <span id="s357">Gorbachev started to open the door.</span> <span id="s358">(We left Russia in 1987, because we celebrated New Years in Italy, remember Dad?)</span> <span id="s359">Last year was 89, we left Russia in November of 1988.</span> <span id="s360">I remember exactly this date.</span> <span id="s361">We applied and we applied for tickets in Russia, you can apply for border tickets from Russia for jet, for train -- so we applied six different times.</span> <span id="s362">In the hopes that we will get permission and, as soon as possible, we will leave Russia.</span> <span id="s363">So we have this experience, for instance, so we got permission on the tenth of November, on the twenty-second we left Russia.</span> <span id="s364">We left furniture, everything, to my wife's sister, to relatives, friends, everything.</span> <span id="s365">We just left Russia.</span> <span id="s366">I knew exactly what we could take.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">When the door opened, we just grabbed our children and left.</span> <span id="s368">And when we got to Vienna, we didn't even have our suitcases.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">We had the tickets through from Moscow.</span> <span id="s370">We went by train to Moscow and from Moscow to Vienna by jet.</span> <span id="s371">So we wanted to leave as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s372">So we went through customs in the night.</span> <span id="s373">And when we arrived to Vienna, we didn't have our suitcases!</span> <span id="s374">We got them eventually.</span> <span id="s375">Actually, I didn't have anything of value, I am a simple engineer.</span> <span id="s376">We had six suitcases and fifty dollars for each person to be allowed to leave to Russia.</span> <span id="s377">Just now, I just remembered this, it is funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">We had some grains, we had some rice, you don't know what the circumstances will be, some honey, some sugar, and they made a total mess of that in customs.</span> <span id="s379">They tried to find a second bottom in my shoes!</span> <span id="s380">They tore them apart.</span> <span id="s381">They checked for three hours on us, we were standing all the time.</span> <span id="s382">It is terrible in Russia.</span> <span id="s383">There is no separate room for these customs examinations.</span> <span id="s384">They have just one big room and a big table and everybody can see.</span> <span id="s385">It is a terrible feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">I am smiling now, but not then.</span> <span id="s387">I was not frightened, I was silent and I kept control of my feelings and I was just terrible cold.</span> <span id="s388">They broke apart all my chess pieces, even.</span> <span id="s389">The chess pieces!</span> <span id="s390">I was not able to pack everything but I was cool so that is probably why they broke everything.</span> <span id="s391">I decided, "do what you would like, general."</span> <span id="s392">And my parents came to Moscow to say Goodbye to us and they were really shocked about the treatment.</span> <span id="s393">My friends were in the airport, and when you go to the airport you have to stand in line.</span> <span id="s394">For instance, Michael and Helen stayed with my uncle, he took the children for this time and he took them to Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">I went at eight o'clock and I spent the day.</span> <span id="s396">I stood in the line to pass through the customs at the airport until night.</span> <span id="s397">Of course, I had the tickets to Vienna.</span> <span id="s398">I gave, to put my name, and now that I am going to leave Russia, I am Jewish, and I put my name - P.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">There is a mistake of all the Americans to feel that anything changed with Gorbachev.</span> <span id="s400">He is an anti-semitic guy, you know, in Russia you are not able to be in the government unless you are anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s401">Gorbachev is not so strong, how can I explain to you?</span> <span id="s402">Russia has a huge army, a huge police force, a huge KGB, let's say.</span> <span id="s403">And nothing has changed.</span> <span id="s404">They spend money so everybody stays, they are terrible, these guys, they treat you like dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Let's say, when I applied, I tried to get them to give me some reason why I was refused.</span> <span id="s406">But they would not even speak with me.</span> <span id="s407">They said what they liked, "You will stay in Russia, that is it!"</span> <span id="s408">They just throw away your application and your requests.</span> <span id="s409">It is a huge room and there is no place for you to sit.</span> <span id="s410">They do not speak with you.</span> <span id="s411">I stood, my wife stood, - I said I would like to leave Russia because I have relatives in Israel.</span> <span id="s412">They keep asking why you want to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s413">You can only leave Russia if you have relatives in Israel.</span> <span id="s414">I was afraid to say anything else.</span> <span id="s415">You can be put in jail if they don't like what you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">But, I wasn't careful, I told someone that it was a mistake when Russia put the troops in Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s417">And then they refused me.</span> <span id="s418">In Russia you never know what will be reported.</span> <span id="s419">I was just talking with a couple of guys around me.</span> <span id="s420">It was my mistake, I wasn't careful, I should never have spoken.</span> <span id="s421">No, I don't think Gorbachev is any different than any other party heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">I failed myself.</span> <span id="s423">It was a serious mistake, a real mistake.</span> <span id="s424">I guess that, first of all, they have some power which they tried openly to stand against Gorbachev and I guess the army and the police and everything, they will be against Gorbachev, because they like to keep the strong order which was before.</span> <span id="s425">They have power, they want to keep it.</span> <span id="s426">Second of all, Gorbachev is afraid to make changes.</span> <span id="s427">Even if he would like to make changes, he is afraid to.</span> <span id="s428">You never can tell on which side changes will fall in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">So they tried to organize some cooperatives and they put pressure on cooperatives at the same time.</span> <span id="s430">They will tell you that they don't spent money on the Army but, actually, they spend a lot of money on the army.</span> <span id="s431">I will tell you, before my departure, I visited the institute.</span> <span id="s432">And when I went through the Institute I could feel what was going on.</span> <span id="s433">From a scientific point of view they made a new system of lasers for aerodynamics lab.</span> <span id="s434">Like laser weapons.</span> <span id="s435">You know as a research engineer I have the scientific training and for me it's enough to look for a half an hour at what they are doing and then I can tell you what they are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">If you have air and you start to heat it the air will start to pass the optical, it will change optical axis.</span> <span id="s437">The optical beams will go another way.</span> <span id="s438">So by changing the thermal field, you can make the heat transfer even less.</span> <span id="s439">And then they can start experiments.</span> <span id="s440">I saw this when I went through.</span> <span id="s441">They started, and I could tell, that they could use this for war.</span> <span id="s442">I can say now, that half of the research institute is working on things for the army.</span> <span id="s443">Each place is Russia will work on weapons first of all, and they will never stop working on weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">So I don't think Gorbachev is the man who will stop this procedure or who will stop the development of weapons.</span> <span id="s445">He is just interested in getting money, let's say, from the West.</span> <span id="s446">The economy of the country is in a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s447">Simply in terrible shape, there is no technology, no food, so if they tell you that they spend one hundred thousand dollars to build such an installation, you know it was much more.</span> <span id="s448">Actually, they have to spend much more because they will really build three - and one of them will be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">For the technology is not on such a high level.</span> <span id="s450">They will make two of them with back-up characteristics and the rest of them will suit for the army.</span> <span id="s451">That is exactly the way it is.</span> <span id="s452">So they are spending on the army - what they say openly in the press, you can actually multiply it by three to get close to the real cost.</span> <span id="s453">They can never be completely open on this sort of thing, even with glasnost.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">I can give you one example of what glasnost can mean.</span> <span id="s455">I read an interesting novel which was about Life and Destination, by Vasily Grossman.</span> <span id="s456">This history was not published for two years.</span> <span id="s457">It was about Jewish people in the War.</span> <span id="s458">About how Jewish scientific people were repressed in Stalin's time and confined in camps.</span> <span id="s459">And I went through this life and know that everything is real.</span> <span id="s460">When I read it and everybody told about it and there were some nice articles about the book, but there is no murder as a Jew.</span> <span id="s461">One man wrote to the magazine, "Dear Editor, Why don't you publish one part of this novel?</span> <span id="s462">Will you explain?</span> <span id="s463">If you don't have this part I will send it to you.</span> <span id="s464">But if you do have it, and did omit it purposely, then it is terrible.</span> <span id="s465">Because this part about anti-semitism in Russia is important."</span> <span id="s466">And they did publish his letter.</span> <span id="s467">I was very surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">This man wrote about anti-semitism in all countries from the time of Rome, and in Russia that this is a government anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s469">This is a policy of the government.</span> <span id="s470">Officially, it is not supposed to be but they turn their backs.</span> <span id="s471">They tell you that we are for friendship but I guess that, at the same time, all this national movement where people kill each other.</span> <span id="s472">I have a deep feeling in my soul that they made it purposely.</span> <span id="s473">Let's say, people don't think about their own plight, they think about something else.</span> <span id="s474">This is important in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">I guess it is like this, even my mother.</span> <span id="s476">My mother told me that before the war, Leningrad had huge stocks of food, of clothes.</span> <span id="s477">And one day, all the stocks were burned.</span> <span id="s478">Huge stocks!</span> <span id="s479">She guessed it was done at Stalin's orders.</span> <span id="s480">Stalin hated Leningrad.</span> <span id="s481">Because Leningrad never supported Stalin; Kirov was from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s482">Leningrad is an intelligent city.</span> <span id="s483">Of course, Russia can make a mess.</span> <span id="s484">They sent in workers and like farmers into the city to live and work, and in a few years they could lower the cultural level of the city.</span> <span id="s485">Maybe it would take thirty years, even.</span> <span id="s486">To me it seemed that he had a plan to lower the cultural level of Leningrad.</span> <span id="s487">Actually, even now, the cultural level of Minsk, of Leningrad, of Moscow, is down from before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">The government placed people with low cultural levels into the cities.</span> <span id="s489">These people don't think, they just do what the party will tell them.</span> <span id="s490">And that is why it is good for this government to lower the cultural level, not to help intelligent people.</span> <span id="s491">Let's say - Sakharov - I heard about Sakharov occasionally when I was a student in my Institute, we had a good professor and he told us that there is such a man and he was not famous, Sakharov.</span> <span id="s492">That he made atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb and he told his stories that he discovered the hydrogen reaction and he wrote the notes and went to the director of the institute and told him that he had made a discovery.</span> <span id="s493">And the director of the institute pressed him to give him his notes and took the notes for himself.</span> <span id="s494">But Sakharov had a second set of notes, and he was a very intelligent man and he just - it was a blessing for Russia - Sakharov didn't think about why he owed allegiance to such a country.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">They spend a lot of money on the army.</span> <span id="s496">And even if they will collect -- its not like there is one scientist, like a laureate or a Nobel Prize.</span> <span id="s497">By the way, my teacher, Aleksey Lykoff, he died at age sixty-three from a heart attack.</span> <span id="s498">He would have liked to be the president of the Byelorussian Academy of Scientists and actually, and he had to meet with the president.</span> <span id="s499">He was famous, he had medals, from the Paris Academy and the London Academy, and a lot of scientists, even in Chicago, they know Lykoff's name and work.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">And they didn't give him this position.</span> <span id="s501">They gave it to someone nobody knew until he became the president.</span> <span id="s502">Like a communist who was put off his mark.</span> <span id="s503">And this man, he hated Lykoff, because Lykoff was really a scientist and an intelligent man.</span> <span id="s504">He told me, okay, you can do it.</span> <span id="s505">But even for discussing things with me, he should not have taken his time to do this.</span> <span id="s506">And each day after two o'clock we can discuss scientific problems and everything.</span> <span id="s507">So he invited me to discuss - this famous man, I was a nothing and Lykoff was a known academician.</span> <span id="s508">He really encouraged me.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">And this new man - the new president of the Academy - hated Lykoff.</span> <span id="s510">Then Lykoff had two heart attacks and he could not get money for research and everything was pressured on him.</span> <span id="s511">When he died, his wife decided not to bury him in Minsk but in Moscow.</span> <span id="s512">And because he had been so great to me, I left and went to Moscow to his funeral, so we drove at night to get to Moscow for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">If he is my teacher, and I like him, I openly told them.</span> <span id="s514">I told them that I was always ready to help after his burial.</span> <span id="s515">His wife told me, "When you are in Moscow, come to my apartment at any time."</span> <span id="s516">They were good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">To go back to our travels, we took a train from Minsk to Moscow, a plane from Moscow to Vienna, and a plane from Vienna to Rome.</span> <span id="s518">When we got to Vienna we were met by a representative from HIAS, I was surprised, I didn't expect anything.</span> <span id="s519">Our family and the family of our friends, we decided to be in one apartment.</span> <span id="s520">So we went together from Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">My friends had the same sort of treatment from the customs in Moscow.</span> <span id="s522">I don't know, they were sent to one side and we were sent to another.</span> <span id="s523">But, on the second day, it was terrible for his daughter, she was about three or four.</span> <span id="s524">She put through customs a small ring and they cut her coat and the lining and they found a tiny ring, the kind young girls play with, probably worth all of about ten or twenty cents.</span> <span id="s525">Not a good ring.</span> <span id="s526">And they were pushed too.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">We went to Vienna and we stayed ten days and each day for seven days I went to Aeroflot to ask for my suitcases.</span> <span id="s528">I asked the people of the Austrian company to call Aeroflot and ask for me because they wouldn't talk with me.</span> <span id="s529">They knew I was emigrating from Russia and they treated me like they hated me.</span> <span id="s530">And when Austrian Airlines called to Aeroflot and made inquiries, then Aeroflot had to make answer to Austria.</span> <span id="s531">That is how they found the suitcases.</span> <span id="s532">My brother went from Minsk to Moscow to try to find them at that end.</span> <span id="s533">It was very upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">I know that I will never go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s535">Not even for a visit.</span> <span id="s536">I feel like it is a country where I spent a lot of years but after that, you understand, I prefer this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">In Russia, I guess our worst fears were that we would never be given the permission to leave.</span> <span id="s538">With all the applications that had to be made, you never knew how you would be treated.</span> <span id="s539">That was bad.</span> <span id="s540">You had to speak with these guys every six months, each time you applied, and they broke you into parts, you had to just take it.</span> <span id="s541">And then there was customs.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">I was afraid for my children.</span> <span id="s543">I was afraid they might make up something about us and our life was in danger.</span> <span id="s544">After they refused us, I never felt safe in Russia.</span> <span id="s545">A couple of times there was a fire near our apartment and I was concerned for my family.</span> <span id="s546">They were like large firecrackers but they did look like a fire and I didn't know if we were the target or not.</span></p></body></html>
