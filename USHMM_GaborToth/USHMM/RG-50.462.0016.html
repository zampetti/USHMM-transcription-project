tell us a little about your childhood, where and when you were born, and a little about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A:I am born September 21, 1907, in Berlin, Germany.</span> <span id="s18">My parents come from Galicia, formerly Austria, to Germany and settled in Berlin.</span> <span id="s19">My father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s20">He never was a German citizen, because, when you are in Germany, you have to be a rich per son.</span> <span id="s21">You have to have a certain amount of money in the banks and what you can show them that you have a lot of money and then you can be a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q:About what year did he come to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A:He came in 1898, 1898, right.</span> <span id="s24">He came to Berlin with two children.</span> <span id="s25">Two girls.</span> <span id="s26">He settled in center city and worked as a tailor.</span> <span id="s27">We were never rich people, because we were a big family.</span> <span id="s28">Seven children.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q:Where were you in that?</span> <span id="s30">Which number were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A:I was number seven.</span> <span id="s32">There really were eight children, but one died as a little baby, so I never count this girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q:What restrictions did your father find not being a citizen in Germany during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A:Not at all.</span> <span id="s35">He was an Austrian citizen then, you know, because Galicia was then in this time was at the Austrian part of the land.</span> <span id="s36">After 1918, the First World War fin ish ed, this piece of land became Polish.</span> <span id="s37">He tried to be an Austrian citizen, but it doesn't help.</span> <span id="s38">They told him by the Austrian consulate in Berlin, "You can do nothing; you are now a Polish citizen."</span> <span id="s39">So automatically we children became Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s40">But we had nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s41">In Germany you can live, too.</span> <span id="s42">You can live to be 200 years old as a for eign citizen.</span> <span id="s43">But not a Burger [citizen].</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q:What kind of community did you live in, in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A:There is no community.</span> <span id="s46">Jews and Gentiles lived together.</span> <span id="s47">O.K., certain Jew ish quarter, but it was not big, maybe three or four streets in center city where Jews were living with kosher bakeries, butchers and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q:And this is where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A:No, no I wasn't living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q:You were living in a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A:Mixed neighborhood, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q:And what was your experience like?</span> <span id="s53">Did you experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A:Yes, sure, as little boy, the other children in the school said to us, "Jew, you dir ty Jew," or "Christ Killer," you know, we killed Jesus.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q:Was this common, or did you have any non-Jewish children that were friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A:Yes it was common...oh sure I had Jewish boyfriends.</span> <span id="s57">In the school was more Gentiles than Jews.</span> <span id="s58">In a class of forty children, maybe six was only Jewish.</span> <span id="s59">Only six.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q:And you were friends with the non-Jewish children as well, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A:I don't want to say really friends.</span> <span id="s62">We played together, that's all.</span> <span id="s63">I wasn't in their house and they didn't come to my house, but in the street we played together.</span> <span id="s64">Foot ball, and you know like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q:What kind of school was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A:Public school, or German Gemeindeschule.</span> <span id="s67">Then came the First World War.</span> <span id="s68">The trouble began with the food.</span> <span id="s69">We suffered a lot in Germany.</span> <span id="s70">Those poor families.</span> <span id="s71">Rich people could go outside in the country and buy for money different kinds of food, meat and fruit and everything.</span> <span id="s72">But my father was a poor guy, but he made as a tailor working for other people, he wasn't working for himself.</span> <span id="s73">He worked for factories and took the work home and sewed in the house.</span> <span id="s74">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q:Who owned those factories that he was working for?</span> <span id="s76">Were they Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A:Yes, I think it was Jewish factories...yes sure.</span> <span id="s78">They cut the pieces of material and he took them home and sewed them together, and brought them back.</span> <span id="s79">He didn't make much money.</span> <span id="s80">But with a big family we had kaum [barely] food to eat.</span> <span id="s81">And then the war was started and the ration cards came out; they had cards for bread, cards for meat, for different kinds of ration cards.</span> <span id="s82">And bread was the first thing...but when we bought bread, this was the first thing that was too little for the whole family.</span> <span id="s83">Very often, I begged my mother for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s84">Butter, we never had butter in the house, we only had margar ine and the margarine was terrible.</span> <span id="s85">Smelling.</span> <span id="s86">Most of the time we eat marmalade.</span> <span id="s87">But not really from fruit, it was made from different kinds of vegetables and sweeted it with like Sweet and Low, what you have today, saccharin.</span> <span id="s88">It was not a nice time, as a little boy or a little girl to grow up in a poor neighborhood.</span> <span id="s89">But, on the other side, when I think now about it, this saved my life in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q:In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A:I was six years in concentration camp alone.</span> <span id="s92">From 1939 to 1945, and lib er a ted from American Army.</span> <span id="s93">People came in concentration camp...some people, you know, they every time they had always rich food and good food, and they died for hunger in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s94">They give us only a little piece of bread every day and a little bit water-soup and there was really nothing in there.</span> <span id="s95">Maybe a little bit of green stuff, or what was swimming in there, but never a piece of meat or nothing.</span> <span id="s96">After a couple of weeks there, they shrinked.</span> <span id="s97">Those people, you know, the rich people, came into the concentration camp...on this little bit of food they couldn't live.</span> <span id="s98">They became diarrhea and died...after a couple of weeks, they died.</span> <span id="s99">I was a small eater.</span> <span id="s100">With this little bit what my mother could give me, I was satisfied.</span> <span id="s101">This saved me my life in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s102">That's what I think.</span> <span id="s103">With this little piece of bread what they give us, and the little bit water-soup like I have [not clear] one soup ladle fullÑI was satisfied.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q:Your father could not fight in the army, I assume?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A:No, my father was a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s106">In the First World War they didn't take him because he was already...always when they called years...when they called the people in to serve for the army, he was always a year older.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q:They would have taken him, though, as a Polish citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:No, no, then he was, in the First World War he was an Austrian citizen.</span> <span id="s109">Austria was in war together with Germany against Russia.</span> <span id="s110">He went very often and said, "Gee, I want to serve for my land," but they wouldn't take him, because his year wasn't on.</span> <span id="s111">He was born 1864 and they never took his year.</span> <span id="s112">He was already a little bit too old, you know, to serve.</span> <span id="s113">He was a big patriot and he was a soldier in Austria...army.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q:He did fight in Austria then?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A:He didn't fight, he was a soldier three years.</span> <span id="s116">There was no war at this time and he was serving in the 1880's, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s117">So, coming back...this saved my life.</span> <span id="s118">This was a big factor.</span> <span id="s119">And people died like flies from the bad food.</span> <span id="s120">It was not nourishing.</span> <span id="s121">It was nothing, you could just live like, what do you call it, vegetated.</span> <span id="s122">Yes, like...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q:Can you tell me a little bit about your Jewish upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A:Oh, I went to a..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">my father was very conservative, Orthodox, not too crazy fromm [religious] but he went to shul [synagogue] every morning you know, in syna gogue...he was a member from a synagogue, but so at home he doesn't care much only about his only son, what I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q:You were the only son?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A:I was the only son, and six girls.</span> <span id="s129">He cared only that I went to the cheder, you know to the religious school.</span> <span id="s130">The girls...he didn't care.</span> <span id="s131">He was old fashioned, he was...boys are the main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q:So you went to cheder then?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A:I went to cheder, yes.</span> <span id="s134">I learned Hebrew, davening [praying] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q:And was your home kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A:Yes, we were kosher.</span> <span id="s137">We kept all the holidays, Passover, everything was clean and we had extra, extra dishes.</span> <span id="s138">Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur, we went around, my father and mother was crying all the time and he was davening...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q:Did you also speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q:Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A:I went in a German school.</span> <span id="s143">My parents talked Yiddish to each other, to each other.</span> <span id="s144">But we understand, but we couldn't talk to them back in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s145">We talked to them in German and they answered us in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s146">Oh, a little bit German, sure, in time they learned a little bit German.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q:What happened after the First World War?</span> <span id="s148">What happened with the change in German politics?</span> <span id="s149">With the start of the Republic?</span> <span id="s150">Did that affect you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A:Not at all, really, not at all.</span> <span id="s152">The Jewish life went on nice and all the syna gogues and everything was really smooth, and good.</span> <span id="s153">But then started the era when Hitler go up.</span> <span id="s154">Hitler came off.</span> <span id="s155">After 1918 with a couple of officers they were not satisfied with the circumstances where Germany has to pay reparations to the Allies and friends and so on.</span> <span id="s156">And they lost the war, you know.</span> <span id="s157">I don't know if you know it, in 1918, Kaiser had to quit his throne and then starts a revolution, with different kinds of soldiers with different kind of officers, untereinander [among themselves].</span> <span id="s158">Kapp Putsch was shooting on the streets, people died on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q:So you remember seeing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A:Oh yes, yes, I saw it.</span> <span id="s161">Then sometimes those different kind of rifles hit in the house where we are living, behind those big doors, the house doors.</span> <span id="s162">We were living in a cellar at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q:Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A:My father had a little tailor shop after the First World War with cleaning, repairs, alterations he made on men's clothing, most of them men's clothing.</span> <span id="s165">This was a cellar, it was a little store, but a couple of steps went down.</span> <span id="s166">So half in the earth, went down.</span> <span id="s167">Big windows, so you see more when you are like on the street than you are upstairs in a house, an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q:Your father was able to work during the war?</span> <span id="s169">The First World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A:Yes, he worked, yes.</span> <span id="s171">But he did never make much money.</span> <span id="s172">Like I said to you, other people had lot of money, had a good job that made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s173">And he had a big family, he couldn't afford many things that other people could afford.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q:Did anything change for him and for the economics of the family during the 1920's?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A:Yes, we lived a little bit better.</span> <span id="s176">We had more food on the table, you know, because he made better and the business went good.</span> <span id="s177">He made not too bad.</span> <span id="s178">I started after school and went eight years in the, what's it called, the Gemeindeschule, Volks-school.</span> <span id="s179">After eight years, my father said to me, "You have to be a tailor, too."</span> <span id="s180">I had nothing to say as a little boy.</span> <span id="s181">He give me to a master, in die Lehre [in an apprenticeship] and I had to learn the trade.</span> <span id="s182">Then started the depression to the...we had a big inflation in Germany.</span> <span id="s183">He said to me, "You work with me."</span> <span id="s184">I was jobless, I lost my job, it was a depression in Germany, in the '20s, you know.</span> <span id="s185">I started to work with him together.</span> <span id="s186">We made not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q:Was your father at all concerned with Hitler's attempts to get into politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A:Not at all.</span> <span id="s189">The German Jews, I am not one of them, but...because I am born there you can count me, too.</span> <span id="s190">They didn't care much.</span> <span id="s191">They said, "Ah, a shtick mesh ug inne, Hitler, he's crazy.</span> <span id="s192">He never can make something...people are much too democratic and not so big anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s193">We didn't take it for real that he was there and made a lot of Unruhe [unrest].</span> <span id="s194">And then he was in prison, he came to [not clear] in many years.</span> <span id="s195">He was in Landsberg in a Festung [fortress] and there he wrote his book, Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s196">But then started the S.A., his Stormtroopers, they, they became bigger and bigger, you know, and the Reichstag, and the, like the Congress here, the Reichstag in Berlin.</span> <span id="s197">Berlin is the capital of Germany, there was the Reichstag and many, many Congressmen became Nazis, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q:What was your feeling and your father's feeling when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A:It was very, very, we felt very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q:Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A:Yes, we were frightened.</span> <span id="s202">Sure, then they were marching on the streetsÑthe S.A. and sing songs about the Jewish blood has to spritz from the knives.</span> <span id="s203">But the really frightening moment came when Hitler came to power on January 30.</span> <span id="s204">Hindenberg was then the President from Germany and he took him in and made him Reichschancellor.</span> <span id="s205">Then it was frightening.</span> <span id="s206">But still the Jews said, "He won't long exist.</span> <span id="s207">Give him three months."</span> <span id="s208">The Jews in Germany, they were very secure, they said, "Nothing can happen to us," and that's why all of them, the German Jews, really went under.</span> <span id="s209">The rich people could go out of Germany easily in the '30s, in the first years, in the '30s.</span> <span id="s210">They took their money and went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q:Did anyone in your family talk of leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A:No.</span> <span id="s213">We had not the possibilities.</span> <span id="s214">One sister married a Polish Jew and they emigrated to the United States in 1922 or '23, but they couldn't help us.</span> <span id="s215">They were struggling too, here in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q:But there was no talk that you might want to leave, even if you could leave, financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A:I would never...I never felt that I go take my skin and save myself.</span> <span id="s218">My parents were old people, my father was in his 70's, and my mother was in the 70's, and both of them were very sick people...with the heart.</span> <span id="s219">I always felt obligated to watch them, to be there...to always be there.</span> <span id="s220">When they get a heart attack, sometimes I have to be at night at my father's bedside, and watching them.</span> <span id="s221">I very often was thinking, "You can't go away and save your skin.</span> <span id="s222">I have to be with your parents."</span> <span id="s223">I felt this, you know?</span> <span id="s224">An inside voice said to me, "You have to be with your parents.</span> <span id="s225">You can't run away."</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q:Was your father involved in any way in the Jewish Council and the organ ization of Jews in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A:No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q:Was he affected or, at that time, you were working, were you affected by the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A:Oh yes, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q:Can you describe it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A:In 1929, I took over the business.</span> <span id="s232">I was twenty-two years old.</span> <span id="s233">I took over the business; my father couldn't see anymore.</span> <span id="s234">He was very bad with his eyes.</span> <span id="s235">See, a tailor has to see what he is doing.</span> <span id="s236">The needle, you know.</span> <span id="s237">So I took over the business, but then in 1933 when Hitler came to power, the first thing what he did...his soldiers, you know, the S.A. put on all the Jewish stores a big sign with swastikas, "Jude, Jude."</span> <span id="s238">Jew, Jew, Jew.</span> <span id="s239">In the beginning of April 1933, a boycott started against Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s240">Not that they threw stones in the windows, only they marked all Jewish doors with "Jew, Jew, don't buy by Jews."</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q:This was on your shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A:Mine store too.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q:Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A:A big S.A. man in uniform had a big sign around his neck here with a big sign "Don't buy by Jews."</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q:Did he put that on your store?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s247">On my store he only put up a big swastika on the window, with white chalk or whatever.</span> <span id="s248">But the trouble was one thingÑin this house where I had my store and I was living in the back of the store.</span> <span id="s249">Upstairs on the third floor was living a S.A. SturmfŸ hrer running around in uniform.</span> <span id="s250">He watched Christian people, when they go into mine store, and bring me some work, you know.</span> <span id="s251">When they came out, he warned them if they do this again they gonna be sorry for, you know.</span> <span id="s252">So then the Christian customers, one after the other, went away.</span> <span id="s253">Then my business lost maybe 90 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q:The first S.A. man you described with the sign, did he stand outside the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A:Outside the door.</span> <span id="s256">Front of the door.</span> <span id="s257">Let nobody go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q:How long did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A:A whole day.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q:The day of the boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A:The day, one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q:And how long did the S.A. man live in your building, stop the Christians from coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A:Always, he always was staying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q:From that point on?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A:He was leaning out of this window from his apartment and watched people.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q:How long did that go on?</span> <span id="s267">From the time of the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A:All the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q:Starting at the time from the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q:Starting in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A:'33.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q:And going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A:This is the difference between Jews in Germany and Jews from Poland, that you interview every day, they didn't know then nothing from Hitler.</span> <span id="s275">They lived in a freedom that nobody was doing something to them.</span> <span id="s276">They started 1940 when Hitler went into Poland, the whole trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q:Your problems then, you feel, started the day of the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A:Really, sure, when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q:What happened after that?</span> <span id="s280">Your business fell off 90%.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A:Ninety percent.</span> <span id="s282">Only a couple of Jewish customers left.</span> <span id="s283">Then many Jews left the country, too.</span> <span id="s284">People with money left the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q:And at this point, you were the only child at home with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A:I was the only child home with my parents and my younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q:There was a sister younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A:Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:One child was younger than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A:Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q:And you felt you didn't want to leave because you were responsible for your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s293">One day came a policeman to our house and said to my father, he has to come to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q:When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A:It must be 1938, in the beginning of 1938.</span> <span id="s296">So my father went with his wife, my mother, and a couple of sisters.</span> <span id="s297">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s298">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s299">I know now I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s300">Only he went.</span> <span id="s301">At the police station they told him, "I wanna give you the best advice...leave this country.</span> <span id="s302">Go away."</span> <span id="s303">So my father said to the police officer, "Where should I go?</span> <span id="s304">I am 72 years old, fast [almost] blind, and can hardly walk."</span> <span id="s305">He walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s306">"I can't go nowhere."</span> <span id="s307">"I beg you to"...one was not a..</span> <span id="s308">.</span> <span id="s309">Nazi, the police officer (all was not Nazi) he said, "I beg you try to go out from Germany.</span> <span id="s310">I warn you."</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q:Why did this officer warn your father?</span> <span id="s312">Why did he take him aside, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A:Because he was a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q:Did he know him personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s316">Maybe he knows my father, but my father doesn't know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q:Now, can we backtrack a little bit before this instance, to 1935 and the Nuremberg Laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q:Can you tell me what happened, how you experienced that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A:I tell you the truth, this doesn't affect me.</span> <span id="s321">I wasn't running around with Christian girls.</span> <span id="s322">The Nuremberg Laws were only affected Jews who were, or Christians who went together with Jews, or they tried to get married or what...This was then a law that Jews can't mary Christians and opposite, too, that Christians can't marry Jews.</span> <span id="s323">If they had sex, and the Jewish partner got caught, became the...death strafe [punishment].</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q:So you don't feel that the Nuremberg Laws affected you that much?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A:Not me, not me.</span> <span id="s326">I was much too Jewish to go with Christian girls in this time.</span> <span id="s327">I never do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q:Did you feel restricted at all in your practicing Judaism during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A:Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q:There was no effect on your religious practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A:No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:What happened with your business...how did you support yourself with the decrease in your clientele?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A:I made hardly a living.</span> <span id="s334">The expenses were not big.</span> <span id="s335">I had to pay the rent, but I was living there.</span> <span id="s336">I had to be there anyhow, I couldn't move to another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q:You rented the basement floor of this building?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q:And your shop was in the front and your living quarters were in the back, and the S.A. man was on the third floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q:And were there other Jewish families or Christian families in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Tape 1 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q:Can you tell me, then, what else changed for you before 1938?</span> <span id="s344">What else did you notice, what other experiences did you have in Berlin during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A:One sister married, married sister with three children, one was already married.</span> <span id="s346">They emigrated to South America, in 1935.</span> <span id="s347">My father was hollering to his son-in-law, "Are you crazy, [we are doing all right here] you can live here, nobody bothers you much," he said.</span> <span id="s348">But the trouble was the Jewish children couldn't go more to the Christian schools.</span> <span id="s349">This was a law.</span> <span id="s350">The Nuremberg Laws, I think.</span> <span id="s351">Jewish children can't go with Christian children together in one school.</span> <span id="s352">They had Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s353">There had to build Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s354">So he said, "If mine child can't go to the school anymore, I have to leave the country.</span> <span id="s355">If he has no education anymore, I have to go."</span> <span id="s356">So he sold his business in 1935 and went to Rio de Janeiro.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q:So this was the second sister of yours that had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A:Yes, this was the second sister.</span> <span id="s359">Two sisters were married to Christians, had Christian husbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q:Did they convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s362">It was not necessary.</span> <span id="s363">They were not married in a church.</span> <span id="s364">They married only for the law, that's all.</span> <span id="s365">So all the friends of mine went away, but I said to myself, "You can't go nowhere."</span> <span id="s366">Till one day, there came out a law that all Polish Jews have to leave the country.</span> <span id="s367">So, I didn't care much.</span> <span id="s368">I didn't went away.</span> <span id="s369">I had to stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s370">It was my obligation to stay with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q:Did noone check to see if you were allowed to stay in the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A:Then one morning, in the 5 o'clock in the morning, was a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s373">The Gestapo came into my house.</span> <span id="s374">We were all in the beds.</span> <span id="s375">"Take on your clothing and let's go."</span> <span id="s376">So, it's only my father and me.</span> <span id="s377">We were only two men.</span> <span id="s378">They didn't said nothing to my mother, or to my sister.</span> <span id="s379">Only my father and me.</span> <span id="s380">I started to holler.</span> <span id="s381">I said, "What you want from my old father, he can't go nowhere, he's half blind and he can hardly walk.</span> <span id="s382">He's 72 years old."</span> <span id="s383">He wants to hit me because I argued with him.</span> <span id="s384">So we put on our clothing.</span> <span id="s385">They didn't say nothing, what's going to be, or what, what they have in mind with us or say, "Take money with you, or take a piece of luggage with clothing..." Nothing.</span> <span id="s386">We went to the police station and there were big trucks and we saw hundreds of hundreds of Jewish people, men.</span> <span id="s387">They were putting them on trucks and brought us all in a big Kaserne [barracks].</span> <span id="s388">Do you know what a Kaserne is?</span> <span id="s389">A Kaserne is big buildings where soldiers were living.</span> <span id="s390">Thousand soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q:Like barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A:Barracks, like barracks, but this was not barracks, was big buildings, three and four floors high.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q:This was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A:In Berlin, yes.</span> <span id="s395">Wasn't used anymore for soldiers, was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q:When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A:This was October 28, 1938.</span> <span id="s398">And we heard they were gonna bring us all, that was all Polish citizen what we were living there for years and years in Germany, were born there, some of them, like me, but we all had Polish passports.</span> <span id="s399">And we heard that they were going to bring us to Poland.</span> <span id="s400">Force us, and bring us to Poland.</span> <span id="s401">We didn't know then that in other cities of Germany, and other little towns, or what, they took whole families and throw them to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s402">Women, with little babies on the arm, and pregnant women, everybody from whole family.</span> <span id="s403">So in Berlin, we were all in a big place behind the Kaserne and I said to myself, "You have to do something.</span> <span id="s404">I can't take...my father can't do this...and go with..." I had the feeling that he wouldn't stand the transport to the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q:You knew at this point what they were going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A:Yes, yes, we knew that they bring us to Poland.</span> <span id="s407">But I knew my father wouldn't [withstand]...this transport.</span> <span id="s408">He wouldn't live through this.</span> <span id="s409">So I went from one officer to others.</span> <span id="s410">Were police, no S.S. nor S.A., only police.</span> <span id="s411">And I went from one officer to another and no success.</span> <span id="s412">I said, "Please, can you leave my father go, let my father go home.</span> <span id="s413">I think he wouldn't stand this travelling on this [not clear]."</span> <span id="s414">Then I went to a higher police officer, I thought it was a higher one, and I said to him, "Can I talk to you?"</span> <span id="s415">He said, "O.K." I said, "My father is fast [almost] blind...he can hardly walk.</span> <span id="s416">Is it possible you can let him free, that he can go home?"</span> <span id="s417">So he said to me, "Where is your father?"</span> <span id="s418">I said, "I bring him to you."</span> <span id="s419">I went and brought my father to him, and he looked at him, like this, as he could see he was 74 years old, and he said to another policeman, "Take this man to a doctor."</span> <span id="s420">And I saw my father...I saw him no more.</span> <span id="s421">He went away.</span> <span id="s422">I said, "Daddy, go," I was happy.</span> <span id="s423">I had the feeling that he was going to be saved.</span> <span id="s424">Then they brought us in trains to the Polish border, to the border town.</span> <span id="s425">German border town.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q:You said there were trucks, you went...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A:Yes, first trucks that brought us and trucks to the station, to the train station.</span> <span id="s428">They put us in the trains...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q:Were you able to take anything with you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A:I had nothing.</span> <span id="s431">They didn't say nothing to us when they took us from home.</span> <span id="s432">In other towns, they had luggages.</span> <span id="s433">Money and everything.</span> <span id="s434">I had in my pants pocket, maybe three German marks, or what.</span> <span id="s435">They brought us to the border town and it was already night.</span> <span id="s436">Nighttime.</span> <span id="s437">We had nothing in our mouth to eat, nothing.</span> <span id="s438">From the morning 5 o'clock they took us, from the bed we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s439">From the train, they let us out of the train, and everybody has to give up his money, what he has, they took everything away.</span> <span id="s440">Then the S.S. took over.</span> <span id="s441">No more police, S.S. with rifles, bayonettes on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q:This was at the border town, in Germany; do you remember the name of it by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A:Yes, Benchin, Benchin, B-E-N-T-S-S-H-E-E-N.</span> <span id="s444">And this train was full with men, women and children from other stops, they stopped in other towns before they went to the border; from all sides came people and then in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q:What kind of trains were these?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A:Regular personal trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q:Passenger trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A:Normal trains.</span> <span id="s449">They took our money away, only ten marks, everybody has to have ten marks, not more.</span> <span id="s450">The rest of the money they took away.</span> <span id="s451">Some S.S. men rifled the people, and some S.S. men took watches away, so really, stealing.</span> <span id="s452">And then they brought us outside the train station, and we came in a big wood.</span> <span id="s453">And they started to hit us over the heads we should run.</span> <span id="s454">The S.S. yes.</span> <span id="s455">Hit us.</span> <span id="s456">Old people fell, lost all their luggage, because when they hit you over the head you have to go up and run again, or they would hit you...so I was happy I had my father not with me.</span> <span id="s457">I was so happy.</span> <span id="s458">I was young, I could run.</span> <span id="s459">So in a little while, they said to us, "You see the little light there in the back in the woods, this is your homeland.</span> <span id="s460">You go there, then you are in your homeland.</span> <span id="s461">Don't come back, if you come back we shoot you."</span> <span id="s462">So we went through the woods to the little light and there was a little border house, a little house only.</span> <span id="s463">And we went in there, and there was a Polish border guard.</span> <span id="s464">We showed him our passports.</span> <span id="s465">"We are Polish citizens and the S.S. told us we have to go to Poland."</span> <span id="s466">And he said, "Back to Hitler, back to Hitler."</span> <span id="s467">The Polish guard, he don't want to know nothing.</span> <span id="s468">"Back to Hitler."</span> <span id="s469">And I said...not only I said, there were hundreds of people...many trains came and we said, "You have to let us through to the first town."</span> <span id="s470">Then we can't stay here and it starts to rain in the woods.</span> <span id="s471">"No, no," he didn't let us through.</span> <span id="s472">Came another Grenz [border] guard with a rifle and we had to stay there the whole night.</span> <span id="s473">And the rain was going down and the people were laying there in the woods.</span> <span id="s474">Women with little children, with babies.</span> <span id="s475">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s476">So I had the first taste from my homeland, so to say.</span> <span id="s477">In the morning he went into town and he brought a lot of police, Polish police with him, and they marched us into town.</span> <span id="s478">Not with trucks...we had to walk.</span> <span id="s479">We had to walk, it was maybe one-half hours or three-quarter hours.</span> <span id="s480">In this Polish town, this border town, the name is Borshin, in Polish.</span> <span id="s481">It was my German, the town was before German, and after the First World War it became Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q:How do you spell the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A:Sporshin, in Deutsch Benchin, in Polish, Spascyn, I think.</span> <span id="s484">So they brought us to big horse stables.</span> <span id="s485">It was a little bit outside of town.</span> <span id="s486">There were big horse stables, empty horse stables, with a lot of straw inside, without windows, only windows were only on the big doors.</span> <span id="s487">We had to march in and there we should lay there.</span> <span id="s488">The Polish citizen come overÑthat was the reception.</span> <span id="s489">After three days, a big truck came on with bread.</span> <span id="s490">They threw this bread down from the truck to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q:This was the first food?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A:The first food, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s493">Dry bread.</span> <span id="s494">And water, water we had from a well, we had to pump.</span> <span id="s495">And then the Jewish organizations in PoznanÑthis may be 50 kilometers away or whatÑbring food.</span> <span id="s496">The life got to be little bit like normal, normalized.</span> <span id="s497">Still we are living in the straw, you know, laying there, but that's all, we had food and we could rest, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q:How many people do you think were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A:Around I think about 500 people.</span> <span id="s500">Then life got a little bit normalized because we, they put some people in schools.</span> <span id="s501">Some people had became [got] monies suddenly from the U.S. or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q:They got money?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A:Yes, from relatives.</span> <span id="s504">Then everybody knew then what happened to those people and they sent money to them.</span> <span id="s505">And I got money from my sister in the U.S. and the dollar was very good.</span> <span id="s506">I became [got]...lots of zlotys...you know the Polish money.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q:How did your sister find out where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A:My, I think, my mother and the other sisters told them what happened, yes.</span> <span id="s509">They sent letters to the U.S. and told them what happened, to their brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q:Were you able to get any letters from your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A:Yes, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s512">They could send us letters.</span> <span id="s513">Not the first couple of weeks, but then we find out what happened in between in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q:What did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A:One of the Polish boys in Paris heard that their parents in Hanover, got, they throw them out to Poland.</span> <span id="s516">And he went to the German consulate and protested there.</span> <span id="s517">And he wants to talk to one of the higher officers there.</span> <span id="s518">And he shoot one of those high officers, Von Rath.</span> <span id="s519">I don't know if you heard about it.</span> <span id="s520">This was a Polish-Jewish boy, Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s521">And this was the Anlass [cause] for the Nazis to start the whole thing against the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s522">They start to burn all the synagogues in Germany and my wife knows the one, she was living there as a young girl.</span> <span id="s523">Burned all the synagogues, plŸ ndert [pillaged] Jewish homes, tear everything apart.</span> <span id="s524">The S.A. went into the houses, in the apartments, slit with knives, everything, sofas, pictures and everything, tore everything down.</span> <span id="s525">Until then the real tsorris [trouble] started.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q:This was the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A:This was the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s528">When you say the word Kristallnacht, you can't think nothing.</span> <span id="s529">This word means really practically nothing.</span> <span id="s530">The "Night of the Broken Glass," you can say.</span> <span id="s531">This doesn't say that the synagogues burned with people in there with the Shamosen [caretakers].</span> <span id="s532">The people were living there in the synagogues...some guards, the shamus, you know...they burned everything down.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q:What happened to your mother and sister during that time?</span> <span id="s534">Were you able to hear exactly what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A:I didn't hear nothing from them, nothing.</span> <span id="s536">We heard it only over the radio.</span> <span id="s537">Over the radio, we heard what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s538">My mother died then.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q:Your mother died?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A:My mother died.</span> <span id="s541">She wasÑI think she died like of a broken heart.</span> <span id="s542">Because I was the only son...she was only thinking of me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q:When did you find out she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A:I find it out, my sisters wrote me a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q:During this time that you were in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s547">And I wrote them, too.</span> <span id="s548">My address where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q:How long after you had left Germany was this do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A:She died erev Pesach [before Passover], March, 1939.</span> <span id="s551">I was then around five months away from home.</span> <span id="s552">Still there in Zbonszyn.</span> <span id="s553">We couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s554">If you want to go to the train station, where Polish border guards...gendarmerie...didn't let you go nowhere.</span> <span id="s555">The streets outside, outside the town...you couldn't go nowhere...were all guarded constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q:Were you able to work at all in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A:Work?</span> <span id="s558">Doing something?</span> <span id="s559">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q:The food that you had was supplied by the Jewish committee in Poznan.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A:Yes, and then afterwards, many people got money from their relatives, and they lived from the money that they got.</span> <span id="s562">It wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s563">Only that you couldn't go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s564">Couldn't go in the land.</span> <span id="s565">I wasn't very anxious to go to Poland anyhow, because I couldn't speak one word Polish.</span> <span id="s566">I was like handicapped, you know.</span> <span id="s567">But they talked to me, I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s568">This was a border town where many Germany were living too, from years before.</span> <span id="s569">So, it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s570">Then came out a law that Jews who left Germany and had a business there can come back for a certain time to Germany to liquidate their businesses.</span> <span id="s571">In a sense, they took us out of the beds, we couldn't do nothing and go.</span> <span id="s572">So we can come back for a certain time to liquidate everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q:When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A:This was around May, 1939.</span> <span id="s575">So I said, "Here, I am one of them."</span> <span id="s576">They took my passport away and I became [received] another passport.</span> <span id="s577">A white passport.</span> <span id="s578">The color was white, and when you open it up, it was a picture of me.</span> <span id="s579">Nationality: Jude.</span> <span id="s580">They were worser than the Germans already.</span> <span id="s581">This wasn't in Germany then.</span> <span id="s582">Was it in Germany in '38?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q:The Poles issued this passport to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A:Yes, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s585">I am not a Pole, I am only a Jew.</span> <span id="s586">And I had to leave the country and never can come back, stand [stated] in the passport.</span> <span id="s587">The passport is guilty only a couple months or what.</span> <span id="s588">Then I went with this passport to the station and I could go to Germany back.</span> <span id="s589">Back to Berlin, my father, I saw my father.</span> <span id="s590">I saved him the life, for couple of lousy years in Germany.</span> <span id="s591">It was '43 when they took him and poisoned him with gas.</span> <span id="s592">I saved him five years, five years.</span> <span id="s593">So I came back to Germany; my sister was still there.</span> <span id="s594">She was married in between to a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s595">This Jewish man was up when the synagogues was burning.</span> <span id="s596">He was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s597">They arrested a lot of German Jews.</span> <span id="s598">Hundreds of thousands and sent them to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s599">He knows something about it and he run away to Holland over the Dutch border to Holland.</span> <span id="s600">And she was waiting that something happened to him that she could go to him.</span> <span id="s601">So one day she then told her girlfriend, a German Jew, too, what was there in Holland.</span> <span id="s602">They went to the Holl and ish borderÑyou know what Hollandish is, Netherland, to the Netherland border and tried to smuggle through.</span> <span id="s603">But the Hollandish Grenz [border] police catch them and gave them back to the S.S.</span> <span id="s604">So they arrested my sister and the other girl, maybe others, I don't know, and brought them to a town called Hanover, I think, I'm not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s605">This is not too important, anyhow.</span> <span id="s606">And she was six weeks there in a prison, they didn't know what to do with her, and they sent them back to their parents.</span> <span id="s607">So when I came back to BerlinÑthis was around June or July of 1939Ñsuddenly, maybe that was the next day, I got a letter from the American General Consulate in Berlin, I should come with $10 to get my visa for the United States.</span> <span id="s608">I had to get a doctor's Attest [certificate] that I'm all right.</span> <span id="s609">I have to bring ten dollars for the visa.</span> <span id="s610">I was happy.</span> <span id="s611">But, the date when I should come was September 21, 1939.</span> <span id="s612">I said, My God, what do you do [till then]?</span> <span id="s613">You can't stay in Ger many, stated in passport, only short time you can be there.</span> <span id="s614">To Poland you can't go back because they wouldn't let you in, so I run to the American Consulate in Berlin, American General Consulate.</span> <span id="s615">Hundreds of people were there, trying to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s616">Jews, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s617">I stand in line, I tried to cry, and said, "Here's my Polish passport what they give me in Poland.</span> <span id="s618">I can't stay here in Germany.</span> <span id="s619">I have to leave the country."</span> <span id="s620">And then on September 1st, the war started.</span> <span id="s621">The World War against Poland, first against Poland.</span> <span id="s622">I begged him, "Please put this date [ahead] for a little bit earlier.</span> <span id="s623">Give me an earlier date so that I can have my visa in the Pass [passport] and then I'm feel good when I have my visa and Pass, then I am [not clear] I go out of the country."</span> <span id="s624">Nothing helped.</span> <span id="s625">I begged them.</span> <span id="s626">He was stone faced, this American, Beamter [official].</span> <span id="s627">"You come when you're told to come.</span> <span id="s628">September 21st is your date, not one day earlier.</span> <span id="s629">There are hundreds of other people before you that want to go out."</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q:This was an American, that man was an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A:Sure, a consular officer.</span> <span id="s632">It doesn't help me.</span> <span id="s633">I came home whining, crying.</span> <span id="s634">Maybe four days later, knocks on the door, in the morning, 5 o'clock, I had the feeling right away what it is.</span> <span id="s635">The Gestapo again.</span> <span id="s636">"Put on your clothes, let's go."</span> <span id="s637">They didn't touch my father, only me.</span> <span id="s638">On the same afternoon, I was already in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q:This was July...September?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A:This was September 13, 1939.</span> <span id="s641">I came to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s642">This is a little...this is a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s643">The Ort [place] is Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s644">Before, the name was Orian ie n burg.</span> <span id="s645">Concentration camp Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s646">Then they changed it to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q:How did you get to Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A:They put us in trains, it was a train load full with prisoners.</span> <span id="s649">I was thinking I'm the only one, but then they were, hundreds other people.</span> <span id="s650">It was a regular train, regular passenger train.</span> <span id="s651">The only thing was we had to lay on the floor.</span> <span id="s652">That nobody could see us when other train would pass this train, they couldn't look in.</span> <span id="s653">There is nothing to see.</span> <span id="s654">They are all laying on the floor and this was all S.S. already.</span> <span id="s655">And pilfered us.</span> <span id="s656">S.S. took every thing that we had, something on us that was wertvoll [valuable] good, good pillows, pen cils, you know, gold, some gold pencils, pens, watches, took everything we...mine only had a regular blechene [tin] watch.</span> <span id="s657">They took my watch, they took it.</span> <span id="s658">Then we came on to this town and we had to march to the camp.</span> <span id="s659">A couple of kilometers away.</span> <span id="s660">When we march ed through the town, we had to keep our hands behind our head like this and we had to march.</span> <span id="s661">It was a hot, very hot day.</span> <span id="s662">The people, they are laying out the windows, you know, the people from the town, laying at the window.</span> <span id="s663">"What, the Jews...they are Jews.</span> <span id="s664">Hit them, kill them, when you wanna give them food, kill them first!"</span> <span id="s665">That was the "good German"...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Tape 2 of 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q:Can you continue about your arrival at Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A:Yes, we came to Sachsenhausen and it was a big, big open space with buildings and so on.</span> <span id="s669">We were standing there in line and the S.S. came to greet us.</span> <span id="s670">Isn't that nice?</span> <span id="s671">Jewish men with big beards.</span> <span id="s672">They put on their lighters and burned their beards.</span> <span id="s673">And they had to stand like this and the beard was burning.</span> <span id="s674">They started to cry; it doesn't help them.</span> <span id="s675">Then we came to a barrack and they have to take all off our private clothing and the private clothing came in big containers.</span> <span id="s676">We saw them hanging them up.</span> <span id="s677">To have to take everything off that we had and wrote everything down.</span> <span id="s678">Real German, you know, everything has to be written.</span> <span id="s679">But I had a wristwatch, ring [not clear].</span> <span id="s680">Then they stop us to take off our hair...shaved us the hair, the head.</span> <span id="s681">[The beard] everything was off.</span> <span id="s682">Then they put us [under shower] ice cold water.</span> <span id="s683">Ice, not warm water, ice cold.</span> <span id="s684">[With a dangerous] powerful shower.</span> <span id="s685">And then they gave us new clothing.</span> <span id="s686">And I saw what they give us.</span> <span id="s687">Heavy military uniforms, maybe 100 years old, worn what, from 1870, or what.</span> <span id="s688">From the war in 1870.</span> <span id="s689">With high stiff collars, and three hooks here.</span> <span id="s690">They had to be closed, those hooks, shouldn't be open.</span> <span id="s691">If they find someone with an open collar, they hit them terrible, on the tops of the head.</span> <span id="s692">They brought us to barracks, my barrack was 37, the number was outside marked 37.</span> <span id="s693">In the barracks there was two parts.</span> <span id="s694">When you came in, it was one, the toilets and the washrooms.</span> <span id="s695">Then came a day-room where you could sit and eat your herrliches [delicious] dinner and table and benches, not chairs, benches.</span> <span id="s696">Then came a door, there was the room where we slept: a big room, empty room and they brought in burlap sacks and we had to fill them with straw and has to staple them on the back wall, to stuff them up.</span> <span id="s697">Then started our working days and hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q:During this time, what kind of food were you given?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A:We became [received]...everybody became [received] a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s700">Five men, one bread.</span> <span id="s701">It was bread, about one-and-a-half pound bread, soft bread.</span> <span id="s702">Black bread.</span> <span id="s703">They cut this in five pieces.</span> <span id="s704">Five men became [received] on bread.</span> <span id="s705">Jeder [each] a piece.</span> <span id="s706">The bread was so, that when you eat the bread, the whole mouth starts to burn.</span> <span id="s707">I don't know what the ingredients in this bread were...that everybody became a little blistered in your mouth, insides.</span> <span id="s708">Of the tongue, inside, you know.</span> <span id="s709">Little white blisters.</span> <span id="s710">When you eat fire, so was the bread.</span> <span id="s711">And ten men, became [received] one piece margarine, it was a pound piece.</span> <span id="s712">For cut in nine pieces and everyone become [received] a piece like this.</span> <span id="s713">[A little thicker.]</span> <span id="s714">Then they give us coffee...was only black water.</span> <span id="s715">That doesn't taste like coffee...was only black water with a sweet taste.</span> <span id="s716">In the evening they gave us one Teller [dish] full of soup, watery soup.</span> <span id="s717">And in that was swimming like, like pieces of Kohlrube [kohlrabi]Ñlittle pieces was terrible...but I eat it.</span> <span id="s718">Other people eat it, too, because they were hungry.</span> <span id="s719">So, work, they had not work for us.</span> <span id="s720">So the work was to laying a whole day on your belly next to each otherÑthe hand in the back had to keep the little cap from head with both hands.</span> <span id="s721">And they watched that we had all the hands really in the back, not that we take one hand away.</span> <span id="s722">Then the S.S. starts to come in and have fun with us.</span> <span id="s723">Up and down, we had to go up from the floor, lay down, up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s724">Till there were a couple of dead people, elderly people who couldn't stand this exercise.</span> <span id="s725">Then they stopped.</span> <span id="s726">One day they did a wonderful thingÑthey put people from the other half of barrack, put them in our part.</span> <span id="s727">And they have to lay in two shifts, one over the other.</span> <span id="s728">There's one laying on the floor and then the people from the other side barrack have to come our part and has to lay on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q:How many people are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A:About 200 people.</span> <span id="s731">In two shifts, one over the other and on top come the S.S., stepped over us with a piece of wood and hit the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q:They would walk on the two layers of bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A:On the two layers of bodies and hit us terrible.</span> <span id="s734">The head in there was un human, so the S.S. couldn't stay long there, because they couldn't stand the heat too.</span> <span id="s735">They had uniforms on, the black S.S. uniforms with the S.S. signs.</span> <span id="s736">They start to feel uncom fortable.</span> <span id="s737">Thanks God, they went out again, because they couldn't stand the heat.</span> <span id="s738">But they worked so long over the people, until there were a couple of dead people thereÑfrom this strenuous exercise.</span> <span id="s739">In the evening we had to go out and stay in line and get counted.</span> <span id="s740">But the people were laying on the floor, their brain couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s741">They couldn't stay on their legs, from laying a whole day, so they tumbled, they couldn't control themselves...they stumbled over the whole place.</span> <span id="s742">Like they run away too, like this.</span> <span id="s743">They couldn't control their own...After the third day or fourth day, I don't know exactly how many, I felt I was one of the victims too, soon.</span> <span id="s744">The Blockaltest came in, he was a criminal because he had green triangle with his number.</span> <span id="s745">A tailor should meld [announce] themselves...who is a tailor?</span> <span id="s746">So I get up and I said, "I am a tailor," and with me maybe ten other people.</span> <span id="s747">And he took three out, from this group he took three.</span> <span id="s748">One of those three was I.</span> <span id="s749">We could sit on a bench, shouldn't lay on the floor anymore.</span> <span id="s750">No more exercise for us, we were sitting, those three, men sitting on the floor...we could take off our jacket because a tailor has to work, you know, has to be comfortable...could take off the heavy jacket.</span> <span id="s751">Those three men, you imagine the feeling that we had?</span> <span id="s752">We were so nebbesh [helpless] for the others, but we felt good...Ashamed to tell you, but it was like this.</span> <span id="s753">We could cool our bodies on the wet windows, the windows were wet from the heat, and the wetness felt good on our naked chests.</span> <span id="s754">And we had to sew on those Mogen Dovids on the prisoners' clothing and the numbers.</span> <span id="s755">Everybody on the floor, one after the other, has to sit up, has to take off the jacket, have to give it to us.</span> <span id="s756">We were sewing on the numbers and the Mogen Dovid and having to give it back to them.</span> <span id="s757">They had to put it on again, and lay again on the floor.</span> <span id="s758">The S.S. came in and [made] a terrible exercise with those on the floor.</span> <span id="s759">They had such wounds on the knees, from them laying on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q:You were doing this in the same barrack where you had been before?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A:Yes, in the same barrack, but we three they took us out, not out, they put us on a bench, we could sit on a bench.</span> <span id="s762">They were laying before us, those hundreds of people, and we were sitting on a benches, three men.</span> <span id="s763">And I was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q:You had mentioned before that the Mogen Dovid were two separate trian g les?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A:Yes, two separate triangles, so put on that it looked like a Jewish star, like a Mogen Dovid.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q:And the color...?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A:The color was red, one triangle was red and one was yellow.</span> <span id="s768">Yellow is Jew ish, the Juden Fleck [patch] you know, the yellow Fleck, and red.</span> <span id="s769">Some had aber [but] black Fleck...parts, black triangles.</span> <span id="s770">Those were Jews who were already arrested once in a while.</span> <span id="s771">One cannot criminals, they named them a-social.</span> <span id="s772">A-social was not a normal person...he lives off others of other's peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q:Like a petty criminal?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A:Yes, like a, what they say in Rusland [Russia], [how do you call] the sort?</span> <span id="s775">Yes people were done that had regular work, live from little petty things, or little Krumme Sachen [petty crimes].</span> <span id="s776">They had a black triangle and a yellow on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q:And the ones that had the red piece were considered political Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A:Because we were political Jews, because we were Polish Jews and still in Germany like, you know.</span> <span id="s779">We had to live there in Poland.</span> <span id="s780">Then some Jews had green on red...green on yellowÑyellow for Jew and green was criminal.</span> <span id="s781">That's why Jews were already arrested...were in maybe prison.</span> <span id="s782">Not much.</span> <span id="s783">Jews are not this type of people in general, who are in prisons.</span> <span id="s784">Saved my life, maybe, this episode.</span> <span id="s785">All my years in concentration camp I had so little chain of little luck, since I would never live six years in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s786">I wasn't this strong enough.</span> <span id="s787">One luck was that I was always a small eater.</span> <span id="s788">I could live with little bread, a little bit, with a little bit water soup.</span> <span id="s789">Another thing was, I was a tailor.</span> <span id="s790">It saved my life in this moment.</span> <span id="s791">A third thing is, I wasn't married.</span> <span id="s792">I was a single person.</span> <span id="s793">I not have to think what happened to my wife: What is with my wife?</span> <span id="s794">What is with my children?</span> <span id="s795">I am here, where are they?</span> <span id="s796">Living, or what, knowing you couldn't go to them.</span> <span id="s797">We couldn't wrote to them.</span> <span id="s798">After a month in concentration camp we could wrote the first postal card.</span> <span id="s799">[But] we should put...only wrote what they said.</span> <span id="s800">We should write, "I am all right, I am here and here barrack and so and so.</span> <span id="s801">[I am] fine, and I hope you feel good, you're all right."</span> <span id="s802">What they said, we should write, we wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q:And who could you send that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A:To my family, to my father, to my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q:Were you able to hear from them after you gave them your location?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A:Not right away, not right away.</span> <span id="s807">The first postal card after a month, we could wrote to them so that they know where we are.</span> <span id="s808">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s809">They took us out of beds, they didn't know what happened to us.</span> <span id="s810">At night, we could take the straw sack down and spread them on the floor and could lay on them.</span> <span id="s811">But there were so many people, there wasn't enough room for each person to lay like a human being, on the straw sack.</span> <span id="s812">You couldn't lay like this, how impossible, there wasn't enough room to lay straight on your back.</span> <span id="s813">You have to lay on the side, on one side, and the next person has to lay fast [almost] on your side.</span> <span id="s814">The Blockaltest [block supervisor], this murderer, every day he had a couple deaths.</span> <span id="s815">He has to show them the results...the dead people were laying outside barracks after they were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q:The block elder you mentioned was a criminal?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A:A criminal, yes, a real murderer.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q:Not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A:No, no, not a Jew.</span> <span id="s820">There were no Jewish block elders in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s821">He had a piece of bread in his hand, and everybody has to lay tight on the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q:With your knees drawn up?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A:The knees maybe like this.</span> <span id="s824">A little bit drawn up...not straight.</span> <span id="s825">And one, the next one has to lay hard on us.</span> <span id="s826">He hit me or the other.</span> <span id="s827">Like you see a sardine in a box, but a sardine look nice.</span> <span id="s828">We were laying like this.</span> <span id="s829">One on the other.</span> <span id="s830">You could hardly breathe.</span> <span id="s831">And when you want to turn, we have to call each other the whole length, we have to call, we wants to turn the other side.</span> <span id="s832">So we all has to turn.</span> <span id="s833">But one has to go out...on the toilet, once in the while in the night.</span> <span id="s834">We had only one little cover to cover us.</span> <span id="s835">So he stand up, this...till he could get up, he was so tight on the other one, till he had the power to get up, to get loose from those people, he went to the toilet, he came back.</span> <span id="s836">He has no place where to lay down.</span> <span id="s837">Right away the place was filled up already.</span> <span id="s838">He begged the people, "Please let me in again, let me lay down."</span> <span id="s839">Nobody wants to let him in again.</span> <span id="s840">He was standing and crying, nebbish.</span> <span id="s841">That happened every night; every night the same thing.</span> <span id="s842">People got up and wants to go to the toilet, come back, couldn't find their place anymore.</span> <span id="s843">You couldn't put on light, there was no light.</span> <span id="s844">And then the S.S. came sometimes at night with a flashlight to the window and looked.</span> <span id="s845">When they saw one of us prisoners laying there maybe stretched his arm or what, made a little motion, you know.</span> <span id="s846">"Oh the Jews don't sleep, how can they sleep, let's go in and throw them out."</span> <span id="s847">So we had to go outÑall of us out, middle of the night because maybe one man raised his arm...out of the barracks on hands, in hands...lay down outside and roll.</span> <span id="s848">Rolling, we have to roll, like children, holding up a hands.</span> <span id="s849">We had to roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q:You were only wearing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A:A shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q:A shirt, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A:A shirt, that's all.</span> <span id="s854">We are rolling, rolling, and they hit us until a couple were dead.</span> <span id="s855">Couple two, three, were dead.</span> <span id="s856">This happened fast [almost] every night.</span> <span id="s857">They came and had fun with us.</span> <span id="s858">Then they had one or two targets, elderly Jews, and hit them until they were dead.</span> <span id="s859">So we saw the dead every day for [before] your eyes.</span> <span id="s860">Work, they had no work for us.</span> <span id="s861">There was no work.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q:You were still sewing on the stars, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A:Yes, but then come one point where there were no more sewing, but then there was different story.</span> <span id="s864">They saw that the people were get so sore, that they had wounds and the pus was setting in.</span> <span id="s865">So they had to find another thing.</span> <span id="s866">We had to, all four of us has to go in the toilet.</span> <span id="s867">In the men's room.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q:All of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A:Yes, all of us from one room in this side, this toilet from the other side barrackÑtheir toilet.</span> <span id="s870">Two toilets.</span> <span id="s871">And we had to stay in those toilets.</span> <span id="s872">And they pressed us in.</span> <span id="s873">One and the other, one and the other.</span> <span id="s874">Until we were staying like this.</span> <span id="s875">Could hardly raise the chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q:You were standing, packed into this...room?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A:Yes, standing the whole day.</span> <span id="s878">This was the working hours, we had to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q:This included you, at

id="s883">The toilets were there, but they couldn't move, because we were pressed one on the other.</span> <span id="s884">You could hardly breathe.</span> <span id="s885">Some people took their hands, you know, to have a little bit distance from the other men, you know, but it was terrible.</span> <span id="s886">Staying in one place, you know.</span> <span id="s887">The toilet was there but no one could go on the toilet.</span> <span id="s888">Because we were standing like this.</span> <span id="s889">People made in the pants, it was a stinking terrible thing.</span> <span id="s890">The windows were closed, the doors were closed...they couldn't get out, the doors was closed.</span> <span id="s891">They pressed the door on us.</span> <span id="s892">The Blockaltest you know.</span> <span id="s893">They pressed the door, it was so full packed, they could hardly close the door, on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q:It was the block elder who put you in here, the S.S. would not...they were also there.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A:This was their plan to do it.</span> <span id="s896">They didn't came in then.</span> <span id="s897">They couldn't come in.</span> <span id="s898">They had no room to go in there.</span> <span id="s899">This was weeks and weeks like this.</span> <span id="s900">Then my legs began to get wounds and start to...from those shoes.</span> <span id="s901">From those worn out shoes with those cleats.</span> <span id="s902">My feet began to get sore and I had big wounds on my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q:You were standing in this room?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q:From the time you got up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A:Yes, we eat our breakfast, our very generous breakfast, and then we had to go in there.</span> <span id="s907">That was the working hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q:That was how many hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A:Around eight hours or so.</span> <span id="s910">Until 5 o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s911">Five o'clock, and then they let us out, we could hardly walk, because we were standing.</span> <span id="s912">We were counted again.</span> <span id="s913">180 Jews angetreten zum [falling in] to Appell.</span> <span id="s914">Ten deaths laying next to us...ten dead.</span> <span id="s915">Naked.</span> <span id="s916">I don't tell you everything, don't think, if I can tell you everything, we stay here until tomorrow.</span> <span id="s917">I can't tell you everything.</span> <span id="s918">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s919">Then the war was against Norway.</span> <span id="s920">Yes, they conquered Norway, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s921">Norway's people are stark [strong] against S.S., against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s922">They started to do everything to boycott them, to hit the Germans where they could bring them in a fight, you know, [murder them].</span> <span id="s923">We got prisoners from Norway, because Norway they had an N and an O on the chest, next to their triangle.</span> <span id="s924">Then we saw many different kind of people from other countries.</span> <span id="s925">On the Platz [square] on the Grosseplatz...This counting was first only for the barracks.</span> <span id="s926">We saw nobody.</span> <span id="s927">Only we could

id="s932">In other barracks was maybe the same thing.</span> <span id="s933">This took long with those Mogen Do vids, maybe 100 people.</span> <span id="s934">A couple days.</span> <span id="s935">How can you sew with those wet fingers, you could hardly hold the needle in your hands, from the heat.</span> <span id="s936">So I became those wounds here in my leg.</span> <span id="s937">I can show you still those big knobs here on my leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q:You still have a big knob on your leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A:I don't know if you can see anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q:From the rubbing of the shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A:Yes, from the wounds on my legs.</span> <span id="s942">I don't know if you can see something.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q:Yes, I can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A:This was from here, till here.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q:The whole back of your heel.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Like a hand, so

much.</span> <span id="s950">Only this leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q:Was there any question about having it treated at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A:So we tried to go to the Revier.</span> <span id="s953">Revier is the hospital.</span> <span id="s954">Revier.</span> <span id="s955">The only thing what they could do to give us paper, bandages aus [of] paper, so they put paper bandages on...but nothing else.</span> <span id="s956">Not medicine or so nothing.</span> <span id="s957">So after those days in the toilet they was thinking to put the people who couldn't walkÑI couldn't walkÑput them outside, not direct outside the camp, it was still inside, aber [but] on a place where nobody came.</span> <span id="s958">From the whole camp it was...from the camp, the...the dirt, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s959">We have to lay there.</span> <span id="s960">No far from them, on the floor, and the big...Hitze [heat] the heat was terrible, it was already Summer, 1940.</span> <span id="s961">For the Polish prisoners...they were all free...there was nothing in Poland.</span> <span id="s962">They only worked a little bit, right?</span> <span id="s963">In Poland, the Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q:Were you able to talk to any of the prisoners from the other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A:No, impossible.</span> <span id="s966">Was not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q:Were you able to get any information as to what was going on outside this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A:Yes, a little, a little bit.</span> <span id="s969">What you hear from other prisoners, talking, you know.</span> <span id="s970">Yes, a little bit from the war going on, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q:That's how you got your information?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A:Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q:Were you able through that year to hear anything significant from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q:You got no mail at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A:Yes, I got mail, but they couldn't write either.</span> <span id="s977">When they wrote something what the S.S. didn't like, they made a big black stamp on it, CENSORED.</span> <span id="s978">A big stamp, CENSORED.</span> <span id="s979">So you couldn't read what they really wrote, what they didn't like.</span> <span id="s980">Every letter was censored.</span> <span id="s981">Refuse from the camp there was the refuse, was stapled [piled] on one place at the edge of the camp, and they put us there.</span> <span id="s982">Next to this.</span> <span id="s983">Hundreds and thousands of flies came, and the flies smelled our wounds, the pus, went insides and put their eggs up.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q:So this is lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A:No lice.</span> <span id="s986">Flies, the flies were flying and smelled our wounds and...</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q:And laid their eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A:And laid their eggs.</span> <span id="s989">The sun hit our legs and I had such a Blasen [blisters].</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Tape 2 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q:You were saying that the sun hit the wound on your leg...on your ankle...</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A:We became sunburned on parts of our body from the sun.</span> <span id="s993">We had big water Blasen [blisters] on the legs...water blisters aber [but] high up.</span> <span id="s994">Then suddenly we looked, worms, we had full with worms on our wound.</span> <span id="s995">The legs were full with worms, white worms, maybe an inch long.</span> <span id="s996">We had to put them down.</span> <span id="s997">But im Moment [at the moment] it felt not too bad, it was ekelich [disgusting], terrible feeling...but the worms eat the pus, they eat the pus from those sores, those wounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A:It was a good feeling, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q:So that they actually removed some of the pus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A:Yes they removed...they were actually living from those pus.</span> <span id="s1002">You were not a human being any more, you were like a piece of animal, without a brain, who couldn't think anymore...only the little thoughts were on this little bit food in the evening, what you get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q:You were still getting the same rations that you described before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1005">A piece of margarine, one pound margarine was parted in nine parts.</span> <span id="s1006">I'm not sure exactly, but I think it was nine parts.</span> <span id="s1007">It was like for every person, was a piece of margarine like my finger is to put on this bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q:Your thoughts then were of the food you described and of the watching the worms or the flies and the process of what was happening to your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A:This is what the S.S. wants from all those prisoners.</span> <span id="s1010">That they shouldn't think anymore.</span> <span id="s1011">They should only be like a piece of wood, you know, without brains.</span> <span id="s1012">Only to listen to the command.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q:Now you had been in the camp a year...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A:Less than a year.</span> <span id="s1015">When I just told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q:When you found that your brain was no longer working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A:Practically, practically not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q:It was a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A:Less than a year, less than a year.</span> <span id="s1020">It was June 1940.</span> <span id="s1021">We were thinking nothing.</span> <span id="s1022">You couldn't think anymore.</span> <span id="s1023">You were like a piece of animal, what has to go in Reihe und Glied [rank and file].</span> <span id="s1024">If you go one Schritt [step] out, right away, they hit you, they shoot at you, the S.S.</span> <span id="s1025">As a matter of fact, when we marched to work, when we were marching they took our camps away from us and throw them to the electric wires.</span> <span id="s1026">Then they said, "Jude, go pick up your caps."</span> <span id="s1027">They took our caps and threw them there.</span> <span id="s1028">The poor Jew went to pick up his cap, and from the watchdogs they shoot him.</span> <span id="s1029">Because they said he wants to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q:Was there anyone at this time, Mr. Kupferberg, who tried to escape, who did so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A:Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q:Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A:Then we were counted.</span> <span id="s1034">One prisoner was missing.</span> <span id="s1035">They had genau [exactly] the number, how many prisoners were there.</span> <span id="s1036">And when the Appell, the count, came, and one prisoner was missing, they let us stay on the big place, the whole camp.</span> <span id="s1037">Every barrack extra, every barrack fŸ rsich [separately].</span> <span id="s1038">And this took sometimes a whole night till they found this prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q:And then what would they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A:Entweder [either] the prisoner was hiding in the camp somewhere, so then they killed him.</span> <span id="s1041">We were staying the whole night on the Appell Platz...without food.</span> <span id="s1042">Then after the counting, all this, we go back to our barracks and became [got] our little bit water soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q:They would shoot the prisoner if...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A:This prisoner, they shoot.</span> <span id="s1045">If they find them outside, he came back as a piece of meat only.</span> <span id="s1046">A bloody mess of meat, you couldn't recognize him anymore.</span> <span id="s1047">Then the dogs were eating him.</span> <span id="s1048">If outside the camp, they let the dogs loose, and the dog find him, this prisoner, where he was sitting, hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q:So by the time he got back...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A:Then they brought him in on a stretcher and the whole camp had to march by this prisoner, to look at him.</span> <span id="s1051">They forced us to look at him.</span> <span id="s1052">On this piece of bloody mess, so zerfressen [eaten up] was he from the dogs.</span> <span id="s1053">Or they hanged him vor [in front of] the whole camp, on a gallow, they hung him up and the whole camp has to look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q:How often did that happen, how often do you think someone tried to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A:It happened every second day, maybe.</span> <span id="s1056">Some people had enough, entweder [either] outside the camp, like I said when he was working, and tried to hide somewhere to escape at night.</span> <span id="s1057">Daytime he wants to hide and the night he wants to run away.</span> <span id="s1058">But they catch them...nobody was running away.</span> <span id="s1059">Always they found him and when it was kilometers away from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q:Now during this time...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A:There was no Jew...it was always a goy that run away, not Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q:The Jews did not try to run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A:No, some Jews were very...got crazy.</span> <span id="s1064">They were thinking on their families, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q:When you say they got crazy, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A:They start to scream.</span> <span id="s1067">Loud scream like a crazy person.</span> <span id="s1068">We know why, because he was thinking of his wife and children.</span> <span id="s1069">What happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q:What would happen to him if he would scream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A:They hit him, and then when it got dark, he ran to the electric wires, to the barbed wire around the camp and touched the electric wire and he got electrocuted.</span> <span id="s1072">In the morning when we got up, we looked out the window we saw hanging people like spins, spins in a net, a spin, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1073">Hanging in the net, attached to this electric wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q:Like a moth or a butterfly...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A:Like a spin, spin net.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q:Oh, a spider web...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A:Yes, a spider web.</span> <span id="s1078">He was hanging like this in the wires.</span> <span id="s1079">Touched to the wires.</span> <span id="s1080">And they had to take off the power...the S.S. had to take off the power and then we had to take them down.</span> <span id="s1081">Everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q:Everyday, someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A:Everyday you saw, two or three, or four hanging in those wires.</span> <span id="s1084">People to do suicide and they run to the electric wires, got electrocuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q:Was there any group of people who carried on any prayers in the camp?</span> <span id="s1086">Was there any opportunity for religious...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A:No, no opportunity.</span> <span id="s1088">We were so busy to watch ourselves that we didn't get killed, that we had no prayers.</span> <span

month or date.</span> <span id="s1091">One of the Jews said tomorrow is Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1092">Some people start to cry and start davening.</span> <span id="s1093">When they were in our barracks, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q:What happened then?</span> <span id="s1095">You had talked about June of 1940, it was the point at which your feet were so infected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A:Full of those worms...what the flies put their eggs in you know.</span> <span id="s1097">But like I said, on one side, you feel Ekel [disgust], but the other you feel that the wounds start to hurt not so much anymore.</span> <span id="s1098">Those worms eat the pus from those sores.</span> <span id="s1099">In September 1939...</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q:You mean 1941...I'm sorry 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A:1940.</span> <span id="s1102">After I was a little bit less than a year there, September 1st or the 2nd, and on the 13th it would be a

<span id="s1109">Air came into two little windows on the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1110">With iron gates.</span> <span id="s1111">You couldn't get out, you know.</span> <span id="s1112">Those doors were closed...they didn't let us out when we wanted to go to the toilet, so we had to make in the cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q:Was there a guard with you on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A:No, no, maybe there were guards, but they were not on those cattle cars; there was no room for them.</span> <span id="s1115">They were in regular wagons, the guards.</span> <span

your food any better at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A:After a little while the wound started to heal.</span> <span id="s1154">Shortly before the wound started to heal, it was only like a quarter big, they threw us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q:They took you out of the infirmary, or hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A:Yes, the Fuss [foot] was still bandaged, but the

[penal] company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q:The Straf company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A:Straf Company...this is a certain type of group of people, of prisoners who were treated worse than the others...punished.</span> <span id="s1162">The whole camp has to work six days a week.</span> <span id="s1163">On Sunday, it was a day of rest.</span> <span id="s1164">We Jews had to work all seven days of the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q:This Straf company...what does that word mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A:Punishment...this is a group of people they were extra punished, because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s1167">We had to dig ditches outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1168">Dachau is a camp, what is outside filled with a big ditch with water.</span> <span id="s1169">First is there electric wire, then is a big deep ditch with water.</span> <span id="s1170">It's very deep, the water.</span> <span id="s1171">If you want to escape, you drowned in this water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q:Is that the ditch that you were digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A:No, no, this is only the situation what Dachau was.</span> <span id="s1174">Then you go outside the camp, you go over a little bridge, you saw the water ringsum [around] and then we walked on those fields outside Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q:Outside of Dachau, were there homes or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A:No, only fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q:Only fields.</span> <span id="s1178">As close as this was to Munich, this was empty farmland...</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A:This camp was isolated from houses...you saw nothing, only fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q:So there were not farmers...</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A:Far away you could see the Alps...from far away.</span> <span id="s1182">Dachau is 800 meters over the sea-level high.</span> <span id="s1183">We have to dig ditches.</span> <span id="s1184">Those ditches were for drainage for the fields to put water on the fields, and then they let the water through to those ditches.</span> <span id="s1185">And the water wasn't very high, maybe like this here.</span> <span id="s1186">So maybe two feet deep.</span> <span id="s1187">We have to dig ditches and till the ground with spades; put the spade in and till the ground.</span> <span id="s1188">We working in long rows one next to each other.</span> <span id="s1189">In the evening when we want to go march back to the barracks to the camp, the S.S. was standing there and threw many from us in those ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q:They threw some of you into those ditches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A:Yes, those prisoners.</span> <span id="s1192">And the water was only till here, so they struggled out of those ditches...and some of them they didn't let out.</span> <span id="s1193">They hit them when they struggled to come out.</span> <span id="s1194">They hit them with [not clear] over their heads, and they got unconscious when they were hit on the head and fell in this little bit of water and drowned.</span> <span id="s1195">That we saw everyday.</span> <span id="s1196">Everyday two or three or four of us, drowned in this water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q:Would they pick these people at random?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A:At random, they didn't like their faces, or what.</span> <span id="s1199">So one day one of the S.S. men called me, "Come here, you dirty Jew."</span> <span id="s1200">With his fist he hit me and I fell Kopf over [head first] into those water.</span> <span id="s1201">And I stumbled out, and he called me again.</span> <span id="s1202">I was standing to attention.</span> <span id="s1203">I was standing like this.</span> <span id="s1204">Wet, wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q:With your arms next to your side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A:And he give me again a hit with his fist, and again I fell into this ditch.</span> <span id="s1207">But he didn't hit me with a spade, not me.</span> <span id="s1208">When I came out of the water, and the Doberman dogs come on, it bit me in the legs, and I was standing with pain where the dogs bit me and then he said, "Back to work."</span> <span id="s1209">Nothing happened to me...only I had bleeding wounds from those dogs...and were wet.</span> <span id="s1210">And I was still working.</span> <span id="s1211">But many of my friends died this way.</span> <span id="s1212">In this little bit water, wouldn't let them get out, hit them on the heads with the iron parts of the shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q:When you were working in these fields, were you still in those German uniforms that you had been given in Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A:No, in Dachau we became [got] striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s1215">Blue and white striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s1216">Pants the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q:And also with stars, the same colors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A:With the stars on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A:I hope this tape is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q:I'm sure it will be.</span> <span id="s1221">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A:We worked seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1223">One day we had to go to the Appell Platz, the Platz where they count those prisoners.</span> <span id="s1224">All the prisoners were in there.</span> <span id="s1225">Everybody takes off their uniform, put them together in a nice bundle and put vor [in front of] your feet, they were saying there.</span> <span id="s1226">There is going to be a selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q:How long has this been since you arrived at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A:Maybe a couple of months later...maybe May, or April of 1941.</span> <span id="s1229">Suddenly we saw far away naked women running...it was far away, but I could see it was women, naked.</span> <span id="s1230">Running for the S.S....the S.S. was standing and they were running...was a selection of women...far away, of the same place, but far away.</span> <span id="s1231">I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1232">But we could see the naked women, and we were standing naked, for hours, and then the sun went away, and...it got cloudy, you know.</span> <span id="s1233">The sun hid under the clouds.</span> <span id="s1234">Under the clouds we start to freezing, you know.</span> <span id="s1235">When the sun was there we were happy, it was warm.</span> <span id="s1236">When the clouds came, the sun was hiding behind the clouds.</span> <span id="s1237">Hours and hours, we had to put on our clothes, and we had to go back to our barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q:You mean there was no selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A:Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1240">The S.S. saw us and said, "I don't want to see the dirt anymore.</span> <span id="s1241">I had enough of this dirt," so we heard him say this.</span> <span id="s1242">This is only a short episode.</span> <span id="s1243">The whole camp was filled with lice.</span> <span id="s1244">People came with the shirts from the wash barrack where they wash our laundry.</span> <span id="s1245">The shirts were still with little eggs from lice.</span> <span id="s1246">They came already infested with eggs from lice.</span> <span id="s1247">Clothing lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q:They washed your uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A:Yes, sure, once in a while...not the uniforms, only the shirts.</span> <span id="s1250">They became [got] every two weeks clean shirts...I told you before my English is not good...I am a tailor, a tailor has to work, not to talk, right?</span> <span id="s1251">I had to sew here in america.</span> <span id="s1252">When I was a salesman, I could learn easier English, but I wasn't.</span> <span id="s1253">So be became [got] lice.</span> <span id="s1254">Infested with lice.</span> <span id="s1255">The whole barracks were alive with lice.</span> <span id="s1256">My whole body, not only mine, all the others, were full from lice, we scratched, the nails, where we scratched.</span> <span id="s1257">After weeks and weeks when we were tortured with this lice, we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1258">In the evening after dinner we have to click the lice to kill them.</span> <span id="s1259">Big lice.</span> <span id="s1260">They took around two barracks for people were so infested with lice and the bodies were so scratched bloody, they took us, burned our prisoner clothing and put us in other barracks.</span> <span id="s1261">To heal us, or what, our bodies.</span> <span id="s1262">They put us on those straw, burlap bags with straw and we had to lay there a whole day, doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1263">Only like naked.</span> <span id="s1264">They give one to another shirt, I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1265">Every two or three days they came in, with some salve and we had to, a black salve, and put this on our bodies.</span> <span id="s1266">It smelled like tar, like tar.</span> <span id="s1267">We have to put this on our bodies...Food they only give us a piece of bread and water.</span> <span id="s1268">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q:That's all you had each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A:Each day, for eight days.</span> <span id="s1271">Bread and water.</span> <span id="s1272">They [punished us yet] because we had lice.</span> <span id="s1273">Our fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q:You were punished because you had lice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A:Yes, like, yes, yes, because of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q:Before that time you had gotten a little bit more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A:Yes, before we got regular prisoner food, with the water soup, you know.</span> <span id="s1278">Sometimes they called it like spinach, because there were green leaves in the water.</span> <span id="s1279">Never a piece of potato, except in the winter time.</span> <span id="s1280">They give us frozen potatoes.</span> <span id="s1281">Frozen.</span> <span id="s1282">The Schweine [pigs] what they didn't eat, they give it to us.</span> <span id="s1283">When they open up those Kessel [pots] where the food was, the smell was terrible, but we eat it, what could we do, we had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1284">We eat those frozen glass potatoes, like glass they were frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q:What were your barracks like in Dachau, as opposed to Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A:They're bigger barracks there.</span> <span id="s1287">The Jews were not mixed up with other pris oners.</span> <span id="s1288">Jews were in their own barracks.</span> <span id="s1289">Bigger barracks than in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1290">And they had one barracks was with Polish...with Catholic priests.</span> <span id="s1291">Young priests.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q:The whole barrack was filled with priests?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A:Yes, yes...with Catholic priests.</span> <span id="s1294">But they had it good.</span> <span id="s1295">They became [got] better food, they became [got] the food what the S.S. got, from outside the camp...and they treated them better, but they were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1296">Had their own church in their barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q:How long do you think these priests were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A:A certain time, maybe a year or...only in Dachau I saw this.</span> <span id="s1299">They had to exercise, they had to run like the soldiers run.</span> <span id="s1300">Some were looking good except they had no hair, like we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q:They were also in prison uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A:Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A:But you heard that they were Catholic priests?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A:Yes, they were Catholic priests, all of them, in the extra barracks.</span> <span id="s1305">They had a church, too, in the barrack, and better food, too.</span> <span id="s1306">They eat the same food that the S.S. soldiers were eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q:Was there any difference in Dachau as far as religion was concerned?</span> <span id="s1308">There still was no opportunity or...prayers going on privately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A:No, not at all, no religion.</span> <span id="s1310">Maybe privately, but not for us.</span> <span id="s1311">We worked seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1312">We were half dead when we came home from work.</span> <span id="s1313">And in the winter time the nose was running in the soup and we eat it.</span> <span id="s1314">The nose was running in the soup and we eat it.</span> <span id="s1315">The whole day sometimes you worked in the rain and came home in the barracks with your wet clothing and in the morning, after you slept you put on the wet clothing again.</span> <span id="s1316">There was no occasion to dry them, you know.</span> <span id="s1317">You put your wet clothing on and you worked again a whole day.</span> <span id="s1318">One day, I was working with prisoners digging the field.</span> <span id="s1319">Turning the dirt.</span> <span id="s1320">One of the posts, S.S. posts were watching us, called.</span> <span id="s1321">He called me.</span> <span id="s1322">With the finger.</span> <span id="s1323">I came near; he said not a word.</span> <span id="s1324">"Your number."</span> <span id="s1325">I showed him my num ber.</span> <span id="s1326">He wrote the number down.</span> <span id="s1327">I know I was maybe talking to mine neighbor, a couple of words, but I wasn't standing still and talk to him.</span> <span id="s1328">I worked, so I was working and talking, maybe bent my head...</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Tape 3 of 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q:You were telling me that you had been stopped for talking while you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A:Yes, I didn't know what it meant, but he wrote my number down.</span> <span id="s1332">In the evening, my number was called up and one of the S.S. men told me I was talking at work and I get dafŸ r [for that] punished, one hour hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q:One hour of hanging?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A:One hour of hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q:What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A:They put me with hands on the back.</span> <span id="s1337">Hands have to be like this.</span> <span id="s1338">Crossed behind your back.</span> <span id="s1339">Then they put a chain around the hands and around the wrists and I had to stand up off a little step-ladder, had to step on top of this, and he put, in the air was a big Balken [beam] with a ring and the end of the chain came through this ring, you put the chain from my hands, a round chain, through this ring and tighten it, then he throwed, with the foot, he throw the little step-ladder away and I started to hang like this.</span> <span id="s1340">The hands go up higher and higher till you were hanging like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q:You were bent over and your hands were behind your back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A:Behind your back and hanging in the air, around two feet from the floor.</span> <span id="s1343">Two or three feet from the floor.</span> <span id="s1344">This was a whole row with prisoners.</span> <span id="s1345">Not only me.</span> <span id="s1346">And they had maybe 30 or 20 prisoners that they hanged at the same time.</span> <span id="s1347">The S.S. was sitting across from us playing cards, with their watch on the table so they see when our time was up to take us down.</span> <span id="s1348">The pain is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1349">The pain.</span> <span id="s1350">The shoulder...socket go out.</span> <span id="s1351">And you were hanging there...And the Schweiss [sweat] is the right word?</span> <span id="s1352">When you perspire for...Angst [fear] you think you have to die.</span> <span id="s1353">Your feeling...you get wet, your body is perspired.</span> <span id="s1354">The drops fell down from your face on your chest.</span> <span id="s1355">And the pains [unbearable].</span> <span id="s1356">You can't stand it.</span> <span id="s1357">And people start to scream.</span> <span id="s1358">In different kinds of languages.</span> <span id="s1359">"Momma, mia," and the Polish in Polish...[started to scream].</span> <span id="s1360">I wasn't screaming, I was seeing what they do.</span> <span id="s1361">The S.S. come to those prisoners who was screaming and with their feet, they were kicking them so that they were swinging on their chains through the air.</span> <span id="s1362">And the pain was worser then.</span> <span id="s1363">So I see what they did to them, I want to scream too.</span> <span id="s1364">"Let me out, let me out of here, let me go."</span> <span id="s1365">But I see they did to the other.</span> <span id="s1366">Then you see, this is like eternity, one hour, to hang like this.</span> <span id="s1367">And then to see [how] the prisoners who helps themÑthe S.S. comes on with this little step-ladder and put it under every prisoner's feet so that he could setp on it and then he opened the chain and let them down.</span> <span id="s1368">Until he comes to you, you feel like...this waiting till they let you go down, is terrible.</span> <span id="s1369">So they let you down and you're sitting there with the hands like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q:Behind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A:Behind me, but then it is impossible to take the hands to the front.</span> <span id="s1372">They are like a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s1373">The hands were like without life, the arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q:Even though the chains had been removed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1376">The hands are still there like this, and so we marched to our barracks like this, we tried to take the hands to the front but we couldn't.</span> <span id="s1377">We march to our barracks and the [fellow] prisoners massaged the arms and they slowly came a little bit alive again.</span> <span id="s1378">Slowly we could move the arms to the front again.</span> <span id="s1379">This was number one.</span> <span id="s1380">And I had the pleasure to hang twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q:What was the other offense for which...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A:The other offense was they said the prisoners...we were working, we should [report] for a certain work.</span> <span id="s1383">And I went, on the [not clear] the German, I went, and some wouldn't work, wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s1384">So they forced them.</span> <span id="s1385">And when they had a bundle of people together they said, "We'll show you.</span> <span id="s1386">You don't want to work."</span> <span id="s1387">I said, "Sure we want to work.</span> <span id="s1388">I am one of the first that said I want to go.</span> <span id="s1389">[He wrote everyone downÑall the numbers.]</span> <span id="s1390">One hour hanging.</span> <span id="s1391">But this second time I had an easier feeling, because I know how this tastes...how this hanging felt.</span> <span id="s1392">When you know what happened to you, when you know, you feel different.</span> <span id="s1393">If you don't know your feelings is another thing, is another one, if you know what happens to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q:You were not quite as afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A:Yes, that is what I mean.</span> <span id="s1396">I wasn't so quite afraid anymore.</span> <span id="s1397">I know about what I went through the experience once, so I was thinking, "O.K., what can you do?"</span> <span id="s1398">They treat you like a prisoner, you come vor [before] S.S. men, higher S.S. men, ReichsfŸ hrer Himmler, you are sentenced to hang, one hour on a chain in the air because you did this, [refused] to work.</span> <span id="s1399">Nothing you could do, nothing.</span> <span id="s1400">Many of my friends hanged once, but I was hanging twice.</span> <span id="s1401">And, we were lucky, because before this whole thing was, they were hanging the people outside the camp on the wood...on the trees.</span> <span id="s1402">There were nails in the trees and they hanged the prisoners there in the woods.</span> <span id="s1403">Most of them came never back.</span> <span id="s1404">They killed them [or what].</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q:Why did those prisoners not last through the hanging in the woods?</span> <span id="s1406">They would kill them afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A:Then they killed them.</span> <span id="s1408">They were screaming.</span> <span id="s1409">Was nobody there for a witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q:But when they did it in the camp...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A:In the camp we were in the Badeanstalt [baths]...in a big hole where we came in the showers.</span> <span id="s1412">In the showers was a big Balken [beam] across the hall, you know, what keeps the roof, a beam, a big beam, with rings [through] where the chain came [through].</span> <span id="s1413">It was a long row with maybe 30 little rings, in those beams, and we were hanging all this in a row, maybe 20, 25 or 30 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q:So you think that because it was done in this room that there were witnesses, and therefore, the men were not killed, as well as hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1416">Then they never came back, many from usÑthis was before my time.</span> <span id="s1417">Before I had this experience.</span> <span id="s1418">There were men sentenced to hang.</span> <span id="s1419">They went away and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1420">They never came back to our barracks.</span> <span id="s1421">And some prisoners...fro perspiring, they were wet and the cold wind hit them...they got pneumonia, they say, from the wet perspiration, and they hanging one hour...and the cold wind hit them.</span> <span id="s1422">Understand Dachau is 800 meters up over sea-level...When there is a wind, there is a wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q:What happened with your shoulders after these episodes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A:The [fellow] prisoners make massaging our arms, our shoulders in the barracks...</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q:The massaging got the arms back in the socket?</span> <span id="s1426">In your shoulder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1428">Then I know exactly, after maybe an hour or two, the life starts to come and again you feel the blood in the arms and you could move your arms slowly [again] and bring them to the front.</span> <span id="s1429">You could raise the arms, not much, but you could, your arms could come from the back to the front again.</span> <span id="s1430">Slowly after a long while, there came life again in the shoulders.</span> <span id="s1431">You were normal again.</span> <span id="s1432">Only you saw those big cut-ins from those chains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q:The scars around your wrists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A:The scars, deep scars insides...Suddenly, they put us on trains and sent about 400 of us Jews back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1435">Not back to Buchenwald, not back to Sachsen hausen, to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q:When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A:This was after I was a year-and-a-half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q:This was in September...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A:In September '41, no wait a minute, in September '41 I came to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1440">It was fast [almost] a year there in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q:Why do you think they moved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s1443">Day to day, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1444">Why they took me for medical experiments on my body in Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1445">Why Mengele was sitting on the desk and made a selection from us from Dachau when we came to Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1446">Only he made to me like this, and to others he made this.</span> <span id="s1447">One, this was for life, this was for death.</span> <span id="s1448">I don't know till today, why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q:Selection at Buchenwald happened right away, as soon as you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A:Maybe a week later.</span> <span id="s1451">Mr. Mengele, you heard of him, came to Buchenwald and gave a Gastspielrolle [star performance] and he was selecting us prisoners.</span> <span id="s1452">We came from Dachau.</span> <span id="s1453">The whole this is this.</span> <span id="s1454">When Auschwitz with those gas chambers, were ready to mein [my] time when I was an invalid in 1940, they would have sent us right away to Auschwitz to gas.</span> <span id="s1455">[But] Auschwitz wasn't ready in 1940.</span> <span id="s1456">And in 1941 it [just] started, so they sent us to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1457">[Lies on] a hill.</span> <span id="s1458">The [not clear] barrack, it was called.</span> <span id="s1459">And Buchenwald lies not far from Weimar.</span> <span id="s1460">The city Weimar.</span> <span id="s1461">Weimar is the city from those gross, gross German, big Germans, Dichters, poets.</span> <span id="s1462">Goethe, you heard from Goethe, Schiller, they were living there.</span> <span id="s1463">In Weimar, not to this time, maybe 100 years before and this was Buchenwald, next to Weimar.</span> <span id="s1464">We had to run up to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1465">They hit us, too.</span> <span id="s1466">When I came to Buchenwald, my legs were like elephant legs.</span> <span id="s1467">Full with water [to my belly].</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q:Your stomach also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A:No, [till] here.</span> <span id="s1470">Entire legs were swollen up with water.</span> <span id="s1471">Like this.</span> <span id="s1472">After the [not clear], Mr. Mengele cameÑI didn't know thenÑafterwards I knowÑand we came in in groups of about 100 in a big room.</span> <span id="s1473">He was sitting on a desk with legs down with his white coat, like the doctors have, and under were his boots sticking out.</span> <span id="s1474">And one after the other has to come vor [before] him, not so near, around like this, we have to stand at attention.</span> <span id="s1475">He looked only at your face.</span> <span id="s1476">He looked only at your face, not at your body.</span> <span id="s1477">He looked you straight in the eyes, and he didn't talk.</span> <span id="s1478">He made only a wave with the hand, like this, or this, this or this.</span> <span id="s1479">So suddenly we were in two groups: one group was in this corner, and one group was in the other corner.</span> <span id="s1480">And we looked at each other.</span> <span id="s1481">We didn't know what that means.</span> <span id="s1482">Then suddenly they took this group across from us where we were standing, they took this group away...the other group.</span> <span id="s1483">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1484">A couple of my best friends were [there].</span> <span id="s1485">And we could go back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q:And you did not know at that point what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A:No, no, we didn't.</span> <span id="s1488">Not only to me, to me, not only to me, if I talk I talk not only for me for other prisoners too.</span> <span id="s1489">This way...</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q:To the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A:To the right.</span> <span id="s1492">This to the left, means dead.</span> <span id="s1493">You know, they killed them very easily.</span> <span id="s1494">They put a needle with air in their veins.</span> <span id="s1495">And they died instantly on the emboli, you know the air goes to the heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q:How did you find out that's what they did to the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A:Later on, I find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q:After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A:Not after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q:While you were still in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A:In the camp, heard it from these personnel, were prisoners, too.</span> <span id="s1502">Sanita tion...some of these prisoners were working in the hospitals...they told.</span> <span id="s1503">They talked.</span> <span id="s1504">All this goings on news from prisoner to prisoner.</span> <span id="s1505">From ear to ear, from mouth to mouth.</span> <span id="s1506">In Buchenwald I worked, I schlepped trees.</span> <span id="s1507">I schlepped trees.</span> <span id="s1508">You know what schlepped means in English?</span> <span id="s1509">Carrying trees.</span> <span id="s1510">Two prisoners, one tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q:You cut them down or you just...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s1513">They were cut down.</span> <span id="s1514">They were laying in the woods in a place where no trees were; they were laid out, so [thrown about].</span> <span id="s1515">This were [only] Jews did that, only Jews.</span> <span id="s1516">And I remember this was the first Christmas Day 1941.</span> <span id="s1517">I was there only a couple months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q:In Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A:In Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1520">We had to go out...the whole camp has holiday.</span> <span id="s1521">The Jews had to go out carrying trees.</span> <span id="s1522">And when you came to those trees, the S.S. was hitting you.</span> <span id="s1523">It has to go fast because they want to have their holidays.</span> <span id="s1524">They don't want to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1525">We had to go fast.</span> <span id="s1526">Take a tree, you can't select the tree.</span> <span id="s1527">You have to take the first best tree, put them on the shoulder, one man in the front, one man on the back and we have to bring them somewhere else, maybe 500 meters far away to another place, and throw them down.</span> <span id="s1528">Crazy things.</span> <span id="s1529">After the fourth round, we got both a tree and this was to our luck was a small tree.</span> <span id="s1530">Not a thick tree.</span> <span id="s1531">Because they hit us, we have to grab the first tree we could take, we select.</span> <span id="s1532">Ahhh, one of the S.S. men on the way to carry the trees saw us.</span> <span id="s1533">"Throw the tree away.</span> <span id="s1534">Come here.</span> <span id="s1535">You Jew, you dirty Jew, take a small tree, ehh?"</span> <span id="s1536">and with a leather glove his fist hit me in the mouth.</span> <span id="s1537">And the blood was coming all over me.</span> <span id="s1538">I was full with blood.</span> <span id="s1539">And I felt that all my teeth upstairs were loose.</span> <span id="s1540">I was working schlepping trees and the blood was coming down on me.</span> <span id="s1541">My whole uniform was full with blood.</span> <span id="s1542">I came back to the barracks and they saw me with the blood.</span> <span id="s1543">"What happened?</span> <span id="s1544">What happened?"</span> <span id="s1545">I told them.</span> <span id="s1546">They put me down to the Revier...the hospital barrack.</span> <span id="s1547">And the doctor was to open my mouth and said the teeth has to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q:Your teeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A:Yes, they couldn't grow anymore.</span> <span id="s1550">They took the teeth out.</span> <span id="s1551">All the teeth up front here, five or six teeth here...What happened then?</span> <span id="s1552">Then come the Russian prisoners in the camp.</span> <span id="s1553">They had so much Russian prisoners, they put them next to our camp, that they could see each other.</span> <span id="s1554">What they did to them was only that they didn't give them food, those prisoners, those Russian prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q:They didn't give them food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A:No, they let them stay outside.</span> <span id="s1557">In the [not clear] in the snow in the rain.</span> <span id="s1558">No barracks, they let them stay outside there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q:These were Russian...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A:These were Russian war prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q:These were Jews...or were they soldiers...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A:No, no, not Jews, in uniform.</span> <span id="s1563">In the Russian uniform [there were Jews, too.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q:Prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A:Prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1566">And we at night time took a piece of bread from our mouths, saved up a piece of bread and threw it over to the other side.</span> <span id="s1567">And gave them a little bit from our bread.</span> <span id="s1568">and then the S.S. saw this.</span> <span id="s1569">And the whole camp, three days no bread.</span> <span id="s1570">[For] punishment...why we fed the Russians.</span> <span id="s1571">Three days no bread [that went] on and on, three days no bread, two days no bread, one day no bread.</span> <span id="s1572">Every week was something, because they saw that we sympathized with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1573">Then one day it came a Befehl [order] the Jews who wants to learn to be a mason.</span> <span id="s1574">Know a mason, a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s1575">Should keep their hands up.</span> <span id="s1576">I keep up my hands.</span> <span id="s1577">I wasn't afraid for work, but of course I am a worker.</span> <span id="s1578">Put up my hands, and around 200 were selected, what they said they want to be masons and the rest of the whole camp, all the Jewish prisoners, who didn't raise their hands, they sent away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1579">In the whole camp, there are 200 Jewish prisoners left, who want to learn to be masons, bricklayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q:Two hundred out of how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A:There were four Jewish barracks in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1582">Around 800 Jewish pris oners.</span> <span id="s1583">Two hundred left because they said they want to be...they selected from us 200.</span> <span id="s1584">They went around, the S.S. and when they didn't like your face, "Come here, you're too old, you are too old to learn."</span> <span id="s1585">Out...all went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1586">Many died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1587">So I learned bricklayer, to be a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s1588">I felt very good.</span> <span id="s1589">They give us a little bit more to eat, food, only soup they give us, more, no bread, soup, two...cups.</span> <span id="s1590">And we learned to be a mason outside the camp, to build houses.</span> <span id="s1591">We built factories outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1592">Maybe a kilometer from the camp.</span> <span id="s1593">Every morning we have to go marching through the gates, you know, and the Kapo said, "Two hundred Juden Schweine [Jewish pigs]...[march].</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q:In the area where Buchenwald was located, did you have to go through a populated area to get to this location?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A:Yes, when we came from the station, from the railroad station, and march to the camp, there were people looking at us out the windows.</span> <span id="s1596">But they didn't say nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q:And what about when you went to work, when you were building this factory?</span> <span id="s1598">Did you have to do...</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A:No, nothing to do with civilian...it was still within in the camp wooded area.</span> <span id="s1600">Yes, we built big factories there.</span> <span id="s1601">Not high, only one story high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q:What kind of factories do you think these were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A:First we didn't know for what it is, but later they built war material [muni tions] rifles, [very modern] rifles, so stuff like this.</span> <span id="s1604">But not Jewish prisoners work there, only goyim, only Christian.</span> <span id="s1605">Jewish prisoners say they didn't want to do this.</span> <span id="s1606">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1607">And the S.S. went around and around and tried to hit us.</span> <span id="s1608">The Kapo...you know what a Kapo is?</span> <span id="s1609">The Vorarbeiter...foreman was a nice goy.</span> <span id="s1610">A nice human man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q:Your Kapo was nice...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A:There was a Maurermeister, a master of bricklayers.</span> <span id="s1613">He could learn us, because he know this work.</span> <span id="s1614">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1615">He watched over us.</span> <span id="s1616">[So the S.S. would leave us alone].</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q:The S.S. were not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A:Yes, yes, sure it was outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1619">They were always running around looking for people so they can kill them, or hit them.</span> <span id="s1620">But they saw us working.</span> <span id="s1621">We worked, we mixed the mortar, and you know, learned to do this, how to mix the mortar with sand and with water, how to lay the bricks and to watch them that they're straight with a..</span> <span id="s1622">.</span> <span id="s1623">You look up to see your building straight.</span> <span id="s1624">This way or this way.</span> <span id="s1625">Level.</span> <span id="s1626">Then lines were put so you can see [if] your work is straight.</span> <span id="s1627">You feel good, you know, because you felt like more like a human being.</span> <span id="s1628">You do something.</span> <span id="s1629">No crazy work [like] in Sachsen hausen where you had to put the jacket [backwards] with the sleeves the front or the back here and the buttons in the back and we had to take up the piece of jacket.</span> <span id="s1630">So like this, should be...and another prisoner puts sand in your lap.</span> <span id="s1631">And you have to keep it like this.</span> <span id="s1632">To hold and run from one place to another.</span> <span id="s1633">Senseless work, without sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q:In Sachsenhausen you were carrying sand in the jackets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A:Sand in the jacket, and the buttons were in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q:Yes, made like an apron?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A:An apron, yes.</span> <span id="s1638">And you have to run and put it on another heap.</span> <span id="s1639">Only to make us busy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q:You did that before your leg became infested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A:Yes, yes...I can't tell you every little thing, this is impossible.</span> <span id="s1642">It would take two days to sit here.</span> <span id="s1643">And they put a blind, a blindfold on us, when you're running you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s1644">You fell over the S.S. man's leg.</span> <span id="s1645">And you lost the sand.</span> <span id="s1646">"You dirty Jew, you lost the material.</span> <span id="s1647">This is expensive material."</span> <span id="s1648">And they hit them.</span> <span id="s1649">In Buchenwald, I learned to be a mason.</span> <span id="s1650">Another miracle comes now.</span> <span id="s1651">We were building a higher building, we were up in the air, to build the walls higher.</span> <span id="s1652">Was all trees, then planks where we could put our mortar things, and we were building, high up in the air.</span> <span id="s1653">And one day the whole thing fell off, fell together.</span> <span id="s1654">It collapsed.</span> <span id="s1655">It wasn't built right.</span> <span id="s1656">And I fell like this high up in the air, and certainly like a hand, keeps me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Tape 3 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q:The scaffolding had collapsed...</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A:Scaffolding, I forget those words, scaffolding collapsed and everybody was falling down with the [not clear] bricks, the mortar fell down.</span> <span id="s1660">It wasn't very high, around 10 meters, 10 meter high in the air.</span> <span id="s1661">Not too bad, but you hurt yourself when you fell down, believe me!</span> <span id="s1662">Suddenly, I was hanging in the air.</span> <span id="s1663">I think, "My God, what's this?"</span> <span id="s1664">You hang.</span> <span id="s1665">My jacket was...the tree was through my jacket and keep me from falling down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q:A tree limb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A:A tree limb, yes.</span> <span id="s1668">This scaffolding was aus [from] trees and then there were square pieces of wood, and then a piece of wood where you can stand on, you know.</span> <span id="s1669">This collapsed.</span> <span id="s1670">I got saved from this.</span> <span id="s1671">I tell you, this is all my life.</span> <span id="s1672">Little miracles.</span> <span id="s1673">Saved me six years and I came out alive.</span> <span id="s1674">So we built those factories that made a lot of material for the war and I think lots of sabotage, we heard from the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q:You heard from the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A:From the prisoners...they work outside, in those factories what we build.</span> <span id="s1677">They made sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q:Now these were not Jewish prisoners?</span> <span id="s1679">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A:No goyish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q:They were sabotaging the...war materials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A:The Communists, a lot of Communists in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q:The Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A:The Communist prisoners.</span> <span id="s1685">Germans.</span> <span id="s1686">They made big sabotage [you can't im a gine].</span> <span id="s1687">One morning, this was January 5, not morning.</span> <span id="s1688">We came back from work, to the barracks back.</span> <span id="s1689">We eat [a wonderful] dinner.</span> <span id="s1690">Was only one Gang [course], not three GŠ nge [courses], [no soup, meat] only one Gang.</span> <span id="s1691">Suddenly my number come through the loud speaker.</span> <span id="s1692">Every barrack had a loud speaker.</span> <span id="s1693">To give the orders, the S.S....my number, and another man's number comes out.</span> <span id="s1694">[immediately to the Revier [hospital]] The [block supervisor] had to bring us [to the] Revier.</span> <span id="s1695">In Buchenwald they were Jewish bar r acks and the Blockalteste was a Jew, too.</span> <span id="s1696">They are a political prisoner, not a criminal.</span> <span id="s1697">There were criminal Jews, too, there.</span> <span id="s1698">Not in my barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q:This was in January of 1942.</span> <span id="s1700">The first January that you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A:1942, now wait a minute, wait a minute it was maybe '43.</span> <span id="s1702">Exactly I can't tell you...after so many years...</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q:Yes, it's hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A:The dates get mixed up.</span> <span id="s1705">I know it was January 5...I think it was '43.</span> <span id="s1706">January, '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q:In other words, you had been in Buchenwald for over a year when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A:From September 1942 to...a year-and-a-half, like.</span> <span id="s1709">A year-and-a-half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A:So it was '43.</span> <span id="s1712">It was '43.</span> <span id="s1713">It was the worst winter.</span> <span id="s1714">The worst winter was this, '43.</span> <span id="s1715">The Blockalteste brought us down [to the] Revier, this hospital complex, and he told us, "You have to stay here, you can't go back to your barracks.</span> <span id="s1716">We gonna make experiments on you.</span> <span id="s1717">Medical experiments on you."</span> <span id="s1718">And I [not clear].</span> <span id="s1719">What is this?</span> <span id="s1720">So they put us in an extra barrack, was still in the camp but isolated from the other barracks.</span> <span id="s1721">Extra wire around.</span> <span id="s1722">And they told us they want to make experiments on us, because there is an order from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1723">They want to make us sick with a certain type of sickness and when we get healed from this sickness...this is right?</span> <span id="s1724">...they gonna take our blood out from us and give our blood to the soldiers on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1725">Then the soldiers on the Russian front, German soldiers, died like flies there, on Flecktyphus [spotted fever].</span> <span id="s1726">They got infested with lice and the lice produced this sickness...the Flecktyphus.</span> <span id="s1727">And they want to save their soldiers; many died there, and they want to make experiment with us prisoners and when we get through the sickness, our blood is then immune from this sickness, take our blood and give it to the Russians, on the Russian front to the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1728">And to save them.</span> <span id="s1729">They first treat us very nicely, each one had a bed, like in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1730">Give us better food...not better food, more food, than the rest of the camp.</span> <span id="s1731">And outside we saw through the windows in the snow and cold, the prisoners fall like the flies.</span> <span id="s1732">The prisoners died from the cold.</span> <span id="s1733">The work was always outside, most of the work outside.</span> <span id="s1734">And we were warm, we were warm.</span> <span id="s1735">The barracks were warm, heated, and we came more food.</span> <span id="s1736">They wanted to make us a little bit stronger so that we could stand the sickness that they gonna put in us.</span> <span id="s1737">Around a month later, they put the sickness in our bodies.</span> <span id="s1738">The camp doctor, Dr. Dink, his name...</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q:Dr. Dink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A:Dr. Ding, that was his name.</span> <span id="s1741">D-I-N-G.</span> <span id="s1742">ObersturmbandfŸ hrer, three stars, or four stars.</span> <span id="s1743">He [vaccinated] us.</span> <span id="s1744">No, not with a needle, with a knife.</span> <span id="s1745">He put a scalpel in, [this little container, with the sickness] cut with the scalpel four times under the skin.</span> <span id="s1746">Cut it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q:And the typhus he got from a..</span> <span id="s1748">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A:From a little [container], terrible looking things.</span> <span id="s1750">Not a solution...like, like meat [rotten meat, or what].</span> <span id="s1751">[It didn't even smell.]</span> <span id="s1752">And when he came to me his scalpel fell out of his hand.</span> <span id="s1753">And he said, "Now I'm going to put gloves on."</span> <span id="s1754">He had no gloves.</span> <span id="s1755">Afterwards we never saw him back again.</span> <span id="s1756">Maybe [he infected himself] with the solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q:Maybe he got some on his own hands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A:Yes, on his hand, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q:Now this doctor put the solution on all of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A:On all of the prisoners...we were not all Jews.</span> <span id="s1761">We were about a quarter Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q:About how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A:About 150 men, people.</span> <span id="s1764">The Jews were by themselves again, the Jews were extra, always extra...not with the others together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q:Now this was about February of 1943, then, about a month later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A:Around a month later, yes...February.</span> <span id="s1767">I think it was 1943.</span> <span id="s1768">Then they put bandages over those injections, those holes, you know, that we shouldn't come with our fingers, touch it or scratch it.</span> <span id="s1769">After nine days, everybody got sick.</span> <span id="s1770">Really exactly nine days.</span> <span id="s1771">One hour earlier, one hour later, but we all got sick after nine days.</span> <span id="s1772">Terrible headache, high fever, around, what you say, the highest fever is here is maybe 104¡ or 105¡ ?</span> <span id="s1773">So high fever.</span> <span id="s1774">The body swells and start to became spots.</span> <span id="s1775">This is the spotted fever, the Flecktyphus.</span> <span id="s1776">And we were laying in our beds like half dead.</span> <span id="s1777">Pain was terrible, the headache, and some sanitation prisoners put cold compresses on our heads.</span> <span id="s1778">They treat us very nice.</span> <span id="s1779">They couldn't do much but they put cold compresses on our heads.</span> <span id="s1780">They came different kinds of medicine we have to swallow.</span> <span id="s1781">Different kinds of tablets.</span> <span id="s1782">Then needles, different kinds of needles and injections.</span> <span id="s1783">But the fever was so high that many of those prisoners couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s1784">The heart went out.</span> <span id="s1785">Died.</span> <span id="s1786">I lived through it.</span> <span id="s1787">After two weeks, the headache went down and I was all right again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q:Did you have any idea when they called you, what you were in for?</span> <span id="s1789">With these experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A:In the moment not, moment not.</span> <span id="s1791">When they come down and said they were going to make experiments on our body, we feel very bad, we were thinking we are like rats now, [or] mice or guinea pigs like.</span> <span id="s1792">We were thinking we never come out alive from it.</span> <span id="s1793">What could we do?</span> <span id="s1794">You are in their hands.</span> <span id="s1795">Why me, why my number?</span> <span id="s1796">Hundred, [hun dred-eighty] people in the barrack, why my name?</span> <span id="s1797">Why my number?</span> <span id="s1798">Until today, I like to know why.</span> <span id="s1799">Why me?</span> <span id="s1800">My other friend got a cold the first night.</span> <span id="s1801">We were in a cold house.</span> <span id="s1802">Ice cold.</span> <span id="s1803">We had nothing to cover.</span> <span id="s1804">Was not organized right away, you know.</span> <span id="s1805">It was a very ice cold house, many got a bad cold.</span> <span id="s1806">They throw them out.</span> <span id="s1807">People with a cold, they didn't take.</span> <span id="s1808">Throw them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q:How long did you have typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A:The sickness around was two weeks long.</span> <span id="s1811">The high fever and the doctors came from all over and civil [civilian] doctors and studied on us, from Berlin, from all over.</span> <span id="s1812">Fat big, big men with white [not clear], you know, we had to turn, and they looked at us, everybody from back to back, they went.</span> <span id="s1813">They looked at those spots.</span> <span id="s1814">I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1815">Among themselves they talked but I couldn't because I was terrible sick.</span> <span id="s1816">After fourteen days the fever went away a little bit, one day after the other.</span> <span id="s1817">It was everything normal.</span> <span id="s1818">They made different kind of experiments.</span> <span id="s1819">They took out of the spine, they put a needle in the spine, and took out fluid from the spine.</span> <span id="s1820">Took out.</span> <span id="s1821">I had the feeling that they took something out, not they put something in but they took something out.</span> <span id="s1822">And many different kinds of medicine it was.</span> <span id="s1823">And then we were sitting there till the end of May.</span> <span id="s1824">and they threw us suddenly out.</span> <span id="s1825">The Jews.</span> <span id="s1826">I know why.</span> <span id="s1827">They said, "Why should we take the Jews' blood and give this to our Aryan soldiers?"</span> <span id="s1828">You understand?</span> <span id="s1829">Our blood was [worthless] to them.</span> <span id="s1830">Jewish blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q:Did they ever take your blood to be used before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A:No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q:They never did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A:Never did.</span> <span id="s1835">They made us immune to this sickness, to the typhus.</span> <span id="s1836">But they didn't take the end result.</span> <span id="s1837">They said we can't take the Jewish blood and give it to our Aryan Christian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q:So all that they ended up doing was extracting the fluid from your spinal column?</span> <span id="s1839">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A:As I tell you, different kinds of medicine they put in us.</span> <span id="s1841">Different kind.</span> <span id="s1842">Every day they give us another needle, or another injection, another medicines.</span> <span id="s1843">A little bit I forget already...already so many years back.</span> <span id="s1844">They throw all the Jewish prisoners out.</span> <span id="s1845">I was there around five months.</span> <span id="s1846">From January till May.</span> <span id="s1847">And then we came from out of this barrack and the other prisoners looked at us.</span> <span id="s1848">We had such a heads.</span> <span id="s1849">We looked like we came from the moon, like from another planet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q:Your heads were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A:Were swollen, our bodies...we had no exercise.</span> <span id="s1852">Never went out of the barracks, never in fresh air.</span> <span id="s1853">We always had to sit around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q:How many of you do you think survived those experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A:Only a couple.</span> <span id="s1856">A handful, maybe.</span> <span id="s1857">I don't know what happened to the other prisoners, I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s1858">To the Christian prisoners, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1859">We saw them at night when they took out the dead.</span> <span id="s1860">At the night they took out the dead.</span> <span id="s1861">We looked out the window so nobody should see us.</span> <span id="s1862">So when they saw us coming across the barracks, they shake their heads.</span> <span id="s1863">[And as] punishment, that we were so [fat and full] from the food.</span> <span id="s1864">You know, like you give us every day double rations of this Wasser [water]-food, you get swollen, you know.</span> <span id="s1865">They put us in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1866">Buchenwald has a big quarry.</span> <span id="s1867">You know what a quarry is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A:Goes deep down and they break stones loose, and you, a prisoner, has to carry them [on] the shoulder up out of the quarry and put them somewhere on a place.</span> <span id="s1870">They put us all in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1871">And most of us died there.</span> <span id="s1872">Carrying the heavy stones, they couldn't work fast, the S.S. hit them on the legs, so they should fall over their legs.</span> <span id="s1873">They have to carry those stones up.</span> <span id="s1874">The stones were so heavy.</span> <span id="s1875">My leg broke open again.</span> <span id="s1876">My foot.</span> <span id="s1877">The old, old sores.</span> <span id="s1878">Broke open again and started to bleed like hell.</span> <span id="s1879">And I shout this to my foreman.</span> <span id="s1880">"Look, look, my leg, I can't walk anymore."</span> <span id="s1881">...The blood is coming out like hell and I showed him my leg and he was nice to me.</span> <span id="s1882">He sent me out of the quarry.</span> <span id="s1883">"I can't do this work," he said.</span> <span id="s1884">He sent me out.</span> <span id="s1885">Me, and maybe two or three others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q:How long were you there when you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A:I was only three days there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q:Just three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A:When my leg broke open.</span> <span id="s1890">Why I wasn't used to walk, anyhow, then we were sitting around for five months.</span> <span id="s1891">Sleeping, eating or sitting.</span> <span id="s1892">We never came out of those isolation barracks, those experiment barracks.</span> <span id="s1893">He let me go out.</span> <span id="s1894">I came to the hospital with this open leg and they treated me nice, again, put me in the bed with the leg up in the air and after two weeks, it starts to get smaller and smaller, and then they throw me out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q:During this time were you in any communication with your family at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A:Yes, I got letters from them.</span> <span id="s1897">But there was nothing in there.</span> <span id="s1898">When they wrote something they don't like, they make a censor stamp on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q:You were still hearing from your father at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A:From my father, not.</span> <span id="s1901">My father was taken 1943 out of the Old Age Home in Berlin and put on a wagon, and they put gas in the wagon, and they gassed him.</span> <span id="s1902">In the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q:You found this out after the...war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A:And then I looked all over, after the war where my father is, in some camp, but he was in no camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q:He was put in an old age home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A:They took them out, people who couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1907">You know what they were put in?</span> <span id="s1908">The [not clear] carbon monoxide from the motor.</span> <span id="s1909">They let it in the wagon, closed the doors, there...were no windows, closed the doors and they suffocated from the gas of the motors.</span> <span id="s1910">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s1911">They didn't put them nowhere, all those people, that was in 1943 in June.</span> <span id="s1912">My sister told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q:So after you were in the hospital and recovered again from your wound from the quarry, from your leg opening up, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A:I went back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q:In the quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A:No, not in the quarry any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q:Where did they put you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A:Then I went to work as a mason again.</span> <span id="s1919">Till one day in '44 in July, [bright] daylight time, around 1 o'clock, the American flyers came and bombarded Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1920">They made so a job you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1921">It was this high, you know, you could see the flyers like a little point and in daylight, you know.</span> <span id="s1922">Hundreds of American bombers.</span> <span id="s1923">And suddenly the daylight came to night.</span> <span id="s1924">Everything was dark.</span> <span id="s1925">You couldn't see nothing but you heard the bombs falling.</span> <span id="s1926">And you were laying under the beds.</span> <span id="s1927">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1928">I had the day off, or what.</span> <span id="s1929">I was in the camp, I don't know yet, at the moment I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1930">I was insides.</span> <span id="s1931">The floor was trembling with us, and the whole camp was not one bomb...yes, one bomb fell inside the Lager [camp], next to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1932">The crematorium wasn't hit but next to it was a big crater from the bombs.</span> <span id="s1933">And outside was like a WŸ ste [desert] you know what a WŸ ste is...in English, like a desert.</span> <span id="s1934">Alles [All] was a desert.</span> <span id="s1935">[Everything was destroyed].</span> <span id="s1936">The whole thing is this: The Americans know that the camp, that the prisoners, in this time of day, come in the camp, from outsides.</span> <span id="s1937">One o'clock, twelve-thirty was a whistle blowing outside and all the prisoners have to march in the camp for the lunch hour.</span> <span id="s1938">If they have something to eat or nothing, lunch hour.</span> <span id="s1939">It was only for the S.S. that they have rest, understand?</span> <span id="s1940">The Americans know this.</span> <span id="s1941">They know at this time when we gonna bomb.</span> <span id="s1942">All the prisoners in the camp.</span> <span id="s1943">So that the prisoners didn't get hurt.</span> <span id="s1944">And it was like so, the camp wasn't hurt, not one bomb.</span> <span id="s1945">But around a week before the [bombing] they changed the rule.</span> <span id="s1946">They said we leave them outside, the prisoner.</span> <span id="s1947">No more coming in the camp.</span> <span id="s1948">Let them stay outside for rest period.</span> <span id="s1949">And the Americans didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1950">They came and bombarded the camp, outside the camp and we had 600 dead prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q:600?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A:Around 600 tote [dead] prisoners from the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q:600 died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A:Yes, many we never find.</span> <span id="s1955">Maybe eight or ten from my barracks, we never find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q:And this was the day you were inside the camp?</span> <span id="s1957">For whatever reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A:I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1959">So after the bombardment, after the air cleared and it got light again, the prisoners has to come and to collect all the dead people...dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1960">And we went out with a big wagon.</span> <span id="s1961">We were with horses you know, has to push the big Leiter wagen [farm wagon] and we came outside and the first thing that we saw outside the camp was this big symbol from the Nazism lay broken in fifteen pieces, maybe, on the floor.</span> <span id="s1962">The big swastika with the big eagle, with the spread eagle, their symbol you know, a big orna ment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q:A statue or a..</span> <span id="s1964">.</span> <span id="s1965">outside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A:Yes, outside the camp...big [not clear] and broken in a lot of little pieces.</span> <span id="s1967">That's what we saw first.</span> <span id="s1968">We were happy.</span> <span id="s1969">And we came and saw those dead people.</span> <span id="s1970">With their bellies open, with the inside out.</span> <span id="s1971">Terrible, from the bombs, air pressure.</span> <span id="s1972">Their belly burst and the intestines came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q:Were there S.S. as well who were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A:Yes, the S.S. was killed, too.</span> <span id="s1975">We saw many S.S. men.</span> <span id="s1976">They were hiding somewhere, but they got killed inside.</span> <span id="s1977">They were so burned that you could see [only half S.S. men.]</span> <span id="s1978">From the head to here, the [breast] bones sticking out, with the uniform, with the steel helmet on it, the head was shrinking from the heat...the head was like this.</span> <span id="s1979">But the helmet was still there, big.</span> <span id="s1980">They didn't allow us to touch the S.S. men, the deads.</span> <span id="s1981">We had big things to load those wagons full with arms, heads, with [half] bodies.</span> <span id="s1982">It was terrible, to touch them and to throw them on the wagon, was terrible.</span> <span id="s1983">Many Hungarian Jews, hundreds Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1984">They went out to work there, and this day died.</span> <span id="s1985">I saw it on the Mogen Dovids.</span> <span id="s1986">I know they were Hungarische.</span> <span id="s1987">They had different uniforms, cleaner [and newer, you know?</span> <span id="s1988">We had the old uniforms, but they had new ones.]</span> <span id="s1989">And then we brought them back in the camp.</span> <span id="s1990">Many we saw had [bullet holes] in their bodies, and they had little holes from schiessen [shooting].</span> <span id="s1991">We had Ukrainian S.S. this time in Buchen wald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q:You had what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A:Ukrainian S.S.</span> <span id="s1994">The war was going on and they needed all the men they could get.</span> <span id="s1995">The German S.S. and the Ukrainian S.S.</span> <span id="s1996">They had brown uniforms on, brown with black...the cuffs are black.</span> <span id="s1997">And they shoot at those prisoners.</span> <span id="s1998">They only wants to hide themselves, from the bombs.</span> <span id="s1999">They shoot at them and we saw many with holes in the bellies, and in the head.</span> <span id="s2000">So we put all the dead in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2001">The first time I saw the crematorium from the inside.</span> <span id="s2002">[Piled the dead] Twice we went outside to bring them in.</span> <span id="s2003">And then we had to wash our hands in that solution.</span> <span id="s2004">I don't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q:After you touched the dead men?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A:After we touched the dead.</span> <span id="s2007">And we were happy.</span> <span id="s2008">Still we were happy.</span> <span id="s2009">Then everything outside what we had built with our hands, whole factories, there were nothing left.</span> <span id="s2010">Were burning for days and days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q:The factories that you had built, were they ever put into operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A:Sure, they were in operation.</span> <span id="s2013">This is what they bombed in '44.</span> <span id="s2014">They were in operation, burning, but I never forget the big hill with all those shoes from the Auschwitz from Maidanek, what big trains came and brought to Buchenwald shoes from those people what they gassed in Maidanek and Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q:The mountains of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A:The mountains of shoes, little, children's shoes, women's shoes, men's shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q:Those were also burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A:Yes, outside the Lager.</span> <span id="s2019">For days and days it was burning, from the bombs.</span> <span id="s2020">The hill was so high, I tell you with cranes [they piled them up].</span> <span id="s2021">What they did, every...the prisoners of war done this, had to take little [piles] from shoes, in little buckets, one man in the front, one on the hand and had to bring this to our barrack and they took all the shoes apart.</span> <span id="s2022">They find dollars in there, [hidden], diamonds among the shoes, you know.</span> <span id="s2023">That's why they brought all these shoes...</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Tape 4 of 5, Side A (Continued from July 24, 1981 on July 29, 1981)</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q:You were describing to me the piles of shoes that were burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A:Those shoes were burning because of the bombing.</span> <span id="s2027">The bomb hit those hills with those shoes and they start to burn.</span> <span id="s2028">The Nazis sent big freight trains from Poland, from the death camps to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2029">The contents of those trains were shoes, clothing; men's clothing, women's clothing; hair, women's hair, hair from women, cut-up hair, eye glass es.</span> <span id="s2030">I think that's all that I remember.</span> <span id="s2031">Then one day, we had to go to those trains and unload them.</span> <span id="s2032">Take out the contents from those freight trains.</span> <span id="s2033">We saw those black clothing from the Polish Jews, what the Jews would wear, in the Yiddish, [not clear] those black robes...We saw the dried blood on it...the dried blood on it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2034">We had to sort them in ladies' clothing extra [separate] and men's clothing extra, but I don't know what they did with this.</span> <span id="s2035">Looking for something in those suits...in those shoes, I know.</span> <span id="s2036">We talked to those inmates who worked on those shoes in the barracks, [under] S.S. [supervision], they watched them what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2037">They had to take the shoes apart with knives, take the soles apart to look for money, for diamonds, or something like this.</span> <span id="s2038">And they really find something in those shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q:What did they do with what was left of the shoes after they searched them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A:Then they throw them away.</span> <span id="s2041">They cut them apart and throw them away somewhere, but this was an immense hill, maybe 20 meters high the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q:Of these shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A:Of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q:What happened, do you think, with the glasses and the hair you described?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s2046">I heard only that they take those women hair and they made felt out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q:Felt...cloth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A:Yes, felt, made shoes out of it...upper part for boots from those shoes.</span> <span id="s2049">One day there came a big transport from Hungary...Hungary Jews.</span> <span id="s2050">The Nazis went into Hungary, I don't know when, in mid-summer or spring of '44 and took all the Jews and sent them to Auschwitz or to other camps.</span> <span id="s2051">Men who were a little bit younger sent to Buchenwald and this was before the bombing, what I tell you just now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q:Why were the younger men sent to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A:To work...that they should work.</span> <span id="s2054">They sent them to camps...around Bu chenwald there were many camps.</span> <span id="s2055">Work, work camps.</span> <span id="s2056">They were under the earth.</span> <span id="s2057">They made them war material under the earth there, they had big factories in the earth, built in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q:The camps were under the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A:The camps not, but they work there, those prisoners, those inmates from the camps, worked in those mountains.</span> <span id="s2060">I think this was the Hartz Mountains, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q:The Hartz Mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A:The mountain...a big hills [and] mountains.</span> <span id="s2063">The Hartz Mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q:What kind of work were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A:They worked on munitions, put in those [powder] munitions, you know in this powder...</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q:For the bullets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A:For the bullets, there is powder in there, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q:The buildings that you worked on were not under the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A:No, they were outside, outside Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2070">Big, two for making war mater ial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q:Was it after the bombing that they built these munitions factories under the ground, or had they always been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A:They were there already.</span> <span id="s2073">They built them in wartime.</span> <span id="s2074">In those mountains and they treated them awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q:They treated the Hungarians...</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A:Hungarian Jews, awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q:What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A:They had to work hard in those mountains and were treated very bad.</span> <span id="s2079">They gave them very little food and hit them all the time.</span> <span id="s2080">They hit them at work they should work faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q:Do you think they treated the Hungarian Jews worse than...</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A:No, not worse than the others...not worse.</span> <span id="s2083">And every day came in dead people from those outside camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q:And what would they do with the dead that were brought in from those camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A:They brought them to the crematorium and burned them there.</span> <span id="s2086">Every day we had to work in those...from the S.S....the smoke came out from the burning people.</span> <span id="s2087">It was a terrible smell.</span> <span id="s2088">Months and months we have to smell...we always have to breathe it in...the smell from the dead people that they burned there.</span> <span id="s2089">Buchenwald burned 53,000 people.</span> <span id="s2090">After the liberation we had them all those, black and white, the amount of people that they burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q:Could you get any news from the new prisoners as to what was happening in the rest of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A:We don't have to get news from those prisoners.</span> <span id="s2093">We get the news that the S.S. give us on radio in every barrack.</span> <span id="s2094">Till today I can't understand, they give us all the news what's going on on the fronts.</span> <span id="s2095">On the war fronts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q:On the wireless?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A:On those war fronts.</span> <span id="s2098">Where the war was going on.</span> <span id="s2099">We know exactly where the Americans and we heard from Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q:The S.S. were telling you?</span> <span id="s2101">You mentioned radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A:Yes, in every barrack was loud speakers and the news came over those loud speakers.</span> <span id="s2103">But till today, I can't understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q:Were these German stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A:Yes, German stations...German luggage.</span> <span id="s2106">Sure.</span> <span id="s2107">We knew when "D" Day was, when the Americans landed in Normandy, and we were happy.</span> <span id="s2108">We know when in Africa they got the end, the Rommel.</span> <span id="s2109">England and the Americans conquered them...they had to retreat, the Germans...We know everything.</span> <span id="s2110">When they landed in Italy...every day we heard the news.</span> <span id="s2111">I don't know why they did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q:So the German radio stations...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A:They gave us every day new hope that the end is near...</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q:Carried the defeats that were occurring?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A:What's this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q:The German radio stations carried news of their own defeats?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A:Yes, their own defeats.</span> <span id="s2118">Maybe not enthusiastically, you know, that the Russian army defeated the German army by Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s2119">This was the point where the war changed to the other side.</span> <span id="s2120">You know, the Germans has to retreat and retreat and retreat.</span> <span id="s2121">In January '45 they had to evacuate all those dead camps in Poland.</span> <span id="s2122">The dead camps were only in Poland, not in Germany.</span> <span id="s2123">They didn't want to have the Germans know everything.</span> <span id="s2124">You know, those people are living not far from those camps, but in Poland it was possible.</span> <span id="s2125">Because the Polish people are very big anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s2126">For a couple pounds of sugar they told the Nazis where the Jews were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q:Were there any other experiences that you had with people who tried to escape from Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A:I think I told you one case, right?</span> <span id="s2129">Where they brought in one.</span> <span id="s2130">We had to stay a whole night because of one of the inmates were missing.</span> <span id="s2131">They looked over the whole camp.</span> <span id="s2132">Wasn't there.</span> <span id="s2133">He must be outside.</span> <span id="s2134">Outside they send the S.S. with dogs, with blood hounds, and they find him and they send the bloodhounds on him, and the blood hounds teared him, like in little pieces, this man.</span> <span id="s2135">Then they brought him in, on a stretcher, in the camp, and put him on the Appell Platz, a big place where all the camp comes to gether, all the inmates, and they were counted.</span> <span id="s2136">Every day, in the morning they were count ed, and in the evening.</span> <span id="s2137">And then, when one or two were missing, the whole camp has to stay there.</span> <span id="s2138">Can't go back to the barracks and the little bit water soup got cold and we couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s2139">Sometimes, like I told you, we had to stay the whole night until they find this prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q:Could there be any contact with any partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A:Not in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q:Not in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A:Not in Germany.</span> <span id="s2144">I was only in German camps.</span> <span id="s2145">In Poland, maybe it was a little bit different situation.</span> <span id="s2146">There were thousands and thousands more people in those camps and the S.S. maybe couldn't oversee all of the prisoners so exactly.</span> <span id="s2147">They had anyhow [with themselves] with the war.</span> <span id="s2148">Every day they took out one more S.S. people from these camps and sent them to the war front to fight the Russians and they put in Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s2149">Ukrainish S.S.</span> <span id="s2150">They were worse than the German S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q:What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A:They shoot the people.</span> <span id="s2153">If you didn't go the straight way, you went a little bit to the side by marching, they shoot them.</span> <span id="s2154">Many people got shot from them.</span> <span id="s2155">I think I told you this before.</span> <span id="s2156">After the bombing from Buchenwald, many prisoners and myself had to go outside the camp and collect all those dead prisoners and bring them back to the camp, to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2157">And we find many, many prisoners with shoot wounds, you see those little holes in those bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q:So the prisoners had been shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A:Shot, yes, before they were bombed, they were shot.</span> <span id="s2160">Because they tried to hide themselves from those bombs.</span> <span id="s2161">It was only natural, but they shot them.</span> <span id="s2162">And we had about 600 dead prisoners this day.</span> <span id="s2163">In twenty minutes...this was the time when the bomb ing was.</span> <span id="s2164">Only twenty minutes.</span> <span id="s2165">And we had about 600 prisoners.</span> <span id="s2166">Many we never could find from us Jewish prisoners...they worked outside the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q:Did you remember what month that was in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A:I think it was July or June.</span> <span id="s2169">It was very hot.</span> <span id="s2170">Hot and clear with sunshine... nice day.</span> <span id="s2171">We were afraid that there was going to be a reprisal against us in the camp, because of this bombing, but they did nothing to the people.</span> <span id="s2172">And then in January '45 came prisoners from other camps, from Poland, back to the Germany.</span> <span id="s2173">They has to evacuate those camps, they don't want that the prisoners shouldn't go and come in the hands from the Russians.</span> <span id="s2174">They don't want to have no witnesses, you know, live witnesses, so they tried to shoot them.</span> <span id="s2175">They couldn't shoot everybody, but who couldn't walk anymore, walk, you know, fell.</span> <span id="s2176">They couldn't stand up, they shoot them, on the way.</span> <span id="s2177">And many came back to Buchenwald, and many of those prisoners were before in Buchenwald, when I told you in '43 when they sent all the Jews away and left only the bricklayers in the camp.</span> <span id="s2178">Our old friends, so to say, came back from Auschwitz and told us what's going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q:Was this the first time that you had heard of the gas chambers or had you known about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A:No, we heard rumors, but now we had real witnesses, you know.</span> <span id="s2181">Komman do Kanada, very famous Kommando Kanada in Auschwitz, was a commando for [of] maybe 50 people.</span> <span id="s2182">Small commando, not many people, not many prisoners.</span> <span id="s2183">And they had to take out the warm bodies from the gas chambers, take them out, open up their mouth and look over to see if they have gold teeth, take them out with little instruments, with pliers.</span> <span id="s2184">And then they cut their hair from many women, dead women, and then they have to bring those dead people to crematoriums to burn them.</span> <span id="s2185">They get burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q:This was all done by the Kanada Komando?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A:Kanada Kommando...the "Keiner da" of Germany.</span> <span id="s2188">It's "nobody there"...the Kommando Kanada.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q:Did they have any other jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A:No, this was their...those commando were isolated from the other camp... they were isolated from the other camp.</span> <span id="s2191">They were living in an extra barrack after their work, but after maybe a month or two months, they took those prisoners from the Kanada Kommando and gassed them.</span> <span id="s2192">Took new people, to do this job.</span> <span id="s2193">So they had no witnesses, but we heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q:Do you think any of the people from the Kanada Kommando survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A:I don't know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2196">I heard only that they killed all those prisoners after a month or two months, they killed prisoners who were in the Kommando, and took other people, to do the work.</span> <span id="s2197">They wouldn't have no witnesses, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q:What were your quarters like with the addition of these other prisoners from Auschwitz and other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A:They put those prisoners in another extra Lager what they build, next to our Lager.</span> <span id="s2200">And this called] the kleine Lager.</span> <span id="s2201">The little Lager.</span> <span id="s2202">They put the prisoners in prit ches [?]</span> <span id="s2203">...like shelves, like a bookshelf in three or four levels.</span> <span id="s2204">And they were laying there.</span> <span id="s2205">Half dead, dead, for days till they could find the deads, dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q:They came from Auschwitz, primarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A:They came from Auschwitz, and from other camps in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q:You saw the insides of the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A:I saw them, I went there once in a while, to look at this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q:And you were able to talk to these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A:We talk to them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q:They weren't put in with you in your barracks?</span> <span id="s2213">Your barracks were kept the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A:No, our barracks were for our prisoners.</span> <span id="s2215">Years and years we were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q:Was the treatment any different towards you and towards the new prisoners who came at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A:Their treatment was worse in the kleine Lager.</span> <span id="s2218">They give them very little food and when they got sick they had no medical help.</span> <span id="s2219">No help at all.</span> <span id="s2220">They were laying there like animals to die.</span> <span id="s2221">Nobody helped them.</span> <span id="s2222">And the smell was terrible: you couldn't stay there very long.</span> <span id="s2223">Only a couple of minutes in those barracks.</span> <span id="s2224">And then came the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2225">You hear it over the radio.</span> <span id="s2226">The American army went into Cologne and they are there, and the English Army is there and we know the end is near.</span> <span id="s2227">[And] the S.S. was a little bit different, too, a little bit.</span> <span id="s2228">They know what's coming to them, you know, when the end is.</span> <span id="s2229">And every night when the American flyers came over Germany, every night, there was always alarm, so the S.S. went to their bunkers, shelters, and the camp was [not clear] the prisoners...they couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s2230">Like I said, they only were flying over our camp.</span> <span id="s2231">We heard the explosions from far away from the bombs and the whole earth was shaking...the whole barracks were shaking from those explosions.</span> <span id="s2232">In the morning we saw the burning cities from far way.</span> <span id="s2233">Then, like I told you, Buchenwald lies on a hill and you could look far away in the valley from all sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q:This was in what month that you saw the burning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A:This was in '45.</span> <span id="s2236">Every night the flyers came.</span> <span id="s2237">We couldn't sleep from those drone and the mortars.</span> <span id="s2238">They were flying very high, [but it was] hundreds and hundreds of airplanes, those big, big bombers.</span> <span id="s2239">B-9's, I forget what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q:The S.S., did their attitude of their treatment of you change as they realized that the war was coming to a close?</span> <span id="s2241">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2243">In '45 they were a little bit milder to us, they didn't hit us so much.</span> <span id="s2244">They were a little bit more human.</span> <span id="s2245">This is my opinion.</span> <span id="s2246">They were not so murderous actions, what they did to us.</span> <span id="s2247">They looked away already a little, the other way, when they saw something what they really should do.</span> <span id="s2248">They replaced those younger S.S. men, those murderers, with older S.S. men, in the 50's and 60's years old the S.S.</span> <span id="s2249">In the watch towers, they took away all those young S.S. and put old men in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q:And the younger men went to the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A:Went to the front, to the front.</span> <span id="s2252">They had not enough soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q:That happened in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A:Yes, in the beginning of 1945.</span> <span id="s2255">Then we heard the noises from the cannons.</span> <span id="s2256">Nearer and nearer, we heard that the Americans come nearer and nearer to the camp.</span> <span id="s2257">And one day, was an order that all the Jewish prisoners, right way, has to come outside the barracks and to go into the big place where the counting always was.</span> <span id="s2258">I went, too, and with me went maybe a handful of other old prisoners.</span> <span id="s2259">We were the old prisoners, [that had been there] a lot of years there.</span> <span id="s2260">And all those Jews from Hungary and so on went, too, off this place.</span> <span id="s2261">All those new prisoners went, too.</span> <span id="s2262">And we were staying there and we see nobody came, only a handful from us old prisoners were there and the other [were all] new prisoners that came from Hungary and all over, and from other camps.</span> <span id="s2263">We were around and around, stand S.S. with heavy weapons, hand grenades on their belts and the rifles on their back with the bayonettes.</span> <span id="s2264">I said, "My God, what's this?</span> <span id="s2265">They gonna send us off [on] a march, a dead march or something."</span> <span id="s2266">So when I talked to my friends and we said we're gonna try to get out of here.</span> <span id="s2267">Back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s2268">And we talked to one of those prisoners who had to watch us, and we talked to him and said, "We are old lager Hasen, old camp rabbits.</span> <span id="s2269">We don't want to go, we're here six years in camp already, and now we should go on a march?"</span> <span id="s2270">And he says, "You are right.</span> <span id="s2271">I smuggle you back to your barracks."</span> <span id="s2272">And he smuggled us [out] and watched [on all sides] and then he smuggled us back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q:Who was this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A:A prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q:A Jewish prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A:No, no, from the, like a trusty.</span> <span id="s2277">The S.S. always had trusties.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q:A non-Jewish political prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A:Political prisoners, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2280">Buchenwald was a camp with more political prisoners.</span> <span id="s2281">Like I told you before, Sachsenhausen, the Christian prisoners were most of them criminals.</span> <span id="s2282">In Buchenwald it was different.</span> <span id="s2283">They were political prisoners had the overhand in the camp.</span> <span id="s2284">The S.S. has to deal with them if they want something from them.</span> <span id="s2285">They were different than the murderers.</span> <span id="s2286">They brought us back to the barracks and in the barracks we tried to hide ourselves somewhere.</span> <span id="s2287">We...all different kinds of things we did.</span> <span id="s2288">Two or three men from us took out through a manhole cover in the camp where the canalization is, the manhole cover and we went inside of those iron pieces where you can walk inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q:There was a canal underneath?</span> <span id="s2290">The sewers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A:The sewers, yes.</span> <span id="s2292">We opened up the covers on top and went inside and then we took the cover and closed it again.</span> <span id="s2293">We were standing inside and the S.S. went around and were looking for more Jewish prisoners, couldn't find us.</span> <span id="s2294">We were standing all day.</span> <span id="s2295">Then came the night and again the Flieger [air raid] alarm...</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q:The air raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A:The air raids came with those sirens and the S.S. right away went out of the camp and went to their bunkers, to their shelters.</span> <span id="s2298">Until the air was clean, so in the night we went out and we went to the barracks, looking for something to eat.</span> <span id="s2299">The Christian prisoners helped us, give us piece of bread of what they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q:How man...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Tape 4 of 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q:About how many of you...you described as handful of Jewish prison ers...about how many of you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A:In my part, where I was, there were four men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q:There were four of you who were hidden...</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A:Hidden in the sewer, those shafts, you know, on the bottom were water, but we weren't standing in the water.</span> <span id="s2306">We were there, the person who was the deepest on the bottom and we stand one over the other and [there was] an iron built in those walls in the sewer where you could go up or down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q:Like a ladder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A:A ladder, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q:So the rest of the men in your barrack were still in the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2311">Many were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q:So you snuck out at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A:At night we went out.</span> <span id="s2314">The air was clear, it was the raid, the air raid every night.</span> <span id="s2315">We know no S.S. can do us nothing to us, so we went in the barracks and they gave us a piece of bread and a little bit something to eat and in the morning we went, when the day started to come, we....how do you say it...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q:The sun rose?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A:The sun rose, we went down again in those sewers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q:And you say it was Christian prisoners who gave you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A:Yes, what they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q:These were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A:Germans, yes, most of the time were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q:How long were you hidden like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A:A couple of days, around four or five days.</span> <span id="s2324">And one day we couldn't stand it anymore, to stay there.</span> <span id="s2325">The whole day to stay and hang there in the sewer.</span> <span id="s2326">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2327">We were weak already, so we tried to go in the kleine Lager, the little Lager and to hide there in the daytime.</span> <span id="s2328">The S.S. never came to the kleine Lager.</span> <span id="s2329">They couldn't stand the smell there from those half-dead people there.</span> <span id="s2330">But we couldn't stand the smell either.</span> <span id="s2331">We tried to be there the whole day...but we had to survive, so we had to stay there in those barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q:Had the forced march occurred?</span> <span id="s2333">Had they indeed taken these people that were counted that night and made them leave the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A:Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s2335">They went on a march.</span> <span id="s2336">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s2337">Only to shoot them, I think.</span> <span id="s2338">We never heard about them anymore.</span> <span id="s2339">I can't tell you, but we know that they shoot them.</span> <span id="s2340">Maybe some tried to escape on the way.</span> <span id="s2341">Sure, maybe some of those prisoners es caped; the end was already near.</span> <span id="s2342">One day, they saidÑit came an order over the loudspeak erÑ the S.S. should come out of the Lager.</span> <span id="s2343">All S.S. personnel out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2344">There was different kind of barracks where the S.S. was there, watched the prisoners, what they do, they went them all out.</span> <span id="s2345">Then they said to us, "Every prisoner has to stay in their barrack.</span> <span id="s2346">Nobody has to come out."</span> <span id="s2347">If we go out of the barracks, we got shot, they told us over the loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s2348">When we hear explosions, we shouldn't run out of the barracks, then we get shot again.</span> <span id="s2349">So we understand that they gonna bomb the whole camp, with their own airplanes, you know, bomb the camps so that we shouldn't fall into the hands of the American Army.</span> <span id="s2350">Then we looked outside of the windows and we saw the S.S. running outside of the camp, in the woods, tearing up their stars, those swastikas, bands here on the arms, tear them down.</span> <span id="s2351">Some took off the whole jacket, the whole uniform jacket and throw them up to on the floor.</span> <span id="s2352">On horses, bicycles, in cars, they were running.</span> <span id="s2353">And we know now it's come.</span> <span id="s2354">Soon the hour when we are free.</span> <span id="s2355">When the S.S. runs away and tears off everything what they have, all those stars, you know...The thunder noises from the war came nearer and nearer.</span> <span id="s2356">You hear the cannons, and one day it was so near that we all had to lay down flat on our bellies in the barracks so that the [bullets] didn't hit us.</span> <span id="s2357">This was so strong, that we heard always the noises from the guns...</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q:You were laying down so the bullets wouldn't hit you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A:Shouldn't hit us.</span> <span id="s2360">Then came the American Panzers [tanks] and tore down the electric fences around the camps and we were free now.</span> <span id="s2361">We didn't realize, but we were crying and laughing.</span> <span id="s2362">It was a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s2363">We felt that we were born again.</span> <span id="s2364">It was a wonderful thing, that we were born again, that we are human again and we went out and saw those American Panzers [tanks] tearing down those electric fences around the camp.</span> <span id="s2365">They give us cigarettes, the soldiers, throw cigarettes out to us.</span> <span id="s2366">But they wouldn't talk to us.</span> <span id="s2367">The war was still going on.</span> <span id="s2368">They had to go further, but they left a contingent of Amer ican soldiers, they left in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q:That was what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A:This was April 11, 1945.</span> <span id="s2371">I can't forget this date, because it is my second birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q:Beautiful.</span> <span id="s2373">Were they able to leave food for you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A:No, no, not those soldiers.</span> <span id="s2375">This was the front soldiers.</span> <span id="s2376">They had only to...the war was going on.</span> <span id="s2377">They left, those Panzers left.</span> <span id="s2378">We saw that it was the Third Army, Number 3 was on those tank.</span> <span id="s2379">This was General Patton's army liberated us.</span> <span id="s2380">And the next day, Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s2381">We all had to stay there and bend our heads and the American flag went to half mast.</span> <span id="s2382">We were standing there, we were crying too.</span> <span id="s2383">And then they sent a big, from the Red Cross, the American Red Cross, big ambulances to the camp.</span> <span id="s2384">Maybe 50 or 60 trucks, ambulance-trucks and took out those prisoners from the camp, from the kleine Lager.</span> <span id="s2385">Those half-dead, were only skeletons alive.</span> <span id="s2386">They couldn't stay up anymore.</span> <span id="s2387">Some of them were going on their hands and knees and they took them away.</span> <span id="s2388">They were very happy.</span> <span id="s2389">Then they brought in food from the American Army, food, but they didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s2390">They wanted to help us, but they give us food what we couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s2391">It was fat, too much fat.</span> <span id="s2392">It was all pieces of bacon, so you got a piece of bacon in your hand and you start to eat it.</span> <span id="s2393">And the people with the big eyes, you know, the desire to eat, you know, was bigger than the insides.</span> <span id="s2394">You know, when they eat the fat food, those fat baconÑand they got sick.</span> <span id="s2395">Their shrunken stomach couldn't take this food and they got sick.</span> <span id="s2396">Many from our Jewish prisoners who got liberated from the American Army died, after the liberation, in the camp.</span> <span id="s2397">We couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s2398">The war was still on.</span> <span id="s2399">We had to live in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q:What did you do?</span> <span id="s2401">How much did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A:I eat maybe one bite and I feel the fat was so...I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s2403">I felt like you have to vomit from it.</span> <span id="s2404">I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s2405">I eat maybe one bite, and I tried another bite, but I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s2406">My nature didn't take this, you know.</span> <span id="s2407">I feel no good.</span> <span id="s2408">I didn't eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q:Bacon was the main thing you were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A:Yes, fat, fat meat they gave us.</span> <span id="s2411">Really fat.</span> <span id="s2412">They were thinking, the Americans were thinking they help us, they give a good thing to us.</span> <span id="s2413">They give us food like this.</span> <span id="s2414">But it wasn't good.</span> <span id="s2415">Many died, many of my good friends were dead, was all those years together with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q:How long were you in the camp like this during these last days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A:After the liberation, the war was still going on and we knew from the other side came the Russians.</span> <span id="s2418">But the Russians stopped on the Elbe River in Germany.</span> <span id="s2419">And the Americans went to this river and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s2420">We couldn't go away...around in June, in May was the capitulation from the German Army, in May, May 8, I think it was, the German Army capitulated, but we couldn't go no further because they said to us, "You can't go to the east, you can go to the west, to Cologne or to, in direction to France, but you can't go east.</span> <span id="s2421">There are the Russians, they wouldn't let you through."</span> <span id="s2422">So in between the liberation and going away from the camp, I worked for the American Red Cross in Weimar.</span> <span id="s2423">Weimar is the next town, next big town to the camp Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2424">I worked there.</span> <span id="s2425">Every day we were picked up by the American Army in trucks, and who want to, this was, you don't have to; if you don't want to, but I said I want to work.</span> <span id="s2426">I am a tailor and I want to work.</span> <span id="s2427">And they took us down to Weimar.</span> <span id="s2428">There was a factory, a clothes factory, with civilian workers, and we worked there.</span> <span id="s2429">We were sewing little boys' suits.</span> <span id="s2430">They find a big Lager with material, the Americans, and they took this material out and we had to sew little boys' suits, for children.</span> <span id="s2431">Suits, for children they found in those camps.</span> <span id="s2432">There were many children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q:Now you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A:Till the end of the war they couldn't do nothing with those children...they had no time anymore to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q:There were children in Buchenwald throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A:Yes, only by the end, by the end.</span> <span id="s2437">The last couple weeks only.</span> <span id="s2438">Before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q:Only the last couple of weeks were there children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A:Yes, they brought them, they brought them to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q:Where were those children from?</span> <span id="s2442">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A:They were from all over.</span> <span id="s2444">From Hungary, from Poland, they had no fathers or mothers anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q:Before that time there had not been children in the camp, before that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A:No, no, not by us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q:So you were living still in your barracks in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2448">You were still wearing your stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A:Yes, sure we had our stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q:And you would work during the day in Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A:I worked in Weimar.</span> <span id="s2452">We were picked up by the American Army in trucks and went to Weimar.</span> <span id="s2453">We worked the whole day there and in the evening, after eight hours, they brought us back to the cam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q:How did that feel, that month or so you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A:I felt wonderful...I felt like a human being again.</span> <span id="s2456">And after the week was over, I got my wages paid out in German marks...</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q:From the American Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A:No, no, from those bosses there.</span> <span id="s2459">They were Germans.</span> <span id="s2460">The factory belonged to Germans, but the oversight was from the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q:So the Germans themselves were then paying you for this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q:What were they like?</span> <span id="s2464">What kind of treatment did you receive in those fac tories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A:They didn't talk to us...they didn't talk to us.</span> <span id="s2466">We didn't care about them.</span> <span id="s2467">We did our job, that's all.</span> <span id="s2468">I worked on a machine and was sewing, that's all.</span> <span id="s2469">In the evening, around five, they put us on trucks and we went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s2470">The bookkeeping were all German people.</span> <span id="s2471">And one day, that I forgot to tell you, the American Army forced every household in Weimar, two people from every household, has to go up in the camp, by feet.</span> <span id="s2472">Not in trucks or so, they had to walk.</span> <span id="s2473">They had to walk up the hill to the camp to see what was going on there all those years.</span> <span id="s2474">To see the mountains of dead people in the crematorium laying outsides because they had not time to burn them.</span> <span id="s2475">There was no coal enough for those ovens, anyhow.</span> <span id="s2476">Thousands of people came up in the camp.</span> <span id="s2477">Civil people from Wei mar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q:Were you in the camp when these visits occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A:Yes, we were in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q:What kinds of reactions did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A:We were hollering, but the American Army didn't let us go to them.</span> <span id="s2482">We were standing all, thousands and thousands of prisoners and [in front of us stood] the American soldiers with the rifles and we saw those civil people coming in long march lines.</span> <span id="s2483">Women, men, old men...</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q:Could you observe any of their reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A:They were afraid.</span> <span id="s2486">They were crying.</span> <span id="s2487">Crying, and begging that shouldn't do nothing to them.</span> <span id="s2488">We were hollering and screaming on them.</span> <span id="s2489">"We didn't know, we didn't know"...they was always hollering.</span> <span id="s2490">"We didn't know what was going on here...we didn't know...we were thinking is all criminals, all murders up there."</span> <span id="s2491">Then the American soldiers forced them to go inside, all over and to see those dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q:Inside...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A:In those barracks where there were [still] mountains of dead people laying.</span> <span id="s2494">This was all in the beginning, after the liberation, maybe ten days, fourteen days after wards.</span> <span id="s2495">And the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s2496">Some people wouldn't go in there.</span> <span id="s2497">They forced them.</span> <span id="s2498">They took them by the neck, threw them into those barracks to see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s2499">Then they shout, "We all know about it, but we never saw it."</span> <span id="s2500">Those lampshades what the Ilse Koch...She was the widow from the Commandant from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2501">From the former Commandant from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2502">She saw prisoners with big tattoos over their chest, over the back, big tattoos...sailors, most of them sailors.</span> <span id="s2503">And she liked those pictures on them and she told her husband, "It would be nice when I get this skin from those prisoners, and we make nice lampshades out of those skins."</span> <span id="s2504">And he followed her and took out those prisoners, sent them down to the hospital, to the prisoner hospital, and there were prisoners who killed them and took off their skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q:Prisoners killed other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A:Prisoners killed them, with needles.</span> <span id="s2507">I don't know what they put in those needles, but they killed them.</span> <span id="s2508">And took the skin off and prepared the skin and made like a parchment out of the skin and fabricated lampshades.</span> <span id="s2509">And this day, we saw the first time those two lampshades.</span> <span id="s2510">Two lampshades they showed us, the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s2511">That they find by her in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q:How many prisoners do you think were killed for the lampshades?</span> <span id="s2513">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A:I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2515">They showed us only two lamps with those lampshades with those beautiful pictures on them...the tattoos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q:Had you heard about this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A:Yes, we heard about it...prisoner talk...one to the other by mouth.</span> <span id="s2518">But, we never saw it.</span> <span id="s2519">She had switches on the wall, switches from human toes, big toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q:How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A:Those switches, with toes sticking out.</span> <span id="s2522">Turn toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q:You mean the bone of the toe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A:No, the toes, the whole toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q:The toe itself was preserved in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A:The whole toe, and they made switches out of them...to turn on and off the light.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q:And you saw all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A:She was a perverse woman.</span> <span id="s2529">I saw her many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q:You saw these in the home, you went into the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A:No, I don't saw this.</span> <span id="s2532">I saw only what the American soldiers showed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q:But you did see her many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A:I saw her many times walking between the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q:She would walk among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A:Among the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2537">We were working outside, digging ditches, or I don't know what it was for work, hard work, and she went.</span> <span id="s2538">She was a little woman, fat woman with red hair, short, short hair.</span> <span id="s2539">But we prisoners shouldn't look at her.</span> <span id="s2540">If she saw a prisoner looking at her, she went to the S.S. and said, "These prisoners [insulted] me with his eyes."</span> <span id="s2541">He insulted her with his eyes, and the S.S. man wrote down the number and they became [got] twenty-five lashes on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q:Why was she walking among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A:She was a sadist, you know.</span> <span id="s2544">She feel something about it when she could walk between the prisoners and they couldn't touch her.</span> <span id="s2545">She was a sadist, that's why she made lampshades.</span> <span id="s2546">And the American Army showed those German civil people from Weimar those lampshades and we saw them, too.</span> <span id="s2547">And they showed usÑshe had made of some prisoners, heads, shrinking heads, they were like this, so big, black...with the eyes, with the teeth, but black.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q:She shrunk heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A:Not she did it, she give them order, and they did it for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q:And what did she do with those heads?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A:I don't know what she did with them, but they showed them to us.</span> <span id="s2552">It's sometimes you see in cars, people will have this in front hanging this little head, shrunken, black.</span> <span id="s2553">They showed them the crematorium with those hundreds of thousands of dead bodies, one piled on the other, high up like this from the floor, and we saw this, too, the first time.</span> <span id="s2554">We never went there in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2555">Only dead people came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q:This was the first time then that you had seen it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A:That I saw those mountains of dead prisoners [piled]...like wood, one over the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q:It must have been incredibly difficult for you to have gone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A:Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s2560">It was.</span> <span id="s2561">But we were without feeling anymore.</span> <span id="s2562">You have no real feeling anymore when you're years and years and every day you see the dead [before] your eyes.</span> <span id="s2563">You had really no feeling anymore.</span> <span id="s2564">The only thing you had was a little bit food every night and we were thinking of to rest, to lay down, for a couple of hours...to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q:It was like you withdrew a lot of your energy from feeling and from other worries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A:I had nothing to think, too, anymore.</span> <span id="s2567">I knew my father was there, an old man, he died, I know.</span> <span id="s2568">They took him away...I know this.</span> <span id="s2569">It was on my mind.</span> <span id="s2570">That's it.</span> <span id="s2571">I was alone and not to care for anybody...I had no wife, no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q:Do you think that helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A:It helped me, sure, it helped me a lot from going crazy, to thinking every day what happened to your wife, what happened to your children?</span> <span id="s2574">...I saw this every day, for people who came into the camp and start to cry, thinking on their wives and hollering and crying and they tried to make them quiet and they wouldn't be quiet.</span> <span id="s2575">They were screaming.</span> <span id="s2576">It got real crazy like.</span> <span id="s2577">Then in the morning we saw them hanging in the wires, in the electric wires...they went out of the barracks and ran straight to the electric [not clear] with [strong] electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q:The electric fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A:Yes, and they had their hands on it, and right away they were stuck to it.</span> <span id="s2580">The high voltage went through your body and they were hanging there.</span> <span id="s2581">In the morning when we came out of the barracks we saw hanging three, four, five prisoners on those wires.</span> <span id="s2582">They have to take off the power and we could take them down.</span> <span id="s2583">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q:So this visit then occurred, of the people from Weimar, occurred about ten days or two weeks after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A:Two weeks after the liberation.</span> <span id="s2586">The war was still on, but Weimar was free already, was [under] American military...occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q:And you worked in Weimar until May or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A:I worked there until the beginning of June and then I tried to go back to Berlin where I came from.</span> <span id="s2589">One day the Americans brought us near the border where the Russians were and we had to smuggle through the woods on the other side of the Russian occupation, Germany.</span> <span id="s2590">We came to Dresden.</span> <span id="s2591">Was a beautiful town before, but it was all bombed and laying in ruins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q:You were going on foot then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A:Yes, on foot.</span> <span id="s2594">In Dresden we went on a train...the train was full, but we were sitting on top on the train.</span> <span id="s2595">We were eight days until we came to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q:What do you mean on top?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A:On top of the train...on the outside.</span> <span id="s2598">On the roof of the trains we were sit t ing...Hundreds of prisoners.</span> <span id="s2599">And the train was rolling and rolling...take eight days.</span> <span id="s2600">Really it makes only ten hours, less than ten hours, took eight days to come to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q:Were the Americans able to provide you with some food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A:Not on the way...on the way not.</span> <span id="s2603">Then we were in Russian occupation already.</span> <span id="s2604">This part from Germany was under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s2605">Then I came back to Berlin and I came to a big place...everything...the houses were falling apart...everything was down.</span> <span id="s2606">You don't know what way to go, to east or to west, no street signs anymore.</span> <span id="s2607">It was like a desert.</span> <span id="s2608">Once in a while there was a house still standing.</span> <span id="s2609">And I came to the house where my sister was living...This was the only house in the whole street still standing.</span> <span id="s2610">Isn't that something?</span> <span id="s2611">Then I knocked on the door, I was heavy set, you know.</span> <span id="s2612">I had good food from the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q:You had gained weight already?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A:Got better food, not those water-soups anymore and my head was like this big...And I knocked on the door and my brother-in-law opened and said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s2615">And I said, "I'm your brother-in-law."</span> <span id="s2616">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s2617">Then he called sis ter and she recognized me.</span> <span id="s2618">But it was like a wall between us, because I had other feelings and they had other feelings.</span> <span id="s2619">I didn't feel like I come back to my sister because her husband was anyhow a goy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">Tape 5 of 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q:You were describing your brother-in-law's reaction, and your sister's reaction to you coming to their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A:It's only natural.</span> <span id="s2623">We didn't see each other for six years, for the first time again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q:Had they been in their home all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A:They were all the time in their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q:How did they escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A:Because in Germany, when the head of the house is an Aryan and he has a Jewish wife, he saves her life because he was the head of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q:She did not convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s2630">They're married, not in a church, not in a synagogue, civil marriage.</span> <span id="s2631">And everybody had his own religion.</span> <span id="s2632">But I didn't feel very good there with my sister in the house.</span> <span id="s2633">First, they had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2634">There were still the ration cards; the war was over, but they still had those ration cards.</span> <span id="s2635">Only what she could give me to eat was little bit potatoes and little bit water soup like, again, I felt like I'm again in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2636">She had nothing to eat, either.</span> <span id="s2637">She made a little bit soup out of flour with a little bit sugar.</span> <span id="s2638">That's what we eat as dinner.</span> <span id="s2639">She has ration cards for meat, but there was no meat in those stores, in those butcher stores.</span> <span id="s2640">And the first Friday nightÑI came around on Tuesday, June 12, I think it was...came back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2641">And the first Friday night I was thinking, I'm gonna look if I find more Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2642">I went to the nearest synagogue.</span> <span id="s2643">Certainly, I knew before that the Nazis burned all the synagogues in 1938, in November, so I came to the synagogue and the American bombs did the rest.</span> <span id="s2644">So I was standing there and said to myself, "Where should I go now...should I go home, back to my sister's apartment or shall I go further looking for other Jewish people?</span> <span id="s2645">My sister couldn't tell me, she was living like in isolation.</span> <span id="s2646">She has no friends there [among the] other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q:Was she accepted, do you think, by the other Germans, the non-Jewish Germans, whom they were living with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A:I don't know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2649">The only thing I know is that she was alive.</span> <span id="s2650">She was thin and her face was small...they had not much to eat during the war time...but she was alive, that's all.</span> <span id="s2651">So I want to go away back to the synagogue, I want to go away and then I hear from far away Friday night those Jewish songs, like you hear in the synagogue (hums softly)...those Friday night songs, and I went around the sound, and I came in the back of the synagogue was a big place, a free place, and there was a little chapel in the back.</span> <span id="s2652">In the back, the singing was coming from there.</span> <span id="s2653">I opened up the door and there was a little chapel, around thirty people, maybe, were there, ten or twelve women and the rest men, old men, and the chazan was singing.</span> <span id="s2654">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2655">I find other Jews and I looked the people over and I looked across.</span> <span id="s2656">The men were sitting on one side and the women on the other.</span> <span id="s2657">It was an Orthodox place.</span> <span id="s2658">And I looked and looked at my wife.</span> <span id="s2659">My wife, I mean I looked at her and I asked the man next to me if he knows this girl over there.</span> <span id="s2660">And he said, "Yes, I know her.</span> <span id="s2661">You want me to ask her.</span> <span id="s2662">Have you...?"</span> <span id="s2663">After the service we went out and he introduced me to this girl and we talked...I didn't talk much because I was ashamed of myself.</span> <span id="s2664">I had no teeth, my upper teeth were out.</span> <span id="s2665">You know, I think I told you this in my story that the Nazis, they had to take out my teeth because they were loose.</span> <span id="s2666">No hair on my head...every two weeks we got our hair taken off, you know.</span> <span id="s2667">As prisoners.</span> <span id="s2668">And I wasn't nice dressed.</span> <span id="s2669">Old suit on and here still was my number on the chest of the suit.</span> <span id="s2670">Civil suit, and the name...no, no, not the number, "Buchenwald" had here a sign on it.</span> <span id="s2671">And we talked a little bit and I brought her home where she was living.</span> <span id="s2672">And I said "Good-bye" to her.</span> <span id="s2673">And the next Friday night we saw each other again and so we met each other and became friends.</span> <span id="s2674">That's it.</span> <span id="s2675">And then we married...</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q:You married in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A:In Berlin, from an American Chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q:When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A:We got married in Purim, 1946.</span> <span id="s2680">American Chaplain married us in full uniform.</span> <span id="s2681">Shuboff, his name was Shuboff.</span> <span id="s2682">He was living in Boston, but he was stationed in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2683">An American section in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2684">Then when I came back to Berlin from concentra tion camp, Berlin was conquered from the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s2685">The whole city of Berlin was conquered from the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s2686">And after a couple of months, the Allied powers [divided] the city off in four parts.</span> <span id="s2687">One was the Russian section, an American section, an English section and a French section.</span> <span id="s2688">I was living certainly in the English section of Berlin.</span> <span id="s2689">English part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s2690">And we married and our daughter got born in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q:She was born in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A:Yes, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2693">We got a nice apartment without windows, only cardboard on the windows, [exchange between Mr. K. and wife here]...Nice bedroom, kitchen and a toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q:Were you able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A:No...Yes...this I tell you.</span> <span id="s2696">After we married my wife talked to her cousin.</span> <span id="s2697">Her cousin was the president from the Jewish Gemeinde [congregation] in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2698">And he give me a job as a clerk.</span> <span id="s2699">So I was a clerk in the Gemeinde, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q:And your daughter was born, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A:In December my daughter was born, and when my wife wants to buy a little bit milk for the baby, those Nazi women start to holler at her in the milk store.</span> <span id="s2702">"Komt die Juden," the Jewish belgeÑa word like animals, like.</span> <span id="s2703">"Come the Jewish belge and trinkt [drink] the little bit milk away."</span> <span id="s2704">So both us said, "We can't live here anymore."</span> <span id="s2705">The same Nazism comes out again after a year, you know, this starts to go [again], on top Nazis again.</span> <span id="s2706">And the English soldiers weren't very nice to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q:Which section of Berlin were you living in?</span> <span id="s2708">Under whose control...the English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A:The English.</span> <span id="s2710">Before, it was all Russian and the Nazis were all disappeared, they hid themselves in cellars, somewhere outside, in the country.</span> <span id="s2711">And we said, "No, we cannot live here anymore.</span> <span id="s2712">This is the same Nazis, the selbe risches [same anti-Semitism] again."</span> <span id="s2713">We said, "We gonna go somewhere."</span> <span id="s2714">So we were talking between us...to America we couldn't go, not the United States we couldn't go because you couldn't go out of the English section.</span> <span id="s2715">If we were living in the American section, you could go to the United States, as a displaced person.</span> <span id="s2716">After a certain time, the English section was open for immi gration to the U.S.</span> <span id="s2717">It opened up for immigration, so we could go to the U.S., in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q:Now, you have shown me a prayer book that you received...</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A:After the liberation, first came the war troops, what had nothing to do, only fighting.</span> <span id="s2720">And afterwards came a different kind of American soldiers.</span> <span id="s2721">They take over the camp, we have visitors from the U.S., people with those big hats, those Texan hats came, and we looked at them.</span> <span id="s2722">General Eisenhower was visiting the camps and members from Congress came to visit the camps, and they showed them everything.</span> <span id="s2723">And we got Chap lains, American Chaplains came in uniform, Jewish Chaplains and the Christian Chaplains.</span> <span id="s2724">Jewish Chaplains naturally came to us Jews, talking to us and then he put out a whole list from all those survivors...Jewish survivors from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2725">My name was on the list.</span> <span id="s2726">They sent this list to the U.S. and the list came to all the Jewish papers in the U.S. And my sister here in the U.S. saw on those lists that I am alive, and then she wrote to us.</span> <span id="s2727">Then the Chaplain gave every Jew, he gave us a little siddur [prayer book] in Hebrew and in English translation.</span> <span id="s2728">Until today I still have this little siddur.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q:And the siddur is engraved or is dedicated to you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A:No, no, no, this is my handwriting.</span> <span id="s2731">This is my handwriting.</span> <span id="s2732">"Zur Erinner ung an den tag der Befreiung."</span> <span id="s2733">In English: "In remembrance on the day of the liberation Weimar-Buchenwald, 11th day, April '45."</span> <span id="s2734">I wrote this in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q:This was the first time you say that religion was re-introduced into...</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A:To us...but I tell you the truth, I couldn't believe in God anymore.</span> <span id="s2737">What my eyes saw...I couldn't believe there is a God in heaven can see this and do nothing.</span> <span id="s2738">So, but my wife, she gave me back the belief in God again, after we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q:Have you suffered much from the physical distress you had during the war, since your liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A:When I came to the U.S., my wounds broke open.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q:On your feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A:On my feet.</span> <span id="s2743">You know I [not clear].</span> <span id="s2744">What, what's this?</span> <span id="s2745">Sores, wounds...of [in] German they say wounds, wounded.</span> <span id="s2746">Sores.</span> <span id="s2747">I don't know, when you ask me "sore," I think sores only if you have a little bit skin like open.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q:These were large ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A:Large ones, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s2750">My feet were swollen up and the wounds opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q:This was how many years after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A:'47, when I came to the U.S. in August.</span> <span id="s2753">Maybe two months.</span> <span id="s2754">Later, suddenly my feet broke open.</span> <span id="s2755">And I went to the Mt. Sinai Hospital on 5th Street, 5th and Reed and they treated this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q:Were there any other repercussions of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A:No, not at all, except my hearing.</span> <span id="s2758">My hearing got worse and worse after the years...from those [hits] on the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q:When they hit you on the head your hearing was affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q:Were you aware of your hearing loss at the time in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A:Not so much.</span> <span id="s2763">You can't think in the camp.</span> <span id="s2764">You don't think anymore.</span> <span id="s2765">You are like a piece of meat.</span> <span id="s2766">You eat your little bit water soup, your nose runs in the water soup and you eat it.</span> <span id="s2767">You had no handkerchief in your pocket.</span> <span id="s2768">You had nothing.</span> <span id="s2769">You go on the toilet you have to clean yourself with the hand with water.</span> <span id="s2770">There is no paper, toilet paper in those toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q:Is there anything else you want to add to what you've told us?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A:I say only one thing.</span> <span id="s2773">If I lived through six years alone [in] concentration camp, from '39 to '45, was the angel watching over me?</span> <span id="s2774">Why me?</span> <span id="s2775">Why he let me live so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q:Why, do you think?</span> <span id="s2777">What do you think kept you alive during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A:I don't know till today.</span> <span id="s2779">I don't know, was the angel watching me?</span> <span id="s2780">But [where] was the angel for the six million other Jews?</span> <span id="s2781">So I don't know till today.</span> <span id="s2782">But God [rewarded] me, give me like, for all my suffering, he give me a wonderful wife, but make a human being better out of me.</span> <span id="s2783">She feeds me...first time I couldn't eat, she take a bite and put it to me in my mouth, because I couldn't eat without teeth...She made a human being back out of me.</span> <span id="s2784">And I say today, "If God let me live, it must have a reason," so I try to do good things to other people.</span> <span id="s2785">I help out and I go to old age homes when I have time...I have plenty of time now...I'm retired.</span> <span id="s2786">To help people, to feed people, I shave those inmates in the old age homes.</span> <span id="s2787">I do what I can to help people.</span> <span id="s2788">I think it is my second life, I live now.</span> <span id="s2789">Must have a purpose that God let me live.</span> <span id="s2790">That's what I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q:I'm very glad I could talk to you.</span> <span id="s2792">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A:O.</span> <span id="s2794">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Perhaps bekam, meaning received or got.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A failed uprising led by Wolfgang Kapp in Berlin, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">In this and other instances, lengthy German phrases have been omitted and only the English translation appears in brackets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">This may be Bendzin, or Bedzin, in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Zbonszyn</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Herschel Grynszpan Perhaps, gŸ ltig [valid] Perhaps, stapel, meaning to pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Perhaps, "parasites."</span> <span id="s2802">[Later on we were counted on a big Platz.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Perhaps "yellow."</span> <span id="s2804">USHMM Archives, RG-50.462*0016 page \* arabic97 From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive.</span></p></body></html>
