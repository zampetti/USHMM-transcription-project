suburb, Mulezootshka(ph), next to this town of Czernowitz in the province Bukovina of the Austria-Hungarian empire at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you tell us in a few words about your school years and your life, your family life during your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In August, 1914, when the war started and the Russian occupied the Bukovina, my mother fled with many other people from Czernowitz to Vienna, so my first four years which I remember are from Vienna.</span> <span id="s17">We were two children, the father was on the front in Italy.</span> <span id="s18">He came once in a while to visit, maybe three or four times during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And after the war, what happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: In June, in July, 1918, we came back to Czernowitz and my father who got wounded in the war left, lived for year and half more and then he died.</span> <span id="s21">And now we stayed with our mother and four children at that time, two were born during the war and after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Where, where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I went to school, primary school in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s24">These were still in German though it was already next to Romania.</span> <span id="s25">Then I went to high school in Czernowitz and then in 1929, then I stayed for two years at University of Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s26">Starting with mathematics(ph), 1931, I went to Berno(ph), to study engineering but one year later, I came to Bucharest to the polytechnic school.</span> <span id="s27">And here where I graduated in construction, civil engineering in 1935.</span> <span id="s28">1936, I did army service from 1937 through 1940, I stayed in Bucharest and sometimes in the provinces and worked in engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: When did you, did you return to Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I returned to Czernowitz at the end of June 1940 when the Russians occupied Czernowitz, first in order to be with my family, and secondly because at that time an anti-Semitic government was installed in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Can you go back for one moment to the inter-war period and tell us if you witnessed any, witnessed any instances of anti-Semitism in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Before I came in contact with the Romanians, I didn’t know anything about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s33">Say around the age of ten or 12, there was a Congress of, Congress of Romanian students in Czernowitz and they went around town and sang their, their chants about long live Romania, death to the Jews.</span> <span id="s34">They took off the, there was a municipal theater, they took off the sign __________ which was now only for Romanian place.</span> <span id="s35">One year later or two years later, there was after the education was taken over by the Romanian government and the students didn’t know enough Romanian, most of them failed at the matriculation exam called baccalaureate and some, one protested very heavily.</span> <span id="s36">It was shot down by a Romanian student.</span> <span id="s37">The student, after a trial was acquitted.</span> <span id="s38">This way, I got to learn about Romanian anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Let’s go back to the summer of 1940 when the Soviets, soldier troops occupied Bukovina.</span> <span id="s40">Go ahead, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I would like to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Yeah, please go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Then when I was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, there were a number of students were anti-Semitic but the engineering atmosphere prevailed and were, we were treated more or less equally.</span> <span id="s44">But at the end of our studies, we didn’t have the same opportunities like the Romanian graduates.</span> <span id="s45">The Romanian graduates had open fields, we could take only second-hand positions.</span> <span id="s46">This was still much better than for other professions.</span> <span id="s47">From the probably early thirties, no Jew could get a job as a teacher in public schools, only in private schools.</span> <span id="s48">And no Jew was ever admitted to be a civil service employee.</span> <span id="s49">Same thing in the Army.</span> <span id="s50">1936, when I was in the Army, in just an eight months course for engineers, the, none of the Jews were, was admitted to the exam to become officer in the Reserve of the Romania Army.</span> <span id="s51">So.</span> <span id="s52">And we had to serve a few months longer.</span> <span id="s53">In my, in 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed in a private engineering firm, the __________ the government, the embassy made(ph) the government came to power, Kovan Kuza(ph) and our company gave us every months by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work and say on January 1, ’38 I got a note that, that my employment will end January 31st, ’38.</span> <span id="s54">February 1st, I got another note through January, February 28th and so forth.</span> <span id="s55">Then Koga Koola(ph) lived, Koga Kooza(ph) fell and we continued to work a second great, second great engineers, always, always just with smaller, smaller pay and less rights than the other, the other engineers.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s57">Do you want to add on this subject anything else or we can go to the year 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Let’s go to the year 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Okay, so my question is, what did you witness in terms of Soviet occupation of Bukovina from July 1940, until June 1941.</span> <span id="s60">Where during this period of time, during this 11 months, any special policies against the Jews enacted?</span> <span id="s61">Were the Jews deported or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: During this year, it’s a full year, not 11 months, it was, it started end of June, end of June 1940.</span> <span id="s63">War broke out June 22nd, 1941 and probably early July, the Russians left and the Romanians came back.</span> <span id="s64">During this months, during this year, I wouldn’t say there were any anti-Semitic acts taken by the Soviet government.</span> <span id="s65">There were acts rather taken against people who, people who, owners, owners of industrial plants, owners of commercial . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Establishments.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Establishments.</span> <span id="s68">And so forth.</span> <span id="s69">Because some or most of that, some of them, because the Germans and the Romanians had left, so most of these owners who stayed were Jews.</span> <span id="s70">And quite a number of them were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s71">Quite a number of them were sent, this was already in June of 1941, a few weeks before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you witness such a deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I witnessed such a deportation because I witnessed first when I came in the morning to the office, I was told what happened.</span> <span id="s74">Then I had to go a school for some construction work and the girl came and said, “Goodbye children,” policemen, Russian policemen next to her.</span> <span id="s75">She said, “Children, these men came to pick me up, my parents are at the railway station.</span> <span id="s76">I have to go with them.”</span> <span id="s77">And I had a job next to the railway station and I came and saw these people in the trains on their way to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Okay, let’s move to 22nd of June, 1941.</span> <span id="s79">Could describe to us what the beginning of the war meant for you and your family and how was Jewish life in Czernowitz during the first days of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Okay, so, June 22nd.</span> <span id="s81">We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitler’s voice.</span> <span id="s82">Two hundred Russian divisions are on border, we have to defend ourselves and have to go into the, the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s83">There were like probably eight or ten days of waiting period and then the Russians left.</span> <span id="s84">Quite a number of Jews left with them.</span> <span id="s85">I would estimate this as between eight and ten thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: From a population of?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, approximately.</span> <span id="s88">I was tempted to go as well.</span> <span id="s89">Quite a number of my friends went, but we were treated badly by the Russian leaders.</span> <span id="s90">Say, the, when we stayed at the office in the last day, they gave authorizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all the Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn’t give any to us.</span> <span id="s91">So I was afraid, at not myself just with some friends, that we would go and they wouldn’t even let us in.</span> <span id="s92">We were afraid of the Germans coming here, here as, as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with Lotte.</span> <span id="s93">She said, she said, “I never would leave my family, either.”</span> <span id="s94">And so we stayed and waited for a few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What happened when the Romanians and the Germans entered Czernowitz?</span> <span id="s96">What happened to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s98">This is just on hearsay.</span> <span id="s99">A few were, a few hundred, maybe a thousand or more were murdered in the first few days.</span> <span id="s100">I know about __________ worked, worked with me.</span> <span id="s101">And the chief rabbi, Dr. Mark(ph) and then they started taking us to manual labor, cleaning, then for some construction jobs but say, they came into the houses and took us.</span> <span id="s102">Then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Who, who came into the houses?</span> <span id="s104">Romanians or Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Romanian soldiers.</span> <span id="s106">No Germans, I think, were ever involved in any administration of any measures in Czernowitz at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Can I ask you another question?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Do you remember when and if a yellow star or another type of sign was introduced for the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I would say a few weeks, maybe only two weeks later.</span> <span id="s111">We were obliged to put on a yellow star.</span> <span id="s112">I remember exactly the day, when for the first time we came out into the street with yellow star.</span> <span id="s113">Two reactions remain in my memory.</span> <span id="s114">One reaction was a Romanian priest who passed us on the street, took off his hat.</span> <span id="s115">Another reaction was when the wife of a Romanian janitor who said, “That’s very good that this happens to you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Okay, next, it was very tough with, because, at this time there was no, not, not enough food.</span> <span id="s118">There was many other, there was no electricity, so we had to go and buy food and buy, buy kerosene.</span> <span id="s119">And you couldn’t get kerosene and food with the star.</span> <span id="s120">So we stayed and we _____ took off the stars and stayed in line and took kerosene.</span> <span id="s121">Few days later, a young student, military student, we had at that time I think this was a still high school for military high school, say in, in preparation for officer school.</span> <span id="s122">So a student of this school recognized me a day or two later that I didn’t have the star and he saw me with the star and took me to work in the, in the field.</span> <span id="s123">With other like 40 or 50 Jews.</span> <span id="s124">So we worked all day and in front of all of these, he, he picked me __________.</span> <span id="s125">Now, this didn’t go on for long.</span> <span id="s126">Because sometime, say mid-August, okay, I tried to get a permanent work so I wouldn’t be taken to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Forced labor.</span> <span id="s129">And I went to the railway station because a few years earlier, I was there as a student.</span> <span id="s130">We had to go every summer for practice and one of the summers, for two months, I worked in the railway station in what is called the maintenance section which maintained the track and the bridges and the, and the buildings.</span> <span id="s131">And the head of this section was the, at my time, he was the assistant head.</span> <span id="s132">So he recognized me and he talked this over with the, his chief which was the inspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work.</span> <span id="s133">Though at that time I got paid only the pay of a soldier and from then on and through this employment, I, I was not harassed again with forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Okay, can you describe where did you live, how was housing?</span> <span id="s135">If you could take your time and describe for us the process of ghettoization(ph) in Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">Okay.</span> <span id="s138">Now at that time, yeah, so let, yeah.</span> <span id="s139">Two of us, my brother who was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, we, he has not finished at that time, and myself, we came back when the, with the Russia occupation.</span> <span id="s140">My mother and my two sisters, they had quite a good apartment and we stayed all four of us together under, under the Soviet Occupation and continued then under the Romanians.</span> <span id="s141">Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there quite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had problems with food, but because in the Bukovina, like in all of Romania, food was plenty and then we got to barter different things from house.</span> <span id="s142">We bartered with the peasants and we got at that time food enough.</span> <span id="s143">Now, this is only say one more month because in October at that time, the ghetto started.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So what happened to you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: At __________ the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: So on October 11th, this was on the Sabbath Day, one morning, maybe the, the work was from eight to one and from four to seven at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What was, what was [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: I worked for the railway.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Oh I see, yeah I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: So before eight o’clock, I just ran across the street to say hello to Lotte and a neighbor of hers told me, “Mr. Engineer, would you read this to us?”</span> <span id="s152">The elderly people, elderly people miss our parents, didn’t still know no Romanian at that time.</span> <span id="s153">I read to her, it said, “There will be punished with death everybody who will house Jews, who will give shelter to people not, not entitled to and those who will help flee people away.”</span> <span id="s154">So I said to her, “I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s155">This has no relation to us.</span> <span id="s156">We don’t want to flee and we don’t want to give shelter,” and I read to her.</span> <span id="s157">One o’clock I came home for lunch and I saw already people on the street with backpacks.</span> <span id="s158">Say what happened?</span> <span id="s159">We have to go into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s160">So I came home and we packed.</span> <span id="s161">My family, they were already packed but we didn’t ever to go.</span> <span id="s162">So I went across the street to Lotte and she said, “We go to a cousin of mine who is in the street, in a street which belongs to the, lives in the street which belongs to the ghetto,” so we went.</span> <span id="s163">And then, there were 11 of us and my mother and her four, four children, Lotte and her sister and their parents and the fiancee of the sister, mother.</span> <span id="s164">We all went to this cousin of Lotte’s who lived not far from this place and we slept on the, the floor for a few days.</span> <span id="s165">Six o’clock in the evening, they, a barricade was, was built and we couldn’t get back, get out of the, of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s166">Next two days, there was just met on the street and discussed what is going to happen we’s, we were supposed to be __________ into Transnistria, which is a province east of Bessarabia, which Germany gave to the Romanians for __________.</span> <span id="s167">On, on October 14th, we were told that these three, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station.</span> <span id="s168">So we put all our belongings on a peasant cart.</span> <span id="s169">The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street to go to the railway station to the trains, bringing us Transnistria.</span> <span id="s170">In the meantime, while staying there, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go.</span> <span id="s171">And said, one lady said, “You know, engineers should stay.”</span> <span id="s172">So a Romanian major passed by and I said, “Mr. Major, I __________, should I stay or go?”</span> <span id="s173">He said, “Stay.”</span> <span id="s174">So I took with Lotte this cart which had all the belongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part of the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days.</span> <span id="s175">We had to bribe a soldier because he was supposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night only.</span> <span id="s176">Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) came to the Jewish Hospital which was the seat of the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, __________ we could __________ the community and said, “I have with you, I have for you good news,” he said.</span> <span id="s177">Because he talked to them in Germany, news was called paseera(ph) he said, “Paseera(ph) which is good news.</span> <span id="s178">You will stay.”</span> <span id="s179">And the day after, they opened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good house belonging to uncle of Lotte’s where we stayed for the next, ‘til the end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">But, okay, so I said . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: For how long did you stay in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: For almost, okay, so next day this good news from Parryom Poppovitch(ph) were not that good any more because we were told lists will be arranged by professions and then they will decide who stays, who goes.</span> <span id="s183">So, on this day, I said to Lotte, “Either we stay or we go, let us get married.”</span> <span id="s184">This was already the Friday after the Sabbath Day when the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s185">And I saw across the street from this house where __________ said, “Rabbi, we would like to get married.”</span> <span id="s186">He said, “Too late.”</span> <span id="s187">It was Friday, two o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So the rabbi said it’s too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">So next morning, we went to the commander of the ghetto who was a major of the Romanian army.</span> <span id="s191">The army was the supervised, this matter __________ and said, “Mr. Major, we would like to get married.”</span> <span id="s192">So he gave us a soldier, an escort and we went in the morning to the court because it would, the court had to give us a dispensation so we could get married without two weeks waiting.</span> <span id="s193">Then we went back in the afternoon, we went to City Hall.</span> <span id="s194">City was supposed to, they opened at five o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s195">__________ five o’clock in the evening, so we took this soldier four o’clock and I went first to the railway administration and they told us don’t worry, we have given, we have given the government all the names of our Jewish employees, you will stay.</span> <span id="s196">Then I went to our other place where my, where my brother worked and this lady took his name, all the personal data, said, “I will help him.”</span> <span id="s197">Then five o’clock we were married.</span> <span id="s198">The, all the employees in this registration office were very gentle.</span> <span id="s199">Either by themselves or the mayor was Parryom Poppovitch(ph) but the registrar who was a university professor, he told me, “Mr. Engineer,” before the procedure, “Mr. Engineer, I hope to celebrate for you __________Jews many more happy, many more happy occasions also here in Romania.”</span> <span id="s200">And then we went back home, they already, each __________ took out of his backpack whatever, __________ and this was our, our marriage ceremony.</span> <span id="s201">And we didn’t get, go on the honeymoon to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s202">Two days later I got two authorizations to stay, one on the list of the civil engineers, __________ 27 engineers say, took a number and then I got it from the, as a railway engineer.</span> <span id="s203">And my brother was a mining __________ so he got it too.</span> <span id="s204">Two days later, we went home.</span> <span id="s205">I think approximately 12 days after we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Let me, let me ask you if you witnessed, witnessed any scene of deportation of other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I was in the railway station and saw them going to the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I would say that I didn’t see anybody being beaten.</span> <span id="s210">Everything was orderly.</span> <span id="s211">They went with their backpacks to the trains and went on the train.</span> <span id="s212">There was no, this was already November 1941.</span> <span id="s213">In January ’41, they had these little squalor, or how you call it in, in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Uprising.</span> <span id="s216">Here...[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]...there was no brutality.</span> <span id="s217">Everybody went with his backpack quietly to the trains.</span> <span id="s218">I was told later when they came back, that they were chased across the __________, with, with brutality.</span> <span id="s219">But I didn’t witness, I, I witnessed only quiet, their quiet way into the, boarding the trains.</span> <span id="s220">Saw it, I saw it from the window of my offices.</span> <span id="s221">I would like __________ to end . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Because I already said this about the gentleness in the office of the registrar in, in the city hall.</span> <span

and 1942, during the spring of 1942, summer of 1942?</span> <span id="s228">What else happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Again, what I will say, yah, in the meantime, many business people, Romanian business people who left Czernowitz when the Russians came in plus other business people from Romania came in and opened the, their previous businesses.</span> <span id="s230">Plus, they were given the businesses of the Jews and the business of the Germans.</span> <span id="s231">During the Russian Occupation, the Germans emigrated to Germany.</span> <span id="s232">There was, this was an agreement between the Soviet and the German government.</span> <span id="s233">So there was a lot of business to be had in, in Czernowitz and many people from Romania came.</span> <span id="s234">If they needed, they needed __________and these were the __________ so they took them into and they, they may not have paid them very well but they were very happy to have people to carry on their business.</span> <span id="s235">So, somehow, a rule of law was back and you had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s236">And we had the curfew at eight o’clock in the evening.</span> <span
