And unfortunately, they were all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: How long had your parents’ families lived in the towns that they were born in?</span> <span id="s42">How far back generations can you go?</span> <span id="s43">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: They lived there all their lives as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s46">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: And when my mother met my father and married, she moved to Waszkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s49">Do you know how they met?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: A-Actually yes.</span> <span id="s51">They were introduced.</span> <span id="s52">My grandpar -- my -- my grandmother -- my great-grandparents, my grandmother’s parents lived in Waszkow and they knew, they said, a very nice young man.</span> <span id="s53">And so they were introduced, and at that time you didn’t even hold hands in the street and I think they saw them holding hands and it was really not very ladylike.</span> <span id="s54">She got reprimanded for that.</span> <span id="s55">But he was -- they were really meant for each other.</span> <span id="s56">He was a wonderful person from what I heard and they had a very loving and wonderful marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What year did they get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: They got married in 1934, and two years later I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s60">And let’s again talk about -- and I know this is what you’ve heard, obviously, cause you weren't born --</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: -- ri -- of course.</span> <span id="s63">Were they a very religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My mother came from a very pious family.</span> <span id="s65">My grandfather had a -- a long beard, and of course everything was homemade.</span> <span id="s66">I heard my grandmother was an excellent balabusta.</span> <span id="s67">She made everything from scratch and she sewed beautifully.</span> <span id="s68">I -- she sewed outfits for me as well.</span> <span id="s69">And we lived -- my grandmother lived with us, my father’s mother, who was also a very pious woman.</span> <span id="s70">She wore a sheitel which is a wig, and va -- she was with us during the war and of course, died in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s72">Were your -- what -- what language did you speak, did your parents speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Thanks to my grandmother, at the time the Jewish people spoke German, the more cultured families wanted expose their children to German at home.</span> <span id="s74">But since my grandmother [indecipherable] lived with us, she insisted and she said, I do not want my grandchild speaking deutschmueller she used to refer to it, making fun of the German language, but I want her to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s75">So my very first language, my mamalashen was Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s77">And again, just tell me a little bit about your father’s business, just a little more elaboration.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s79">He employed people in the textile -- they had textile machines.</span> <span id="s80">They had it -- it’s attached to the house and they manufactured peasants’ skirts and shawls and -- which they sold in their dry goods store to the villagers.</span> <span id="s81">Beautiful, colorful fabrics and he was doing well because his sister said, maybe you should come to the United States and he was finally getting on his feet and he said no, we’re doing well here in Europe.</span> <span id="s82">And he was in business together with his brother-in-law, his sister’s husband.</span> <span id="s83">And we shared a two -- was a two family home.</span> <span id="s84">And so things were going well for us, I had dolls and doll carriages and I would play outside and was a happy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Do you have any memories of -- of the town?</span> <span id="s86">Can you describe the town at all, or what your mother told you about the town later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well, the Jews pretty much lived in the same area.</span> <span id="s88">Was a pretty modern town.</span> <span id="s89">My father went to shul every Shabbat.</span> <span id="s90">He had a beautiful voice, I guess I’ve inherited that from him, and he used to be the[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s91">He also belonged to the Havra Kadisha, which is the burial society.</span> <span id="s92">Very giving, as my grandmother was, they were very pious.</span> <span id="s93">He had a sukkah and at that time only the men would eat in the sukkah and the children.</span> <span id="s94">And my mother told me that he would take me to shul every Shabbat.</span> <span id="s95">And I think -- I didn’t know that, but I loved going to services, and I too like to conduct the services, I’m a shuli hatsidore, and to follow in his footsteps, years later I -- I became part of the Havra Kadisha also --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s97">Now, what would be your very first memory?</span> <span id="s98">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Of my town?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s101">Or of your life, your first memory.</span> <span id="s102">The earliest memories [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My earliest memories were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Had a -- had a happy, loving childhood.</span> <span id="s106">Would visit my grandparents and they adored me.</span> <span id="s107">My aunts, uncles.</span> <span id="s108">So for the most part it was loving, and -- but my grandmother who lived with us didn’t allow me to take my toys -- oh, she said, she’ll use it up.</span> <span id="s109">Why is she always in the street playing with the children?</span> <span id="s110">And -- course, it was very short-lived, but it was a happy childhood.</span> <span id="s111">I was with my cousin, who was just eight months younger and I recall it being happy and content.</span> <span id="s112">We had a radio, we had running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: You lived in a house in the center of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: We lived in a house, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Right in the center of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: More or less, I believe, but I really don’t recall exactly.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t have an address.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s119">Now, do you have memories of that town at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: The street where I played, yes.</span> <span id="s121">Some memories, whether they’re my own or because they were related to me.</span> <span id="s122">When I would come to my grandparents in the little village, they would give me a bath outside.</span> <span id="s123">And I would watch my grandmother make her own butter, and how she churned it.</span> <span id="s124">It’s just fragmented memories here.</span> <span id="s125">I do remember a Sukkor here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Any -- any favorite songs as a young, young child, from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: That I really don’t remember, just is -- I remember sadness after that, that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s129">Well let’s -- when did things start to change from this happy childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, the -- as I recall, the Russians came in first and they drafted all young men.</span> <span id="s131">They drafted my father into the army and that was -- we did not know, but it was to be the last time that I saw him, when we said our goodbyes and he left on a train with other soldiers.</span> <span id="s132">My uncle got out of it because of -- I don’t know how, but he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s133">So he was the head of that whole family, with my mother and I and luckily her sister, who was sent to live with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you -- do you have any memories of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Do I have memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Of your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Of my father?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: He was a tall man, a handsome man, very loving, always smiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And you remember -- that’s what I’m saying, cause you were so young when he left, but you do remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I don’t know if it’s exactly my memory or what I’ve been told, cause it’s -- was a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s143">Right.</span> <span id="s144">So he went off the Russian army and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s146">Then the war broke out [indecipherable] in ’41, and the Jews were told, we were told that we would be evacuated and we had to be ready within 48 hours and we could only take whatever we could carry with us, whatever was on our backs and in a little knapsack.</span> <span id="s147">Even though I was only four years old, I do recall when they first came marching into town, my cousin had gone up to the attic and he was looking outside.</span> <span id="s148">And soldiers saw him and I remember they came knocking on the door with bayonets and my mother said for us to hide under the beds.</span> <span id="s149">So the children, we hid under the beds, and they said, where is this spy?</span> <span id="s150">She said there were no spies, this was a child that was looking out the window, she saw you marching.</span> <span id="s151">No, we saw a spy.</span> <span id="s152">And they came with the bayonets, they came into my mother’s bedroom, that I do recall and they opened the closet door and were looking.</span> <span id="s153">And we were afraid, we were whimpering under the bed and they made us come out from under the bed.</span> <span id="s154">We were lucky, they didn’t sh -- and my cousin admitted that he was the one that was looking at them, and my mother begged them and said, don’t harm these children, my husband went into the war, he’s a soldier and please don’t -- don’t harm them.</span> <span id="s155">That’s all I recall and so our lives --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What -- what -- what did the soldiers look like to you, would -- when you were such a young child?</span> <span id="s157">Do you have any memory of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Mean.</span> <span id="s159">I was -- it was horrible experience.</span> <span id="s160">I was really shivering, we were very frightened that we would be shot.</span> <span id="s161">You know, they accused us of being spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s163">But you all -- I’m sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was a frightening experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Do you have a memory of this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: That I do have a memory of.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Some things distinctly I have a memory of.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Now, these are German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: There were -- I’m not exactly clear if they were German or Romanians who worked hand in hand with the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Yeah, okay, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s172">So then they left your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Then they left my house.</span> <span id="s174">I then -- next thing we knew we had to pack up and my mother dressed me in layers of clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What did she tell you was happening, now here you are just a ch -- such a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: We have to leave.</span> <span id="s177">We have to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s178">[indecipherable] child wanted -- I wanted to be with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: She -- she dressed me.</span> <span id="s181">I-I didn’t want to wear so many things.</span> <span id="s182">I -- I must have worn about four or five layers and on top of it, coats.</span> <span id="s183">And then I -- as little as I was, I had to have a knapsack on my back, carrying other belongings, with no toys, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: You took nothing personal, no dolls, no anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: No dolls, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: No books, no toys?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s188">And the funny part was that they took -- well, my mother took my father’s suits, thinking that -- that when he would return she wanted some clothes for him.</span> <span id="s189">And she took his tallit.</span> <span id="s190">So that tallit was with us.</span> <span id="s191">She also took the down pillows and -- and some quilts along.</span> <span id="s192">So they really carried large bundles and then we had the -- the Jewish star on, that we had to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: By that time you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: The yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s196">Do you re --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: And then we -- we went -- were to be transported to a -- a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you remember wearing the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Do I remember wearing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: I do remember wearing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Do you remember any feelings about that?</span> <span id="s203">Did you know what it meant?</span> <span id="s204">Again, I un -- you were so young.</span> <span id="s205">Did it mean anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: It meant that I was different.</span> <span id="s207">It was frightening.</span> <span id="s208">I saw a lot of people, we were packed like sardines and they didn’t tell us where we were going, but they said our destination was Margulav, which afterwards turned out to be -- that was a death camp.</span> <span id="s209">However, my grandmother’s half-brother was on that transport as well.</span> <span id="s210">He was very well-to-do.</span> <span id="s211">And he heard in the middle of the night that some soldiers -- we were at that point in a resting place, and a -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Now you were -- you were on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah, after the train they brought us to a -- it’s a -- was a great big hall with -- with hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s214">I know I -- I had a terrible earache there, I remember that.</span> <span id="s215">And in the middle of the night my uncle disappeared and then he came back.</span> <span id="s216">And he said, we’re gonna leave this transport.</span> <span id="s217">It’s dangerous, but we’re gonna leave because some of the Romanian soldiers were taking bribes and my grandmother had sewn some money in her bras and in her girdle.</span> <span id="s218">I had asked her why she was doing that and she said, well, I’m an old lady -- she considered herself old then, she probably was just in her -- her 40’s -- if they shoot me, but we never know, it may save our lives.</span> <span id="s219">And sure enough, the soldiers who took the bribe, they took us over the Dniester, D-n-i-e-s-t-e-r river.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Let’s back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s221">From your home --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Th-That’s okay.</span> <span id="s224">Wi -- from your home to the train, how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: We walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: You walked.</span> <span id="s227">With -- with other villi -- with other Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: -- people [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: With other Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And you got to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: You know, like Anna Cheska it reminded me.</span> <span id="s233">When I saw that, I said oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah, it really hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s237">And you got to the train station and you all got on the train.</span> <span id="s238">Was it a train with seats?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: You know, that I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Okay, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Remember standing, but I don’t really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s243">So now your -- your uncle said, we’re gonna leave this transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s245">Right, but they took us over to the river to a place called Chargolat, which was also in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s246">It was the Ukraine, but it was a labor camp, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: And many a soldier -- th-these were barges we were on, and they drowned -- many of the Jews were drowned, the soldiers just threw them in the -- in the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did you as a child see this, or you heard it --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: I saw this.</span> <span id="s251">A soldier was holding me, and my mother’s anguished look.</span> <span id="s252">He knew that she was on the verge of tears, she said please don’t hurt my child.</span> <span id="s253">And he said -- there were -- really God answered me, I da -- I believe.</span> <span id="s254">He said, do not worry.</span> <span id="s255">I have a child this age at home, I am not going to harm her.</span> <span id="s256">I was blonde.</span> <span id="s257">I had brown eyes and I think he said I reminded him of his child.</span> <span id="s258">So there were kindnesses that I do remember and thank God that we did make it across.</span> <span id="s259">Then our good luck was also the people that took us in, they were prima -- it was a labor camp, but we’d have to find our own housing.</span> <span id="s260">And the person that took us in wa -- they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s261">They were also part of the labor camp, but he had one of his children, his oldest child, who was engaged [indecipherable] went to the riverbank to see which people looked suitable, they looked balabatish to take in.</span> <span id="s262">We were nine people.</span> <span id="s263">They had a primitive clay house, that is a one bedroom with a hearth in the center.</span> <span id="s264">They were a family of four taking in ni -- they had to take in, they had no choice, so they picked -- they picked us, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s265">They picked nine of us.</span> <span id="s266">He was a butcher, the gentleman who -- who was the owner of the house, and he took us in.</span> <span id="s267">It was my mother and I, my grandmother and her sister, and then my father’s sister and her husband, two children and my uncle’s mother, Baba Chana.</span> <span id="s268">So they took all of us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Now, is this 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No, this was in 1941, September of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Oh, September of ’41, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And the reason I -- I asked, I said how come my mother wasn’t -- I don’t recall her being -- for some reason they had mercy, that if you had a small child, they didn’t take you into the labor camp.</span> <span id="s275">Her sister worked in the tobacco fields and she also worked in an area where they dried apples and fruit and tomatoes.</span> <span id="s276">She wasn’t allowed to -- she would have been shot if she would had taken any food out.</span> <span id="s277">Thus we experienced a lot of hunger.</span> <span id="s278">Whatever we could get, that’s -- luckily my aunt, who was very handy with a needle and she -- she sewed beautifully and she knitted beautifully.</span> <span id="s279">And she found some people from home who were not Jewish, but they were also transported to this camp.</span> <span id="s280">The two women who gave her work to do on the side, and after she came home from labor, and in exchange, they would give her food here and there.</span> <span id="s281">So we would have a potato floating in the water.</span> <span id="s282">I would have a -- a piece of bread with some oil occasionally.</span> <span id="s283">But as a child I remember you -- we found other -- even though I saw death, I saw people dying in the street and starving, they didn’t have a roof over their heads, and as primitive as the conditions were -- there was no running water, there was no -- there were no toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s284">I remember going in a pail, having to go outside in the very bitter cold of the winter.</span> <span id="s285">My aunt and uncle stayed with us only for one year, but then they -- they left, they went to a different camp.</span> <span id="s286">It was ju -- we just couldn’t make it together, it was too hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: But up to that point you were all living with that family of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: All living with that family but my mother and I stayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What was their name -- wa -- what was the name of the family, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s291">I found out.</span> <span id="s292">Yoshka Nousins Brytank.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s295">Brytburt, Brytburt.</span> <span id="s296">Yoshka Nousins Brytburt.</span> <span id="s297">That was his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And what were they like to you?</span> <span id="s299">What di --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: They were very nice actually.</span> <span id="s301">They -- they had nothing so they couldn’t share with us.</span> <span id="s302">But you can imagine ah -- all I remember is so many of us in this one great big room.</span> <span id="s303">They had a bedroom, but we had to find sleeping quarters for nine of us.</span> <span id="s304">My uncle had typhoid fever and they were very, very nice, they let us -- let him be in the bedroom when he was so ill, they di -- they didn’t want him to infect the rest of us, and he was lucky, he made it.</span> <span id="s305">But it was a very, very hard time and I remember my aunt would get very upset with my cousin who was older.</span> <span id="s306">She said, why don’t you steal like other children, so we could have a piece of bread?</span> <span id="s307">And -- and he said, I can’t do it, I can’t.</span> <span id="s308">It’s not in my nature, I will not do it.</span> <span id="s309">And that’s when they decided to leave and see if they, you know, they -- they didn't want it to be a burden.</span> <span id="s310">Here we were women, all women, and it was hard for her to leave her mother behind, cause her mother is the one that stayed with us, my grandmother, but she also had her husband’s mother and so they went to a different camp where she worked on -- on hats, and -- a different labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Did the host family have children?</span> <span id="s312">You said there were four or --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes, they had two, they were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: They were older?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: They had two older children, yeah, one was about to be married.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, the ho -- so what were they -- what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You were there for a few years in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: -- in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: We were there until ’44, April of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Okay, but staying in this same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: In this same house.</span> <span id="s324">I watched my grandmother [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s325">She died in that house, she had stomach cancer.</span> <span id="s326">And she had shrouds that were being made for her and I would ask her -- you know, a child is very inquisitive, what are these?</span> <span id="s327">Why is all this white?</span> <span id="s328">And she said, that’s for when they bury me.</span> <span id="s329">And she had a little sack of soil that her brother was able to get for her, it was the soil from Israel, as you know, traditionally that’s what we’re buried with.</span> <span id="s330">And she knew that her son would never come back, she had that feeling.</span> <span id="s331">And she never was to see her daughters again, the one from the United States and she didn’t know what would happen to us either, we were all in danger.</span> <span id="s332">And when she died, she -- oh, she asked me, she said, I want you to light the candles.</span> <span id="s333">But what they didn’t do, they didn’t take me to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s334">I remember they did the taharat, they prepared her body for burial right in that room where we lived.</span> <span id="s335">And that was such a -- such a traumatic things for me.</span> <span id="s336">And of course when the finished I lit the candle, but then they took her away and they didn’t let me come to the ceremony.</span> <span id="s337">Klainer kinder, little children you don’t take to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s338">That is imbedded in my memory, I will never forget that, it was really, really difficult.</span> <span id="s339">It was my first experience with -- with loss, somebody close like that who died.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: But what -- when did she die?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I -- you know, I don’t know exactly, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Do you know what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I think it was about a year and a half in [indecipherable] I wou -- I would think it would be about f -- I would say ’42 - 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: So she did have a -- a burial site.</span> <span id="s346">She was the only one of my grandparents who -- well, she and her -- her husband of course died in World War I. I don’t recall them saying that he had a -- a burial ground, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s347">But -- so that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: All right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: As far as what did I do there, we played with little stones.</span> <span id="s350">My mother made a -- a rag doll for me out of straw.</span> <span id="s351">What kept us alive was cleanliness.</span> <span id="s352">My mother had to go about a mile and a half to a running -- running water where she would do our laundry, made sure that we were clean.</span> <span id="s353">And I fell into that river once.</span> <span id="s354">I went with my mother and -- and my cousin, and my cousin suddenly said, Tante Tavu, there’s a kinder in wasser.</span> <span id="s355">Aunt Tavu, there’s a little child in the water.</span> <span id="s356">And my mother takes a look and that little child is -- is her daughter, and she did not know how to swim, so luckily she was doing our sheets and she threw the sheet in and she told me to grab onto it, and I did, but I did not speak for three days.</span> <span id="s357">They had me lying down, I -- that I remember cause to me it was like witchcraft.</span> <span id="s358">There was this woman that came and -- and broke an egg on my forehead and she started talking -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: -- after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, I could not speak, so they brought in this woman who broke an egg on my forehead.</span> <span id="s361">She said all kinds of abra kadabra language that was not familiar to me.</span> <span id="s362">I still didn’t speak, it was traumatic for me, and for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: This was a Jewish woman, or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I really don’t know, the -- yes, she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s365">They called in a specialist, so to speak, and luckily after three days I -- I came back and started speaking.</span> <span id="s366">But this was the second time that my mother almost lost me and it was very frightening for -- for her.</span> <span id="s367">But as a child I -- I found other children, we played with little rocks and there was even a little pre-kindergarten class organized by people and I remember going and learning my very first Hebrew, because you had to say what you were bringing.</span> <span id="s368">So I had [speaks Hebrew] which okay, bread and -- and some oil, occasionally.</span> <span id="s369">It was very brief, I recall fragments, you know.</span> <span id="s370">We learned a song here and there and I was with other children.</span> <span id="s371">And even though the times were horrible and I saw starvation and people begging in the streets and death, somehow as a child you find some happiness with other children, you just -- I mean, I saw a lot of sadness but I guess to protect yourself you just want to step back and live in your own little dream world.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Who -- who is the teacher of the class, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I really don’t recall her name.</span> <span id="s374">I can find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: No.</span> <span id="s376">No.</span> <span id="s377">And were your warm, did you have enough food, do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, food, we were always hungry, no.</span> <span id="s379">I remember being cold, being hungry.</span> <span id="s380">Yes, we did have clothing from home that, you know, luckily when we dressed in all those layers.</span> <span id="s381">And our own bedding that my mother carried with us, so that s -- that saved us.</span> <span id="s382">And there was a potbellied stove and they -- they did heat it, but the winters were bitter there, bitter cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: How did your mother explain to you as a young child what was happening?</span> <span id="s384">Do -- did she say any -- tell you anything special, maybe a story, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: She herself was just so forlorn, not knowing where her husband was, not hearing a thing about him.</span> <span id="s386">Not knowing anything about her parents or the fate of her -- her sibling.</span> <span id="s387">She was loving and -- but I -- I really don’t recall the stories she made up for me.</span> <span id="s388">They were bad people, she said.</span> <span id="s389">Do anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: -- to good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: -- did you know there was a war going on, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: What did war mean to --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: How could I not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Well, what did war mean to a young child like you?</span> <span id="s397">What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Separation.</span> <span id="s399">I -- I heard bombing.</span> <span id="s400">I heard what was going on.</span> <span id="s401">Noises always scared me, I s -- dogs always scared me, because I had seen dogs chasing people, and I have -- to this day when I see a German Shepherd, I hate it.</span> <span id="s402">My friend had to put her German Shepherd out in a kennel whenever we’d come to visit, because I just would not even get up from the table.</span> <span id="s403">And this was a friendly dog, but he was ju -- i-it just -- I couldn’t st -- deal with it.</span> <span id="s404">To this day.</span> <span id="s405">So there are some things that I -- I hate the -- the noise, it always startled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: So what was the typical day for you, do you remember?</span> <span id="s407">You would wake up in the morning --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: It was an existence.</span> <span id="s409">We would wake up hungry, we’d see what there was to eat, we had something to drink.</span> <span id="s410">Nutrition was very poor, no milk, no -- you know, the hygiene too.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t remember brushing teeth and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: That’s why my teeth are so horrible, and as a result I -- I was sick after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did the other children that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: There weren’t many that I saw, many children, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did you all t -- do you m -- do you remember if you talked about what was happening, about the war?</span> <span id="s417">Or you ju --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No -- I don’t re --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- you just played children’s games?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: We just played with, you know, my cousin and then they left and -- and then I found some other children and my mother was with me.</span> <span id="s421">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Were -- did you hear any speeches?</span> <span id="s423">Did you ever hear Hitler make a speech?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes, I heard speeches before we were deported, because we had a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: And yes, it was like the wild man talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Da -- and you knew ger -- did you know German, or just Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No, I -- I just heard how it was said, it was -- sounded horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: You knew hatred and I guess my parents explained it.</span> <span id="s433">But they really didn’t know what was going on either, nobody knew exactly what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Did you see any swastikas?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Did I see swastikas, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s439">And in -- di -- were you -- were you able in Shagara to walk around by yourself?</span> <span id="s440">Again, you were very young, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: You had to stay close to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I stayed close to the house, did not go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did you ever talk to the non-Jewish children, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Didn’t see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Didn’t see any, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Never went to the market, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Not even to the market?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So for those years you were just in the house and --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I mean, I don’t know if I want to blot that memory out, but it’s not a pleasant memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: But I did have this memory of -- of playing with some stones and a little rag doll and going with my mother to the river to wash clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: What was the stone game that you played?</span> <span id="s459">A: You know I don’t -- I don’t -- I can’t remember, we -- my mother said we found little things that made us happy and -- and we played for hours just with other children, and conversing.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">Did you ask about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: And singing.</span> <span id="s463">Yes.</span> <span id="s464">She said well, after the war, maybe he’ll come back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: You hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s468">You said something about singing.</span> <span id="s469">Did you have any songs at that time that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Don’t recall any but my mother said I learned a couple of Hebrew songs here and there and I w -- I wish I had written down what, but I have no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did -- did you start to learn how to write?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Yeah, not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: So no reading, no writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, my only schooling was right after we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s478">But up to that point it was no reading and no writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s481">So the days --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: That I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: -- yeah -- the days went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: The days went on, seemed like forever, and then right before liberation, our --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Which was -- wa -- your -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Which was -- we were liberated in April of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: So you started in September ’41, you said, in ch -- in ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: We -- we got there September ’41 --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: ’41 and April ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: -- and the Russians liberated us in ’44.</span> <span id="s491">But the night before liberation there was a lot of -- a lot going on in the camp and people were afraid because they were going to be bombings, you know, the front was pushing towards that area.</span> <span id="s492">And so the [indecipherable] from our -- our landlord, so to speak, they had a house with a basement and a sub-basement and they took us into a sub-basement where we were all hiding.</span> <span id="s493">They had a -- a little boy who suddenly disappeared and they were afraid for him because he ran out in the street.</span> <span id="s494">And that’s how we found out though that the Russians actually came, because he was out and when he came back he reported that there was drinking in the street and he saw Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s495">So in -- I guess the front broke through and at that point we knew that the war was over.</span> <span id="s496">And then our -- our journey back home, so to speak, began.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s498">We’ll get to that, of course.</span> <span id="s499">You knew, you said, that the war was over.</span> <span id="s500">Now again, what did that mean to a child of your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: It meant that I was going home.</span> <span id="s502">I thought I was going back to my house.</span> <span id="s503">I thought I would reunite with my father, I thought I would see my grandparents again, my aunts and uncles, which unfortunately was not to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: But there was euphoria, there was happiness that we lived through that horrible period so far, and we were going to pick up the pieces and go back, what we thought was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: But when you were in Shargarat, did you see people going off to work in the streets?</span> <span id="s507">It was a camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah, my aunt left every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So you knew it was a place where people would go off --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: -- to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: But did you see groups of people marching, going off to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I saw marching and I saw people begging in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s520">And what was your mother’s state of mind when she knew the Russians had broken through?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What was your mother’s state of mind when she knew that the Russians had broken through?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Oh, was not too good.</span> <span id="s524">She was ra -- always sad, but she put up a good front for me, and I guess her mother-in-law, who was a lovely woman, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So you were seven -- s-seven years old?</span> <span id="s526">In ’44, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: In ’40 -- in ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: You were eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: You were eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s533">And so then how s -- how much longer did you stay in Shagara after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Oh, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s535">We left as soon as we were liberated.</span> <span id="s536">We left -- I -- don’t ask me, we got on a train and we went back to Waszkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Was it hard to say goodbye to the people you lived with?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: No -- yes and no, you know, we thanked them, of course, that they took us in, we were very grateful.</span> <span id="s539">And they finally had their house to themselves, but it was very primitive compared to the home that we’d left.</span> <span id="s540">When we came back to Waszkow, the Russians -- the Iron Curtain set in, and the same real estate people that my aunt was working for when she came to visit -- not visit, to stay with my parents because her father wanted her out when the Russians initially came.</span> <span id="s541">He -- he was in charge of a bank, so he invited my aunt to come and work for the bank.</span> <span id="s542">But when we went to our house, it was used as a silo, and they said no, you cannot -- they had product there, you cannot come in.</span> <span id="s543">My mother said look, my husband was fighting the war at that time, he’s a soldier and I just want the pictures that I have in the attic.</span> <span id="s544">Can I go into the attic, cause I don’t have any pictures.</span> <span id="s545">And they did let her go in the attic, I don’t -- and where we were permitted to live was my great-grandparents house was converted for the returnees, those who came back home but they couldn’t go into their home.</span> <span id="s546">So we were given a room in my great-grandparents house --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: -- which was not far from where we used to live, okay.</span> <span id="s549">And I started going to kindergarten --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Okay, th -- what did your mother find in the attic of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: She found pictures, but she didn’t find the money that she had hidden [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So she took the photographs --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: She got -- took the photo album and took the pictures, right.</span> <span id="s554">They were precious, cause some people have lost -- my husband didn’t have a picture left, nothing.</span> <span id="s555">He’s just told how beautiful -- what a beautiful baby he was, but he never saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Was the furniture and everything in the house, was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Nothing, everything was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Oh, it wasn’t the furniture that you ha -- your parents had had?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, no, no, no, was converted into a silo, they had --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Oh, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: -- no, they had products there, no.</span> <span id="s562">No, no, nothing was -- was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Did you also go inside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Did I?</span> <span id="s565">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Only my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: And there [indecipherable] my mother put herself in danger with my aunt -- oh, and my aunt came too, from the other labor camp, we were together again.</span> <span id="s570">And they would sell different products so that we could have food on the table.</span> <span id="s571">And of course my aunt had a job.</span> <span id="s572">And then my uncle again found out that if he falsified -- there was a -- a Pole that he knew, a friend.</span> <span id="s573">And he said to him, I’m going to register my family, cause I want to get out.</span> <span id="s574">You should also see if you can have false papers drawn up, because I would suggest that you leave this place, it’s going to be hard to leave Russia, if you don’t leave -- we were there for a brief period of time.</span> <span id="s575">We got there April ’44, and we were out by -- by ’40 -- ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What part of --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Na -- we were there about a year, not even a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What were your -- y-you talk about your aunt --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: [indecipherable] excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: You -- you -- you talk about your aunt and uncle, what -- what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Oh, my uncle’s name was [indecipherable] oh, Mendel.</span> <span id="s582">Mendel.</span> <span id="s583">Mendel Machlovich.</span> <span id="s584">He was married to my father’s sister Esther.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s587">And this -- a friend of -- of my Uncle Mendel, Mr. Schlitz, his wife was Polish, so he knew -- he told us that all ethnic Poles were going to leave the Iron Curtain and that’s when he told him to have these papers falsified.</span> <span id="s588">And Mendel, my uncle, decided to lie and say they were Polish so they would get then into Poland.</span> <span id="s589">And he went with my mother and registered me, that’s when he made me the two years younger.</span> <span id="s590">And my aunt was -- he said that my aunt was his sister.</span> <span id="s591">I don’t know what he made my mother into, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: What was the purpose in making you two year younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Because he had a child that was eight months old and it -- I couldn’t be older because he had another -- he had a son, so he thought that if I would be younger than his daughter, it would make more sense.</span> <span id="s594">So they got these false papers and my aunt was not allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s595">We were all on the train, ready to leave, and my aunt worked in the bank.</span> <span id="s596">My mother went to beg her empl -- her sister’s employer’s wife to please speak to her husband and let -- and let her s -- only sister go.</span> <span id="s597">Oh, and what I didn’t bring up, my mother and aunt found out the fate of their parents.</span> <span id="s598">They wanted to go back to the little village where their parents lived, but as it turned out they found a neighbor of my grandparents who was living in Waszkow aft-after liberation, and they inquired.</span> <span id="s599">They said, what happened to our parents?</span> <span id="s600">Well, they proceeded to give them the blow by blow description.</span> <span id="s601">The Ukrainians worked hand in hand with -- you know, they were anti-Semites too, and they were glad to comply with the government, you know, to get rid of the Jews, and this way they had their belongings because my aunt saw him wear -- my mother did too, my grandfather’s shirt.</span> <span id="s602">And when they went to the house they saw -- you know, they prepared a hope chest.</span> <span id="s603">My aunt would have been the next one to get married and my grandmother already started a hope chest for her and they saw that there and they saw some of the furnishings.</span> <span id="s604">And they said that my grandfather escaped briefly, but they said there was HaSharah, they used to train religious boys in kibbutz life and there was a ri -- so he -- he went there for awhile because he said they won’t touch the families, yes.</span> <span id="s605">Well, he came back, he came back the day after his wife, my grandmother, the three aunts and my uncle were butchered.</span> <span id="s606">I call it butchered because they were, with farm implements, they killed each and every one of them.</span> <span id="s607">And they left the remains and they showed him the remains.</span> <span id="s608">And then for some reason they had mercy and shot him instead of killing him with the farm implements.</span> <span id="s609">And this man, this neighbor described it to my mother.</span> <span id="s610">It was horrible, so we -- we know exactly the date when they were killed, the 10th of Tammuz, which was on a July -- I have it down here --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Do you know what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: It was in 19 -- just -- it was on ju -- on July fifth, but I don’t know the -- the 10th of Tammuz, and he was a day later.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s615">Which was -- which was horrible because my mother just tore the earrings out of her -- you know, when she heard all that, and you know, they became orphans in -- in a sense and -- and my father’s best friend came home and we asked him what happened to my father, where was my father.</span> <span id="s616">And when he related he also gave us, you know, cause it’s very important to the Jewish people to know the exact Yahrzeit and when.</span> <span id="s617">Of course they had no burial, none of them did, but at least he came back giving us when, the seventh day of Av, it’s always two days before Tisha B’Av.</span> <span id="s618">For me it’s a Tisha B’Av because from the time I was little I had to say Kaddish for him.</span> <span id="s619">Of course then it was only Orthodox, so the girls didn’t say, so that’s when I found out I -- I didn’t have a father any more.</span> <span id="s620">And that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s621">He was always -- I always missed having a father in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: And gra -- and loving grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s625">So you -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: -- actually remember hearing that your father was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: You d -- you do remember hearing the news that your father was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Oh yeah, oh yes, they told me.</span> <span id="s631">And I went to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: How did you handle that as a child, after being --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Hard, it was hard.</span> <span id="s634">I, of course, cried and I -- I was envious of my cousin who had her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: And she -- they were never set -- separated from him.</span> <span id="s637">But -- and I had the love of my mother and -- and her sister and then I went to school and I remember the Russian soldiers looking over my report card and -- and saying, oh you’re such a good student [Russian] means outstanding, outstanding.</span> <span id="s638">But I was very scared, I used to walk to school through the woods.</span> <span id="s639">And I had to recite poetry from memory, remembering -- I learned Russian, Ukrainian, we learned -- and we were told to kiss Stalin’s picture cause these were -- these schools were run by communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: But you were now living --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I was living in -- in Waszkowitz, when we returned after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Right, but then you said you got new papers, you -- yo --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, no, no, but this is before we got papers to leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: -- I went to -- we were there for a year, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay, so this is the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: -- did complete -- yes, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: The year before we left of our own free will.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s653">So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: -- still using your name, you were still using your -- your correct name, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s658">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- yes, yes, yes, Lifschitz, right.</span> <span id="s660">And I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And you pi -- and you picked up Russian, you learned Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Picked up Ukrainian, they taught in the lower grades and I -- and some Russian, right, because I recited poetry and I -- I was scared to death, they don’t believe in Santa Claus, but they called him Ded Moroz there was, with a big tree and he was dressed like the Santa Claus, and I had to recite this poem in -- in Russian.</span> <span id="s663">And the anti-Semitism was there, even though i -- although we were told that he is the savior, Stalin, you kissed his picture whenever you saw him, you gave him [indecipherable] before I went to bed.</span> <span id="s664">Yes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did you know who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: He was a dictator.</span> <span id="s667">He -- I knew he was a ruler of Russia and they came and -- and took -- and there were a lot of pogroms even then, they -- they killed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s668">The Ukrainians killed Russians soldiers.</span> <span id="s669">There was a lot of murder going on.</span> <span id="s670">We couldn’t wait to get out.</span> <span id="s671">We got out of there just in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So you felt the danger during that year?</span> <span id="s673">A: Yeah, and a -- we would go out to leave ho -- at that point we were very happy to leave Waszkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: But what -- did your mother give you any freedom tha -- during that year that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Freedom, yeah, I walked to school, I went -- you know, I -- I don’t recall everything that happened to me.</span> <span id="s676">We lived there and -- until we were able to leave, and when we left our journey took forever.</span> <span id="s677">It took us three months and we had to cross different borders with false papers and at that point the israle -- Israeli underground, Israeli people were planted in Poland and in -- in -- in Czech -- in the Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia and in Salzburg, cause I was in Lódz and I was in --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Okay, let -- le-let’s do your journey now.</span> <span id="s679">So you’re le --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: The journey was -- that I remember, cause I was older and I remember how

remember is that it took us three months to get to Germany, to Munich where we finally got to a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s743">Now, did you go by train all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: We went by different trains, we hopped different trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: How did you hop it -- a train?</span> <span id="s746">How do you hop a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Illegally.</span> <span id="s748">We -- we did it at night, we were on coal cars, we -- when we were stopped -- we posed at one point as Greeks and they send us children and -- and we ask for mayim, mayim, and we showed them we wanted some water.</span> <span id="s749">The soldiers searched us, you know, we had to undress, my mother, I remember.</span> <span id="s750">It -- it was a very frightening time for us, and we found some places -- again, the s -- one man appeared that came from the town that my -- my uncle knew and he told us where to go, where it was safe to stay.</span> <span id="s751">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So what was your new name at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No, our name

B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Rita Lifschitz Rubinstein.</span> <span id="s764">This is tape number two, side A. And before we go on to talk about your experience in the DP camp, were there any instances where non-Jews helped you and your family out?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s766">When my aunt worked in the labor camp, she recognized one woman who was not Jewish [indecipherable] and her sister Lydia.</span> <span id="s767">One of them had worked in a pharmacy, a Jewish pharmacist.</span> <span id="s768">She was his assistant and she happened to be in Shargarat at the time and she needed some things that had to be fixed.</span> <span id="s769">This was not done, of course, during her work in labor camp, but after she would leave they would give her some extra work and in exchange they would give her some food that she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: What -- what kind of work would she give your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: She would do repairs and -- and a -- do some dresses for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: So this was dressmaking --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: She would sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: -- this was the dress --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes, dressmaking work.</span> <span id="s776">Tailoring, so to speak.</span> <span id="s777">And in exchange they would give her bread, and -- but she was very happy to share with us, and so we didn’t starve [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Any other instances besides that?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s780">After the -- the war when we came back to Waszkowitz, there was [indecipherable] whom she -- my aunts had worked in real estate for him, but when the Russians came he became a banker.</span> <span id="s781">He owned a bank and he invited her to work in the bank.</span> <span id="s782">So there she earned some money and we were able to purchase food and that sustained us again.</span> <span id="s783">My mother did a lot of smuggling with her -- her sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s784">They -- a-and that brought food to the table, too.</span> <span id="s785">Ma -- they exchanged credits, in other words, they did not do it legally.</span> <span id="s786">But we were very poor, we had nothing left after the war, no money and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: When you say food on the table, what kind of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: The -- what kind of foods?</span> <span id="s789">They fix bread, milk and -- and some butter and no luxuries.</span> <span id="s790">Cheeses.</span> <span id="s791">I don’t think they had a kosher butcher left, and we were very kosher then.</span> <span id="s792">It was mostly a -- dairy products.</span> <span id="s793">I don’t really remember any -- eating any meats at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s795">And -- and is -- was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Oh, and then there was another in-instance when we were trying to flee the Iron Curtain and we were at the train station when the son of the midwife who delivered both my mother and my aunt in their little town of Mili, or Mileev, he was married to a Polish woman and he was on the transport to go to -- to Poland.</span> <span id="s797">And he thought, so he knew he was able to go because of his wife being Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: But he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: No.</span> <span id="s800">And he knew that they were not really Poles, that we weren’t Poles, but he did not give it away.</span> <span id="s801">He did not go to the authorities and he pretended that he didn’t know us -- because in that instance he could have -- we probably wouldn't have been allowed to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: But you were and you did get away and now you --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: So, it was the third time, right, that we were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s807">And now you’re in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: So now we went to Lódz, we went to -- to Czechoslovakia, my aunt met her wonderful husband with other -- we were -- I know we met lots of refugees who were fleeing from different -- he was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s809">We were together, the un -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: How long did you stay at these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: -- the Israeli underground, they -- I should say organizers from Israel helped us travel through -- through the different areas and -- and found places for us to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And would you ever stay more than one or two nights in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: In some -- in some instances, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: But you were constantly moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Constantly moving by the kindness of strangers and other either Jewish families, or non-Jewish families.</span> <span id="s816">They knew where it was safe for us and we were constantly moving, constantly.</span> <span id="s817">Finally, finally we reached Munich.</span> <span id="s818">Yes, it was near Munich and [indecipherable] and that was a Displaced Persons camp and we were in barracks which were used for -- not the soldiers really, it was a camp for soldiers, but it was run by HIAS and -- the Hebrew sheltering society.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Before we get now to that --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: When you were traveling, those months --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: -- to get there, were there a lot of children in the group with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Not a lot of children.</span> <span id="s825">Oh, it was very sad because as you know, most children didn’t survive the war.</span> <span id="s826">A lot of children were murdered.</span> <span id="s827">And -- but in DP camp, you did find children.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yeah, but before the DP camp, were there any children in the group at all that you were traveling with?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Other than my cousins, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Really don’t recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: -- seeing a lot of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s835">Did y -- did you and your cousins do --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: But I did see families when we wer -- got on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Groups of people all the time and --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: -- also doing what we were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And di -- did you know what was happening, what was a nine year old’s perspective at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: We knew we were the -- we were de -- either destined to go to the United States or we wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You knew that at the time on your way to the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: That that was our goal, we knew that --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: -- we no longer had a home as far as we were concerned.</span> <span id="s847">Our home was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Le-Let’s -- let’s talk about what Israel and also the United States meant to a nine year old who had been through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did you know what Israel was?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: First of all, to a nine year old, it was my first taste of a formal Jewish school, where I was taught Hebrew, history -- we were like sponges, we were -- had a void in our lives.</span> <span id="s852">We didn’t have much of a childhood, we didn’t have time for play, we didn’t have time for study.</span> <span id="s853">And suddenly we were given mathematics and -- a-and the thirst for knowledge was unbelievab -- we had wonderful teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: This is in the camp -- in -- in Feldafing --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: This is in DP camp, in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: We were given one room, the conditions were certainly not plush, but we were given a room.</span> <span id="s858">My mother met a man from Germany, he had lost his wife and he was in Auschwitz and in Dachau and he lost a wife and son there.</span> <span id="s859">His daughter was on a Kindertransport to England, he didn’t know if she was alive.</span> <span id="s860">He was 15 years my mother’s senior, but people told my mother, who knew at the time she was probably going to go to the United States, but I -- my Zionism was, I think, embedded in me when I started going to the school there and the love of Israel and I will never forget the day that Israel was declared independent.</span> <span id="s861">We children -- the school was -- consisted of just maybe a hundred children.</span> <span id="s862">I have pictures of that, of DP camp.</span> <span id="s863">And yet we were so happy that those were happy times, cause we were free.</span> <span id="s864">And we danced all night in a bonfire and I told my mother, I am not going to the United States, I am going to tear up the papers.</span> <span id="s865">I’m a half an orphan, I wanted to go on the Exodus.</span> <span id="s866">My aunt did not -- even though she had two sisters in the United States, but my cousin was seven years older than I and he swam the channel already.</span> <span id="s867">He refused to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s868">But my mother said, my only sister, she had -- there was a quota system then.</span> <span id="s869">My aunt got married to a Lithuanian Jew and -- who lost his entire family and they were allowed to come -- immigrate to the United States right away, they left in 1946 -- ’47.</span> <span id="s870">’46 - ’47.</span> <span id="s871">And we did not leave until ’49, we had to wait for our quota system.</span> <span id="s872">In the meantime we had our physical exams and many of the children in the school were found to have TB.</span> <span id="s873">I was in a camp -- they had diagnosed it three months before they even told my mother, and then they told her that I indeed had TB and I had to go to a sanitarium, they called it a sanitarium then.</span> <span id="s874">And it was not in the same town, it was in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s875">And here I was, nine and a half, 10 years old.</span> <span id="s876">My mother took me there initially and she left me with all the other children.</span> <span id="s877">I was only able to see her once a week, it was not close.</span> <span id="s878">And when she came back and was looking for me, she said where is my daughter?</span> <span id="s879">And they said well, she is in quarantine.</span> <span id="s880">She has a bad case of TB and she cannot be with other children.</span> <span id="s881">So I was in that sanitarium for nine months.</span> <span id="s882">The treatment that I needed they only gave to people who had TB of the bones, not -- I had it in my lungs.</span> <span id="s883">And so they had to collapse a lung and th-the anti-Semitic nurses, they were not -- there were some people that were nice.</span> <span id="s884">The doctor that I had was wonderful, the Danish doctor who spoke to my mother.</span> <span id="s885">He said, I had TB as a child, I have a family now, don’t worry, your daughter will be okay.</span> <span id="s886">But luckily we had family here, so my mother wrote to them in the United States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me.</span> <span id="s887">In the meantime they had to perform surgery and the nurses would always tell me, you’re going to go through this test, it’s going to hurt.</span> <span id="s888">And they would give me tissues, you’re going to cry.</span> <span id="s889">And so I believe that my tolerance for pain was established there because I showed them how brave I could be, and no matter how much it hurt, I -- I didn’t give in.</span> <span id="s890">I -- I had to show them.</span> <span id="s891">I would write letters to my mother trying to calm her down because [indecipherable] said don’t worry, things will be okay.</span> <span id="s892">I -- and I remember my mouth, I had developed a terrible tooth infection, they had to send me to -- I had an abscess and I had to go through surgery, they sent me to a different hospital where suddenly I had my period at 10 and a half.</span> <span id="s893">And that was so frightening, that it -- I -- that I remember very vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Did you know what it represented, it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No, because my mother never talked to me about it, but of course the -- a friend, you found out through friends.</span> <span id="s896">And we didn’t have tampons, and we didn’t have -- it was rags, that was disgusting.</span> <span id="s897">But then finally you know, and the Americans brought over the pads and things.</span> <span id="s898">But I was frightened.</span> <span id="s899">There was a very nice counselor from HIAS who -- who would come to see me and she brought me a lot of handiwork to do.</span> <span id="s900">I still have an embroidery that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: This is while you’re still in solitary?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: While in -- I was in the sanitarium for nine months and I was in the quarantine for -- for three months.</span> <span id="s903">They performed surgery, I still have the scars.</span> <span id="s904">While I was under the knife, my mother came with the streptomycin -- this is before, and I used to get streptomycin shots every four hours all during the day and night.</span> <span id="s905">That was -- that was for three months.</span> <span id="s906">And after surgery I would console my mother, she just wished she had saved my letters, that I saw a bird and don’t worry, I’ll be fine and I’m feeling okay.</span> <span id="s907">But thank God I lived through it and came back to camp.</span> <span id="s908">My cousins couldn’t even say goodbye to me, they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s909">In the meantime they left for Israel because they were not allowed, but my aunt would come with my uncle and then of course we had a wonderful reunion first time we went to Israel before the Yom Kippur war, my husband and I. And I -I just can’t describe it, how we felt.</span> <span id="s910">We both kissed the soil of Israel and we were just so thrilled.</span> <span id="s911">But also I’ve been very happy in the United States.</span> <span id="s912">I’m glad that, you know, I did go with my mother, cause we did have a loving family here.</span> <span id="s913">I met my father’s sisters for the first time, who always sent packages while I was in the sanitarium.</span> <span id="s914">At that time they believed in feeding you.</span> <span id="s915">I was, you know, skinny after the war, but my fat cells grew in that sanitarium.</span> <span id="s916">Then they believed in feeding you a lot.</span> <span id="s917">Butter and all kinds of rich things.</span> <span id="s918">And they would send me clothing from my cousins and my cousins would blame me for being chubby.</span> <span id="s919">We had to eat because our cousin in Europe was starving.</span> <span id="s920">But with -- you know, the opportunities were here.</span> <span id="s921">We came --</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: But let us -- before we get to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: -- let’s talk a little more about -- about the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: -- yeah, about the camp.</span> <span id="s927">So you were in the sanitarium for nine months and they you went back to the camp itself.</span> <span id="s928">I -- y-you were in the sanitarium --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Oh, from the sanitarium --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: And then you were ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: -- for nine months, and f -- my mother visited me once a week only, which was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s933">And then you went back to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I went back to camp at -- yeah, and I went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s936">And what did you and the other kids talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: What was very sad for us and -- and a-at the same time rewarding too.</span> <span id="s938">I’ve always loved to sing and dance and we put on wonderful performances for the people.</span> <span id="s939">And that -- one performance I -- I was given solo a lot, with-without any formal training but I had a good voice and I loved to sing and we put on some really cute shows, even without the ballet outfits, I’ll show you the makeshift outfits they made for us.</span> <span id="s940">We always had managed with costumes and things.</span> <span id="s941">But they were a handful of kids, there were only a hundred of us or so.</span> <span id="s942">And there were people that came, survivors who came to see the shows, and one woman sat next to my mother and she pointed to me.</span> <span id="s943">She said, who knows if -- if the parents of this child is alive.</span> <span id="s944">There were so many children -- I had friends there that -- whose parents didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s945">I mean, that was my lucky thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: -- that I survived with my mother.</span> <span id="s948">And she said, well, thank God, I am the parent.</span> <span id="s949">She said, how lucky you are, and people who lost their children, it was so sad.</span> <span id="s950">And I learned Polish there because there were many kids who had been hidden in convents and they didn’t speak a word, they didn’t even know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s951">And they didn’t speak a word of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s952">So, in order for me to be able to converse, I learned the language.</span> <span id="s953">And people would start speaking Polish to my mother, said I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s954">How come?</span> <span id="s955">Your daughter speaks Polish.</span> <span id="s956">Well, my daughter picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: W-When you put on the shows, in what language were the shows?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Oh, now that was all in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: That was all in --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yiddish or Hebrew.</span> <span id="s961">We learned Hebrew and we learned Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: And you had a formal schooling there?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Absolutely, formal schooling with -- with report cards and excellent teachers, excellent tea --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Who were the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: But we remember -- now they would say child molestation, sex -- sex offender, we had -- and it’s strange, none of us -- we had a reunion here.</span> <span id="s966">I have two friends, dearest friends that I met in DP camp.</span> <span id="s967">They were -- one was from Poland and one was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s968">We found each other.</span> <span id="s969">And she was just here.</span> <span id="s970">We had a reunion because we worked as volunteers for the army, three of us.</span> <span id="s971">And we never talked about it, I mean, we didn’t think about it, cause then we were so ashamed.</span> <span id="s972">There was one teacher, he was an excellent teacher, but he would invite you to his home.</span> <span id="s973">He would say he was going to help us, you know, with the studies or whate -- very friendly, very nice man and I -- I was always lacking a fatherly figure.</span> <span id="s974">And -- but he always was touchy-feely, and you know, we were developing girls.</span> <span id="s975">And we never, you know, none of us shared it.</span> <span id="s976">We had a reunion, one of the survivors lived in Vancouver, and we talked about this teacher and all of us had this same experience, how we jumped out -- I jumped out of his window, I ran when he started, you know, anything.</span> <span id="s977">And they said they had the same experience.</span> <span id="s978">And we burst out laughing, I mean it -- it’s funny to us now, but we were afraid to say anything to our parents or anybody, they would think we are crazy.</span> <span id="s979">And we felt so dirty, we felt oh my God, what is he doing, you know, touching us like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: So it -- these teachers, a lot of them were trained as teachers and they took us on trips.</span> <span id="s982">There were different castles and there were a lot of marbrahim that came from Israel and they talked about Israel and that’s why we -- we had [indecipherable] we had a different assembly for -- for Hertzel and Schumfeldore and different celebrations.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: So you became fluent in Hebrew then?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: We learned Hebrew well, and Yiddish, right [indecipherable] that’s -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s987">That’s when -- I was so delighted when I came to New York and they offered Hebrew in the junior high school and the high school.</span> <span id="s988">That’s what I took and I continued with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s990">So you -- you h -- your daily schedule was to get up and go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: And then come back to your mother at the end of the day and --</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Yeah, and we had woods nearby and I would go with my friends and we would pick strawberries and all kinds of berries and mushrooms.</span> <span id="s994">And sometimes we would steal apples from orchards from the Germans and we didn’t -- we would get like cans of tuna fish we didn’t -- and they gave us Spam.</span> <span id="s995">I -- Spam, what the heck is that?</span> <span id="s996">So what -- my stepfather took it and he -- in exchange the Germans -- he would speak German very well, they gave him a chicken that we had slaughtered and had chicken, cause you know, th-the food was not that great that they gave you.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: What kind of living arrangement, how -- did you have?</span> <span id="s998">Were you in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: We were in a -- we were in a one room with not -- all together in the one room and we had a little kitchenette.</span> <span id="s1000">It was a barrack.</span> <span id="s1001">The living quarters were not great, and I had hand-me-down clothing, but I was happy, you know.</span> <span id="s1002">We had a table and chair -- chairs.</span> <span id="s1003">They gave us basics that we would need.</span> <span id="s1004">We had tuna fish we didn’t know what to do with.</span> <span id="s1005">Then we find -- you know, so peanut butter, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Did you -- what were your thou -- feelings about Germans at -- at that time?</span> <span id="s1007">When you would see German people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: We did not like them, I’ll tell you that.</span> <span id="s1009">It was a beautiful country, we went to see, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: So when you would see a German on the street or German in the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Well, they were not in -- in uniform then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: No, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: No, I know, but did it -- did you have any emotional gut feeling towards them at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: All I know that I -- I was robbed of my father, my grandparents because of them.</span> <span id="s1016">I didn’t have good feel -- but I mean, I didn’t blame them all, I knew that some of them who are my age, they were not at fault, they didn’t do any of it, but their parents, their grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: What about the American, when you would see an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: That made us feel good.</span> <span id="s1019">They always gave us chocolate and they were very friendly and they were very outgoing and -- but they made it difficult too for us to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1020">We couldn’t wait until the quota system finally -- and we were really frightened because you had to pass the health exam and if anybody was sick, even though Ellis Island was abolished at that point, you still -- you didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1021">And they saw calcification on my lung, so my mother worried about that.</span> <span id="s1022">But thank God we had sponsors.</span> <span id="s1023">She had great-uncles who came to the uni -- my -- my grandfather’s stepbrothers, they were here.</span> <span id="s1024">And so we did have some help as far as finding an apartment.</span> <span id="s1025">In the beginning it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1026">We lived with my aunt, my mother’s sist -- only surviving sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Your -- you’re talking about in -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: When we came to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Okay, and -- and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: -- initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: -- okay.</span> <span id="s1032">Wh-When you were still over there in Feldafing, wa -- what were your thoughts about the United States?</span> <span id="s1033">I know you said you wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I wanted to go to Israel because I finally -- finally we had a country that we could call our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: We said, how wonderful this would be, to be in our very own country.</span> <span id="s1037">To have street cleaners, to have garbage men all Jewish.</span> <span id="s1038">Of course they’re not any more, but to be surrounded and not be frightened.</span> <span id="s1039">To be able to hold our heads up high.</span> <span id="s1040">And we were just so happy to hear about Israel and -- and the things they were doing.</span> <span id="s1041">Of course we knew they were in danger.</span> <span id="s1042">The Arabs didn’t love us then and they had to fight for the freedom.</span> <span id="s1043">But when it was declared as a state, it -- but then again we also heard that the United States was so tolerant of all religions.</span> <span id="s1044">I never felt anti-Semitism at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: And I moved into a neighborhood -- well, initially --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Okay, well, we’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1050">When you were still in the camp, the DP camp and you were with the other kids your age, did you ever tell each other the stories of what you all had been through during the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: -- war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Would you exchange stories with them?</span> <span id="s1055">A: Yes, in fact one of the -- there was a grandmother and a little child, her name was Mirunya and this grandmother told us about how she rescued her granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1056">Her -- her children didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1057">It was an adorable child.</span> <span id="s1058">And even though it -- we picked up -- these were the remnants of the war that picked up the pieces, and suddenly you saw a lot of weddings, a lot of babies that were born.</span> <span id="s1059">You saw life again.</span> <span id="s1060">We had theater, we had the opera.</span> <span id="s1061">I mean, there was a thirst for all of that that we were -- was missing from our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: You said you were in a -- performances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Lots of performances, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Can you sing one that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: -- we just, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: -- a little bit of one of the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: We -- we still did so -- we did a lot of Hebrew songs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Can you sing one of them a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: -- in Hebrew, we’d -- we did Arab dances, and it was just -- it was really -- you know, when people say, oh DP camp -- and both my friend Ada and I said, this is a happy time.</span> <span id="s1070">We bo -- we had boyfriends, we had -- we remember two boys, we tried to locate them, but we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1071">We still remember names, I have pictures of them.</span> <span id="s1072">There was such a bond, because everybody lost grandparents, everybody lost somebody.</span> <span id="s1073">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: So there was a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: -- we were very close knit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: And then I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: It was like a youth group type of feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yeah, we all scattered.</span> <span id="s1080">Everybody just went to different places.</span> <span id="s1081">That was sad, parting like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Can you sing any songs, or -- one or two lines of any of those songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I can’t say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Oh my God, we’re really going back to my youth.</span> <span id="s1086">You know, basically the yid -- Zionist songs that you know that were the very old ones, the Chenna Chenna, and [sings] I love that.</span> <span id="s1087">[sings] Sang songs from Israel all the time, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: What were the names of the two friends you said you got together --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Ada Rosenberg, whose father was the journalist.</span> <span id="s1090">She was in Russia, hiding in Russia like my -- my late husband.</span> <span id="s1091">And then Ruthka, who immigrated to British Columbia with her family and we found her -- we just -- unfortunately she has died, but we found her six years ago through the holocaust -- a little holocaust museum on the island that my friend was volunteering.</span> <span id="s1092">And she talked to her friend and she says, Ruthka, I know where Ruth -- oh, she was so excited and she sent us a letter.</span> <span id="s1093">And I ran to New York when I heard she was around because we were such -- she says, you were my best friend in DP camp, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: What -- what did the three of you do in DP camp together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: We were very good friends, we did a lot of fun things together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: We took walks together, we went on trips together, we -- we picked berries together, we were in classes together.</span> <span id="s1098">We were in all the shows together.</span> <span id="s1099">I have pictures of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: And I have one good friend who was Orthodox and I lost touch with her, but we were inseparable.</span> <span id="s1102">We both had the long braids and w-we really loved one another.</span> <span

Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: -- and she lived in the same barrack [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Was she your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: She was exactly my age, yes, and she too was an only child.</span> <span id="s1114">Some of parents had babies in DP camp, but my mother felt that I was an only child and when she remarried she didn’t want me to feel like the stepchild -- I was a stepchild, my stepfather was not very good to me, but she didn’t want me -- want to bring other children into the world where I would feel the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Your stepfather’s name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: His name was Leo Neufeld and he sort of adopted me, but I can look back and see that he lost his son and wife and he was a bitter person and not very good to me, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1117">Didn’t allow me to go on trips, there -- he never came to visit me in the sanitarium.</span> <span id="s1118">But it -- I did go on trips.</span> <span id="s1119">And we went to different ski resorts and we -- we did a lot with the Israeli [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1120">We would have bonfires, we belonged to -- we -- in the summertime we had the [indecipherable], we had camps with tents.</span> <span id="s1121">So they tried to give us as normal a life as possible, what we missed.</span> <span id="s1122">And some people had motorcycles and -- and bicycles.</span> <span id="s1123">My friend Ada, whose father was a journalist, I thought she lived in the rich part cause she had her own room and that -- she said, what are you talking about, we were in barracks also.</span> <span id="s1124">But they had a little more, she had a bicycle and so did -- her brother was born there and then I had another friend, this Ruthka, I remember holding her brother as a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: When you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: We started being interested in boys, we had Leon and then there -- there were the two twins, they had crushes on both Ada Rosenberg and I, and we really -- we socialized and we -- we had fun together.</span> <span id="s1127">We were so happy to be alive, happy to be in the school, and we had a -- a special bonding and we fought for one another.</span> <span id="s1128">We -- we all were lacking grandparents, we all lacked a childhood, we didn’t have the childhood, the normal childhood.</span> <span id="s1129">I know we didn’t have any love left for the Germans, let’s put it this way, or the Poles for that matter.</span> <span id="s1130">Most the Polish people, they experienced when they went back home, there were -- many Poles said, what are you doing back?</span> <span id="s1131">We thought they killed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1132">And many lost their lives, so it was -- it was sad, but some were saved.</span> <span id="s1133">There were ri -- Righteous Gentile.</span> <span id="s1134">They were saved in nunneries and -- and some Poles took them in, but of course they didn’t want to give them up either.</span> <span id="s1135">They just thought they were Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: When you had gone back to -- let’s back up a little bit, when you had gone back to your home village, home town -- this is before you left to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Did you experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: You mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: -- after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: -- liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Yeah, after Shagarat and you went back for that.</span> <span id="s1143">Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you left Shagarat and came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Well, in -- it was the Iron Curtain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: -- they had -- didn’t display it openly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Y-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: -- but I was afraid, as a Jew, although the communist movement, you know they -- they said they loved all children and blah, blah, blah, all of that.</span> <span id="s1149">What was interesting though was that I lacked religion.</span> <span id="s1150">You know, come to think of it, you said I -- I came from a pious home, you know, before the war.</span> <span id="s1151">I guess my mother lost some of her belief because of what happened.</span> <span id="s1152">I mean, how could God do this to such a pious family like my -- my parents, who were just so charitable.</span> <span id="s1153">And it was the same goyim that they were so good to.</span> <span id="s1154">He would give them credit.</span> <span id="s1155">He had a dry goods store, but when it was their holiday and one goy would invite my grandparents, even though they didn’t eat anything at the weddings, to the weddings.</span> <span id="s1156">And they’re the same goyim that turned on them and they -- and they butchered the family?</span> <span id="s1157">I -- how can human beings do this to other human beings?</span> <span id="s1158">You just wonder what -- what triggers it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: That’s why it’s important, you know, it -- it could happen, God forbid, could happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: We’re back in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Back in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: And you’re ready, getting ready to leave.</span> <span id="s1164">What was that like, when you knew you were going to be leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: It was a happy time.</span> <span id="s1166">I knew I was going to see aunts and cousins that I had never met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: And you came by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: And the arrival -- oh my God, I remember that journey.</span> <span id="s1169">I think that cured me of any cruises, I never wanted to go on a cruise or on a boat.</span> <span id="s1170">That -- of course we didn’t go under plush circumstances at all.</span> <span id="s1171">We were transported on -- on the army transport.</span> <span id="s1172">I remember General Haan to this day and by coincidence, my husband was on the General Haan when he was drafted into the army and he was not sent to Korea, but instead he was sent to Germany, and he spoke German, so he had some very interesting conversation in bars with some Germans as a young Jewish American soldier.</span> <span id="s1173">But in any case, that journey was horrible.</span> <span id="s1174">We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: How did you get to the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: We got there by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: And I know we went through all kinds of exams, and had the papers and we were allowed luggage and we were assigned to a huge room with bunk beds, and my mother said, if you have to be sick you better choose a -- a top bunk bed and we did.</span> <span id="s1179">I was together with my mother and both she and I were sick the entire time.</span> <span id="s1180">Did not set foot into a dining room.</span> <span id="s1181">I think we had maybe two grapes -- grapefruit.</span> <span id="s1182">If we had a grapefruit a day it was a lot and we -- but the day that we landed and -- near the Statue of Liberty, I will never forget that.</span> <span id="s1183">They -- that’s where we finally -- when we arrived, we got on -- onto the deck and when we saw the statue it -- you really felt such welcome.</span> <span id="s1184">And at -- it was such an overwhelming feeling, I said, why me?</span> <span id="s1185">Why was I privileged, and how come not the others?</span> <span id="s1186">And I was happy, very happy that I was finally coming to a country, land of opportunity that I’d heard so much about.</span> <span id="s1187">Course I would have been happier gone to Israel, but I was happy, I made peace with it.</span> <span id="s1188">After all, I wanted to be with my mother and other family members.</span> <span id="s1189">And we got a big reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Who me -- who met you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: My mother’s sister, husband and baby and all the relatives on my -- from my father’s side, my -- my father’s -- my father’s two sisters Aunt Bertha and Sarah and they had dinner for us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Well, when you came down onto the ground, onto the American ground, what was that like?</span> <span id="s1193">Do you remember any special --</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: It’s a good feeling, but it was strange too, cause they -- they thought we -- some of them who had emigrated years ago, you know, they thought we didn’t see lights and this is a light.</span> <span id="s1195">And the salad was kind of strange because we didn’t -- we ate different, it was not like the iceberg lettuce, we were used to different salad.</span> <span id="s1196">And they served us salads and they kept asking us if we saw -- and of course I didn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s1197">I had -- when we moved in with my mother’s sister, who had a one bedroom apartment, it was very difficult to get apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: This is 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: This is the 19 -- September 1949.</span> <span id="s1200">At -- she lived in the Midwood section of Brooklyn where I thought, oh the Jews are so rich, because they had their own home and a piano in the house and oh my God, I -- but I did not open up my mouth for three months because I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s1201">And I’m very frustrated I remember because they gave me a -- an I.Q. test and I could hardly speak the language.</span> <span id="s1202">So when I got to high school and the principal called me in, and he said, I’ve never seen anybody improve so much on the I.Q. test, I said look, you gave it to a greenhorn who didn’t know a tailor from a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s1203">I said, it’s lucky I didn’t test as an imbecile, I passed it.</span> <span id="s1204">Yes, I didn’t pass it with high marks, but I said, no wonder it’s gone up so much, I said, now I know the language.</span> <span id="s1205">And they frustrated me even further, they gave me French, they put me in a special class.</span> <span id="s1206">I said oh my God, you know, that was really unreal.</span> <span id="s1207">I look at it today they have the bilingual education, and I say what -- what’s going on, you know?</span> <span id="s1208">They bend over backwards, then it was sink or swim, when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Were you still living with your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Lived with my aunt for three months until we got our own apartment and we moved to a neighborhood that was not quite as affluent.</span> <span id="s1211">There was -- we lived in Midwood section with -- in Flatbush near Brooklyn College with my aunt, and then we moved to Bensonhurst, where it was a mixed neighborhood, Italian and Jewish.</span> <span id="s1212">And more people -- some people spoke Yiddish as well, it -- it -- I felt more comfortable, I -- perhaps also because my English was quite -- you know, much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Yeah, Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: And thanks to the land of opportunity really because we were poor and my -- my stepfather didn’t really have a trade here.</span> <span id="s1215">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1216">He had been a businessman in -- in Germany, and there was no business for him to take over so they taught him how to house paint.</span> <span id="s1217">My mother’s uncles were in the real estate, so he became a housepainter.</span> <span id="s1218">And my mother wanted to work so that I wouldn’t have to go to clinics and he didn’t like that too much.</span> <span id="s1219">So she quit and so I remember working my way through school really.</span> <span id="s1220">While I went -- was in high school I always had jobs from the time I was 15.</span> <span id="s1221">I worked in bakeries, I worked in -- in different stores, I worked as a counselor.</span> <span id="s1222">And I came to -- when I was -- graduated from high school and wanted to go on to college I definitely had the grade, and my stepfather didn't want me to go to college.</span> <span id="s1223">He believed girls should marry rich [indecipherable] it was not easy, I -- we had lived in a one bedroom apartment, my room was the living room, the sleep sofa and my pinups were on the closet, but I did not leave home ye -- at that time you respected your parents and my mother went through a lot with me and I -- it was a di -- a difficult time, but I -- I told my mother I can’t -- I just for [indecipherable] like, I didn’t go to school right away, but I said I have to go to school, cause people even offered to give me money to send me away, but I said, I can’t do that to my mother.</span> <span id="s1224">Brooklyn College accepted -- you know, if you had A average, the girls had to have 90 - 95, the boys only 80 something.</span> <span id="s1225">So -- it was free, other than just the books.</span> <span id="s1226">I said, I’ll go to scho -- I’ll support myself.</span> <span id="s1227">During the day I went -- I worked in a real estate office and at night I -- I went to school at night until I had to go student teach.</span> <span id="s1228">You know, you have to do that for a year, so I transferred and I started going in during the day.</span> <span id="s1229">And I met my wonderful husband while I was in school and we married in 1959, I married him and I met him in ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Was he also a student?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: He was a student --</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: -- right, under the G.I. bill and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: When you were in high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: -- did you tell the other American students what you had been through, d -- or did they ask or did the teachers ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: They never talked about the Holocaust then.</span> <span id="s1238">There were no Holocaust studies at all, as if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: -- it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: But did teachers ask you about your background and what you had been through?</span> <span id="s1242">Did you confide in any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Um, no.</span> <span id="s1244">I do remember -- people really didn’t want to hear too much about it.</span> <span id="s1245">I didn’t want to -- I myself didn’t want to speak Yiddish then to my mother.</span> <span id="s1246">I said, we’re in America, we have to talk English.</span> <span id="s1247">But as I got older, I -- I wanted to cling to the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1248">That was my, you know, Mamalashen.</span> <span id="s1249">And no, strangely enough, they didn’t talk of it, but the -- my relatives wanted to know what we went -- what we lived through, but nobody from school, we didn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: So the other teenagers were not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: -- counseling.</span> <span id="s1252">No.</span> <span id="s1253">My friends, yes, they -- they would -- there was one, because her parents came from Europe, they were the ones that were interested.</span> <span id="s1254">They would ask me questions.</span> <span id="s1255">But a -- and then in college, of course, it was different.</span> <span id="s1256">People wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1257">It was interesting, they wanted to know what happened and -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: I mean, I was asking because I would imagine on the registration form in high school puts your di -- place of birth and date of birth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1260">What made me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: -- and you would think the teachers would want to know a little bit about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: What made me extremely nervous was in New York we had to pass some very strict exams before we became a teacher, before you were licensed.</span> <span id="s1263">And we had to go to a speech pedagogy exam.</span> <span id="s1264">And having not been born in the United States, I was so -- and you know, people in Brooklyn have very distinct accents, that I made sure in college I took speech classes and I said, I’m going to pass this exam, because some of my friends who were native Americans, they were born in the States didn’t pass it and I really was scared.</span> <span id="s1265">I said, uh-oh, I’m going to go before this whole board, there are principals and teachers and they gave me things to read and things to pronounce, and I s -- I was so nervous.</span> <span id="s1266">Oh, never -- and when I passed I was ecstatic.</span> <span id="s1267">I just didn’t -- I was so careful to enunciate and pronounce everything correctly.</span> <span id="s1268">So I’m going to show them that -- as soon -- I said, they’ll see where I was born and they’re probably going to give me a hard time.</span> <span id="s1269">So I was thrilled, I really was.</span> <span id="s1270">And it -- I was very grateful, I -- I -- I’m still very patriotic, I think it’s a wonderful place for somebody, you know, we didn’t have anything and I -- you can make something of yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: So you met your husband, you got married in ’59 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Met my husband, we were starving students, we were in love and we didn't have to have the house, we didn’t have to have the car.</span> <span id="s1273">With my -- my savings I bought our first car that we used for a honeymoon to Canada.</span> <span id="s1274">He accepted a -- a teaching assistantship at the University of Maryland.</span> <span id="s1275">He was a math major and physics minor and on 1800 dollars a year.</span> <span id="s1276">I was supposed to support us through a -- through his schooling, but we got lonely.</span> <span id="s1277">There weren't very many Jewish graduate students and we would go to New York quite often to see our parents.</span> <span id="s1278">I became pregnant when my -- you know, before I was supposed to.</span> <span id="s1279">I -- it was planned, it was not an unplanned pregnancy.</span> <span id="s1280">But we managed because at that time the gifts that we had gotten for our wedding and we managed with little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: And he was born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Where was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Oh no, my husband was born in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: And they were hiding.</span> <span id="s1287">They lost their entire family except for my father-in-law’s sister, he -- his whole family and my mother-in-law’s family too, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1288">And they were hiding in Russia, they went through a hard time.</span> <span id="s1289">He was the only one that I dated that was a greenhorn, so to speak, only went out with American, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: When did he get to the United States, your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: In ’49.</span> <span id="s1292">We didn’t know each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: But they came at the same time.</span> <span id="s1295">However, he was not as fortunate.</span> <span id="s1296">He did not go to -- to the schools, he had to help his parents out.</span> <span id="s1297">They didn’t have relatives like we did.</span> <span id="s1298">And so he worked the garment center, he would take classes at night.</span> <span id="s1299">And then he was drafted into the army shortly after and he went to school on the G.I. bill and not every college was going to accept him, but he was brilliant in math.</span> <span id="s1300">And Long Island University --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: And his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Nathan.</span> <span id="s1303">And he survived the war with his parents and brother.</span> <span id="s1304">Brother who was born near Siberia in Russia.</span> <span id="s1305">They had a very tough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: What town in Poland was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: He was from Pulawy a Wisla, near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1308">I have the [indecipherable] book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yeah, his father was a tailor and he was a very special person, very bright.</span> <span id="s1311">He was a rocket motor scientist, worked for Johns Hopkins applied physics lab.</span> <span id="s1312">And we had three daughters and a wonderful marriage, only to be short-lived unfortunately for 30 -- 35 beautiful years and then he went -- got cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Yeah, lung cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: But he fought it valiantly and we had our -- our first house in the family and then the cars and we thought -- well, we really had everything, I would re -- I would go back to the apartment and if he were only alive, I didn’t care if -- we were very happy together.</span> <span id="s1317">And produced three wonderful daughters and I’m lucky to have them around, but I’m -- my grandchildren, they’re my life, as you know.</span> <span id="s1318">Grandchildren are wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your feelings about what you went through.</span> <span id="s1320">I know you said before that you had lost your childhood in those early years and it was not a normal childhood and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: And I lost my father, my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: I always felt a void in my life not having a father, but my mother’s sister married a wonderful, wonderful man who was like my surrogate father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Surrogate father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: -- to me, however he also -- he died very young.</span> <span id="s1326">He was -- left at -- at the time a 12 year old and a five year old, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Are you -- are you angry that you had to go through what you went through while others your age were having an easy childhood in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: -- United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: I was not angry with other people about it.</span> <span id="s1331">It was something that a -- like people ask me how did you go through everything and still have a bright disposition?</span> <span id="s1332">I said look, it’s other human beings who did it, I don’t believe that a -- God did it.</span> <span id="s1333">He -- yes, I felt deprived of a childhood and I had sadness and sometimes it would surface when my kids said they were under pressure and I used to say, what do you know about pressure?</span> <span id="s1334">I mean here they had -- and we wanted them -- please don’t get me wrong, we wanted them to have everything we didn’t have, but they lived in a beautiful home and they didn’t strug -- we had provided for them and -- and they -- they had their own rooms, which I never had and -- but you know, it’s normal.</span> <span id="s1335">You can’t just bring your life into their -- but at one point if they would complain they had so much pressure, I would -- then I would see that my background was with me, I -- what do you know from pressure?</span> <span id="s1336">You’ve had loving parents and thank God you have your grandma, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: When they were the age you were when, let’s say, you had to go to Shagarat or go through certain things --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yeah, I look at my granddaughter now, I say oh my God, was I that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Right, do -- right, what does that do when you see -- when you saw your children and now your grandchildren --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Oh, I think what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: -- the same age you were at those times?</span> <span id="s1342">Does it bring back memories for you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: No, well -- well, I -- I look at my granddaughter who is five and a half [indecipherable] you know and I say thank God.</span> <span id="s1344">Thank God there is not, an-and I hope that they’ll never be war, I don’t want them to go through anything like that again.</span> <span id="s1345">I don’t want them to go through loss like that again.</span> <span id="s1346">And -- and war is a horrible thing for children.</span> <span id="s1347">I mean, it -- just terrible, I mean breaks my heart there is still a lot of suffering and a lot of poverty in the world now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn’t gone through what you did go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Hard to say.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1351">Would have been happier having had the love of my father and the guidance of a father.</span> <span id="s1352">I wouldn’t have felt that -- that void.</span> <span id="s1353">That was hard, especially when I was a teenager or later when I had to introduce my dates to my stepfather, who didn’t -- wasn’t a talker and who -- who was really [indecipherable] in my life.</span> <span id="s1354">That was hard.</span> <span id="s1355">And hard not having Seders and you know, I -- I’m surprised I picked up as much, cause I guess it was inborn because my -- my father trained me to be -- have such feelings, but I’m very involved with shul and it gives me comfort.</span> <span id="s1356">But yes, I ask questions.</span> <span id="s1357">Why and why did my husband have to die young and -- and why, but I don’t feel sorry for myself, it just -- I feel sorry for those who didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1358">Why didn’t my aunt, who was only seven years older than I, she never made anything, you know.</span> <span id="s1359">So I thank God for what I have, I’m grateful.</span> <span id="s1360">Yes, I’m angry at the people who did these horrible things.</span> <span id="s1361">Th-The farmers, how -- how they could turn like that on my grandparents, who were such pious people and you say why?</span> <span id="s1362">You know, you’re supposed to be rewarded with sedakah and you know [indecipherable] Hasidim and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Are you more comfortable around people who’ve -- that -- who are survivors also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Are you more comfortable around others who -- other people who are survivors as opposed to people who were -- who didn’t have to go through what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: There’s a special bond, but it’s interesting that you ask that.</span> <span id="s1367">I’m very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1368">However, when my husband and I joined the child survivor group and we went to a couple of meetings, both of us felt that some of the people were very bitter and they had a lot of psychological problems and they wore it on their sleeve, whereas my husband and I had gone through a lot, we just put it in the past.</span> <span id="s1369">We were grateful for what we have here and try not to be bitter.</span> <span id="s1370">I mean, what’s the point?</span> <span id="s1371">How you -- you survived, you’re alive, you picked up the pieces.</span> <span id="s1372">You have a beautiful family, you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to speak out when you see injustices done to -- you know, things that are done to other people, so that it doesn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1373">Yes, my heart bleeds for Israel, I always worry.</span> <span id="s1374">I know I’m an American, I’m a Jew, but somehow there i -- I have this special feeling for Israel that if God forbid anything would happen to Israel, you know, it -- what are we again?</span> <span id="s1375">You know we’re -- we’re a people without a land.</span> <span id="s1376">Yes, I -- I’m a citizen of the United States, I have all my full rights here, but somehow I feel like I belong there becau -- and -- and I think that’s as a result of having survived the war, not having a place to go, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1377">[sings] Tell me where shall I go.</span> <span id="s1378">I mean, that has so much meaning to me, cause every door was closed to us.</span> <span id="s1379">And look at how many children, the innocent children, that’s what really gets to me.</span> <span id="s1380">But I’m thankful for what I have.</span> <span id="s1381">You know, some people look at their glass half full and some people look at it half empty and I thank God for [indecipherable] yes, it could have been different, but you know, life went on, I have a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1382">Hitler didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s1383">And people tell me, we thank God you’re here, what do you mean you -- you say why me?</span> <span id="s1384">It -- every shul needs a reader who [indecipherable] this one lady who is very sweet.</span> <span id="s1385">I said thank you very much, but -- so -- and -- and I hope it -- it will never happen again and -- and any of my grandchildren [indecipherable] I wouldn’t want them to go through that.</span> <span id="s1386">And I think because I lacked grandparents, I bend over backwards to be a good grandparent.</span> <span id="s1387">I try very hard and bond with the kids, and help out, as you do with your -- your gra -- it’s a pleasure.</span> <span id="s1388">It’s just a pleasure.</span> <span id="s1389">And I don’t understand how people could do that to kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Rita Lifschitz Rubinstein.</span> <span id="s1392">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1393">You got your teaching certificate and then you started teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Got my teaching certificate and I was thrilled to get a job at Olney Elementary School where -- this was 1960.</span> <span id="s1395">I thought I earned a lot of money, it was 7,000 a year and I was supposed to support my husband through graduate school.</span> <span id="s1396">However in 1961 our very first child Nina was born and then in ’63 her sister Sherri and 60 si -- six, Rene.</span> <span id="s1397">And of course we were not lacking for names, unfortunately, we had lots of names to give them.</span> <span id="s1398">Wonderful girls, we loved being parents and very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1399">One is a psycholog -- she’s industrial psychologist, one earned a degree in law, she’s an attorney and -- and the third one is a -- a nurse at Hopkins, and my husband was privileged to walk two of them down the aisle with me and he was -- he did see four grandchildren, but unfortunately the oldest, when he died in ’95 was only six and the youngest at the time was only two.</span> <span id="s1400">So he -- he saw four grandchildren and four have been born since, and he would have been so proud of all of them.</span> <span id="s1401">Just -- I regret the fact that he never was there for a Bar Mitzvah, but I -- I feel that he was there in spirit, because I can see some of the characteristics that he had in each and every one of my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1402">And we talk about him a lot and his -- his memory will be for a blessing and I know he’ll always be remembered.</span> <span id="s1403">And one of his grandchildren has a love of soccer just like he did, and she’s a good soccer player.</span> <span id="s1404">So my grandchildren range in age from 20 down to two.</span> <span id="s1405">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: And their names are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: -- I thank God for them.</span> <span id="s1408">I -- names are Sammy, which would have been my -- my uncle who was killed in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1409">Then I have a Max, Maxwell David Heller and he’s named after my father, David.</span> <span id="s1410">And -- and then we have Alexis.</span> <span id="s1411">She has other grandparents who are survivors too, so she was named after that side.</span> <span id="s1412">And then we have Mitchell, Mitchell Heller and he was named after my late husband’s brother, Baruch -- Benny.</span> <span id="s1413">And then came Tobi, Tavulah, who is my mother, named after my mother and she was born si -- six weeks after my husband died.</span> <span id="s1414">It was too hard to give her hi-his name.</span> <span id="s1415">And after Tobi came Jacklyn and she has my husband’s name Natanya, which is a gift from God.</span> <span id="s1416">And then my daughter Rene has the two younger ones, she has Chelsea and Blake, who are -- unfortunately don’t have Hebrew names because she married a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1417">And -- but I love them all and that’s my mishpokhe.</span> <span id="s1418">I am proud of all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Can we talk a little bit more about your thoughts?</span> <span id="s1420">Are there any sights -- sights or smells or reminders that you come across today that kind of make you go back in time to your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: In time from when I was a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Yeah, when you were little, going through the war.</span> <span id="s1423">Anything today that sparks a return in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: I know Seders and Sukkoth, I always had tears in my eyes when I saw people celebrating Pesach because I -- I didn’t have that, I’d -- I’d recall [indecipherable] I was very little and I recall the Sukkoth, but yeah, that’s why I -- I really celebrate them fully and always invite people to Seder.</span> <span id="s1425">Smells, I -- I’ve -- I know from what my mother told me about her mother having been such a wonderful balabusta, she made everything from scratch, so whether it’s -- I was told the difference, she was an excellent cook and an excellent baker and -- and did everything, but I really don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Nothing triggers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: -- you back in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: What was it like to become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: It was a great feeling.</span> <span id="s1432">I’d have to do it on my own and of course when I went to court I had already been through school so I did -- it was a joke the questions that they would ask, I knew I would pass.</span> <span id="s1433">It felt very good.</span> <span id="s1434">Felt I belonged and it was great.</span> <span id="s1435">Didn’t feel anti -- any anti-Semitism, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Personally no, but my grandchildren here and there have, and they’ve heard it, and so that was very hurtful to me and they were very angry.</span> <span id="s1438">And this -- a hockey field, ice hockey?</span> <span id="s1439">Particular instance where -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: You mean, other children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: They were called a name, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: By other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: By other children.</span> <span id="s1444">And I said, how could this be in the United States, my grandchild, you know.</span> <span id="s1445">But I know it’s there and I know it’s hidden.</span> <span id="s1446">You feel it.</span> <span id="s1447">I did -- oh, I shouldn’t say, I did experience it.</span> <span id="s1448">My uncle had a house in the country and suddenly I saw a sign, no dogs or Jews allowed.</span> <span id="s1449">And this was the country club, yes.</span> <span id="s1450">So I knew that there were places that were forbidden and I knew that Jewish students had a tough time here, I mean I -- I learned history.</span> <span id="s1451">When they went to medical school and other places, it was -- it was harder for them.</span> <span id="s1452">But we were always known as the people of the book, and we -- so we excelled, we knew we had to excel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Do you think of yourself a survivor?</span> <span id="s1454">Do you call yourself that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1456">Definitely.</span> <span id="s1457">I’ll always be a survivor.</span> <span id="s1458">I felt like a greenhorn for a long time, I -- I didn’t after -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Is it a d -- a defining --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Does it define me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I think I am -- in a way I was glad that I married a survivor because we understood each other fully.</span> <span id="s1463">You know, the sadness and there was a lot of un -- [coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1464">There was a lot of unspoken, but we had so much more in common.</span> <span id="s1465">And there’s a special bond that we all -- survivors have.</span> <span id="s1466">So I think yes.</span> <span id="s1467">My children also know that they’re the product of survivors.</span> <span id="s1468">They think they were brought up differently because -- well, I don’t think so because I co -- I consider myself American, I -- I went through schools here, public schools, but I definitely feel like I’m a survivor.</span> <span id="s1469">I survived the war, I feel I can survive anything.</span> <span id="s1470">I’m also a cancer survivor, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: You -- you started to talk about your teaching experience and then you had the children and then did you go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1473">At the time when I was teaching my career ended early because I became pregnant and they didn’t want pregnant women in the school system.</span> <span id="s1474">So I decided to rear them when they were very young, myself and stay home and do with a little bit less materially.</span> <span id="s1475">And then when I was member of Hadassah and somebody was teaching at the Chaim Weizmann Yiddish Hebrew School and they needed a music teacher and Yiddish teacher and so I said oh, it sounds wonderful and I went for an interview and got the job.</span> <span id="s1476">So I taught Yiddish music, brought me back to my music and my days in DP camp, and Hebrew and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1477">And then after my teaching there about four or five years, the principal, Frieda Frank had retired and she asked me to take over for her.</span> <span id="s1478">I became principal and I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s1479">And as a -- a Hebrew school teacher I also went to different training session and I was trained to become a Bar and Bat Mitzvah tutor.</span> <span id="s1480">I learned the trope for Torah and Haftorah.</span> <span id="s1481">And I had private students.</span> <span id="s1482">I did it for a number of my friends, they were my guinea pigs in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1483">Friends’ children that is, who are now all grown and have children beyond the Bar Mitzvah years.</span> <span id="s1484">So I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s1485">I’ve also taught adult -- adults -- I’ve had four adult B’nai Mitzvah that I -- I trained and that was rewarding.</span> <span id="s1486">And right now they all -- all the training I do is for my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1487">I’ve had the pleasure of -- of teaching three of -- four of actually -- five of my grandchildren, prepared them for Bar and Bat Mitzvah and I’m looking forward to the others in the future, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: And I -- I think it’s wonderful that I belong to an egalitarian shul where we were given complete rights and I can read Torah and Haftorah, I do that in memory of -- of my parents and I chant the Haftorah and privileged to ha -- ha -- I’m happy to have the privilege to give -- to be given the opportunity where I could read Torah, because I remember we were not always egalitarian and when my mother died and I went to shul every day to say Kaddish, they didn’t recognize me as part of the minyan and I fought it -- and we fought it and under our new rabbi, Rabbi Jonah Layman, he gave us full rights and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1490">W-We actually got those -- we were counted in the minyan before Jonah joined us and I was happy because unfortunately when my husband died and he didn’t leave any male heirs and my daughters went to say Kaddish, they did not look for a 10th man, they were counted in the minyan.</span> <span id="s1491">So I am very proud -- I don’t know what my grandparents are thinking about it, but I -- I’m very happy that we have equal rights, cause they were all Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Do you have any survivor friends or have you talked to survivors, other survivors who say they’ve lost their faith because of what they went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Well, my own mother really was not as pious here as she had been.</span> <span id="s1494">She -- sh-she -- she was not Orthodox any more, she traveled on Shabbat and a -- yes, she kept kosher, definitely and -- as I do.</span> <span id="s1495">But she was angry with God, yes, so to speak and yes I have survivor friends and we do have a special bond, have older friends and younger friends and they’re -- they’re like family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Oh, I was watching that and I -- I was overwhelmed by what people went through and sometimes I f -- I felt guilty that I didn’t go through as much as some people and what -- what is strange, the competition sometimes bothers me among survivors.</span> <span id="s1498">When you tell them where you’re from, or what you’ve gone through, they say oh, that’s nothing.</span> <span id="s1499">You were not in Auschwitz or Dachau, you don’t have a number.</span> <span id="s1500">But how are they to say what I’ve experienced and what losses -- I’ve had losses.</span> <span id="s1501">I was robbed of a childhood.</span> <span id="s1502">And in a way that’s what kept me away from some of the groups, because I was never honored -- not in my shul, my shul I’ve been honored many times, but never honored to light a candle, and Transnistria existed, it was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1503">So in a sense I felt a little hurt.</span> <span id="s1504">I didn’t make waves, but -- and a -- I’ve heard other people experience the same thing.</span> <span id="s1505">People, for instance who were in Russia.</span> <span id="s1506">My friend Ada, she also experienced that, they say, what did you go through?</span> <span id="s1507">And you were a kid, you can’t remember much.</span> <span id="s1508">But we did.</span> <span id="s1509">We’re robbed of our childhood and -- and we certainly went through a holocaust, our own personal holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: How would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s1511">Are you an American, are you Jewish, are you Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No, definitely not Romanian.</span> <span id="s1513">I have no desire to go back.</span> <span id="s1514">Well, sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: That was going to be my next question, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yeah, sometimes I’ve wanted see where [indecipherable] say oh, it wasn’t so great.</span> <span id="s1517">I would -- I’m proud to say I’m an American, yes, very proud and a -- I’m a Jew first.</span> <span id="s1518">I will always feel very, very Jewish, because no matter what, the Jews who’ve tried to hide that they were Jewish, you couldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s1519">Even those who had, they say [indecipherable] whatever, even if you had a little blood, the great-great grandparents, those Germans found you and they labeled you, you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s1520">But no, I don’t mean it in that sense, I am proud of who I am.</span> <span id="s1521">I’m proud of my people, things that we’ve gone through and we persevere.</span> <span id="s1522">And that’s why we exist.</span> <span id="s1523">And we -- we cling to our belief that the -- the Torah, if we only would all practice what the Torah preaches it would be a wonderful world.</span> <span id="s1524">And the same thing for the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: What do you think your reasons are for doing this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: What are the reasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: For doing this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: To keep the memory alive and to say to deniers, you can’t deny it, it happened.</span> <span id="s1529">Let’s hope it never happens again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1531">Before we close, is there any message you wanted to give to your grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1532">Anything special you wanted to say to them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1534">First of all, I mean, to my children and grandchildren, I love them very much, I’m very proud of them, but I want them to remember to always be proud … of their heritage, proud of being Jewish and always fight for the underdog, do not stay -- stand back and say oh, they don’t mean me.</span> <span id="s1535">Even if it’s somebody out of the religion, out of your faith, always speak up for the truth and for justice.</span> <span id="s1536">And -- and do the right thing, as Grandpa said, always do the right thing.</span> <span id="s1537">And know I’ll be with you, watching over you no matter where I am and I’ll always love you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Well that -- well that [tape interruption].</span> <span id="s1539">Have you been to the Holocaust ceremony at the rotunda of the capital, United States capital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yes, and I will never forget the very first time I was seated in the rotunda.</span> <span id="s1541">It was an overwhelming experience, very emotional.</span> <span id="s1542">I have taken, when we were allowed to, I have taken two of my grandchildren there and two of my daughters there.</span> <span id="s1543">I -- I said -- it was such a -- an overwhelming emotional experience, I wanted them to experience it.</span> <span id="s1544">Of course they experienced it differently than I did.</span> <span id="s1545">But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military walking in with the flags that liberated the camps, I -- I just started crying like a baby.</span> <span id="s1546">It was a feeling of joy and a feeling of sadness and a feeling of saying well here I am, the greenhorn, sitting in the United States, a citizen, a -- in the rotunda and being with other survivors and seeing the flags and it brought back memories of the war and saying why me, why was I privileged?</span> <span id="s1547">And especially this year it was very emotional because I sat very close to the stage and there was Elie Wiesel sitting next to our President Obama.</span> <span id="s1548">And President Obama addressing us.</span> <span id="s1549">I-I will never forget that, I was really choked up, it was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s1550">And it -- it made me proud to be an American and seeing that they recognize the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1551">I mean, it’s sad that we had it but at least it’s there and -- and they recognize it by honoring the memory of the dead by having the Holocaust Museum, which is a-an educational tool and -- and I see so many people from different walks of life on line and that makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s1552">Because hopefully through education, something like this will not happen again.</span> <span id="s1553">And so I have volunteered and I will start working at the Holocaust Museum myself.</span> <span id="s1554">It’s difficult, yes.</span> <span id="s1555">Having been through the museum, it’s -- it’s ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a room with pictures of smiling faces and families that were, that are no longer here because the entire town was gone, maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived, that’s very hard, but it’s an important lesson.</span> <span id="s1556">And I think people should go and -- and be educated and I’m glad that they are offering it now as part of the curriculum in the schools.</span> <span id="s1557">So I think it’s my duty, it’s time for me to -- to do some volunteering there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Are there any names of relatives you’d like to mention that we haven’t talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Yeah, my mother -- my grandparents, my mother’s side, my -- my grandfather Zev Mirabaum, Worf Mirabaum and his wife, Zora Brina Mirabaum.</span> <span id="s1560">Her brother Shmul, or Sammy, as they called him.</span> <span id="s1561">A-Anita, Menusha and Esther, who would have been only seven years older than I, she was born in 1929.</span> <span id="s1562">May their memory be for a blessing and my [indecipherable] my grandma -- my father -- my father’s mother who -- who died in labor camp in Transnistria, were wonderful -- they were wonderful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Before we close, you had been talking about a singing group that you have started, can we end on that note?</span> <span id="s1564">Tell me a little bit about the singing group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: We’re called Die Freyliche Knaidlach which -- the Happy Dumplings.</span> <span id="s1566">And we sing mostly Yiddish songs and some Ladino and Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s1567">And we bring joy to people.</span> <span id="s1568">We’ve sung in various -- he -- in Hebrew homes and nursing homes.</span> <span id="s1569">We’ve sung at the Israeli embassy, at Catholic University, Montgomery College, University of Maryland.</span> <span id="s1570">And music is wonderful medicine for some people.</span> <span id="s1571">It i -- it evokes such emotion.</span> <span id="s1572">People with Alzheimer’s who have not spoken for quite some time suddenly start crying and singing along with us.</span> <span id="s1573">We derive a lot of pleasure and at the same time we feel we’re doing a mitzvah and it’s -- it’s wonderful for us as well.</span> <span id="s1574">It’s a healing.</span> <span id="s1575">Music really heals.</span> <span id="s1576">We love bringing some joy, some freyliche to people and it was s -- it really saved me after my husband died.</span> <span id="s1577">I immersed myself in it and I’m teaching Yiddish to my fellow knaidlach and they enjoy it immensely too and it brings joy to people.</span> <span id="s1578">So I’m -- I’m happy to be part of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Do-Does your group have a motto or a slogan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Yes, and just like knaidlach, we find ourselves offering hot soup, sometimes in cold soup or just like good knaidlach we always rise to the top.</span> <span id="s1581">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1582">I am also involved in other two musical groups, the [indecipherable] choir and the Gaithersburg chorus.</span> <span id="s1583">And we do quite a few Yiddish songs there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Well that’s a -- a wonderful motto to end up on.</span> <span id="s1585">Thank you so much for doing this interview.</span> <span id="s1586">This -- this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rita Lifschitz Rubinstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">End of Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0174 PAGE 73</span></p></body></html>
