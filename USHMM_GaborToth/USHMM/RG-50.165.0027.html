it's irrational.</span> <span id="s206">There's a latent anti-Semitism in this country.</span> <span id="s207">All we have done is keep the lid on, make it disrespectful.</span> <span id="s208">But it's there.</span> <span id="s209">As long as that disease exists, it has the potential for being a plague.</span> <span id="s210">We just don't know exactly under what conditions it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">WH: Aside from the obvious is there a way in which your experiences affect the way you function here?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">AF: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s213">I' m a product of both the good and the bad.</span> <span id="s214">On the one hand, there was the anti-Semitism and on the other there was this woman who risked her life to save me regardless of what happened.</span> <span id="s215">She did it as a human being.</span> <span id="s216">I don't know whether she did it because she wanted me to be a Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s217">It doesn't matter; she risked her life.</span> <span id="s218">And the people who saved Jews were not the doctors or professors, the simple people.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">WH: Do you believe education can prevent a Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">AF: It's one of the elements.</span> <span id="s221">Sometimes it's exposure; sometimes it's embarrassment; sometimes it's a threat.</span> <span id="s222">We've also found the more educated blacks are, the more anti-Semitic they can be.</span> <span id="s223">I remember one time a black professor said at a meeting we had: "You know why there's anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s224">It's because Jews excel."</span> <span id="s225">So another guy around the table said: "You know, I'll make a deal with you.</span> <span id="s226">We'll be number three or number two if you'll guarantee there'll be no anti-Semitism."</span> <span id="s227">Education isn't necessarily the antidote, but it's one way.</span> <span id="s228">I'll fight it any way I can.</span> <span id="s229">In this country anti-Semitism is here but it's different.</span> <span id="s230">We experienced in this country in a period of twelve to eighteen months Boesky, Pollard, Irangate, and the crisis with the farmers———four classic situations for anti-Semitism: Boesky—Jewish greed; Pollard—dual loyalty.</span> <span id="s231">And our people, not the goyim, wrote about dual loyalty; Irangate—a situation where Israel was shlepping America into its interest; the farm crisis—America lives on myths.</span> <span id="s232">One of the myths in the farm belt has been that if you work hard and go to church and you're moral, you'll be rewarded.</span> <span id="s233">These people wake up one morning and they're being bankrupted.</span> <span id="s234">Guys come in and say: "Hey, the Jews, Eastern bankers It didn't sell...So I say to you, something's different in this country.</span> <span id="s235">Thirty, forty years ago, if you had a confluence of these things there would have been anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s236">There isn't.</span> <span id="s237">In 1973, we saw it coming with the oil crisis, but it didn't.</span> <span id="s238">For every bumper sticker to burn Jews, not oil, we got 10,000 phone calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s240">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0027 PAGE 5</span></p> <p><span id="s241">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
