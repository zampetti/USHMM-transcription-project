Col.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Arieh Pinchuk, Col. Dan Hiram and Lt. Col. Dan Dagen.</span> <span id="s21">The three were Jewish soldiers in World War II, that came from a country under British dominion and incited Nazi Armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">(AP speaks) Breakout of WWII we became aware of what was happening in Germany and the other occupied countries and therefore young Jewish people tried to find ways to help the British Army.</span> <span id="s23">Being under British dominion, Palestine was considered a mandate.</span> <span id="s24">Being a mandate, we were only allowed to volunteer.</span> <span id="s25">There were about 35,000 volunteers out of a population of 600,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">2:20 There were first various service units and during the first years we tried to get recognition as a separate fighting unit.</span> <span id="s27">In 1943 the Jewish Brigade was formed and t hen went to Italy and saw action in the fall of 1943.</span> <span id="s28">After the war was ended in Italy and only after that did we meed with the Holocaust people and when we went to the other low land countries like Belgium and Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">3:40 At the time some men were all around Europe, who were supposed to meet the people in the camps and to organize their transfers from the camps to, what the British thought of as illegal, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s30">(D.H. speaks) Before the Jewish Brigade was formed under Winston Churchill in the summer of '44, we served in different British units for many years, before we had the permission to serve under our own flag.</span> <span id="s31">We formed our own fighting formations out of the existing battalions of the Palestine</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">5:51 (Q: How did you feel on that day you were granted permission?)</span> <span id="s34">(D.H. continued) We were very proud and showed off our star of David on our shoulders.</span> <span id="s35">We wanted to become the nucleus of the future Jewish Israeli fighting force -- to become an independent army.</span> <span id="s36">This was first like the first step -- Jewish formation under it's own flag -- towards an independent army under</span></p> <p><span id="s37">an independent state.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">7:12 (D.D. speaks) I volunteered late 1941 while we were still unrecognized as a fighting unit but later we were formed under one battalion.</span> <span id="s39">The strive to be recognized as Jews as not part of the British army was the ultimate because we could walk with our heads high with the start of David, especially during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s40">it gave new life to them fighting to save Jews.</span> <span id="s41">What of course though what we did now illegal and underground, but that is another</span></p> <p><span id="s42">story.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">9:05 (Q: What were your feeling as Romel pushed towards the Maine?)</span> <span id="s44">(A.H. speaks) Jewish command in Palestine (ESHEV?)</span> <span id="s45">got organized when Romel pushed eastward and there was a danger that he might be successful.</span> <span id="s46">The Jewish leadership elaborated a plan in which some people would never the less enter the British army for training but also so that the war against the Nazi's would not be won without the Jews being represented as an independent fighting unit and so that people would know that the people which suffered most took part against Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s47">This was our main project.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">11:29 These soldiers who came back were also the best equipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">(DH) Women also participated but not in the fighting units only in the services -- ambulances, hospitals.</span> <span id="s50">(D.D).</span> <span id="s51">There were about 2-3 thousand women of the 35,000.</span> <span id="s52">They were serving in the auxiliary rhetorical forces as ambulance drivers and even some as lorry drivers and other services.</span> <span id="s53">We also had a few hundred in the auxiliary air force within the Royal Air Force.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">14:03 (Q: If the Jewish Brigade had it's own air force, do you think they would have bombed Auschwitz?)</span> <span id="s55">(AP) Though it is a speculated question, I am certain that we would have bombed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Many army generals then have said that they would do it looking back.</span> <span id="s57">I think that many military leaders now, are of the opinion that it was a grave mistake.</span> <span id="s58">Had they done it, they would have saved many thousands of lives.</span> <span id="s59">(D.D.) Going back to the previous question of Romel, we had no fear, no desperation, worry?</span> <span id="s60">Yes, We were prepared to fight to end, hopefully their end.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">19:06 (Q: For us you were the heroes.</span> <span id="s62">What did it mean to you to see us in stripped shirts, etc) (DD) That question did not arise at that time.</span> <span id="s63">The feeling was that we were finding the reminisces of the lost Jewelry.</span> <span id="s64">(Q: When you came to the DB campus you were involved in education.</span> <span id="s65">Can you describe some of them?)</span> <span id="s66">(AP) what we did first was to organize their transfer to camps as near to the Brigade as possible.</span> <span id="s67">The biggest camps were around Italy.</span> <span id="s68">We would try to take them to Bauri and Brindisi and then further transfer them to Israel.</span> <span id="s69">But whilst they were staying we organized military training for the youngest, and teaching Hebrew and Jewish History and about the Jewish Community in Palestine to prepare them for their arrival in Israel.</span> <span id="s70">We would help them contact their friends and relatives and people they wanted to find and generally provided, or course, food, clothing, etc.</span> <span id="s71">.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">21:30 This was a complete job which we had to do apart from our military service.</span> <span id="s73">You must appreciate still that some of the units had British commanders.</span> <span id="s74">Even though they knew what was going on, they were not to harsh with us, and, I might say even generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Thanks to that we could go on with our operations quite successfully.</span> <span id="s76">Although some arrived quite dolorous, I think all of them arrive.</span> <span id="s77">(Q: Do you think there was a different attitude in the British soldiers once the ships reached the shores of Palestine?)</span> <span id="s78">(AP) There is nothing to compare the Br.</span> <span id="s79">commander was Jewish minded -- Israeli minded.</span> <span id="s80">Even the Br.</span> <span id="s81">officers were pro-Jewish in women way.</span> <span id="s82">This I can't say about the British officers or British polish in Palestine.</span> <span id="s83">Those officers were given all sorts of explanations and they were given a different job -- they were anti-</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">23:46 I remember returning in British uniform and being taken by a British sergeant and officer.</span> <span id="s86">I would say, not in a very polite manner, (DD) We should distinguish their political official attitude which was anti -- they were against all we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">25:20 (Q: We may discuss the taking of the Jews to Palestine.</span> <span id="s88">At the time you come into contact with Americans.)</span> <span id="s89">(AP) Not with many.</span> <span id="s90">We were neighboring the American zone but we didn't meet</span></p> <p><span id="s91">many.</span> <span id="s92">(Q: During the Brigah (?)</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">One of the first projects of the</span></p> <p><span id="s95">US.</span> <span id="s96">Did you experience such an encounter?)</span> <span id="s97">I had several occasions when I met an American officer.</span> <span id="s98">They were helpful and open-minded.</span> <span id="s99">They were not really acting as soldiers, but they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s100">(DH) Since we were in a British formation the American's help was very limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">27:33 I want to comment on your comment on our relationship to Britain.</span> <span id="s102">This was a very ambivalent relationship.</span> <span id="s103">We will fight the British mandate as if Hitler didn't exist.</span> <span id="s104">So these were actually two wars -- one against Hitler and ne against the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">(Q: What happened when the illegal immigrants arrived on the shores of Israel?)</span> <span id="s106">It was a different organization which helped them.</span> <span id="s107">.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">We were in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">29:00 (Q: I do recall some individual members of the Jewish Brigade who worked on their own initiative?)</span> <span id="s110">The Jewish Brigade was highly organized.</span> <span id="s111">They weren't volunteers but members of the organization.</span> <span id="s112">Amongst us hidden were commanders of the operations.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Organizations of ships to shores of Palestine and in palestine there were men in uniform.</span> <span id="s114">The Jewish Brigade was not in Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">We took 50 to 60 people of the BD camps on.</span> <span id="s116">They went to Cyprus or other DB camps.</span> <span id="s117">Instead of them we returned some of the people to Palestine, using their names and cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">32:20 (Q: did the men marry some of the women in the DB camps?)</span> <span id="s119">Yes, we had quite a number of cases because these camps were near us.</span> <span id="s120">We used to have social meeting with these people.</span> <span id="s121">Some came home married men.</span> <span id="s122">(DH) Sometimes they got married fictionally just to bring them into Palestine legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">34:40 (AP) The French were at that time cooperative.</span> <span id="s124">La Division Duiv(?)</span> <span id="s125">was well known.</span> <span id="s126">We crossed almost the whole of southern France.</span> <span id="s127">They were very cooperative especially when one of the lorries turned over.</span> <span id="s128">Without their help we couldn't of done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">We had camps, convoys, training camps throughout France.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Considering this being right after the war and their hatred towards the Germans, we met them with enthusiasm, we did not feel any anti- semitism at that time on the part of the French or the French Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">36:20 (Q: How did the Germans react when they saw you Star of David on you military uniform?)</span> <span id="s132">(DD) I think they were shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">(AP) When we took our first prisoners and they found out that we were the Jewish Brigade, they were sure that they were going to be shot right away.</span> <span id="s134">I think they were shocked at not being shot and not being maltreated.</span> <span id="s135">In Germany we met various people.</span> <span id="s136">At that state of war then, they could not be pro-Nazi.</span> <span id="s137">I think they saw the war as over so I think that this was the reason.</span> <span id="s138">I don't think that they could have changed their mind.</span> <span id="s139">I don't think the change in mind could take place so rapidly, but they behaved well and they tried to treat us well.</span> <span id="s140">We met the simpler people, not the SS or</span></p> <p><span id="s141">the SA.</span> <span id="s142">They were taken by the Americans into prison camps or</span></p> <p><span id="s143">other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">38:06 (DH) I would like to say something regarding the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">I knew hundreds of Germans -- civilians and prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Without exception all the Germans in 1945 their first sentence was that they knew nothing.</span> <span id="s147">They never took part in anything.</span> <span id="s148">They didn't know what a concentration camp is.</span> <span id="s149">They didn't do anything against the Jews.</span> <span id="s150">The always liked them.</span> <span id="s151">The question was where did all the millions of people who supported Hitler go.</span> <span id="s152">Everyone was completely detached and no one took part in it.</span> <span id="s153">(Q: What did it mean to you to go back to Europe with a Jewish Uniform?)</span> <span id="s154">(DH continued).</span> <span id="s155">You see we were very young at that time.</span> <span id="s156">We were dealing with a great matter of facts with a situation and we had a job to do and we did our job.</span> <span id="s157">The depth and size of the tragedy we realized only later -- when the books and articles came out.</span> <span id="s158">In the first meetings we dealt with it in a very matter of the fact way.</span> <span id="s159">We had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">40:40 (Q: I would like you to sum up the Jewish Brigade on three levels: on a personal level, what it meant to the Jewish State and what it means on a national level.)</span> <span id="s161">(DD) personal issue, I am 3rd generation Israeli, so it came naturally, but also you must understand that each of us had connections in the military, so it was more than natural to want to fight the main enemy of the nation.</span> <span id="s162">Along with the years we served in the army and then finally encountering the Germans, we had a feeling that we had finally reached our goal as a person and as a community.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">42:30 It had great importance.</span> <span id="s164">35,000 volunteered out of a population of 600,000 into the army.</span> <span id="s165">That is a very high percentage.</span> <span id="s166">it meant that the nation had a feeling that it's sons should be a part of the world struggle not only against the Nazis but for a new and a free world.</span> <span id="s167">Coming back as a formation and immediately the war o independence broke without the military knowledge of those who came back it would have been impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">44:12 (DH) I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s169">I had to run from Hitler.</span> <span id="s170">For me to return 5 years later as a soldier of the Jewish Brigade made me feel very proud.</span> <span id="s171">On the national level one must remember that the main issue was free immigration into Palestine.</span> <span id="s172">To open up Palestine for all the Jews to come in was a feeling of dedication of the part we are playing establishing a Jewish independent state and opening Palestine's borders to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">46:01 (AP) We are three people and each will have a different story.</span> <span id="s174">I came to Palestine from Poland voluntarily in '37.</span> <span id="s175">Under the law I could bring my parents in after 2 years but months before war broke out and my parents were destroyed.</span> <span id="s176">In 1944 I know that my parents were dead.</span> <span id="s177">I felt something that I had to do.</span> <span id="s178">I was more than satisfied to join the British army and the Jewish</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Brigade.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">48:03 On the Jewish side that in that kind of war in WWII was regarded as a different war.</span> <span id="s181">Nazi Germany decided to annihilate the Jews as a race.</span> <span id="s182">historically speaking the Jewish Brigade formed an important mission by recording for history in an organized fashion, stood up that enemy as Jews and not just as soldiers in the army.</span> <span id="s183">The second aspect has another side, the universal aspect which means in my view (get's cut</span></p> <p><span id="s184">here)</span></p> <p><span id="s185">.</span> <span id="s186">END.</span></p></body></html>
