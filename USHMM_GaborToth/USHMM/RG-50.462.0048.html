speaking and I am about to interview Mrs. Lillian Steinig.</span> <span id="s3">This is side 1 of the first tape, April 22, 1982.</span> <span id="s4">I am going to start out, Mrs. Steinig, by asking you when and where you were born, and if you could tell us a little bit about your family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">LS: I was born January 23, 1923, in Poland.</span> <span id="s6">The name of this city is Stryj.</span> <span id="s7">My father was a merchant, but right before the war, he sold his store and he rented a farm not far away from Stryj.</span> <span id="s8">His parents used to have their own, they owned their farm, but during the First World War it burnt out and he was used to life on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">JS: So, his reason, then, for getting the farm was because this was something that he knew from childhood to be a pleasant experience?</span> <span id="s10">It had nothing to do with what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">LS: No, no.</span> <span id="s12">From the beginning I was going to school in Stryj and living with my grandmother, but when my brother got older, we both took a train from the farm to Stryj and we traveled every day by train to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">JS: And that was....What ages are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">LS: I am talking about, let’s say 13, I was 13 and my brother was younger, he must have been 9.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JS: And this went on for how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">LS: This went on until the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">JS: We are talking about how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">LS: We are talking about....We stayed on the farm 5 years before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s19">When the war broke out, I finished the 4th class of Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s20">The Polish system in school were 4 classes in Gymnasium, and 2 Lycees.</span> <span id="s21">Altogether there were 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">JS: What would this be the equivalent to in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">LS: This would be the equivalent of regular high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JS: You completed high school then by the time...?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">LS: No, I completed high school after the Russians occupied my city.</span> <span id="s26">You see, the war broke out in 1939.</span> <span id="s27">First, the Germans came in, and then they left, and let the Russians in.</span> <span id="s28">Then the Russians came to the farm.</span> <span id="s29">Their system - nothing belongs to us anymore because they felt that my father was a capitalist, and they told him to leave everything, to give them the key and we have to go to the city.</span> <span id="s30">We had to rent, we had a big farm at that time, let’s say maybe 300 acres, horses and cows and a lot of people working there, but when the Russians came in, they said, “Nothing belongs to you, you have to leave it and go to the city and you work there and you make a living.”</span> <span id="s31">This is the first time that I remember my father had a heart attack because it was a terrible experience for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JS: Where was your mother at this time?</span> <span id="s33">You didn’t mention her.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">LS: My mother was wonderful.</span> <span id="s35">She was a city girl, used to city life, but because my father liked to have a farm she went with him.</span> <span id="s36">She was a wonderful housekeeper, she learned whatever she had.</span> <span id="s37">Of course, we had help there, but she managed whatever she had to manage.</span> <span id="s38">Just the household.</span> <span id="s39">When we came in town, this was, I think, Succos time, people looked at us like we are crazy.</span> <span id="s40">“What do you mean they threw you out?</span> <span id="s41">It belongs to you.”</span> <span id="s42">We said, “No, they told us nothing belongs to us.”</span></p> <p><span id="s43">JS: You are saying that the people in the city hadn’t had that kind of experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">LS: At that time the Russians didn’t nationalize the stores, yet.</span> <span id="s45">Eventually they did it, but later on.</span> <span id="s46">So we stayed in the city and we rented a place, a small apartment.</span> <span id="s47">I can’t remember exactly what my father was doing then, in the city.</span> <span id="s48">I know only that they had a task force that he was...it was called Prnieszczyk [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JS: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">LS: P-R-N-I-E-S-Z-C-Z-Y-K.</span> <span id="s51">[Pomestchik (phoetic) means Lord of the Manor.]</span></p> <p><span id="s52">JS: That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">LS: No, that was like a name they gave to a farm owner and he couldn’t get certain jobs, he was sort of discriminated.</span> <span id="s54">I had to go to a Russian school, and that was how I finished my education.</span> <span id="s55">The Russians have 10 years of schooling, 10 years of schooling.</span> <span id="s56">I finished equivalent to American high school.</span> <span id="s57">I finished the 9th and 10th grade in Russian school.</span> <span id="s58">We had to learn Russian and it was a strange language to me.</span> <span id="s59">We had to learn Russian history.</span> <span id="s60">I was like in-between.</span> <span id="s61">Here I hated the Russians, and here they told me that whatever my father was, it wasn’t right.</span> <span id="s62">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">JS: That must have been a difficult experience for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">LS: It was terribly difficult.</span> <span id="s65">My father was so scared that whenever he used to come home, he used to put his finger in front of his mouth to be quiet, because he was afraid that somebody else might listen.</span> <span id="s66">So, we had the Russians for two years, from 1939 until 1941, till the war broke out with Germany.</span> <span id="s67">Now, coming back, I know you are interested in the Jewish life in my city.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JS: Which city are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">LS: Stryj.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JS: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">LS: S-T-R-Y-J.</span> <span id="s72">It belongs now to Russia.</span> <span id="s73">Personally, I can say that I felt...let’s say that because I am Jewish, and my girlfriends treated me differently.</span> <span id="s74">I went to Polish school where it was mixed.</span> <span id="s75">We did have Jewish schools, like in different cities, I know.</span> <span id="s76">It was mixed.</span> <span id="s77">I lived in a mixed neighborhood too.</span> <span id="s78">While I was living in the city, we had neighbors that were Gentiles.</span> <span id="s79">My parents were well-to-do.</span> <span id="s80">I wouldn’t say very rich, but pretty well-to-do and, while I was going to high school, it was costly.</span> <span id="s81">we had to pay for our education in high school.</span> <span id="s82">Normally the fee was 50 zlotys.</span> <span id="s83">That was equivalent to a dollar, let’s say, like you would pay $50 a month for education.</span> <span id="s84">So I got a little break and I think we paid only $30 a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">JS: How is it that you had a break on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">LS: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s87">My father tried to get it a little cheaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JS: That was something, then, that could be negotiated?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">LS: It could be negotiated, yes.</span> <span id="s90">For me life was good.</span> <span id="s91">I didn’t dream ever of coming to America, and I still feel a little uprooted, let’s say, because my friends aren’t here.</span> <span id="s92">When I went to Israel for a visit, I felt at home because I met a lot of friends, school friends, and the new friends are not the same.</span> <span id="s93">We have common things to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">JS: There is something about those early experiences that we hold onto.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">LS: It was a carefree life, I think.</span> <span id="s96">And, like everybody looking back at their young days, they feel that is the part they need to appreciate.</span> <span id="s97">And what I feel personally is the wartime, it really deprived me of so much, because, first of all, the school was so strict, high school.</span> <span id="s98">We had to wear uniforms, navy skirts and blouses and berets and God forbid that the teacher would see you on the street without the beret, you were reprimanded in school.</span> <span id="s99">She used to say only cooks walk around without their hat being [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s100">JS: You graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">LS: I graduated the Russian school in the 9th and 10th grade of the Russian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JS: How about beyond that?</span> <span id="s103">Did you go beyond that?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">LS: No, the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JS: And how did that, then, begin to influence your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">LS: The Germans came in in 1941.</span> <span id="s107">I don’t remember when it was, June, I think, and first I worked in a place where you did some knitting, I remember.</span> <span id="s108">And then I worked for awhile in the clinic, with sick people.</span> <span id="s109">It was a short while.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JS: Was it difficult to get jobs at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">LS: Not that is was difficult.</span> <span id="s112">My father, you see, my family was my mother, my father, and a younger brother.</span> <span id="s113">My father went to work with my brother at the lumber yard.</span> <span id="s114">They did get special papers when they were working there because every body tells them as long as you are working, you are sort of safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">JS: What were these special papers, and how did one go about getting them?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">LS: We got it from the place that we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JS: Was this more difficult for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">LS: Jews had to work.</span> <span id="s119">If not...they had to work because...I don’t’ remember when we had the first raid on Jews, because, I think, I experienced maybe two or maybe three, only.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JS: What do you remember about those raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">LS: Just that soldiers came in and knocked at the door and they took people out, and they took them out by, not cars, buses, and then to the train and the people never came back.</span> <span id="s122">And then it was already normal life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JS: This happened to people that you knew, friends, neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">LS: It happened, wait a minute, it happened to my grandmother and uncle, aunt.</span> <span id="s125">When we found out, people started to make, like little bunkers, hiding places, and we had a place like that in the basement, where, through an opening from the kitchen we went down and we put a table on top of it, on top of that opening, so we were safe this way.</span> <span id="s126">In 1942, we moved to a different place, because where we lived, the apartment that we lived in when we came to the city, during the Russian time, we had to evacuate and go to a special section in the city.</span> <span id="s127">This was, how do you say it?</span> <span id="s128">Required by the Germans.</span> <span id="s129">Jews have to occupy, let’s say, so many , so many streets.</span> <span id="s130">It wasn’t a ghetto, it was just a special section for the Jews.</span> <span id="s131">At that time we just stayed with the Jews because before, we were living in a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s132">We heard rumors that, let’s say, a certain day the Germans are going to have a raid.</span> <span id="s133">So my father, who was going to work with my brother at the lumberyard, he was so sure that his papers were all right that he wouldn’t hide in the place we had to hide in, and he walked out in the morning and he was taken.</span> <span id="s134">Of course, we did not know anything about it because we were hidden.</span> <span id="s135">Soon after the raid, we came up again to out place where we lived, from the hiding place and, let’s say, overnight my father came back, full of blood, with teeth knocked out so we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s136">He told us what he did.</span> <span id="s137">The Germans took him right away on the street with my brother to a synagogue where they gathered all other Jews.</span> <span id="s138">Then they took them to the train station and loaded them into these cattle cars.</span> <span id="s139">But my father....</span> <span id="s140">And the window was closed.</span> <span id="s141">It was like wooden windows with nails.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JS: On the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">LS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s144">He went to the window and tried to break it open, and people were screaming, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s145">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s146">You are going to avenge all of us.”</span> <span id="s147">He didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s148">As soon as the train started, he pushed open the window and he threw my brother out and then he jumped out after him.</span> <span id="s149">This is why he was hurt when he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">JS: Your brother was how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">LS: My brother must have been then 13 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JS: So he was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">LS: Sure, he was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">JS: And your father was about how old, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">LS: This was in 1942 and he was born in 1895.</span> <span id="s156">So he was 47 years old.</span> <span id="s157">He came home and, oh, I forgot to tell you what he lived from.</span> <span id="s158">Whatever clothes we had - we had a good friend, a Gentile, she used to sell, and this is how we lived.</span> <span id="s159">There was not much to eat at that time.</span> <span id="s160">Anyway, we called the doctor to treat my father.</span> <span id="s161">It was a Jewish doctor and he came to us and he looked at me and he says, “Who is it?”</span> <span id="s162">And my mother says, “This is my daughter.”</span> <span id="s163">And he says, “Why do you keep her home?”</span> <span id="s164">So I said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s165">He said, “She doesn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s166">She can pass as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s167">Why don’t you try to get her some papers?”</span> <span id="s168">When I heard it, it just...my mind starting working.</span> <span id="s169">The woman that sold our clothes was the mother of my girlfriend from public school, and when she came over one day I asked her, “Do you think that your daughter would giver me her birth certificate and her identification card?”</span> <span id="s170">At that time we had only the Russian identification card.</span> <span id="s171">We didn’t get yet the German identification card.</span> <span id="s172">It was with this girlfriend’s picture.</span> <span id="s173">She agreed to do it.</span> <span id="s174">She brought me her birth certificate and card.</span> <span id="s175">Didn’t give her any money.</span> <span id="s176">She didn’t want any money.</span> <span id="s177">She was a really good person.</span> <span id="s178">I took my identification card, took off my picture and put it on the new identification card and the name was Jadwiga Belinska.</span> <span id="s179">Then I started thinking, where am I going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">JS: You were how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">LS: This was in 1942.</span> <span id="s182">I was born in 1923, so I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">JS: Twenty-nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">LS: No, its wrong.</span> <span id="s185">1942, 19 years old.</span> <span id="s186">I remember that on the farm, that place where we had the farm, we had a public school teacher whose husband was a high school teacher, and we knew them very well.</span> <span id="s187">When the Germans came, they moved away to the western part of Poland and we had their address.</span> <span id="s188">So, I thought, what about if I go there?</span> <span id="s189">Maybe they will take me.</span> <span id="s190">My mother wouldn’t let me go by myself.</span> <span id="s191">She asked that lady that was selling the clothes if she would travel with me.</span> <span id="s192">She agreed.</span> <span id="s193">But I asked the lady, too, “When I am leaving, would you take my parents to stay with you?”</span> <span id="s194">She agreed to it.</span> <span id="s195">But first she took my mother to her house the same night I was leaving.</span> <span id="s196">She took her into her house because my brother and my father were still working at the lumber yard and they felt for a while that they could stay there.</span> <span id="s197">So, night time I left home....Oh, I forgot to tell you, we were wearing these arm bands with the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s198">It was November and it was cold already and we were not supposed to, we did not have the fur on our coats because this we had to give to the Germans.</span> <span id="s199">The woman, she bought for me the ticket and for herself.</span> <span id="s200">I say good-bye to my parents, we went to the station and on the station they have the German police, special uniforms, looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s201">We went on the train till we came to Krakow and we had to switch the train, and we waited in the waiting room and a German policeman approaches us.</span> <span id="s202">He wanted the papers, so I showed him the papers.</span> <span id="s203">He didn’t see that the picture doesn’t match, the stamp on the picture doesn’t match.</span> <span id="s204">He didn’t see that, and the funniest thing happened.</span> <span id="s205">He accuses that woman that she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s206">She says to him, “Look, my husband passed away, but he is known that he used to work in the train station in Stryj.</span> <span id="s207">You could call there and verify it,” and I say to the man, “What do think that the lady is Jewish?”</span> <span id="s208">And he says, “Look at her, she looks like a Jew.”</span> <span id="s209">So, because I was very young, I say to him, “If you can spot a person by the looks, well I can say that you look Jewish, too.”</span> <span id="s210">That’s what I say to him, and he let us go.</span> <span id="s211">We came to the city my old friend the teacher was living.</span> <span id="s212">I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s213">The lady opened, she looks at me and she got scared.</span> <span id="s214">“Come in, come in.”</span></p> <p><span id="s215">JS: Did she know that you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">LS: She didn’t know.</span> <span id="s217">I didn’t want to write because it would give her too much to think.</span> <span id="s218">She would probably have refused.</span> <span id="s219">That...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JS: Please excuse me while I change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">(Interview stops before tape is fully run) Tape 1, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JS: We are now beginning the second side of the first tape.</span> <span id="s223">[Long pause] If you would continue now about meeting this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">LS: We walked in.</span> <span id="s225">I know why she was afraid a little bit.</span> <span id="s226">She had a small girl and she didn’t want me to say anything in front of her, so she shouldn’t be a little bit suspicious.</span> <span id="s227">We walked into a separate room and I explained to her.</span> <span id="s228">I introduced the lady that brought me and I told her that I have a birth certificate under a different name, and I asked her if she would allow me to stay with her.</span> <span id="s229">She agreed.</span> <span id="s230">I stayed with them until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s231">They introduced me to their friends as a cousin that came from the western part of Poland, because the Germans used to take a lot of Polish girls to work into Germany, so she explains to their friends that I came here because I was afraid the Germans may take me to work.</span> <span id="s232">In the same city lived this lady’s father-in-law, so I was introduced as her niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">JS: What was the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">LS: The name of the town?</span> <span id="s235">Przedbórz.</span> <span id="s236">It was near Kielce.</span> <span id="s237">Kielce was the big city and this was a very small town.</span> <span id="s238">By the time that I came there it was judenfrei, not a single Jew living there.</span> <span id="s239">At that time, they were selling Jewish furniture, Jewish clothes and the Poles were buying it.</span> <span id="s240">Now, these people that took me in were educated people.</span> <span id="s241">She was a teacher, a public school teacher, and he was a high school teacher.</span> <span id="s242">They were nice to me, but they were antisemites.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">JS: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">LS: How I can tell.</span> <span id="s245">Well, it was a very small town and they used to have a judge coming over, and a few lawyers coming over, and not a single time, it happened that they would say, “It was a shame what happened to the Jews.”</span> <span id="s246">Not a single time.</span> <span id="s247">The only good thing about the people that I lived with, I could say, was they didn’t buy anything from the Jews like the Germans [unclear].</span> <span id="s248">She worked as a supervisor of kitchen for children of poor people.</span> <span id="s249">I really can’t remember....And he used to teach high school illegally at home.</span> <span id="s250">I started taking care of the household and in that city they had a lot of factories that they made wool for knitting.</span> <span id="s251">I knew how to knit and materials were very expensive then, so I started working, knitting at home sweaters, skirts, boots, whatever, and all of the money that I made I gave them, because they didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s252">From the beginning I used to go with them to church.</span> <span id="s253">Later I didn’t feel like going so I was telling always their friends that I go to early mass.</span> <span id="s254">I was posing as her cousin.</span> <span id="s255">Then one day, a niece of hers came over from Warsaw, so that time I introduced her as his cousin, and I have here some pictures even, too, at home, under Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s256">I remember that time they were talking a lot about the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s257">Meetings, fighting.</span> <span id="s258">I didn’t pay too much attention then.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">I want to go back to the lady that brought me, on the train.</span> <span id="s260">When I say good-bye to her, she said that she would take care of my mother.</span> <span id="s261">And I told her that I am going to write to her, how I am, and it really happened.</span> <span id="s262">I wrote to her address and I used her to get letters from home from my mother, too.</span> <span id="s263">Eventually my father had to leave the lumber yard and she took him in, so she had my mother and my brother and my father.</span> <span id="s264">They stayed hidden there.</span> <span id="s265">It was a small home with a little cellar.</span> <span id="s266">My father slept, he told me, he slept on a slab.</span> <span id="s267">We used to have a maid at home.</span> <span id="s268">She was a nursemaid to my brother.</span> <span id="s269">She was the only one that knew my parents are there.</span> <span id="s270">The lady that kept my parents was a widow.</span> <span id="s271">She couldn’t hang out man’s clothes, man’s underwear, so this maid used to come and take the clothes and wash them and bring them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">JS: Let me just clarify here for a minute the dates.</span> <span id="s273">We are talking now about...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">LS: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JS: Through...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">LS: 1942 to 1945, the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">JS: ‘45, right.</span> <span id="s278">And during this period of time you were able to have contact with...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">LS: I was communicating until the time that the Russians came back.</span> <span id="s280">The Russians took that part over in 1944, and I was cut off until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s281">I didn’t hear anything about them...So, after the war ended, I really wasn’t sure if my parents were alive.</span> <span id="s282">I couldn’t wait to go home.</span> <span id="s283">I said good-bye to these people that I stayed with.</span> <span id="s284">The trains weren’t going because the train tracks were demolished, so I took a small Rucksack, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s285">Knapsack, on my back and tried to hitchhike with cars and trucks.</span> <span id="s286">They were Russian trucks that time.</span> <span id="s287">I came to a city, it was [unclear], where there was the border between Russian and Poland and without... oh, there is something else that I forgot to say that is very important.</span> <span id="s288">I have to come back.</span> <span id="s289">In that new city that I stayed over, people didn’t have yet the German identification cards, and I had to go and get it myself.</span> <span id="s290">So I went to the office and I put my name Jadwiga Belinska and I read it: Were my parents Jewish?</span> <span id="s291">Were my grandparents Jewish?</span> <span id="s292">No, and I got my identification card that I got.</span> <span id="s293">It was fun.</span> <span id="s294">That you could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">JS: You felt you kind of put something over on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">LS: Over on them.</span> <span id="s297">That’s right.</span> <span id="s298">I outsmarted them.</span> <span id="s299">I came back, and wartime and, oh, gosh, they are talking about bombs and bombing.</span> <span id="s300">When I heard the bombs and something going on, and I was the happiest one, because I knew that something was being done, something was going on.</span> <span id="s301">As I told you, I was going home with these Russian trucks till I came to the city of [unclear] where I needed a pass to go to a Russian part, that Russian-occupied part that my parents were in.</span> <span id="s302">And the man that was giving these, called in Russian [unclear], he wasn’t in because it was Saturday or Sunday, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s303">So a Russian man that was driving a Red Cross car and took me to that city, told me to lay down on the floor and he covered me and nobody saw me and I went through the border and then I came to Lwow.</span> <span id="s304">You heard about the city Lwow?</span> <span id="s305">This city is like 60 miles from my city.</span> <span id="s306">It didn’t have no buses, no trucks going that way and I didn’t have money because I needed rubles and I had only zlotys.</span> <span id="s307">So I’m stopping a man on the street to ask him which way to [unclear].</span> <span id="s308">I wanted to walk, but he looks at me and he says, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s309">And I said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s310">And he says, “Because I am Jewish, too.”</span> <span id="s311">That was the first Jew that I encountered and he helped me out.</span> <span id="s312">Anyway, I cant’ remember if I walked or I took another truck and I came to my city.</span> <span id="s313">Of course I was looking for the street and the house where that lady lived.</span> <span id="s314">I was terribly afraid to knock at the door.</span> <span id="s315">Anyway, I knocked and she was by herself.</span> <span id="s316">She says, “Your parents are alive, and your brother is alive.</span> <span id="s317">They have their own place now.</span> <span id="s318">But,” she says, “I am going with you and I will go in first and I will tell them that I have regards from you.</span> <span id="s319">I don't want your father to get scared, because he had heart trouble before and it would be a shock to him.”</span> <span id="s320">And she told me, “Do you know that your brother lost two fingers.”</span> <span id="s321">I don’t remember if he has it on the left hand or the right hand, working in the lumber yard with the saw.</span> <span id="s322">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s323">He just didn’t handle it right and his two fingers were cut off.</span> <span id="s324">He came home.</span> <span id="s325">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s326">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">JS: It must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">LS: One of the really best days of my life.</span> <span id="s329">I looked terribly bad after all of that walking and riding and I was undernourished and my father was, I don’t know, he was selling fish or something.</span> <span id="s330">I don’t remember and he told me that they are registered to go to Poland because that part was already called Russia.</span> <span id="s331">I said, “You want to go to Poland?</span> <span id="s332">Why don’t you want to stay here?”</span> <span id="s333">I said, “They hate us in Poland.</span> <span id="s334">Nobody gives a damn about us.”</span> <span id="s335">And my father thought, oh you come to Poland, they’ll welcome him.</span> <span id="s336">I didn’t have papers even, too, at that time to go back to Poland, so through some friend of my father’s, they made out the papers and I stayed in that city only two weeks because the Polish citizens could repatriate to Poland, and we were at that time Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s337">So it took us from Stryj to Krakow 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s338">I remember my mother baking bread before and she cooked before so we had enough food, and these were all like cattle cars that we were going in.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">I want to tell you something else that I omitted.</span> <span id="s340">When the Russians left and the Germans occupied our city, we had a Ukrainian friend that his son was taken prisoner and he was in jail, in Russian jail.</span> <span id="s341">When the Germans came in they opened the jail but he was looking for his son.</span> <span id="s342">In the courtyard there were sewers, like openings to the sewers.</span> <span id="s343">This is what my father told me, and they had all dead people in the sewers, and everytime you went outside the courtyard, the jail, you could smell this terrible stench and we didn’t know where this came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">We came to Krakow and we stayed there...1946, from 1945 to 1946, not a whole year, even.</span> <span id="s345">I got a job in an officer’s club and my father was, I don’t know what he was doing, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s346">We had a nice apartment, but at that time they had again a pogrom in Kielce, and even in Krakow they started beating up the Jews again and we were living at that time in Krakow under my assumed Polish name, too.</span> <span id="s347">Even my father’s name was Belinski too.</span> <span id="s348">Through some friends, illegally, we left Poland and we came to Austria.</span> <span id="s349">In Austria we lived in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s350">Actually, I wasn’t in a camp itself but on the border of the camp.</span> <span id="s351">There I met for the first time all these concentration camps inmates.</span> <span id="s352">They were longer...they were there since they were liberated.</span> <span id="s353">We went, I remember, one to [unclear], it must have been a small camp and I remember seeing baby shoes, little dolls...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">JS: Do you remember the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">LS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">JS: You had mentioned earlier about the raids that occurred and that various members of your family had been taken away.</span> <span id="s357">In that interim period, that time in between, had you heard about the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s358">Did you have any idea what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">LS: We had heard that they were taking people to different concentration camps for labor, but we didn’t hear that they were exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">JS: So you actually didn’t know about that until the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">LS: Actually, after the war.</span> <span id="s362">We knew that the people don’t come back.</span> <span id="s363">We couldn’t believe...we couldn’t believe that....We thought they were taking people for labor.</span> <span id="s364">Even like my father that time when he broke that window, and threw my brother out, people were against him.</span> <span id="s365">Because they didn’t expect that something bad, really bad, is going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s366">We didn’t....It’s hard to imagine.</span> <span id="s367">Like when I saw the first time in Linz, must have been 1946 or 19847, a film about the concentration camp, I couldn’t believe it is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">JS: You say that when you were in this displaced persons camp that you did meet concentration camp victims at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">LS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">JS: Were they able to tell you at that time about the experiences that they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">LS: They wouldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s372">I guess it was too, maybe they wanted to forget.</span> <span id="s373">Maybe, they wanted to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s374">Maybe, nobody talked about it.</span> <span id="s375">You knew they went through hell.</span> <span id="s376">I remember we had...I have even pictures here...on liberation day they made ceremonies in memory of the dead victims.</span> <span id="s377">Parades.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">JS: Where was this taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">LS: It was in Linz.</span> <span id="s380">In Linz I was working for Mr. Wiesenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">JS: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">LS: Yes, it was the first place...[long pause] and exactly I don't remember what they were doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">JS: Let’s stop here for a minute.</span> <span id="s384">[Long period before tape ends.]</span> <span id="s385">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s386">JS: Did you want to say a little about your experiences with Simon Wiesenthal?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">LS: He was a chairman.</span> <span id="s388">He organized a Jewish Identification Center, so-called, in Linz.</span> <span id="s389">And for a short while I was working for him, with my brother doing clerical works.</span> <span id="s390">I remember seeing for the first time the Jewish Exponent, and I can’t remember actually what was he doing at that time.</span> <span id="s391">I met him here, too, in Cherry Hill two years ago, three years ago.</span> <span id="s392">He recognized me, I brought my son who was very much impressed by Mr. Wiesenthal and he gave him a card with his autograph, and it was quite a reunion.</span> <span id="s393">I remember, oh, this goes back maybe 15 years.</span> <span id="s394">There is a writer Lewis....I forget his first name, and that time through somebody he heard that I knew Wiesenthal and he wanted to write a book about him.</span> <span id="s395">I remember he came to me and wanted to ask me questions.</span> <span id="s396">I couldn’t help too much because I really didn’t remember and I didn’t do too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JS: What was your job with Simon Wiesenthal?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">LS: Doing clerical work, typing was one thing.</span> <span id="s399">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s400">There is a lot of things that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s401">I don’t want to remember anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">JS: When did you begin to make plans to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">LS: Oh, my father had relatives in the States, his uncles, his sister’s brothers, and through relatives from Israel, we got their addresses and he wrote to them: please send us affidavits and, of course, we had to wait three years for the quota to come, and we came to the States in 1949, January 7th, on the S.S. Marina [unclear], on a boat which was a military boat with 500 people.</span> <span id="s404">It took us 11 days to cross the ocean.</span> <span id="s405">We had a horrible storm, terrible storm.</span> <span id="s406">Everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s407">The first night of crossing all the ladies got dressed nice, to the dining room...on other ships, people had to work, but this was a luxury ship.</span> <span id="s408">We had servants and bakers and everybody came into the dining room and we were enjoying dinner and the next day for breakfast nobody showed up.</span> <span id="s409">I wasn’t sick but it is a funny feeling you have.</span> <span id="s410">But we came to Boston.</span> <span id="s411">Oh, every time I go to New York and I go to Long Island where you cross with the ferry and I come back...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">JS: Staten Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">LS: Staten Island.</span> <span id="s414">And you go back to New York, I have that feeling that I am coming from Europe.</span> <span id="s415">But we didn’t come to New York.</span> <span id="s416">We docked at the Boston Harbor.</span> <span id="s417">At that time we were welcomed with an orchestra and ladies that bring you coffee and tea.</span> <span id="s418">I remember that they came to tell us that our uncle sends a telegram that they will wait for us at the station, the North Philadelphia station.</span> <span id="s419">So, I don’t remember even boarding the train.</span> <span id="s420">And we came to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s421">It was winter time and we were wearing these coats, warm coats, lined with fur underneath and the baggage was left on the train and my uncle looked for refugees.</span> <span id="s422">He couldn’t imagine that you are the refugees.</span> <span id="s423">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s424">JS: The expression on your face and the laughter in your voice indicates that that must have been quite an exciting time for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">LS: It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s426">So, the family did a very good thing.</span> <span id="s427">They were quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s428">But they felt like why should they take us into their home.</span> <span id="s429">So they rented a place in a hotel.</span> <span id="s430">It was the Quincy Hotel, I think, on Chestnut Street.</span> <span id="s431">And the first impression that I had: how come they don’t ask us here for passports, any identification card?</span> <span id="s432">Nothing.</span> <span id="s433">It was so different from the Russian times.</span> <span id="s434">And the German times.</span> <span id="s435">But the whole room was spinning.</span> <span id="s436">I still had the ocean in my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">JS: And you’ve been in Philadelphia ever since that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">LS: Yes, we only asked our family to get us some jobs, if possible.</span> <span id="s439">They were wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s440">They rented for us a house, later, on 40th Street.</span> <span id="s441">A dentist used to live there.</span> <span id="s442">He still has his office, and he rented the house and he furnished it with furniture, carpets, everything, but we paid them back.</span> <span id="s443">It was a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JS: I am glad things worked out the way they did for you.</span> <span id="s445">Before we end this interview, I just wanted to ask you a few more things about your earlier times.</span> <span id="s446">Specifically, if in fact you had experienced any antisemitism that you recall and whether in fact your family belonged to any Jewish organizations before the Nazis came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">LS: I personally didn’t experience much of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s448">I know only that at the highest institutions they were accidents [perhaps, incidents].</span> <span id="s449">The Polish students used to beat up Jewish students.</span> <span id="s450">I heard of it.</span> <span id="s451">It was hard to get into the medical profession, into the law profession, but I had non-Jewish girlfriends and I was living in a mixed neighborhood and, as a matter of fact, when I came here to Philadelphia, I used to say to my relatives - they lived in Wynnefield - I used to tell them, “My goodness, Hitler forced us to get going into ghettos and you are making ghettos here.”</span> <span id="s452">It was strange to me.</span> <span id="s453">My family...I really don’t remember if my father belonged to any organizations, Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s454">I did not because even though we had student Jewish organizations but it was sort of illegal for a high school student to belong to a organization and my parents would never permit me and I was a good girl and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s455">If they had dances, I used to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">JS: What might have happened if you did belong to an organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">LS: I would have been reprimanded by the school authorities.</span> <span id="s458">I really don’t know, but my parents wouldn’t allow me so I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">JS: Did you know anyone who did belong to organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">LS: Yes, I did have some girlfriends who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">JS: And were they reprimanded?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">LS: I don’t think so because nobody knew.</span> <span id="s463">The school didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">JS: Mrs. Steinig, is there anything else that you would like to relate at this time with respect to your background and experiences you had before in the early 1930’s and 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">LS: It’s like a dream.</span> <span id="s466">It’s, I know, I am longer in the United States than I lived in Poland, and I sort of still hear for those years there...even though somebody would tell me I will give you a free ticket to go to Poland, I would never go.</span> <span id="s467">I want to tell you also that the Polish people and the Ukrainian people, the neighbors, my neighbors, let’s say, people from the same city, are very guilty for what happened to the Jews in the city because the Germans could never tell who is Jewish.</span> <span id="s468">They didn’t know the Jews and they were helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">JS: So, you are saying that the Polish people and the Ukrainians helped the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">LS: Yes, even though, personally, I really can be thankful to two Polish families for saving my life and my parent’s life, but this was an exception, because if the Poles and the Ukrainians would want to help, they could help.</span> <span id="s471">Only, even though by not pointing the finger that this is a Jew, they would have helped.</span> <span id="s472">I’m sure that there is much more that I could tell.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t remember a lot but I told you before, if I ever have a bad experience, I push it as far back as I can.</span> <span id="s474">I don’t like to tell anyone.</span> <span id="s475">It’s not going to be helpful to me.</span> <span id="s476">It will make me miserable.</span> <span id="s477">There are years gone by and it’s a shame because they are the nicest years of my life and they are lost.</span> <span id="s478">They won’t come back.</span> <span id="s479">This country is my home now and it’s the one place I feel in the world that you can come without a penny and if you are willing to work, you get there.</span> <span id="s480">I always think, my goodness, just four walls and nobody should bother me and nobody should be behind me.</span> <span id="s481">Not to be afraid.</span> <span id="s482">Even though I didn’t go through hell like other people, but I was still afraid somebody might spot me, somehow.</span> <span id="s483">The only one Jew that approached me in Lwow [unclear]...A Jew could find another Jew out.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">JS: Is there anything else that you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">LS: I think I said enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">JS: I want to thank you so very much for sharing this personal history with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">LS: You are very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
