<span id="s12">Good morning, Mr. Merin.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Could you tell me where you were born, when you were born and what your name was at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Okay, it’s Harry Arnold Merin.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in Holland, Amsterdam, December 9th, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Wow, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s18">And what were – what were your parents like, what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My – I don’t know what my mom did, but my dad sold – actually, during that time, I think he did advertising, he did sign – made signs for stores and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I have a sister who was born in Holland after the war, and then a brother who was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s23">So you’re the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I’m the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay, so, obviously you were a baby –</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: – during the war.</span> <span id="s28">So tell me a little bit about what your parents were, where they were, what they were doing at this – when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s30">I know they moved, I – I’m not that – I don’t have the history exactly, of my parents.</span> <span id="s31">My parents really never discussed that with me.</span> <span id="s32">To me, I was considered too young.</span> <span id="s33">I know what he did after the war, I know they were hidden with different families.</span> <span id="s34">One of them was in Broek in Waterland, would be with – would be Friese(ph) and Preym(ph) is the persons who they were hidden ith – with.</span> <span id="s35">And that was right at the end of the war, and my dad used to travel back and forth in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s36">He – he had invented and wore the original roller skates, two wheels, and that’s what he traveled with, and – and they – they moved pretty fast.</span> <span id="s37">So, my dad had s – put money away during the war so he could get to it.</span> <span id="s38">And so there were – I do know they were captured once and they escaped.</span> <span id="s39">But otherwise, they had left me pretty well in the dark.</span> <span id="s40">The only think I knew, I was at – at the camps, I was picked up.</span> <span id="s41">I was with a nurse, picked up and taken to the camps.</span> <span id="s42">I found out a few years ago that I was part of a group of kids because at my age you feel, how did I survive the camp, you know, when you’re two and a half years old?</span> <span id="s43">I found out I was with a group called unver kenter kinder in, where there’s a whole memorial at the museum.</span> <span id="s44">There were 51 of us, almost all of us survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Hold on.</span> <span id="s46">All right.</span> <span id="s47">Sorry for the interruption.</span> <span id="s48">You were talking about being in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s50">I know I was in Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s51">I was, after the war I was brought to Hilversum, and I know my dad picked me up.</span> <span id="s52">Again, not much was said, but I do know he had found a motorcycle, and picked me up in a motorcycle from one of the buses, and that he had found my name in a newspaper, under the name Yetterman(ph).</span> <span id="s53">And when he got there, someone pointed to a sple – school buses, or buses, some type, and he pointed to which bus I would be on.</span> <span id="s54">So that is basically more than they used to tell me.</span> <span id="s55">Because they used to, you know, f – a group of them got together, per se, my parents’ friends, who also either hidden or camp survivors, and they used to discuss things.</span> <span id="s56">But I was basically never allowed into the group.</span> <span id="s57">I do know my mom has had nightmares.</span> <span id="s58">I didn’t know how bad, that she basically had nightmare almost every night.</span> <span id="s59">But that’s – was the point, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: My family was not very religious.</span> <span id="s62">We kept kosher, but I was not – we’re not glatt kosher, and I still am not, but we did keep kosher.</span> <span id="s63">In Holland, if we traveled, we had salads, or fish.</span> <span id="s64">And that is – that’s it.</span> <span id="s65">Oh, except I – I – I know I used to go to services on Saturday, and my dad would join me once in awhile, but most of the time I went to services, they sent me to services.</span> <span id="s66">Saturday I went by myself.</span> <span id="s67">And that would be probably from the age of six or seven.</span> <span id="s68">There was no fear of me getting lost, I had a very good sense of direction.</span> <span id="s69">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: And this was in Holland still?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: This was in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: When you were born, did you – did you have a bris?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I had a bris.</span> <span id="s74">I have records of what hospital I was born in, and I got records of things – the person who discovered me and br-brought me into this organization per se, is Hans van der Bruk, Kulp(ph).</span> <span id="s75">Kulp(ph) is his Jewish name.</span> <span id="s76">And he is the one who basically got this whole group together.</span> <span id="s77">And the only reason he’s not here this time is because he’s down with lung cancer.</span> <span id="s78">So – but otherwise, I would not know, and he’s – he’s had his hands on papers which are not open to the public.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: He’s been able to get into the files in Holland somehow, and got documents which shows that – in fact, the last time when we had the conference in Holland, I went to where my grandparents used to live.</span> <span id="s81">And, in fact, the first time, I was back about 10 years before that, so it would be about 13 years ago, the first time I went back to Holland.</span> <span id="s82">And I showed my wife where I used to live.</span> <span id="s83">I remember things – I remember what school I went to, how to find that.</span> <span id="s84">I went to the [indecipherable] park.</span> <span id="s85">Again, I showed her my house.</span> <span id="s86">I showed her where the grocery was where I used to go.</span> <span id="s87">They had a very neat operation there.</span> <span id="s88">You can get fresh potatoes peeled.</span> <span id="s89">They had a machine where you threw your potatoes in.</span> <span id="s90">It peels it, it washes, you buy a pound, you buy two pounds, and you bring it home.</span> <span id="s91">And it’s some – you know, nobody in the States has seen, basically.</span> <span id="s92">And when I went back there, I showed my wife where that machine was at.</span> <span id="s93">So, things what a small child remembers, that I remember.</span> <span id="s94">When we left Holland, they didn’t even tell me we were leaving.</span> <span id="s95">They – they were very secretive about going anyplace.</span> <span id="s96">We just all of a sudden the car was piled up with suitcases, we were going on vacation.</span> <span id="s97">They just didn’t tell me we weren’t coming back.</span> <span id="s98">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you have any family left in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: There was no family left.</span> <span id="s101">My mom’s total family was wiped out.</span> <span id="s102">My dad had a brother in the States, and actually he has a sister who lives in New York, my aunt, who was in the Nuremberg trials because she was a secretary to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: So, that is all that I really know.</span> <span id="s105">And like I said, I’m finding out about my roots, basically, especially the first ca – so I ris – I’ve have a lot of incosyncrasies(ph) in my life, and I found out I wasn’t the only one.</span> <span id="s106">You know, I – I put more f – more food away than most people, I – you know, we always have extra stuff.</span> <span id="s107">I don’t believe in wasting food.</span> <span id="s108">Of course, that’s one of the reason why I got a little fatter, because if the kids didn’t eat it all, I’d eat it.</span> <span id="s109">You don’t leave food on your plate.</span> <span id="s110">And I get upset with my son-in-law, who fills up a plate and then leaves half of it, you know.</span> <span id="s111">So, it just – so there are some items which I’ve grown up with, which I’ve done, which make sense now, but they didn’t then.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Let me ask you, do you – this is sort of an odd question, but what do you think your first memory is?</span> <span id="s113">What is the thing that you can remember first from your childhood, whether it be a picture of something in your br – in your mind, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I have a – I have a – a block conference.</span> <span id="s115">In other words, anything which is bad, which has happened to me, gets blocked out.</span> <span id="s116">I do know that when I was in the second grade, and there was a lady, a girl in the first grade, who works at the Jewish Museum in Holland.</span> <span id="s117">When I went there the first time 13 years ago, I was looking to see what type of information I can find on me.</span> <span id="s118">And I gave her my last name, and she turned around and she says, you’re Harry.</span> <span id="s119">And my mouth dropped open.</span> <span id="s120">Because at that time, when was in first grade, I still remembered.</span> <span id="s121">But I have forgotten totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: It’s – it’s blo – it’s in there, but it’s blocked.</span> <span id="s124">I have phobias which have come into light now, which I’ve never had.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I’ve got some thought about it, but I don’t know exactly why, but I do know I’ve got some phobias which I didn't have in the past and they’re coming out.</span> <span id="s127">So, but the [indecipherable] the shock of, for some odd reason, 40 years later, she remembered my name, my first name, my story and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: So of course that means she’s got an excellent memory, maybe that’s why she’s working at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Where are you liber – sorry, this is – where are you liberated from?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: It would have been from Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Bergen-Belsen, okay, so you were four years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: About four years old, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you ha – you don’t have any recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s138">I do remember the persons, the nurse where I stayed at, I know she was still alive after the war, and I know my parents took me there, once in a great while.</span> <span id="s139">And again, I remember things.</span> <span id="s140">Her husband, he was hard of hearing and I remember he had a big horn, and you had to speak into that big horn.</span> <span id="s141">But, in other words, it’s items what a small child will remember, close to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Those are the things I remember.</span> <span id="s144">I remember in Holland, when I went to visit the house, which was also very unusual, because there was a fellow who was a cantor, who lived there now, a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s145">So, when I knocked, some stranger, I’m showing my wife where I used to live 40 years ago.</span> <span id="s146">You know, they let me go in and I s – there used to be something down here, you know, like a frog in something.</span> <span id="s147">He says, yeah, we moved that – about – after we moved into the house 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s148">So those are the things you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: So it’s – I remember my parents used to send me to [indecipherable] a lot.</span> <span id="s151">I don’t remember how, but there was a place back there, someplace how you can escape out of the backyard, and I used to wander through the – the dunes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: At the beach.</span> <span id="s154">And again, I could be back in time for dinner, and they weren’t worried about me –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: – I was a regular visitor there.</span> <span id="s157">They had a room for me year round.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: My parents used to travel a lot.</span> <span id="s160">After the war my dad sold ladies’ hats and dresses, and he was – he sold hats all through Europe.</span> <span id="s161">So he had salespeople on the road, and then every so often he’d go to all his clients, you know, personally.</span> <span id="s162">But – so – and I know I went to [indecipherable] but I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was too structured.</span> <span id="s165">But again, you know, for – for a six and seven year old –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: – just be able to – they put me on a train, someone would pick me up.</span> <span id="s168">And it would s – again, one time my sense of direction was –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: – excellent.</span> <span id="s171">And I used to walk from the synagogue where I went to – on Shabbas, for the high holidays, I walk all the way to this [indecipherable] synagogue downtown in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s172">And you know, it’s a – probably a good three mile walk, and considering when you’re seven and eight years old.</span> <span id="s173">You know, people nowadays wouldn’t let your child to go that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: But again, they didn’t worry about me, I’d find my way back, so – so it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So when did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s177">When does your family pack up the car and head into ha – what was the journey like?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, I remember we went to – my parents had to do something, I was left in a child [indecipherable] in Germany.</span> <span id="s179">Wer – I know we – we left out of Germany.</span> <span id="s180">I was there, I was two weeks at camp over there.</span> <span id="s181">Again, a young person doesn’t have any problem communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Communication.</span> <span id="s184">And there was – oh, you know, you had minefields there and bombs and stuff, but again, you know, I got along with the other kids, and we’d go – used to go scavenging for metal, which you can take to the junkyard, and then you can take that money and buy candies with it.</span> <span id="s185">So, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Now it’s pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah, and then we were in a – a camp [indecipherable] camp, probably for at least six months.</span> <span id="s188">And it’s like apartment buildings and you know, you – I, of course, pick up the milk in the morning fu – you know, in a bucket, and so on, and I don’t remember much else.</span> <span id="s189">I know there was – the Black Forest was nearby, and it’s one place they said I shouldn’t go, because you can get lost in there.</span> <span id="s190">But you know, know, they have paths and –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: – we used to walk on the paths every so often.</span> <span id="s193">And I remember for Rosh Hashanah, they had a Shochet there and they would bake a live chicken, and it was – shochet it, you know, there on the spot and so on.</span> <span id="s194">So – but otherwise, no.</span> <span id="s195">A-And I remember the boat trip over.</span> <span id="s196">We came in December, and they had a nice, big storm.</span> <span id="s197">And I know all the adults were sick, and all us kids were happy because we got to go down and – and have all the desserts we want.</span> <span id="s198">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And where did you arrive into?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We arrived actually, December the ninth in New Orleans.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: And I have not been able to figure out what ship I came on.</span> <span id="s203">I know it was a American destroyer – well, American ship of some type, which was converted to a passenger.</span> <span id="s204">But I don’t remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So you arrived on your birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I arrived on my birthday.</span> <span id="s207">That made it easy for me to remember.</span> <span id="s208">And I remember they had a TV there, so you could watch Hopalong Cassidy and all these cowboy shows, which of course, I didn’t understand, but you know that was – it was a movie.</span> <span id="s209">So – and us kids sat there in front of the tube while the adults were busy with everything what was going on.</span> <span id="s210">Yeah, I was – I turned 10 when I arrived.</span> <span id="s211">And I know we left Harlem when I was – was about eight and a half.</span> <span id="s212">We traveled actually to Europe for almost a year for –</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And – and then you moved to – to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Then we moved from – my mom wanted someplace warm, like someplace like New Orleans, and my dad says no, we’ll go someplace a little further north, so we ended up in Saint Louis, since his brother lived in Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: We stayed there one summer, and then we moved to Detroit, it was too hot.</span> <span id="s217">The only thing you had in Saint Louis in those days were window air conditioners.</span> <span id="s218">It was very little – you didn’t have houses, you had window –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: – you know, so that was it.</span> <span id="s221">So, like I said, one summer is all that it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Move farther north.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Move further north.</span> <span id="s224">I remember Eisenhower, everybody was talking about Eisenhower, and I was talking, who’s he?</span> <span id="s225">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And what languages were you speaking at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: At that point I was still speaking Hollands.</span> <span id="s228">I did not know any English.</span> <span id="s229">You learned the words yes and no, and so on.</span> <span id="s230">And thank you.</span> <span id="s231">I went to a Jewish day school in Saint Louis for a few months, and my parents didn’t think I was learning enough English.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: So I went to a public school.</span> <span id="s234">And like I said, by that fall we – we were moving –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: – to – to Detroit.</span> <span id="s237">I know we stayed in the apartment for probably about a year, and then we moved into a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s239">And you were speaking more English by this point, were you picking it up?</span> <span id="s240">How was –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I was – well, I was picking – I was learning more English as I was going along, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And how was school for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Nowadays, they have persons who speak your language and they take you to through the year right along.</span> <span id="s244">In those days they did not.</span> <span id="s245">I know I started off in first grade with – with English and then I progressed – you know, I’d skip one or two semester – you know, you – during – during the year I’d move up one more grade.</span> <span id="s246">Math I was all right in.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s248">Cause it’s a universal language.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: But story problems I still have problems with.</span> <span id="s250">My wife – in fact, even in college, my wife – I’d write the paper, then my wife translates it, corrects the spelling, and everything.</span> <span id="s251">Because in English I’m very poor at spelling.</span> <span id="s252">And that’s – that’s it, but she did my term papers and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So where did you wind up going to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I went to, actually, Perdue University.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Perdue.</span> <span id="s256">What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Interior decorating.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: So, and that’s my field.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s261">And did you meet your wife in college, or did you know her before?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No, I – I knew her before, she was a blind date.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: And she’s – she’s originally from?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Fort Wayne.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Fort Wayne.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yeah, yeah, we got married in ’71 and I had been dating her for almost nine years.</span> <span id="s269">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: A-And how many kids do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: We have three kids, and I got seven grandkids.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Wow, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: So – and my two daughters live in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s274">My son-in-law, well, a month ago he finally closed – he had a restaurant, a kosher restaurant here.</span> <span id="s275">And he did not get support of the city.</span> <span id="s276">Ninety percent of his clients during the day were non-Jewish, and he – he finally had to close it.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s278">That’s too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Closed it up just before the holidays because basically with the holidays, you’re closed all month anyhow, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s281">Well, is there anything else you want to mention, anything else you want to add?</span> <span id="s282">Anything else you’re thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: It’s basically, like I said, with the conferences, I’m finding out stuff.</span> <span id="s284">I don’t know almost nothing about my parents.</span> <span id="s285">Again, they wouldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s286">I did find out from my aunt that my dad used to live on the border between Germany and Holland, and then he basically snuck across the border into Holland.</span> <span id="s287">And my dad says, if you pay taxes and stuff, they’ll let you stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: As long as you’re paying them good money, they u – they want you to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: And they – he met my mom in Holland and they got married.</span> <span id="s292">I do have the records of that because I want to – in Amsterdam, I want to – what e – whatever the house is, whatever – it’s a registrant, you know, for information and I – I got actually copies of my mom’s, and I got a copy of my birth certificate there.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s294">But it’s just something that you’ve blocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yeah, I wa – that part I didn’t block.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s297">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: But I never knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Again, th-there are incidents in my life which I have blocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: I just – and I still do that today.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And did you ever ask your parents about any of this, or was it just one of those things that you just didn’t do?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: My parents – no, European-wise, you just didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s305">And if you did ask, oh, it’s not important, it’s – you know, we really don’t want to – basically, we really don’t want to talk about it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s308">Actually, my brother found out more than I did.</span> <span id="s309">And well, by that time – he is 18 years younger than me, and my did didn’t have the strength to fight [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s310">So, he is th – he is the baby, and my mom is still alive, but she is not totally coherent any more, she’s – she is, but she isn’t.</span> <span id="s311">She can’t – she’s bedridden, and she has been for the last three years, totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: It’s too hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah, it just – yeah.</span> <span id="s316">And like I said, you do have her story on tape, which –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: I do.</span> <span id="s318">Well, is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Okay, well thank you, Mr. Merin.</span> <span id="s321">This is – this was
