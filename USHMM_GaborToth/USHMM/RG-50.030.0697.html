to cut material, and my mother used to sew it.</span> <span id="s149">So I always had nice clothes to go to school, or to go to friends, or as you could see from the picture, I was dressed like a middle class person, like a middle class child actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Was a middle class child in Poland, a middle class family, the same thing as in the United States?</span></p>

id="s175">Rozwadow.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: The town – we had – the town was not big, but it was a 90 percent Jewish town, with a lot of youth.</span> <span id="s177">We had our own Bürgermeister, which means the mayor was a Jew, a very rich Jew.</span> <span id="s178">And we had a city hall, we had a jail.</span> <span id="s179">No hospitals, we had doctors, we had pharmacists, and of course a lot of merchants.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: So, it was a large Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: A large Jewish community, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Within a small town, would that – or was it a city?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, the town was not big, but you cannot consider a very small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: We had three shuls.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: In the three, we had a – the very Orthodox shul; we had the Conservative, more or less, shul; and we had – and the rabbis, of course, had their own shuls.</span> <span id="s188">There were four rabbis in our town.</span> <span id="s189">There were two brothers, and they had their own shuls, with their own people who went to them, just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: To pray, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s193">Did everybody know each other, or not really?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well, mostly like families know – knew each other, because the families stuck together, like my mother’s family was quite a large family, and my father’s family was quite a large family.</span> <span id="s195">I mean, they were not so large, like there were six, and in my mother’s family there were six.</span> <span id="s196">And they all had children there – not married, they were still all young before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I mean, married age came during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: But before the war they were still all like 16 - 15 - 14 years old.</span> <span id="s201">So mostly – especially you – you knew very much your neighbors, because we were like close knit and living very close to each other.</span> <span id="s202">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Which parent were you closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Which grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Parent.</span> <span id="s206">Parent.</span> <span id="s207">Your mother or your father, who did you feel closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I think there were times when I was very close with my mother as a child.</span> <span id="s209">My father didn’t have time for anything, cause he was always, always working –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: – in order to provide for the family.</span> <span id="s212">And then – well, this was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: It changed differently later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s216">I-Is that it changed during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I-It – it changed – in 1938 my father was drafted to the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And everybody was very stunned because already he – that time he was in the 40s, and he was like the only Jew who was drafted to the Polish army, and nobody could understand why.</span> <span id="s220">So of course it was very hard for my mother with the three of us to make a living, or support us.</span> <span id="s221">We went to my grandfather, to my father’s father.</span> <span id="s222">He had a big house, he had room for us, and he told us to come there.</span> <span id="s223">So we lived together until the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: And we didn’t hear from my father if he’s alive or not, where he is.</span> <span id="s226">He was fighting.</span> <span id="s227">When the war started, he had to fight with the Polish army, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: That was – must have been very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: It was very frightening and when they start to bomb the city, we all escaped like to a village, not far from Rozwadow, and then we came back.</span> <span id="s230">And we never went home again.</span> <span id="s231">And my mother stayed with us, with my grandfather, my grandmother had died just before, a few years.</span> <span id="s232">We stayed, and also my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s233">And their children all stayed at the same house until the Germans march into Poland, to our city.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: I want to stop there.</span> <span id="s235">I still want to talk a little bit about pre-war.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Do you have an earliest memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Do you have an earliest memory?</span> <span id="s240">Do you have, you know, as a child growing up, one of your – the earliest things that – that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I could – I could remember that anti-Semitism started.</span> <span id="s242">I felt – not only I, the whole family, that short before the war, the antemitism(ph) got much more –</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: – intensive, you know, and it was scary to go out, especially at night, especially before a Christmas holiday, my father never let us out in the street, because the Polish people, they are very, very susceptible to drinking.</span> <span id="s245">And whoever they saw they could have beat up or something, and it was scary to go out.</span> <span id="s246">So this I remember very well when I got older a little bit, not when I was very young.</span> <span id="s247">When I was very young, I was like very free to roam around, not the city, but near the house.</span> <span id="s248">We had the little park, you know, we had swings.</span> <span id="s249">So it wasn’t like I had to go far away that’s my mother couldn’t call me in when she felt it’s time to get into the house.</span> <span id="s250">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: – I was – I was a happy child.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And had very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Can we stop for a minute?</span> <span id="s256">I’d – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: You were talking about some very close friends that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah, I had friends, we – we were very happy, you know.</span> <span id="s260">I remember I had a friend, she was rich, and they had the telephone in the house, and also a doll – a doll and a carriage.</span> <span id="s261">We all got together and play with her dolls and with the carriage.</span> <span id="s262">It was like, even for a person who didn’t make a living for the family, but you couldn’t afforded those things.</span> <span id="s263">So if somebody was able to afford it, well, they had the beer factory, that friend of mine.</span> <span id="s264">She didn’t survive the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: The name was Sandrovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: And her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s272">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Bronya(ph) Bronya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Bronya(ph) Bronya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Bronya(ph) Sandrovich(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you meet an –</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: It’s coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: It does, it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: So we used to play in their backyard with the carriage, with the doll.</span> <span id="s284">And then one time it came to my home, we went home.</span> <span id="s285">But we looked forward the next time again to meet.</span> <span id="s286">But I had three friends.</span> <span id="s287">One you met on my picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Sonya Olst(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: She – she’s now – she’s very, very, very sick.</span> <span id="s292">She has cancer all over, she’s a doctor herself, but she’s very, very sick, hardly surviving, I don’t know how much longer she will survive.</span> <span id="s293">I speak to her once in a while.</span> <span id="s294">And we were close, we went always together, skating, to school, to – to public school, to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s295">We were like three of us always, always together, never separating.</span> <span id="s296">And on Shabbas we used to go for – they had for the kids, they had like little lectures, you know, singing.</span> <span id="s297">And this was also gathering everything on religious basis, nothing out of the ordinary, which didn’t belong to us.</span> <span id="s298">But there were also kids who were like in different organizations.</span> <span id="s299">And we always belonged to the Mizrachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Mizrachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: And the Mizrachi is a working religious organization, and mine brothers were also – my father made sure that’s my brothers that every Shabbas go to the meetings, and so some learning for the Polon(ph) Mizrachi, which is working religious people.</span> <span id="s302">Course my father belonged to that organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So that meant for –</span></p> <p><span

Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And so that sense, that – that mission, was something that was very conscious for you, as you were growing up, that Israel is a pla – is the homeland.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: That Palestine is the homeland.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah, my father was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s309">He always attended his meetings, and he always intend that’s one day he’s gonna be in Israel.</span> <span id="s310">But he never made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Yeah.</span> <span

living with them for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s314">And one day they announced that we should get a – then the bomb stops, because they had already occupied them.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Okay, excuse me, I don’t want to get to the war yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: We’ll get to the war.</span> <span id="s318">I wanted to know the name of the other girl.</span> <span id="s319">You were three of you who were all –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Shifka(ph) rose – Shifka(ph) Wiesenfeld(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Shifka(ph) Wiesenfeld(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And do you know what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yes, they perished by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: The whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So it was the three of you –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Separated, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: – sep – yeah, who event – yeah, were separated, but as children, you were the closest friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, we were separated as children when the war – when the Germans came into the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And they occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: I have one more question before we come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And that is about your relations with local Polish people.</span> <span id="s336">I know you mentioned that anti-Semitism got very strong right before the war, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah, only good relation we had is with the – our teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Polish lady.</span> <span id="s340">She was very nice to – to all the kids, and that’s the only Polish person that I really knew at home.</span> <span id="s341">We didn’t associate with any Polacks at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Even in school, we had our own – our own Jewish kids which we play together during the recesses and mostly we kept to ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s345">So now let’s come to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How much talk was there in your home about Hitler, about what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s349">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s352">It was like – it was like a bomb, you know, like an – where they were bombing us first, like I said, we had – my mother took us, we escaped to a village, maybe there would be less bombing.</span> <span id="s353">But they were so low in the planes, that’s – I remember like vividly I seeing them now.</span> <span id="s354">They could have killed everybody, but somehow –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Were you on the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: We were on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Trying to escape the city.</span> <span id="s359">But then when the bombing stopped, we came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Not to our house, like I said, to my grandfather’s house, and we stayed there until the Germans moved in.</span> <span id="s362">Nobody talked about Hitler, nobody talked about the Germans.</span> <span id="s363">We only heard – nobody had the radio in those years – we heard that France was occupied, Belgium was occupied, all these countries, and Poland was like the next on the road.</span> <span id="s364">They came in, it was just before the Jewish holidays, and they settled themselves to the best houses, which they occupy half of my zayde’s house, my grandfather’s.</span> <span id="s365">Course, he had like a double house.</span> <span id="s366">And they were very – those were young, very young Austrian soldiers.</span> <span id="s367">They were quiet, pleasant.</span> <span id="s368">They said don’t worry, we’re not going to do nothing to you.</span> <span id="s369">That’s how I remember it.</span> <span id="s370">And it was settled, you know, everything is going to be okay.</span> <span id="s371">Few weeks later when they took my older brother to work, he was that time already 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Pinchus(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Outside the town, I don’t know what to do, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s374">Oh, maybe I had an idea, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s375">Then he came home at night a few days later, we heard the loudspeakers in the market, you know, it the city hall, that all the Jewish people should gather at this and this time in the marketplace, and there will be an announcement made.</span> <span id="s376">So the announcement was that every Jew has to leave Rozwadow immediately.</span> <span id="s377">You could go home, take whatever you can, and leave the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was – for my mother it wasn’t a shock, because she wanted to go and find my father.</span> <span id="s380">She didn’t know where he is, she never – we never heard from him.</span> <span id="s381">She had a feeling that he is someplace alive.</span> <span id="s382">So she gathered us, we put on like – I remember like – I put on like three dresses, or whatever and two coats, and hats.</span> <span id="s383">It was already September, October, something like this.</span> <span id="s384">And my brothers, whatever they had in a little bundle on the back.</span> <span id="s385">And my zayde went, my grandfather, my father’s father.</span> <span id="s386">My cante(ph) with her three kids and her husband.</span> <span id="s387">We went to the San.</span> <span id="s388">The San is the river which divided our city in half.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Ah, so Rozwadow was on the San river.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Rozwadow was on the San, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And that’s what – the city where my husband comes, also on the San, but they were on the Ukrainian side, we were on the Galician side, on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s393">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Were the cities far from each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: [indecipherable] far?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes, because they were like, near the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: And we were near – and we were in middle of Poland, that called Irlitsia(ph) in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: It still – it still is called Irlitsia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Irlitsia(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: – I think, I – I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s404">So everybody who was able to work, the kids, the old people, the young people, and some people didn’t leave.</span> <span id="s405">Some people were hiding in their homes.</span> <span id="s406">We left.</span> <span id="s407">We got on the San, hurry across the San.</span> <span id="s408">The bridge was already bombard to pieces.</span> <span id="s409">So, of course if you have a little money, my grandfather got a Polish guy who had a little, like a fishing boat or something.</span> <span id="s410">So the family got into that boat, and many people drowned, because they were walking in the water.</span> <span id="s411">They didn’t think it’s that deep, but it was deep.</span> <span id="s412">Many, many people drowned.</span> <span id="s413">And we got to the other side.</span> <span id="s414">On the other side we had a small village, but it was prosperous village, where my father’s brother lived, his wife and his father-in-law and his child.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Wait, what was the name of the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: [indecipherable] I’ll tell you in a minute.</span> <span id="s417">Justkowicz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Justkowicz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Justkowicz(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: So we stayed in their house –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: – because we were family, for a few days.</span> <span id="s424">And my mother saw Polish soldiers coming home from the war, every – and she knew a lot of the – a lot of the old customers of my father.</span> <span id="s425">So she used to ask them if they ever saw my u – my father.</span> <span id="s426">They said yes, he’s alive, but he’s in the German side, in Premisz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Premisz(ph) was also, one side was the Russian, and one side also was the zerc – I mean, the water in the middle – one side was the Russians occupied, one side was the Germans.</span> <span id="s429">My father fell in into the German side, as a Polish soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: When – can – before I go there, just to establish, when you were in the village with your father’s brother, was that occupied by the Russians at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Not my father’s brother – yeah, my father’s brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: [indecipherable] father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: – Benny.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s435">Was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s437">It was occupied – was an o – was occupied by nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: The Russians were starting to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: They were starting to come in, but they didn’t get that fast to that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: The Germans got much faster to the other side where we lived.</span> <span id="s444">So my mother said no, she’s gonna take her children, and she’s gonna go and walk to meet the Russians.</span> <span id="s445">And we were constant, constant, we saw Polish – Polish soldiers coming back from the army, which were already, you know, army that time was already –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: What did they look like, these soldiers, as they were coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Tired, exhausted.</span> <span id="s448">And they were glad that they still were alive and coming home.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Did they say anything of what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: N-No, didn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s451">We stayed in Pishnison(ph), which was the je – which were the border of the Germans, and the border of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: This was a cousin of my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: She let us stay there in one room, all of us, my aunt with the three kids, an uncle, my grandfather and my – and us, my mother and three kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s458">One very dark room, but at least, after walking for miles and miles and miles with the bundle and all dressed up, we finally got to Pishnison(ph), and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s459">The Russians were already occupied that town.</span> <span id="s460">We stayed there for awhile, maybe a week or something, til we got our strength back.</span> <span id="s461">My mother picked herself up, she left us with my aunt and uncle, and she took the [indecipherable] to Lwów, because she had a feeling that maybe she’ll find my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Was Lwów under the Germans at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: No, Lwów was under the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Under the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Even though she had been told he was in a prison in a town –</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yeah, but we don’t know what happened after.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: After the war, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: – how he got out or –</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: – where he was.</span> <span id="s474">So she went to Lwów, she was never in Lwów.</span> <span id="s475">I don’t know how she had the courage to go there, and she was walking around the whole city, asking people if they ever saw my father, if they know where he is, and if this – if he survived.</span> <span id="s476">Somehow, my father survived.</span> <span id="s477">He was kept in a camp, in a German camp for a while, and I don’t know how he escaped, and he crossed the border to Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So even though she didn’t know, and he didn’t know, they ended up in the same city.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: In the same city, and somehow all the refugees at tho – at that time they all stuck together, they – everybody was trying to find somebody they know.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Sounds like huge chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: In Lwów, yes, little – in 1939, yes, 1940.</span> <span id="s482">And she found him.</span> <span id="s483">And she came back, she said to my – to his father, my zayde and – and to his sister, she said, I’m taking my kids, I’m going to Lwów, I found my husband.</span> <span id="s484">So we were so happy, and took the train, we went to Lwów and they gave us the – like a committee, a Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s485">There still was a lot of – lot of Jews before the war there.</span> <span id="s486">They arranged something for us to sleep in a Polish cathedral, you know, we slept –</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Was it the first time you were in a Polish church – in a Catholic church?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah, yeah, in a Catholic church.</span> <span id="s489">I remember even the street was Matskavich(ph), the street was Matskavich(ph), I can – how I remember this, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Do you have a –</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: It was – it was not a church, it was like a cathedral you know, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So it’s a huge place.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Very huge.</span> <span id="s494">So the – and the Polacks there, and the priests gave us the downstairs.</span> <span id="s495">Not only us, where – there was a lot of refugees.</span> <span id="s496">We slept there on the floor for a good while.</span> <span id="s497">But at least we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Did you have any food?</span> <span id="s499">Did anybody give you any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: We probably got food from the people – from the Jewish people who lived before the war in Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: We got some food from them probably, I don’t – I – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I remem – and then my – we were still there.</span> <span id="s507">Of cour – of course, afraid from the Polacks.</span> <span id="s508">But we weren’t alone, we were a lot of us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: But were there also Polish refugees in that basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Just Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Just Jews, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: The Polish people didn’t have to leave the city or go by themselves or anything.</span> <span id="s515">My parents went to look for a place where they could live with Jews together and not in a cathedral.</span> <span id="s516">So they found not far from the marketplace, a big house, which perl – probably belonged to Jews, and they gave out floors for those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Now it was empty, we slept on the floors.</span> <span id="s519">So there was I don’t know how many families.</span> <span id="s520">We had a little space, all five slept together and had the little [indecipherable] or whatever they gave us to cook something.</span> <span id="s521">And we lived there and I started Russian schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: You started to go to school in r – had you s – ah, one question I had, did you see Russian soldiers in Lwów?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: In Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: When was the first time you saw Russian soldiers, and I’d like to know –</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: In Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: In Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Did you have it in – what impression did they make on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I wasn’t scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I was too young, I thou – I thought it’s funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: They look different, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I – I saw – I saw the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s538">They were much cleaner looking than the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s539">Different outfits, different everything.</span> <span id="s540">But they didn’t bother us, they let us roam around free.</span> <span id="s541">If you can buy something on the black market, if you had some money for food or something, you bought whatever you could.</span> <span id="s542">And that’s how we survived for 1940 – 1939 - 1940.</span> <span id="s543">And I started Russian school.</span> <span id="s544">I was that time going in the – in the fifth grade, maybe sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I was that time by 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: So you – as a – you were a young child when this is all happening to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: When the war broke out, I was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: That’s why I couldn’t understand all this politics.</span> <span id="s551">I remember now –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: – what will happen that – that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: But it’s import –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: But didn’t – I – those years I didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s556">I was only nine years old.</span> <span id="s557">What do I know about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: What do I think about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: So after my father decided in 1940, a lot of people decided that’s they going.</span> <span id="s562">There was a committee to register who wants to go back to Poland, to the – to home.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Af – I want to ask a question, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: When you started school and you – i-it was Russian school, so you’re starting to learn Russian, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Russian and Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Russian and Jew – so you were able to study in Yiddish, or in –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: In Yiddish and Russian, yeah, they were Jewish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And it was a public school?</span> <span id="s570">Or was a religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: It was a – supposedly – no, no, a public.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: A public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Public school.</span> <span id="s574">And just wanted the children to do something with themselves, otherwise they would get crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: They were –</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: And do you have any impressions of this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Do you have any memories of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: What would you remember from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: I remember to learn Russian that time.</span> <span id="s583">You know, beginning.</span> <span id="s584">They didn’t last long, maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s585">After my father went to register that’s he want to go back to Poland, not only him, they were standing in the line for days.</span> <span id="s586">And then he came home happy that’s – who knew the war is going to be for six years, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s587">That’s eventually they will let us go back to Poland, you know, to the home.</span> <span id="s588">So instead of keeping the promise that they’re gonna let us go home, the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s589">All the people who registered to go home, they got them together from all over, no matter where you were, and that was on a Friday night, I remember like now.</span> <span id="s590">My mother had cooked something for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s591">The Russians came in, because they knew where all the refugees were living, the Russians came in and they said, get yourself together immediately.</span> <span id="s592">We didn’t know what happened, we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s593">My parents woke us up, we got dressed.</span> <span id="s594">Then my mother took whatever she cooked, you know, for Shabbas, and they took us to the trains.</span> <span id="s595">Not knowing where we going, not knowing nothing.</span> <span id="s596">Hungry and naked and everybody get up like they know how to do it, very rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So the manner was different from what you had ac – been experiencing up til then?</span> <span id="s598">The way the soldiers behaved was different than what you had experienced in Lwów until that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Well, this was – this was like a – they – they had a – they were told they have to do that, but first, in one night they got together, the whole refugee or whoever – wherever they were, if they knew who they were.</span> <span id="s600">And when we came those trains, we met already my aunt, with her kids, and my uncle, and my grandfather and a lot of other families from other people my parents knew.</span> <span id="s601">And they put us in cattle trains, hundreds of people in one train.</span> <span id="s602">You only have standing place.</span> <span id="s603">We stood like – worse than cattles.</span> <span id="s604">And then the Ukrainian, the goyim, they were the happiest in the world.</span> <span id="s605">They were clapping and they were dancing, and they were whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes, we saw that before we even went to the trains.</span> <span id="s608">So they – they knew they’ll have plenty of what to – you know, take away whate – whatever the Jews left.</span> <span id="s609">But they didn’t take the people who did not register.</span> <span id="s610">They only took the people who registered they want go back.</span> <span id="s611">Which means you wanted to go back to – to Germany, to be in that – on the Hitler side, but Hitler wasn’t, you know, on the other side of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: But here’s a question.</span> <span id="s613">If – knowing that, knowing that – that it’s on the German side, why did your father want to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: They didn’t think it’s gonna take – the war was – God knows they – they thought after the pact, you know, when the – Hitler did the pact with Russia, it’s gonna be one, two, three and they’re gonna divide, and you can go home and be yourself like you were before.</span> <span id="s615">That’s what you thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: So they knew about the pact.</span> <span id="s617">They knew –</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Oh yeah, we knew about the pact, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: You knew the pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: There never gonna be a war with Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s621">They’re gonna divide whatever they took, and that’s how it’s gonna be finished.</span> <span id="s622">So who didn’t want to go home to their places where they were born, raised and – and worked and everything?</span> <span id="s623">So – and they took us to the cattle trains, and then they were filled up with different families, we didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s624">We didn’t know none of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Were any refugees not Jewish?</span> <span id="s626">Are you saying all of the refugees were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: All Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: All Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: All Jewish, only Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Only Jews, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: So – and we traveled, we traveled for a whole month.</span> <span id="s632">They stopped in certain places, which they let us go out in case you had to go out.</span> <span id="s633">Otherwise there was nothing inside that you could relieve yourself.</span> <span id="s634">That was crying and crying and getting sick and it was – I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s635">We were only kids.</span> <span id="s636">My oldest brother was 15, my middle brother was 13 and I was 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: You didn’t know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: You knew it wasn’t home, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, no, we knew right away, yeah, we knew it.</span> <span id="s641">Because it didn’t go the side like to Poland, it was now the way we going my – they used to stop like maybe after few weeks of traveling, or a week, so that people came to the – to the trains, and they gave us like [indecipherable] like hot water to bring something.</span> <span id="s642">There was no food, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: So you got no food in the trains, nobody fed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Well, how could someone survive no water and no food?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Nothing, nothing, just – we remember stopping, and this was already Russia.</span> <span id="s647">We – we didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s648">They came to the trains with buckets of hot water and it was like a Godsend, you know.</span> <span id="s649">Food?</span> <span id="s650">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s651">They didn’t feed us at all, from –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: What time of year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: What time of year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: This was end of ’40 – of – end of ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So it was December?</span> <span id="s657">Sort of like November, December?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No, we – when we came to the Urals, it was already winter, because they took us off the train with sleds, and they brought us to – in the Urals, which was camps and barracks, and – and the steppes, you know, steppes?</span> <span id="s659">I don’t know if you know what the steppes are in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Tell me, what does it – what does it look like, a steppe?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: It’s fields, empty, empty fields, around, around on the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s662">It’s like on the border with Europe and – and Europe and Asia, divided.</span> <span id="s663">This was the ur – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s665">So a steppe is an open field?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yeah, that’s what the steppes are, it’s very open, you know, a lot of empty like fields.</span> <span id="s667">Not growing anything, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So it’s like just – just empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Steppe – yeah, empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: No trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s672">No trees.</span> <span id="s673">Then when – when they brought us to the barracks, to the little place which was called [speaks foreign language] I don’t remember exactly, and there were barracks, which they had kept – many years ago they kept over there like prisoners of war or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s674">And they divided everybody to a barrack room.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Was your family kept together?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: We – our family, and another family, we were – we were given one room.</span> <span id="s679">One r – the room was maybe half as high as what this.</span> <span id="s680">So we slept on one side, and the other family of four slept on this side, in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Tell me, what kind of conversation – do you remember what people were saying to one another in the trains, as they were being taken into Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Were the people praying?</span> <span id="s684">Do you remember if they were praying?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Everybody was praying.</span> <span id="s686">It didn’t help, but they were praying.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Praying to God, not knowing where we were going to be, or what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did your – was there much – did the guards, or did anybody official in a uniform or anything like that –</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No, the guards were outside the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: They were just guarding that you don’t leave it?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s693">No, we were locked like, you know, with the bolt.</span> <span id="s694">And when they stopped – when the people, like some of the people brought us hot water –</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: – they opened up the bolt and they shoulder – they opened the doors so everybody could get some water to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s698">And did they say anything to you when you were brought to those barracks?</span> <span id="s699">So you didn’t know why you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: They – no.</span> <span id="s701">We – we assumed, because mostly people had registered to go back, and that’s why they were there, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Okay, but no speeches, no explanation?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s704">We came – the one of the cities, I think it was Molotov that time, which is like a main city in the Urals.</span> <span id="s705">I’m reading now a book about it also, from dur-during the war, and when I saw Molotov I rem – or Kora Stalowka(ph), this was a place where we were, the – the little enclave like a few barracks and on one side were the woods, with lions or with tigers and whatever.</span> <span id="s706">Or hyenas, you know it’s scary to death.</span> <span id="s707">But somehow, we lived through.</span> <span id="s708">So [indecipherable] barracks like this, you know, and – like barracks, you know what barracks a-are.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: So the barracks, were they inside the woods, or on the steppe?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: On the steppe where it was a clearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: But the mountains and the woods were all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: And this was like a clearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: But we had the commando there, Russian commando.</span> <span id="s717">After they settled everybody in the house over there where we lived, they started to choose people for work.</span> <span id="s718">Of course, the work was in the woods, to cut woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: You know.</span> <span id="s721">They took my mother, they took my older brother and my father was not well since he got out from the army, he went to a committee and they said he cannot work.</span> <span id="s722">And they let me and my younger brother – my middle brother, also didn’t take because we were too young.</span> <span id="s723">They took from like 16 and up.</span> <span id="s724">So they took my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s725">And that’s where they worked all winter, sawing trees and putting them into the water for transportation.</span> <span id="s726">And it was 60 below zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And what kind of clothes did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Codes?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Clothes, what kind of clothes did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Whatever we brought from home, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s731">Everything was cold and torn, no-nothing special.</span> <span id="s732">Freezing to death.</span> <span id="s733">We survived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s734">I don’t know how we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Do you remember the food?</span> <span id="s736">If – what kind of food you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: The food?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yeah, they gave us like maybe 200 gram of bread, like stone was the bread.</span> <span id="s740">Maybe the workers got a little bit more.</span> <span id="s741">And there was a kitchen, soup kitchen, so everybody had to go with a little thing to get some soup.</span> <span id="s742">This was our food.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Always.</span> <span id="s745">But my – in the summer my mother discovered chives.</span> <span id="s746">You know chives, the green, between the grass?</span> <span id="s747">She recognized which ones are looking like chives, so she collected that when she was able to.</span> <span id="s748">And she also collected – there is a green grass which is very itchy, I don’t know how it’s called.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: It – it – it looks like spinach, it grows like spinach, but the leaves are very sharp and itchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Would it be nettles?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: I don’t know how it’s called in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: If you go touch it here, you would –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Do you know what it’s called in Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Or in Polish?</span> <span id="s758">Or in Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: No.</span> <span id="s761">You don’t know what it’s called, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yeah, pokrzywy.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Pokrzywy.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: In Polish it’s called pokrzywy.</span> <span id="s765">In Jewish, I don’t have no idea.</span> <span id="s766">So she collected that, and from this she cooked soup.</span> <span id="s767">And this was our vitamin.</span> <span id="s768">And it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s769">Just water, washed it, whatever she could.</span> <span id="s770">The chives, the pokrzywy, little salt, water and this was the additional soup what we got from the soup kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: So it was bread that was hard, and this.</span> <span id="s772">And that’s what you got to –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: That’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s774">Then the summer came, my brothers were very good blueberry pickers.</span> <span id="s775">They went to the woods and they came home with buckets of blueberries.</span> <span id="s776">Not blueberries like here, cultivated, really blueberries, growing on the ground.</span> <span id="s777">And they used to sell it to people who couldn’t go collect this.</span> <span id="s778">So we got a few rubles, whatever that time it was, and then my mother collected a few things with myself, like we had a – a nice tablecloth, we had some socks what we brought from home.</span> <span id="s779">And we went to a village far away and brought home some potatoes, some eggs.</span> <span id="s780">Not much, but we – whatever we had, we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: And that’s how we lived through the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: So you were allowed to leave the barracks.</span> <span id="s784">It wasn’t like you were imprisoned within –</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Hel – the barracks were surrounded, you cannot get out, like out to go.</span> <span id="s786">You had to have [indecipherable] document if you want to go to the next village.</span> <span id="s787">It was the same thing.</span> <span id="s788">But there were Gentiles living, Russians there, many, many years.</span> <span id="s789">And they had their little farm, you know, and they had like what to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s791">But they were – the – the commandants of this commando and so on, it wasn’t that you were in a prison where they wouldn’t let you out at all.</span> <span id="s792">You ne –</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Oh we – we could – we could walk around in the barracks whatever – I mean, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: They had to go to work and some – they weren’t like going [indecipherable] you know, with the rifle, but they were going to work every single day, Shabbas and Sunday, was no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Did you go – did you were insi – were – because you and your younger brother and your father didn’t go, what did you do with yourselves during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I – to tell you the truth, there was no schools, we – the children used to play, you know, get together and play whatever, running around in the summer, not in the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: And not much, you know, it was a very boring life, scary, hungry, no food, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What were you scared of the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I’m gonna die there, because many people died from hunger.</span> <span id="s802">And there were people who were – mostly intelligentsia, which they weren’t used to that type of life, they didn’t know how to help themselves, and a lot of them, a lot of them, a lot of them died, just like in the concentration camps, from hunger.</span> <span id="s803">You live on – on 200 gram of bread, which was hard like the earth, I don’t know, they probably baked it with – with earth or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s804">Supposedly this was bread [indecipherable] my mother went to another village to be able to collect something like a potato, like whatever, you know, an egg, a potato, a carrot.</span> <span id="s805">So she divided it for everybody.</span> <span id="s806">And my father was getting more sick and sick and sick and no hospitals.</span> <span id="s807">The only thing – and the doctor always gave him the paper that he cannot work.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So the doctor didn’t treat him, but he gave him a paper he can’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: That he can’t work, he couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s810">He couldn’t work –</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Was he changed, was he –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: – he couldn’t work, he was a – he was on – knocked out from the prison in Germany [indecipherable] he was very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Tell me, earlier, when I asked you which parent you were closer to, and you said, as growing up, it was my mother, but that changed.</span> <span id="s814">How did that change and when did that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: It changed because my father was sick.</span> <span id="s816">Got very close to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Did you talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: And – and my mother was always upset, because she had to work, and she couldn’t supply enough for everybody.</span> <span id="s819">So it was like – and my father couldn’t help her, so we were like divided, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Were they – were they angry with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No, no, my father was very good man.</span> <span id="s822">Sometimes he was strict, you know, and we listened to him.</span> <span id="s823">But my mother was the supplier of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: He was quite a burden on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s826">To feed us, to find a grass she could cook.</span> <span id="s827">She worked hard to get a little bit more bread, something.</span> <span id="s828">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s829">This was going on until Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s830">Yom Kippur my mother and my brother didn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s831">They went to – there was a Jewish cemetery where my father was – where my grandfather was buried.</span> <span id="s832">I don’t know, probably – oh no, this was already later, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s834">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No.</span> <span id="s836">No, no, no, it was still in the camps.</span> <span id="s837">They didn’t go to work, to the woods, you know, to – it was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s838">So 16 Jewish men and women, I remember exactly the amount …</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: – were taken to the city of Molotov to be prosecuted, because they didn’t work on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s841">And we went – we didn’t know if we were going to see them again or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: So, included your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s844">Not my brother, my mother and 16 other people, men – men and women.</span> <span id="s845">But it took a few days, we didn’t know what’s gonna be, because they only let those people go under, you know, with soldiers, on the watch of the Soviet commando, whatever they were.</span> <span id="s846">And they were freed.</span> <span id="s847">It was like the biggest thing what ever happened, that time.</span> <span id="s848">They let them all go.</span> <span id="s849">They – and the judge, I don’t know if it was Jewish, it was a Russian Jew or some, I don’t know, he listened to their story and they said they had never worked on Yom Kippur, and even if they died, they would never work on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s850">And they let them free, everybody came home.</span> <span id="s851">I mean, home to them.</span> <span id="s852">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s854">But it must have been everyone was terrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Oh yeah, [indecipherable] when

id="s1084">And of course after the war it was – I was finishing up my seventh grade, which was a big deal at that time.</span> <span id="s1085">And in March of ’46, we were already in Poland, the whole family, also [indecipherable] hot, it was more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: What had happened to your grandfather?</span> <span id="s1087">You said that –</span></p> <p><span

1946.</span> <span id="s1135">But certificates never came.</span> <span id="s1136">We came to [indecipherable] which is now part of – not part of Czechoslovakia, and we stayed there over Shabbas because he didn’t travel Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1137">The people there brought us food.</span> <span id="s1138">They divided us in different hotels.</span> <span id="s1139">We stayed over Shabbas, Shabbas night we went to Prague.</span> <span id="s1140">In Prague there was a camp for the children, you know, not far from Prague, which was called Jablitz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Jablitz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: [indecipherable] Jablitz(ph).</span> <span id="s1143">And he left us there, and Rabbi Ralph Herzog and his son went back to Israel, to Palestine that time, to request why he didn’t get the promised cer –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: – you know, affidavits or certificate.</span> <span id="s1146">And we never were able to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1147">They left us in Jablitz(ph) and the Aliyah [indecipherable] took over, another Jewish organization, and then divided us into two groups, which were the Mizrachi and Aguda.</span> <span id="s1148">They took us, after six weeks being in Czechoslovakia, they took us to Strasbourg in France, and Aguda they took to Cassada(ph), which is on the Spanish border in France.</span> <span id="s1149">And in France already, we had Madrafeme(ph), which were organizing the kids; the younger kids, the older kids, the middle kids.</span> <span id="s1150">And we stayed in France from 1946 to 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: You were with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: We were in France.</span> <span id="s1153">Strasbourg, and I was in Paris, and I was in Roazhon, different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: But no school at this time, or were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: – were you going to school of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes, in – in Strasbourg, yes, we went to learn French and also we learn – they te – they taught us to sew.</span> <span id="s1158">You know, it’s [indecipherable] this school.</span> <span id="s1159">Mostly – not the regular school, but the French school, just to learn French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Which we learned, of course, and then you forget it, if you don’t use it.</span> <span id="s1162">So after I found out my father passed away in 1948, in Salzburg, they also emigrated from Poland to – to Austria, to the camps in Austria.</span> <span id="s1163">I – my father was working with the po – with the Polish council for me to come back to be with them together.</span> <span id="s1164">Because we couldn’t go to Israel, there was no Israel that time, and the kids who went to [indecipherable] were turned back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: – and they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1167">So my father worked I should legally be able to leave France and come to Austria and be with them.</span> <span id="s1168">But by the time the papers were ready, he had passed away in March of 1948.</span> <span id="s1169">By the time [indecipherable] was, and my brother had joined th-the illegal geose(ph), this is the Israeli army, which was illegal one.</span> <span id="s1170">My oldest brother, he joined with his oldest cousin.</span> <span id="s1171">After he joined, of course, he went to fight.</span> <span id="s1172">They went to Italy, first in France, Italy.</span> <span id="s1173">From Italy they went by boat, by little boat, and they got into Palestine.</span> <span id="s1174">And he was fighting in 1948 for Israel.</span> <span id="s1175">I have a picture with his rifle [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1176">They took them off the boat, they gave them rifles [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1177">No exercise, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">He didn’t know how to use a rifle, but that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1179">And then I met my husband in 1948, he was from the ma – through a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Strasbourg?</span> <span id="s1181">In Strasbourg?</span></p> <p><span

you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I was gone back finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: – you had gone back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: In June I was gone back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: So your father died in March and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yes, and in June I was gone back and I had all the papers ready and everything.</span> <span id="s1191">I already – my oldest brother, like I said, had really gone to geose(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And your youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: And only my mother and my little brother were still in Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: I stayed with them until I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: And you met your – you met your future –</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Husband through a friend of mine, Joseph Jonas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: We were going out for years and then we got married.</span> <span id="s1200">In 1950, we got – we were on the American zone.</span> <span id="s1201">They did – when they were closing the camps, because our camp was in the city –</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: What was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: – Bradenburg(ph) was in Salzburg but in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: What was its name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: It was a camp fo-for soldiers, you know?</span> <span id="s1206">So they were liquidated and they had to put the people someplace.</span> <span id="s1207">So some people went to Israel, some people went to America, some people went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1208">And my husband’s family, they wanted to go to America because they had family here.</span> <span id="s1209">My father-in-law had family here, so he registered for America.</span> <span id="s1210">He didn’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s1211">Because we were on the American zone, they had to let you go where you wanted, because supposedly you are an American already.</span> <span id="s1212">So when we came here, we got the green card right away, and the minute we got off the bus – the ship – the ship was coming here was like half dead.</span> <span id="s1213">We came here on military ships.</span> <span id="s1214">I remember the name of the ship was General Blatchford.</span> <span id="s1215">And we almost drowned, it was in December.</span> <span id="s1216">We came in 1950, in December – 1950, just a day before Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So tell me, why did you almost drown, and why was it half dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Because it was that – it was – don’t forget, it wasn’t Atlantic, it was the Pacific, and it’s very rough.</span> <span id="s1219">The ship was rolling.</span> <span id="s1220">It was a military ship, you know.</span> <span id="s1221">It wasn’t a big boat.</span> <span id="s1222">It was a boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: You were going on the Pacific Ocean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: On a military ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: No, I know, but you were on the Pacific Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: We were on the Atlantic Ocean coming to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: You were on the Atlantic Ocean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: But in that time was December.</span> <span id="s1231">It was like, you know, the storms, the winds, the – it was very scary.</span> <span id="s1232">So we came here and of course they s – HIAS took over, they settled us in – in a hotel, some of them in HIAS, wherever they had place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: I want to ask a few things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: One of the reas – why was it that you never went back to Rozwadow?</span> <span id="s1236">What was the reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Why I went back what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Why, when you came from Russia to Poland, why is it that you never went back to Rozwadow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: To the city where we came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Where you – yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: There was nobody left.</span> <span id="s1242">There were no Jews, only Polacks, and my father never wanted to see the place he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1245">All the Jews were brought in to that area, which was occupied by Germany before the war, but after the war they gave it back to Poland, which was Brandenburg [indecipherable] a few cities.</span> <span id="s1246">And that’s where they brought all – if somebody wanted to go back, nobody did go back.</span> <span id="s1247">And then when the riots started, in Brandenburg and in other cities, there were a lot of riots, a lot of Jews killed, then everybody decided to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s1248">Nobody went back to their own city any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: When did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: We even had killings early in 1946, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: What kind of killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: The – the riots from the Polish anti-Semitin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: And when did you find out of what had happened to the Jews in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: When did you find out of what had happened to the Jews who remained in Poland?</span> <span id="s1258">Did you know about that when you already returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1260">My father had a friend who joined the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: And he wrote to us where – while we were still in Russia, before we left, he wrote to us what happened to the city, to the Jews, to everything.</span> <span id="s1263">And he wrote us – that’s my father’s brother’s son, who was alive, he was that time [indecipherable] when the war s – excuse me – when the war started.</span> <span id="s1264">And he heard from the goyim he knew, that my uncle’s, my Benny’s son Joseph is alive and he’s now five years old or six, and he’s in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1265">The gathered all the kids they knew who are Jewish and they could find them, they brought them to Lublin –</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: – in Poland.</span> <span id="s1268">And that’s – and that’s how we knew this, what happened.</span> <span id="s1269">And when you came home, you found out more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: But we knew in the last – in the beginning not so much – in the last few years we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1272">We knew that my uncle was killed, my aunt was killed, her father was killed.</span> <span id="s1273">All the family from my father’s, the sisters, the children, the husbands.</span> <span id="s1274">All my family from my mother’s side, whoever was left in Poland.</span> <span id="s1275">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1276">Only the only cousin survived.</span> <span id="s1277">He was a baby and the parents gave him to Polacks, of course for a lot of money, and they – after the war they just said go, go, and some of the Jews picked him up and they brought him to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1278">And then he came here to this country with his sisters, his mother’s sister, his mother’s father.</span> <span id="s1279">I mean, they came, he was – I don’t know how – how old he was, maybe five, six years old.</span> <span id="s1280">He grew up in this country already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: And he was very, very [indecipherable] the only cousin I have from the family who survived from Germany.</span> <span id="s1283">Nobody survived from my father’s side, or my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1284">They were all killed [indecipherable] killed in

id="s1288">She saw how my uncles were shot, everybody in one grave, the sons and everything, the children, everybody put to one grave.</span> <span id="s1289">As a matter of fact, they have a Polack who takes care of the cemetery in Justkowicz(ph) and [indecipherable], another little village.</span> <span id="s1290">They send the money every year, the people from here who survived, and they take care of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: That place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: – graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Those graves</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: After so many

the ocean.</span> <span id="s1408">They – all the women used to go out and talk to each other from home, from the kids, from the grandkids.</span> <span id="s1409">And here she didn’t have no one to talk.</span> <span id="s1410">So after one year, she left – I mean, she went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: I have a – another couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: I have a couple of questions still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1415">No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: When it all started, when all of this started, so unexpectedly for you, you were nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Close to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Close to 10.</span> <span id="s1419">And when the war ended, you were already 15 - 16 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: 16, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: How did you change, what happened?</span> <span id="s1422">Were you the same person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: I grew up too fast.</span> <span id="s1424">I didn’t have teenage years, so I didn’t know what it means to be young, because between ’39 and ’45, it was like a period you didn’t know where it went.</span> <span id="s1425">Was very hard times, especially the winter times.</span> <span id="s1426">When you were healthy, then it was like you appreciated that because you were healthy.</span> <span id="s1427">In the teenage years, when you were the teenage years, you always had to do something to help the family, you know.</span> <span id="s1428">So I learned in France how to sew, when I got married.</span> <span id="s1429">We didn’t have anything, I just went to work right away.</span> <span id="s1430">I was sewing clothes.</span> <span id="s1431">We had the little factory in the camp.</span> <span id="s1432">And then, because I knew a little Hebrew, and I was a little bit educated, I was working in the kindergarten with kids, and for a while, until we emigrated to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: I have another question.</span> <span id="s1434">Your experience, what you went through is different from that of most Holocaust survivors because you were in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Do you think – it’s a bit of a provocative question –</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: – do you think people understand that experience enough –</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: You mean the experience we went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Not so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Why would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Not – not so much because they consider us being the lucky ones, the Holocaust survivors, which were – which officially, no matter how much we went through, we were the lucky ones, we weren’t shot to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: That’s true, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: You know, if we didn’t accomplish anything over there, but many people, many, many people that died from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: And this was like – just like in the concentrations, not being shot, but dying from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: I know my mother’s brother and his wife, they died in [indecipherable] on the street from hunger.</span> <span id="s1450">And they were rich people at home, rich.</span> <span id="s1451">I wouldn’t say like here somebody rich, but in our standards, in my home, this was a rich family.</span> <span id="s1452">And they died from hunger.</span> <span id="s1453">There was nothing they could buy, even they had some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: So, I saw a lot of dead people in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Not being shot, but being able to work and not having what to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: So they just gave up and died.</span> <span id="s1460">But we were the lucky ones –</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: – because we didn’t – my – my mother didn’t go to work with the big s – you know, with the [indecipherable] on her back.</span> <span id="s1463">The commanders there made them work very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: And that was – and it was 60 below zero, you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: The snow was that high, and you walked just – you made like a – how do you call a shareskai(ph) like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: A li – small path?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Like a little bit walk through, and both sides the snow was higher than you.</span> <span id="s1470">And that’s how we lived.</span> <span id="s1471">No transportation, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1472">You walked to school like this.</span> <span id="s1473">There were no days off because there was a snow, there was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s1474">You had to be in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: This was already where you were freed from the steppes – from the steppes, from Ural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: And is there a reason –</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: And the worst thing was, when you became older, after 13, you had to join the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s1479">You know what the Komsomol is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Komsomol is the youth communist party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: And whenever – me and my cousin were in the same class, and they were after us to join, and my father said no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1484">And I couldn’t say my father said no, because they would put him to jail.</span> <span id="s1485">So, we were trying to avoid it, not to be forced into it.</span> <span id="s1486">So they – in the summer they send us to a camp where we could help, you know, with the harvest or whatever, to work there, or do something.</span> <span id="s1487">That’s how the few years went back, and by the time they made me already join, we were free to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: So it was just on the edge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Just on the edge, for a whole year and a half, and I wasn’t able to open my mouth, that’s my hu – father is not allowing me to join the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s1490">They didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: It must have been a lot of stress, a lot of stress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: No wonder you get sick, you know.</span> <span id="s1493">Yeah, but somehow you don’t realize, when you are so young, you know, you don’t realize that s – that stress, you don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s1494">Later on you find out that’s stress, it’s – it’s punishment, it’s this and that, but when you young, you don’t think about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: You think that’s how it’s supposed to be, and that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Wh-Why – huh?</span> <span id="s1498">You said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: And that’s how we lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: You said earlier that you never really talked about your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: With children, never.</span> <span id="s1504">We didn’t – I didn’t want them to burden with what I went through.</span> <span id="s1505">I figure less they know, better it’s for them.</span> <span id="s1506">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Did they want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Did they get – did you ha – did they ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Not much, because they saw we don’t want to talk, so they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1511">We always used to, when we used to come for Shabbas [indecipherable] their house, she always used to go on zayde’s lap, she said, zayde, tell me [indecipherable] story.</span> <span id="s1512">He meant this is a story.</span> <span id="s1513">So he used to tell them how we were up in the woods, how – and he was looking for his mother, she got lost in the woods, she didn’t have a good organization how to get out of the woods.</span> <span id="s1514">He went at night with all the wolves and everything, and – and he found her and he put her on a sled and he brought her home.</span> <span id="s1515">She hardly was alive, you know.</span> <span id="s1516">She was so frightened and afraid.</span> <span id="s1517">And you know, stories like this, but not like what happened after, or before, you know?</span> <span id="s1518">And they were like – especially [indecipherable] was like every time until they grew up, zayde, tell me a massen(ph), tell me a massen(ph).</span> <span id="s1519">He was fascinated with those stories.</span> <span id="s1520">And that’s why he went after me two years ago, Bubbe, why don’t you want to – it’s good for us, we’ll know what happened, you know?</span> <span id="s1521">My other grandson called me up, Bubbe, it’s going to be for – not only for the first generation, it’s going to be for the second generation, for our kids.</span> <span id="s1522">At least they’ll know where you’re coming from.</span> <span id="s1523">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1524">I never talked so much in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: I’m grateful that you did.</span> <span id="s1526">I’m very grateful that you did.</span> <span id="s1527">I know it’s costing, I know there’s a price to pay for it, but we’re very, very grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: I never, never – I never had – let’s put it this way, I never had the time, I worked very hard, I used to come late, and I had to cook for the kids, and I had to go to the meetings, I have to go to parents’ meetings, and I have to – and then my husband was sick.</span> <span id="s1529">I mean, they – and I dealt with a lot of people during the day in the bank, a lot.</span> <span id="s1530">And I heard so much horrific stories how children are treating them, you know.</span> <span id="s1531">And they were all rich people having business and jewelry and the children want them already to take a day of it, and I – and I had to listen to it, you know, cause I was a banker.</span> <span id="s1532">So like I came home, I was like stim(ph), you know what stim(ph) is?</span> <span id="s1533">Quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: I did my work what I had to do home, I cooked, I [indecipherable] made sure they have what to eat and make sandwiches for the next day to go to school, and I went to work.</span> <span id="s1536">My children worked very hard because they went to school from seven to seven.</span> <span id="s1537">They came home very late.</span> <span id="s1538">They never had time to flounce around outside and play with the [indecipherable] with the other boys.</span> <span id="s1539">They were – on the Shabbas they went to shul, and Sunday they had school too, a half a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: That’s a lot of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: So they were like more restricted than other kids, you know.</span> <span id="s1542">But thank God, I can’t complain.</span> <span id="s1543">I made sure I would never need for my kids anything.</span> <span id="s1544">I saved whatever I could, we bought the house.</span> <span id="s1545">Which I don’t need it now because it’s a – now I have three tenants in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: – have to take care of it.</span> <span id="s1549">That’s my home.</span> <span id="s1550">I work for it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: And it’s spacey, and it’s all – everything is there.</span> <span id="s1553">And I don’t need anything from my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: I think this is a real –</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: I was able – I saved and I saved and I saved and sometimes now, why did I do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: You ask yourself that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: It took away too much strength to do it.</span> <span id="s1558">So, you know, parents from Europe, they always – even when my parents were not rich, middle class working people, they wanted their children to have the best they could give them.</span> <span id="s1559">And of course, us, even we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1560">Of course, and the war took away so much.</span> <span id="s1561">We wanted our children to be something.</span> <span id="s1562">So you worked.</span> <span id="s1563">If you didn’t work, you didn’t have money to pay the schools, because they always went to private schools, yeshivas.</span> <span id="s1564">So we worked and we saved and you worked and you paid, and whatever you could, you put away for a birthday, or whatever – whatever’s gonna come.</span> <span id="s1565">But thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Well, is there something that you would want people outside your family, outside your grandchildren, other American children, or young Polish people, or young Russian people, what would you want them to understand about what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Well, mostly people who I knew and know, they went through the same thing what I did.</span> <span id="s1568">Most of my friends, younger, older, they passed away.</span> <span id="s1569">I have two more friends, which one is still very, very sharp.</span> <span id="s1570">She went through a concentration camp and everything.</span> <span id="s1571">But she doesn’t want to do an interview because she says she’s gonna sit and cry a whole day.</span> <span id="s1572">I spoke to her another day, and another friend is getting a little bit of Al-Alzheimer’s, so – and that’s what’s left, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Not many people my age are here any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Well, as I said before, I know there’s a cost, and my colleagues at the museum know that there is a cost, and that it – it’s not an easy thing to talk about.</span> <span id="s1576">And that’s why we’re doubly appreciative that you have agreed to do it, agreed to tell us your story, and have it available for many people who you’ll never know, but who will have a better understanding of what a young, nine year old girl had to face when the war started, you know, and what she lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: I – I remember now, I see the airplanes flying so low.</span> <span id="s1578">That’s – we just, you know, lay down on the ground with the heads down.</span> <span id="s1579">How we weren’t shot, I don’t – I don’t – I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1580">This is like a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: They were – you – you could see them – you could see the pilot, you could see the – the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1583">It was like unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: And I think God wanted you to live, so you live.</span> <span id="s1586">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Did your faith help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Did you think your faith helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s1591">It – it – I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Well, Mrs.—</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: See, my whole family is religious.</span> <span id="s1594">My brothers are religious, my cousins which I still have in Israel, most of them – not all of them, but most of them are religious.</span> <span id="s1595">My husband’s family, they all religious, very strict religious.</span> <span id="s1596">So we have faith.</span> <span id="s1597">I don’t say I am a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1598">I’m not a [indecipherable], but I have my beliefs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Can you explain to me those words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Because I had many accident here, which I fell off an escalator, I don’t know how I stayed alive.</span> <span id="s1601">I fell in the street, and all right I have a good mem – I – I have a good – my hand doesn’t – you know, my shoulder still – I have broken ribs, I have this and that, but I’m still here.</span> <span id="s1602">So I pray every night, and I talk to my parents every Shabbas when I light the candles.</span> <span id="s1603">And this give me hope.</span> <span id="s1604">I don’t know how long, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Well, thank you for talking to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: My grandchildren tell me, you’re gonna be here for our weddings.</span> <span id="s1607">I don’t believe it, but maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: You never know.</span> <span id="s1609">Is there anything you would like to add to what we’ve spoken about already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: I would like to add that I was lucky with jobs.</span> <span id="s1611">Wherever I worked, especially in the bank for so many years, and 10 years in the bakery, I was well liked because I worked, I produced.</span> <span id="s1612">And I wanted to better myself, so I went for courses, I took all kinds of courses, you know; in the bank, they send you.</span> <span id="s1613">And – and I retired, they gave me a beautiful bonus.</span> <span id="s1614">I have a pension from the bank and they made a very big party.</span> <span id="s1615">And this was not for cause I didn’t work, I worked.</span> <span id="s1616">And – and I liked my work because I was with people all day, talking to them and trying to help them and whatever I could in my capacity.</span> <span id="s1617">And mostly I’m glad that the children, my grandchildren grew up to be good children.</span> <span id="s1618">For this I thank God, cause they didn’t go that way, but they went the straight way.</span> <span id="s1619">No – no marijuana, no – no smoking, no all these, you know, they all educated, they all got jobs and working hard.</span> <span id="s1620">For this I’m very thankful.</span> <span id="s1621">This I really wanted to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: And if I live to their weddings, it’ll be okay, if not, it’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: I hope you do.</span> <span id="s1625">I hope you do, and once more, thank you very, very much.</span> <span id="s1626">I appreciate that you’ve speak – spoken with us and shared the story and shared the tough bits as well.</span> <span id="s1627">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Golda Buch Jonas, on May 5th, 2013.</span> <span id="s1628">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: If I ever talk again like this, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: I appreciate that you
