Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born on August the 7th, 1912 in Czernowitz, the capital of Bukovina.</span> <span id="s19">It was, until 1918, part of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.</span> <span id="s20">In 1918, it was uh given to to ...by the powers to Romania; and in 1940 it was occu...on uh June the 28th, 1940, it was occupied by the Soviets as compensation for twenty years of Romanian occupation of Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s21">It hadn't been for over two hundred years part of any Russian empire.</span> <span id="s22">It...I would say it was occupied as a result of the Stalin-Hitler pact, and uh the same criteria should apply to it as they applied today to the Baltic States.</span> <span id="s23">Uh in these forty years, the Russians have been able to change demographically the population of Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s24">Interesting is the fact that they have attracted a large group of Russian Jews to Czernowitz...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s26">We'll come to some of these stories.</span> <span id="s27">I would like to ask you to describe your childhood before World War II, when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Uh, I uh...as I told you I was born in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s29">The name of the street in Romania was Marshal Fosh number 9.</span> <span id="s30">Uh it...my father was uh the chief clerk in a large lawyer's office, Dr. Hodrover.</span> <span id="s31">He had the title of solicitator, which is not the same as a solicitor in the United States.</span> <span id="s32">It uh...he was uh...he did not speak Romanian.</span> <span id="s33">He spoke only German, and so naturally when the Romanian entered in 1918 he lost uh his qualifications, not knowing the Romanian language.</span> <span id="s34">As a solicitator, he had to write even not being a lawyer to plead in lower courts, minor cases, uh breach of contract for one.</span> <span id="s35">And his anti-Romanian attitude probably reflected itself also in our attitude in the beginning.</span> <span id="s36">Later going to high school, the lyc√©e, in uh...in Czernowitz he spoke ___(ph).</span> <span id="s37">I had one sister uh uh who uh studied later with me at the University in Prague.</span> <span id="s38">She studied pharmacy.</span> <span id="s39">I studied medicine.</span> <span id="s40">I uh took the baccalaureate--or the uh matura--in 1930 and uh uh my sister and I went to Prague, Czechoslovakia, to matriculate at the German University in Prague.</span> <span id="s41">In that time, Pra...Czechoslovakia, Prague had two uh universities.</span> <span id="s42">Two medical...a German and and a uh Czech.</span> <span id="s43">We...we matriculated at the German university.</span> <span id="s44">She went to the uh pharmacy department.</span> <span id="s45">I went to the medical school.</span> <span id="s46">It was the Karls (ph) University in Prague.</span> <span id="s47">It doesn't exist today anymore.</span> <span id="s48">Today there is only one, Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And your mother.</span> <span id="s50">Could you tell me a little about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: My mother came from the southern part of Bukovina.</span> <span id="s52">Cimpulung, she uh they were married.</span> <span id="s53">My mother had uh studied the piano in Vienna.</span> <span id="s54">She uh she uh finished the conservatory I think at the age of eighteen.</span> <span id="s55">She was a fine pianist, excellent uh uh accompanist.</span> <span id="s56">As a matter of fact, she accompanied uh uh a well-known singer by the name of Selma Kurtz in Vienna uh as an accompanist.</span> <span id="s57">She had a fine technique but uh marrying my father, this uh really brought an end to her music career.</span> <span id="s58">She played for us and uh instilled in us the the love for music, especially since her specialty was uh uh lied[er].</span> <span id="s59">You know, I was familiar with lied[er] as a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Could you describe the life for Jews at that time in your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Czernowitz had a very active uh uh Jewish community, culturally.</span> <span id="s62">Uh the Jewish community had produced quite a few remarkable people in Jewish uh uh cultural, in Jewish cultural history.</span> <span id="s63">Itzic Manger (ph) is one of the uh these figures and the well-known and famous, uh fablist (ph) is this could be the term which I could use...he was uh...I just missed the name...uh, well I'll come back.</span> <span id="s64">Eliezer Steinbe...Steinberg (ph).</span> <span id="s65">Eliezer Steinberg wrote beautiful fables fables in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s66">It uh...Czernowitz had a permanent Yiddish theater, uh Goldfaden_ Theater.</span> <span id="s67">It had a permanent uh German and Romanian theater, national theater they called it, which was a replica of the uh of the opera from Vienna.</span> <span id="s68">Beautiful building.</span> <span id="s69">Excellent acoustics and uh uh there were uh so-called part-time German, uh Ukrainian and and uh Polish uh cultural organizations.</span> <span id="s70">Uh in...as soon as Hitler came to power in Germany, things changed.</span> <span id="s71">The Germans...we had a large German population in...out in the suburbs, especially which were uh uh...not Schwabian...I don't know from where they uh really came...and uh their political uh attitude changed.</span> <span id="s72">Hitler and his propaganda ministry were quite active and the same happened in the other German colonies in Romania.</span> <span id="s73">Romania had...in Bessarabia there were Schwabian colonies which were for a long time already that they came to Bessarabia under Katherine the Second.</span> <span id="s74">Uh then Transylvania had uh Saxon, especially in the southern part Fagaras-Brasov.</span> <span id="s75">Uh the Banat had also Schwab Germans and uh naturally as their attitude toward Jews and uh and uh as apparent of the new National Socialist inclination of the German people, uh uh fell on a very fertile ground.</span> <span id="s76">Uh in the late '30's the uh Romanian government fell under the influence of the Iron Guard, first Cuza-Goga, then government, then the Iron...then the Iron Guard had a tremendous influence.</span> <span id="s77">It was very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s78">It was a chauvinistic movement which aligned itself uh intimately with Hitler under Marshall Antonescu to a degree where they took part in the anti-Soviet campaign with uh two armies.</span> <span id="s79">So did the Hungarians and uh voluntary uh the voluntary uh divisions from Spain and from France, does not matter (ph), and from Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And from the time you graduated medical school in 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No, no, no, no. 1936.</span> <span id="s82">Thirt...I started medical school in 1930.</span> <span id="s83">I left Prague in 1933.</span> <span id="s84">I was for three years there, a student at the German University.</span> <span id="s85">I uh...the uh students at the German University were between seventy and eighty percent Nazis and uh their attitude toward the Jews was well known.</span> <span id="s86">I went from there to Strasbourg , France, but uh not being...uh France having a different system of studies which was completely different from the German system...the French medical studies were there yearly studies and you have to pass every year an exam in order to be admitted to the next year.</span> <span id="s87">The German University had a a uh different ____(ph).</span> <span id="s88">You had three riguroza (ph) of which every five semesters you have to finish, so uh they didn't recognize my third year.</span> <span id="s89">In order not to loose it I went later via Basel uh Swiss, Switzerland to Italy because I found out that Italy had had reciprocity with England.</span> <span id="s90">Reciprocity lasted until 1940.</span> <span id="s91">The uh the uh Italian system...uh well you had to pass a special exam in order to be admitted to the to the British Medical Council.</span> <span id="s92">Eur...uh Europe in that time was full of people who wanted to leave Europe because of Hitler.</span> <span id="s93">Many succeeded.</span> <span id="s94">Many did not.</span> <span id="s95">I was admitted to the British Medical Council.</span> <span id="s96">I secured a landing permit for Australia and in the end I ended up in spite of everything in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Tell me what happened to you at that time, once the Nazis came?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: In uh in uh...I found myself...the Nazis attacked Russia on uh June the 22nd, 1941.</span> <span id="s99">Uh I was uh in that time working under the Russians...oh yes...I forgot to tell you that in 1940 I uh, June the 22nd...I..</span> <span id="s100">.23rd, 1940...I married Gusti Klier, also born uh also living in Czernowitz and I had returned from the Transylvania from Cluj to Czernowitz to get married.</span> <span id="s101">I uh was an assis...a voluntary assistant at that time at the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the University in Cluj and I was supposed to come back.</span> <span id="s102">My uh then father-in-law asked me to stay with him after the marriage for a week.</span> <span id="s103">I uh...and this was Sunday, the 23rd.</span> <span id="s104">On Friday, the 28th the Russian tanks entered uh Czernowitz and my return could not take place anymore.</span> <span id="s105">I worked as a uh ear, nose and throat man in the First City Hospital in Czernowitz and at the Second Polyclinic, also in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s106">I had two, two and a half jobs as they called staukas (ph).</span> <span id="s107">Uh still not enough to make a good...a living.</span> <span id="s108">Conditions were tight, very lousy in Russia and uh and uh one really had a hard time.</span> <span id="s109">My wife also worked in that time as the head of a cooperative and uh with her and my salaries we could barely uh make ends meet.</span> <span id="s110">At the...as soon as Hitler attacked Russia uh on June the 22nd, 1941, three months later I found myself in the uh western part of the Ukrainia uh uh east of Kamenets Podolski and I tried to make my way back to to uh...and we ended up in Kamenets Podolski in the western Ukraine.</span> <span id="s111">There we met...uh we were a group of three physicians.</span> <span id="s112">Uh Gabriel Zinreich, my friend and his wife and his father-in-law.</span> <span id="s113">Uh Frank uh uh...I think his first name was Solomom Frank and from Brasov both his...were from Transylvania whose uh native tongue was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s114">In Kamenets Podolski we found Hungarian uh troops and again one of these uh uh seldom happened really a miracle.</span> <span id="s115">Uh I uh...in 1936...and I'm coming back, uh going back...in 1936 after I graduated I returned to Czernowitz and went from there to Bucharest to take the license in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s116">My parents lived in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s117">My mother was still alive.</span> <span id="s118">I wasn't married in that time and uh I passed the uh the exam which was not quite easy.</span> <span id="s119">It is the...they called it the notification (ph) and I got an off...an offer to have a locum tenence (ph) near the Hungarian border in Transylvania and uh uh I earned quite a lot.</span> <span id="s120">I wasn't uh I wasn't married and I ate in the house of a Hungarian priest whose wife came from uh uh the northern part of Transylvania.</span> <span id="s121">And while being in Kamenets Podolski...now I'm coming back...now again '41...we met somebody who was from...a sergeant picked us up from the Hungarian army and he happened to be from Salonta, Szatmar area from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s122">He uh he apparently knew about what's going to happen to the Jews in in uh in the Ukrainia because uh when I established that I knew somebody from from Salonta where he was from...it turned out that the mother-in-law of the priest in whose house I ate in in a little town in Transylvania by the name of uh of uh Beius, Ujlak...uh he said this is no place for you to be.</span> <span id="s123">You have to go to Hungary.</span> <span id="s124">Jews in Hungary in that time, 1941, were still alright.</span> <span id="s125">We had...Gabriel Zinreich, my friend, had a Hungarian-speaking wife and he put us on a truck to Munkacs.</span> <span id="s126">But in order to get to Munkacs we had to pass through Poland, through the General Government, and it happens that when we passed the bridge uh over the Dniester in Horodienka we got picked up by Hungarian gendarmerie, uh beaten and uh we ended up later in the ghetto, in a little ghetto in Poland.</span> <span id="s127">And here started our Polish episode which had to...which turned out to last the whole war and ended up in 1944 where I joined the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Tell me about the time in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The ghetto where we ended...where we lived was a little town.</span> <span id="s130">It, it was fascinating to me.</span> <span id="s131">I had never seen a uh a uh an establishment like Korolovka (ph).</span> <span id="s132">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s133">It had no railroad station.</span> <span id="s134">It had no sanitation.</span> <span id="s135">It had no water supply.</span> <span id="s136">It had no electricity.</span> <span id="s137">It uh...you had a wasser treiger (ph) who had to bring the water to the people who paid him.</span> <span id="s138">You uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to eighteen hundred Jews in that little ghetto.</span> <span id="s139">It was a natural ghetto.</span> <span id="s140">It was like a stetl from the time of, which Shalom Alehem described.</span> <span id="s141">I have never been in such a stetl and uh for me it was really fascinating to to to to study it.</span> <span id="s142">It uh...one doctor.</span> <span id="s143">One Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s144">One Jewish dentist.</span> <span id="s145">The doctor was Dr. Teibers (ph) and everyone had a sufix in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s146">Dr. Teibers was called Tiberhazel.</span> <span id="s147">The dentist was called...his name was Gunie Wiesenthal...was called Gunie Pipick (ph) because he was uh heavy.</span> <span id="s148">Uh the Jews lived around a remick (ph), the ring platz (ph) in the center of which was a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s149">Magister Schwartz was the the pharmacist.</span> <span id="s150">These were attached houses but the the Germans didn't really need to establish a ghetto.</span> <span id="s151">There was a natural ghetto right there.</span> <span id="s152">They just established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that area and no Jew is permitted to go out.</span> <span id="s153">It was difficult to reinforce this because the borders of that ghetto were quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews were able to communicate with the farmers.</span> <span id="s154">Having done commerce and business with them for so many years, they knew each other and uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger cities.</span> <span id="s155">Uh we had problems with food.</span> <span id="s156">I saw immediately that uh uh I have to to do something to uh to establish a source of food and uh I went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to me his uh overflow.</span> <span id="s157">He said there is really no overflow at this time, and you know, uh in that time you didn't pay for a visit.</span> <span id="s158">You, you...the farmers or the people who came for medical consultation paid in uh in food.</span> <span id="s159">So...but he said...and he gave this advice.</span> <span id="s160">If you get the permission to practice outside the ghetto in the little community, because there are no doctors around here, uh we...you you could uh you could survive.</span> <span id="s161">I would like to mention here the attitude of the Jews in that little ghetto.</span> <span id="s162">When I came in, the Russian had left.</span> <span id="s163">The Russian had been there, in Korolovka, since the seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when they entered the eastern part of Poland, and there was...the attitude of the Jews was not uh friendly towards the Soviets.</span> <span id="s164">Many Jews had been deported.</span> <span id="s165">So were many Ukrainian who had been deported, especially Ukrainians who belonged to the National uh Nationalistic organization.</span> <span id="s166">Ukrainians were very uh very nationalistic in their political aspiration and as soon as Hitler attacked Russia, the area was flooded with uh leaflets in which uh they uh were proclaiming that the time had come to establish the uh Volna Ukraina (ph), that means the free Ukraine.</span> <span id="s167">The leaflets were signed by a Ukrainian uh uh uh leader by the name of Stephan Bandera who established a group of people later who uh carried his name and they were called Banderovitsis (ph).</span> <span id="s168">Very anti-Semitic and very anti-Soviet.</span> <span id="s169">They said the time has come to proclaim the free Ukraina, to kill the Jews and the Communists.</span> <span id="s170">The uh...I didn't know how to go about getting the permission and I was directed to what the chief of the Judenrat , the Judenaltester who was a man by the name of Max Glickstern, Glickstern.</span> <span id="s171">Max Glickstern was married to a uh woman from the Bukovina by the name of Hilda, Hilda uh Zinreich and was a cousin of the, my friend Gabriel Zinreich, so I had access to him.</span> <span id="s172">He was a businessman who never did very well, but when he came to the ghetto he was already nominated to be the elder of the Judenrat .</span> <span id="s173">Uh he uh lived like a king really.</span> <span id="s174">He had power.</span> <span id="s175">Also, being a small community but the powers uh con...uh con...confer power to a human being and his attitude changes completely and uh it did on uh Max too.</span> <span id="s176">While I would have to say that in many instances he behaved very honestly, still people who had money to bribe and the Judenrat was bribable to a very, very large degree.</span> <span id="s177">So was everybody.</span> <span id="s178">Uh there's...uh belonging to their admini....to the so-called Jewish administration uh he gave me a uh a..</span> <span id="s179">.</span> <span id="s180">he got for me letter signed by a priest in a small community uh outside Korolovka by the name of Bicewslote (ph).</span> <span id="s181">He directed me.</span> <span id="s182">He sent letters to the uh lecaspoiutove (ph) which was the Kreisars (ph) of the of the Ukrainian physician who was in charge of the area, and he gave me permission to the...uh to practice there.</span> <span id="s183">The letter from the priest was signed by a priest by the name of Stamosese (ph) who was the leader of the Ukrainian organization.</span> <span id="s184">And we were brought by a uh uh man whose family later survived the war by the name of Sturmer who was a person who had intimate contact with the farmers around Korolovka.</span> <span id="s185">He still managed to keep a couple of horses hidden in someplace outside the ghetto and he brought us to Benceslote (ph) and now started for me a a very interesting uh uh practice.</span> <span id="s186">It lasted no more than six months because the area was later declared in May uh '42 Judenrein .</span> <span id="s187">When we came there uh he brought us to the house of the man by the name of Samy Reinstein who had a who had a dwelling where he had what they call it propinatzia.</span> <span id="s188">He sold liquor, schnaps and uh small uh items to the farmers.</span> <span id="s189">Right now he didn't have any more that store and he was able to rent us a few uh a couple of rooms.</span> <span id="s190">Uh the next day he he told me I should go to introduce myself to the priest being the leader of the community.</span> <span id="s191">Father Shamosheshin (ph) spoke some German.</span> <span id="s192">He was a lean mean in his early fifties or late forties.</span> <span id="s193">He uh uh was very non-committal.</span> <span id="s194">He said for twenty-five years I had asked the Polish government uh to send a physician here.</span> <span id="s195">Uh the Germans had to come finally to make it possible for Benceslote to have a physician.</span> <span id="s196">Benceslote was also known that it had a large estate belong to an absentee land-lord by the name of Count Sapira (ph).</span> <span id="s197">The count...the estate had been uh taken over by the Soviets and transformed into a state farm and the Germans left it the same way.</span> <span id="s198">A week later an event occurred which uh which was important.</span> <span id="s199">Somebody knocked at the window of our of our room and uh when...Mr. Reinstein, Samy Reinstein opened the door, he said Doctor, it's for you.</span> <span id="s200">They want you to come immediately to the priest.</span> <span id="s201">The wife of the priest is sick.</span> <span id="s202">I, having his assurances that this, the call was genuine because I was afraid to go in the middle of the night, I uh...the man who who had come for me was a militant (ph) from the militia, Ukrainian militia.</span> <span id="s203">I found the uh the wife of the priest in severe upper abdominal pain.</span> <span id="s204">She had a gall bladder attack, gall stones.</span> <span id="s205">She said she had it for many years.</span> <span id="s206">She was in agony.</span> <span id="s207">She was perspired, begging to help her and so was her husband, uh the priest.</span> <span id="s208">I had one ampule (ph) of a synthetic morphine opium (ph) preparation, ______, which I gave her and uh she promptly vomited as soon as I gave it to her, even before I thought it.</span> <span id="s209">But she fell asleep and uh I left her for a couple of hours and I came next morning.</span> <span id="s210">I found her in uh in uh the kitchen cooking, full of enthusiasm.</span> <span id="s211">Doctor, you cured me.</span> <span id="s212">I said what do you mean.</span> <span id="s213">I was told the only cure for me was an operation and here I am free.</span> <span id="s214">I feel fine.</span> <span id="s215">It is possible that the injection had relieved the spasm and the stones had passed into the small intestine and uh and uh I really cured her.</span> <span id="s216">(laughter) As a result of it next Sunday as Samy Reinstein told me, the priest in church in his sermon to the community said you can do what you want with our local Jews...there were twelve or fifteen Jewish families still in Benceslote (ph) but the Romanian doctor you shouldn't touch.</span> <span id="s217">And the term Romanian doctor remained with us for the whole time while I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s218">Uh a week later we were honored with a fat roasted duck sent by the priest with his thanks.</span> <span id="s219">Interesting.</span> <span id="s220">And a week later when I came to visit his wife, he was very friendly.</span> <span id="s221">Took me into the uh into the basement uh and said I would like to show you something.</span> <span id="s222">He showed me a book published many years before.</span> <span id="s223">It was called Zolotaknina Hatmana Skoropatzkoro (ph), the Golden Book of the Hatman Skoropatzki.</span> <span id="s224">Skoropatzki was one of the hatmans who had fought in the early twenties during the civil war against the new Soviet power.</span> <span id="s225">The the group...the soldiers of hatman Skoropatzki were known to have performed, to have quite killed many Jews.</span> <span id="s226">Among the pictures in that book, he showed me a picture...he said that's me.</span> <span id="s227">Was a young man in military uniform with a C C on his uh collar.</span> <span id="s228">C C is S S..</span> <span id="s229">.</span> <span id="s230">it's the...but it has nothing to be the German SS.</span> <span id="s231">He said it it it is Sichobeitselie Kovetz (ph).</span> <span id="s232">Sich (ph) was the national fighting organization of the Ukrainian uh uh Nationalist uh movement and uh Father Shamosheshin was the leader in his community.</span> <span id="s233">His word meant law there.</span> <span id="s234">Whatever Father Shamosheshin said, went.</span> <span id="s235">Naturally, we were now somehow under the protection of Father Shamosheshin.</span> <span id="s236">A month later an event took place which really uh was a lucky incident.</span> <span id="s237">One night somebody rang the bell uh...rang the bell...knocked on my door...no bell...knocked on the window.</span> <span id="s238">It was, as it turned out, a Polish refugee who had...from Warsaw who had tried in 1939 to to go by car to Romania.</span> <span id="s239">We were not far from the Romanian border, some hundred and fifty kilometers, and his car broke down near Bielce (ph) and he couldn't...and before he could repair the car the Soviets had uh marched in, had closed the border, and his name was Zarenski or Zarubski.</span> <span id="s240">He was a young engineer from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s241">He said please come.</span> <span id="s242">My wife is dying.</span> <span id="s243">I came to his house and I found her almost bled out.</span> <span id="s244">She had a vaginal bleeding.</span> <span id="s245">She had an incomplete abortion and what she needed was a little scraping.</span> <span id="s246">She was almost in coma.</span> <span id="s247">She she had a pulse of over 200.</span> <span id="s248">She...,there was no uh uh her blood pressure was extremely low.</span> <span id="s249">I I told him to get immediate some transportation to take her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s250">In Borosow (ph) it was the nearest hospital, but there was also a railroad station.</span> <span id="s251">I knew a couple of doctors...one Doctor un Rabinowitz (ph) and Dr. Rosenblatt (ph) who uh they are able to perform a uh a uh D&amp;C.</span> <span id="s252">As soon as we brought her in they did the D&amp;C.</span> <span id="s253">Uh she stopped bleeding.</span> <span id="s254">They kept her for three or four days in the hospital and uh I want you to know this was a time there weren't knowing the transfusions.</span> <span id="s255">There were no even transfusions.</span> <span id="s256">That operating room had no oxygen.</span> <span id="s257">Nothing.</span> <span id="s258">No suction.</span> <span id="s259">Nothing, but it functioned.</span> <span id="s260">It was 19 uh 41, '42 now.</span> <span id="s261">It uh...he brought her home and a week later he showed up in uh where I worked, embraced me and said Doctor, I don't know, I don't have the money to or how to pay you, but remember if the time will...I know you have a hard time...if circumstances will come that you will need help, come to me.</span> <span id="s262">I took it as a uh as an empty uh uh thank you and didn't pay too much attention, but it stayed, stayed in the back of my mind and really later it it uh uh was a lucky incident.</span> <span id="s263">When the area was declared Judenrein we returned to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">Do you want to ask me something?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: No.</span> <span id="s266">It's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: It's alright?</span> <span id="s268">We returned to the ghetto and now a very hard life.</span> <span id="s269">Uh food.</span> <span id="s270">Food and during the summer of '42 we heard that this was the rumor that the _______ of the Gestapo from Stanislow (ph) is around in the area liquidating ghettos.</span> <span id="s271">That means aktion.</span> <span id="s272">We established a uh guard every house.</span> <span id="s273">In that time I stayed in the house of a certain Aaron Spotheim, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s274">Aaron Spotheim had a ______ of ______.</span> <span id="s275">______, that means how much.</span> <span id="s276">That means he was a bad man.</span> <span id="s277">He was really a..</span> <span id="s278">.</span> <span id="s279">not a very friendly uh person.</span> <span id="s280">Uh the whole ghetto real...uh really didn't like him very much but he he uh let us in and so we were happy there and with his help when the aktion star...in the area started, we we decided to build our own bunker or our own front.</span> <span id="s281">Being uh what he was, ____ ________, he said nobody should know it.</span> <span id="s282">I don't want anybody to come in to that, in to that uh hiding place from our neighbors.</span> <span id="s283">So nobody really knew about our hiding place.</span> <span id="s284">I thought in that time that our hiding place was a good hiding place.</span> <span id="s285">We had...you know, the houses in the ghetto, around the _____ were attached houses.</span> <span id="s286">The house attached to Mr. uh to Mr. Spotheim's house had a smaller uh roof.</span> <span id="s287">We decided to took the border between two houses to separate and create between the attics as a hiding place.</span> <span id="s288">Later I..</span> <span id="s289">.</span> <span id="s290">when I compared our hiding place with the others, I felt it was probably the flimsiest hiding place or bunker which existed.</span> <span id="s291">It had only one positive thing.</span> <span id="s292">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s293">I was witnessing...looking out from when the aktion took place and seeing in what ways they collected the people in to what they called the Umshagplatz (ph) there in the ghetto, because because they had to take them, to take the Jews by large lorries to ____, uh to Borszczow to to transport them by train to uh...our area went to the annihilation camp in...oh my goodness, this gives me...I don't remember it so...(pause)...anyway uh the way how they did it convinced me that...until then I was not really convinced that people were uh gassed.</span> <span id="s294">We heard about it.</span> <span id="s295">There were rumors but nobody knew for sure.</span> <span id="s296">It really didn't make sense.</span> <span id="s297">The whole plan of the annihilation of the Jews was conceived in such a diabolic way...having a Jewish Judenrat to collaborate, to fulfill the orders of the Germans because they had no way, no different way, no way out.</span> <span id="s298">Having installed the Jewish police and here is an element which I would like to mention.</span> <span id="s299">To a large degree the Jewish police was formed by former lawyers.</span> <span id="s300">They were so brutal.</span> <span id="s301">Their language was so crude.</span> <span id="s302">The way...how they uh how they behaved toward the population was so revolting that many times we asked ourselves, how come these educated people...and they...you had to consider them educated people to a large degree in comparison to the other people in the ghetto who who were not educated, who didn't have any university schooling.</span> <span id="s303">It uh behaved in such a way...the circumstances created it.</span> <span id="s304">Example.</span> <span id="s305">During the summer of '42, seeing that I really had nobody to rely on...I'm a stranger...I'm a foreigner...who is going to help me?</span> <span id="s306">I had...we had no money.</span> <span id="s307">I started to explore the area around Korulovka.</span> <span id="s308">In one of these explorations I got into another ghetto by the name of Czortkow (ph).</span> <span id="s309">It was a bigger ghetto.</span> <span id="s310">It had five thousand Jews there and the leader, the Judenaltester, was a lawyer by the name of Dr. Ebner (ph).</span> <span id="s311">You know in the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, every lawyer was called Herr doctor.</span> <span id="s312">I wanted what they called a psheapuska (ph).</span> <span id="s313">Pshepuska in Polish means a passirchein (ph), a permit, because I wanted to make my way or to find a way toward the border.</span> <span id="s314">The border was Zaleszczyki.</span> <span id="s315">It uh...when I uh sent a militia man in ann...to say if Dr. Ebner can receive me, I don't know what the militia if he understood very well, but I ended up really in front of Dr. Ebner who said, who are you?</span> <span id="s316">What do you want?</span> <span id="s317">Very hostile.</span> <span id="s318">I said, look.</span> <span id="s319">I'm a physician from Czernowitz, you know, Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s320">As a matter of fact I was trying to...Czernowitz had a a deputy by the name of Meyer Ebner...I say...the same last name...I said you probably must be related.</span> <span id="s321">He said, sure I'm related.</span> <span id="s322">What do you want?</span> <span id="s323">His attitude was...he called the militia man in and told him in Polish uh Czortkow.</span> <span id="s324">That means search him.</span> <span id="s325">I didn't know what...and he said uh see if he had, if he has grini papirna (ph).</span> <span id="s326">That means dollars.</span> <span id="s327">I didn't have any.</span> <span id="s328">He says what do you want?</span> <span id="s329">I say I would like a _____, a pshapuska (ph).</span> <span id="s330">He said, look doctor.</span> <span id="s331">I have no time.</span> <span id="s332">You are bothering me.</span> <span id="s333">You take my time away.</span> <span id="s334">I have...I have my people to take care of.</span> <span id="s335">Get out of my ghetto or I'll give you over to the Gestapo myself.</span> <span id="s336">I was really amazed at that hostile reaction and I was very depressed.</span> <span id="s337">I left that ghetto because he said in ten minutes you have to disappear from my ghetto.</span> <span id="s338">Alright.</span> <span id="s339">Czortkow was a city which looked or is a city which looked like a fortress.</span> <span id="s340">It had big uh tall uh uh walls.</span> <span id="s341">It was one of the eastern cities of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and probably for protection against invasions from the east, but it was a a frightening city.</span> <span id="s342">I left the city in a hurry.</span> <span id="s343">I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s344">I was angry.</span> <span id="s345">I was hungry, tired, and I came and throwing me out of the ghetto, Dr. Ebner saved my life.</span> <span id="s346">Outside the ghetto, I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s347">I looked for a place, a _____, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s348">Until in the morning I heard uh I heard engine uh noise.</span> <span id="s349">I looked out and I saw trucks filled with police, German police, Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s350">They were liquidating the ghetto in that day.</span> <span id="s351">By throwing me out of the ghetto, he had uh really saved my life.</span> <span id="s352">To make a long story short uh at the end of September, beginning of October, finally the aktion took place in _______.</span> <span id="s353">It was preceded by a request from the Gestapo to Max Glickstern, the Judenrateltester, to furnish two hundred fifty Jews.</span> <span id="s354">The rumors said that the two hundred fifty Jews were meant to go for schmeltz (ph) what that means ?</span> <span id="s355">.</span> <span id="s356">That means for destruction.</span> <span id="s357">And I happened to witness a discussion in the Judenrat which took place to form a list of the two hundred and fifty Jews, and it it was a..</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">the discussion which took place...he said look, you have an old uh father up there who is really...why don't you give your father.</span> <span id="s360">He said my father.</span> <span id="s361">You have an uncle and you have this...why don't you give...and everybody was pointing fingers to somebody else.</span> <span id="s362">It came to a point where Max Glickstern, he had to really...and I I admired him in that time...had tears in his eyes and said look, fellows.</span> <span id="s363">I grew up, I know everyone of...I grew up in this community.</span> <span id="s364">I know every one of you here.</span> <span id="s365">I am not going to make a list of two hundred and fifty Jews.</span> <span id="s366">I am going to say to the community hide.</span> <span id="s367">Whomever it will, it will hit it will hit but I'm not going to make.</span> <span id="s368">And he left the meeting.</span> <span id="s369">So now everybody was finishing or starting to to to uh because everybody knew it is it is...the end is near and uh the result of that aktion was really disastrous.</span> <span id="s370">It wasn't two hundred and fifty.</span> <span id="s371">It ended up around fourteen hundred were taken and it explains to a large degree what has been discussed so many times in the last years.</span> <span id="s372">Was it correct or was it right or was it fair from the Judenrat or the Judeneltester...I just read the book about Rumkovski, the chief of the Lodz ghetto, you know, to give out in order to save the community a certain number of Jews.</span> <span id="s373">Here Max Glickstein had re...had refused to give out two hundred fifty and later we asked ourselves the question...if he would have given the two hundred and fifty, you know, there would have remained uh fourteen hundred still there.</span> <span id="s374">But it was a a a question which nobody really could uh answer satisfactorily.</span> <span id="s375">Uh some two hundred, hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who whose hiding place were not found, were uh were uh survived.</span> <span id="s376">I witnessed one scene where a uh a tailor by the name of Singer whom I had known in the ghetto uh was on his knee before a German and said, herr Gestapo, ________________.</span> <span id="s377">He looked at him...</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Translate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: ...uh Mr. Gestapo.</span> <span id="s380">Give me back my wife and my child, to which the man looked at him and said bring me a thousand Juden.</span> <span id="s381">Bring me thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s382">And then he brought a thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s383">He knew the hiding place of every...of a lot of people.</span> <span id="s384">I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s385">Many people, especially the one who had uh still money...they're paying people to to to dig their bunkers.</span> <span id="s386">In this way there were people who knew about the bunker of neighbors or other people, and he brought them.</span> <span id="s387">When I, we left the ghetto, Gusti and I..</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">Gusti was the name of my first wife...uh Mr. Singer was was still there and the Germans had...he had his wife and his child.</span> <span id="s390">How long he survived I don't know.</span> <span id="s391">Uh summer 19...before the aktion took place, an incident...an even...a a an episode which might be interesting.</span> <span id="s392">One day I got in...I think it was July or August '42...I don't remember exactly...I get a call from the, from Dr. Teibers to come, to come to him.</span> <span id="s393">Since I have seen uh in the end of 1941 he hadn't uh shown too much interest in me.</span> <span id="s394">And I came there.</span> <span id="s395">I I was a little suspicious of his call and I said uh...he starts questioning...how hungry are you doctor?</span> <span id="s396">I was impression first he make fun of me, but then I thought...I say why do you ask me that question?</span> <span id="s397">Sure.</span> <span id="s398">We have no food.</span> <span id="s399">He said I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s400">There is a community around Korolovka by the name of Oxenetz.</span> <span id="s401">The story of Oxenetz, O - X - E - N - E - T - Z, it is a a a uh...how do they called it....it would be called a a uh hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism.</span> <span id="s402">Why is it important to mention it?</span> <span id="s403">In Oxenetz, they were around twenty or twenty-five Jewish families.</span> <span id="s404">Before the German authorities or the Ukrainian authorities were able to take over the new administration after the Soviets left, the local popu...uh population, the local Ukrainians had killed all the Jewish families in Oxenetz.</span> <span id="s405">He said there is a call to be made, a medical call in Oxenetz for the grandchild of the wogt (ph).</span> <span id="s406">Wogt is the Polish name or the Ukrainian name for uh the mayor.</span> <span id="s407">The word comes from the German vogt.</span> <span id="s408">It is a uh a Ukrainianization of it, colonization of the word.</span> <span id="s409">The _____, and he'll pay whatever...there is no doctor in the whole place.</span> <span id="s410">I say why don't you take the call?</span> <span id="s411">He said I wouldn't even if they would pay uh gold I wouldn't go there.</span> <span id="s412">He says these are murderers.</span> <span id="s413">Well, he said, there is a man outside the ghetto who waits with a carriage or the _____, you know, to take whoever...if you want to go.</span> <span id="s414">He'll pay you whatever you want.</span> <span id="s415">I went back and I told Gusti this will be the only way to get some food.</span> <span id="s416">I didn't tell her that it is to Oxenetz because why should...she heard later while I was away.</span> <span id="s417">I knew that in the area was an epidemic of diphtheria and when I came out the...the outside the ghetto, I found a militia, a Ukrainian militia man with the cap of where they have the emblem of the Ukrainian uh organization.</span> <span id="s418">The Ukrainian Nationalist organization had the, was OUM, for uh Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Organizationa Ukreinski Nationalistiv (ph) in Ukrainian, and their militia men had an emblem...they call it the trizub (ph).</span> <span id="s419">Trizub is a trident .</span> <span id="s420">It looked like a trident and they have it on top of their cap.</span> <span id="s421">He had a trident thing and he had a I thought it was a frisky horse.</span> <span id="s422">There were two uh wheels in the front, two in the back and something...and we had to sit sideways on it because there was no...there were no sides walls on it.</span> <span id="s423">Anyway I said before we leave I would like to pass by a..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">what we called the convent.</span> <span id="s426">There were two Polish nuns who uh who provided the population with uh sporadically this drugs, medications and I passed by...I knew the nuns because one of the nuns a throat infection.</span> <span id="s427">Being an ear, nose and throat man, Dr. Teibers a year before had told me, had sent me there to see them because the nuns, you had to to to treat for free and Dr. Teibers was not very much interested to treat for free and this was the reason why he was called over _______.</span> <span id="s428">Anyway I..</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">they gave me a serum, two ampules of serum I think around ten cc's each, large ampules, and uh whose date of expiration was...as a matter of fact I don't remember it...there was a date of expiration.</span> <span id="s431">I took these two ampules and we not knowing if I'm going to use it.</span> <span id="s432">We...after four, five hours we arrived in Oxenetz and entering I saw empty houses that the wind was was was uh uh...the empty windows without glass panes were uh uh and he shout...the man shouted and said in Ukrainian to me...used a very derogatory word.</span> <span id="s433">He says ___________________.</span> <span id="s434">Here our Jews lived.</span> <span id="s435">Our Jews.</span> <span id="s436">But he used the term jide (ph).</span> <span id="s437">It is a a term which the Ukrainian applied in general to Jews and uh I came to the house of the wogt.</span> <span id="s438">He greeted me in this way, with the hand up.</span> <span id="s439">Not the uh the uh...it was a greeting...I don't don't think it was the Nazi's Nazi...and showed me the way into the house.</span> <span id="s440">I came in.</span> <span id="s441">I found a two and a half or three year old boy breathing very heavily, almost uh, you know... ______, ______, he had that _______ ...I looked in his throat and there was no (cough) uh everybody who had seen once the so-called pseudo-membranes of of diphtheria patients, it was no problem for me to make the diagnosis.</span> <span id="s442">I told the ____ I have to to uh give him an injection.</span> <span id="s443">He said you do what you have to do.</span> <span id="s444">The only thing is there were some fifteen, sixteen people in that little room, you know, the the air was heavy.</span> <span id="s445">I said I want everybody out, so only four or five people remained.</span> <span id="s446">There was a grandmother.</span> <span id="s447">Uh I found out that this was the only male grandchild of the wogt and he he he was tremendously uh uh eager and concerned about the health.</span> <span id="s448">I gave the child...the child was very toxic.</span> <span id="s449">His his temperature was low.</span> <span id="s450">He didn't even have a high temperature.</span> <span id="s451">He was pale.</span> <span id="s452">He had trouble breathing.</span> <span id="s453">I checked his heart to see if he had any complications.</span> <span id="s454">No.</span> <span id="s455">His heartbeat was alright.</span> <span id="s456">His lungs uh I couldn't make out because of that ________ but I gave him the injection and uh I said we'll see.</span> <span id="s457">He said alright.</span> <span id="s458">You see, you're going to sleep in the next room.</span> <span id="s459">I said what do you mean sleep in the next room.</span> <span id="s460">He says well, you're going to stay here until the child will recover.</span> <span id="s461">I had...I was under the impression that this is going to be just a medical call and I will leave.</span> <span id="s462">I realized immediately if that if that child is not going to recover I don't think I'll recover or I'll survive it.</span> <span id="s463">But to make a long story short, I was hungry so I said look, I didn't eat the whole day.</span> <span id="s464">Oh, he said, food...no problem.</span> <span id="s465">He called his wife.</span> <span id="s466">He said why don't you make the doctor...and he said pane doctor.</span> <span id="s467">That means herr doctor.</span> <span id="s468">So I uh said make me a a uh uh five eggs, this slanina, this bacon and they put a bottle of vodka.</span> <span id="s469">I had three drinks.</span> <span id="s470">I ate it.</span> <span id="s471">I felt good and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s472">When I woke up uh some ten or twelve hours later and now it was morning, next day, ten o'clock.</span> <span id="s473">I went in to see my patient.</span> <span id="s474">He was breathing slightly better.</span> <span id="s475">He still still had some ________ but we were able to force a little water or cold milk in his throat.</span> <span id="s476">I uh didn't know, I didn't have what to do so meantime somebody else came and said doctor, could you see my wife.</span> <span id="s477">So my fee in that time was two chickens for a cold, so I asked the wogt if he'd give me permission.</span> <span id="s478">He said sure, why not.</span> <span id="s479">Anyway in the evening, at the end of the second day I I was a a lucky uh uh proprietor of six chickens.</span> <span id="s480">I had three.</span> <span id="s481">I slept the second.</span> <span id="s482">I ate and drank well and the third day they...the child was breathing now much better.</span> <span id="s483">It was...it...the the serum had...I was very worried.</span> <span id="s484">The serum at that time was not a very concentrated serum and uh there were a lot of reactions, the reaction what we called serum disease.</span> <span id="s485">It...you could have really serious uh uh side reaction, sometimes even fatal.</span> <span id="s486">Anyway, that child had absolutely no no side effects.</span> <span id="s487">He recovered.</span> <span id="s488">The fourth day he was fine.</span> <span id="s489">He asked for food.</span> <span id="s490">He had now a little bit of a..</span> <span id="s491">.</span> <span id="s492">still around hundred, hundred and two, being that, you know, the European thermometers were from thirty-six degrees Celsius so...centigrade...so uh I said, I asked the wogt how do you uh...do you think I could leave.</span> <span id="s493">He says oh yes.</span> <span id="s494">Never said thank you.</span> <span id="s495">The only uh person who came forward was the wife, his wife.</span> <span id="s496">Not the mother of the...the mother of the child didn't leave the child but the grandmother, the wife of the wogt.</span> <span id="s497">She came out, took my hand and said in Ukrainian, doctor, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s498">You are a good man.</span> <span id="s499">You saved my grandchild and the wogt said, the car...here is the man who brought you.</span> <span id="s500">I said...oops, I'm sorry...he said...I'm sorry ______...he uh said uh...I had asked for what they call a koretz (ph) of..._____ is hundred kilo, two hundred pounds of uh wheat, kernels.</span> <span id="s501">He said no problem.</span> <span id="s502">I found the hundred kilos on the carriage...on the briska.</span> <span id="s503">Meantime I had twelve chickens.</span> <span id="s504">The moth...the grandmother of, the wife of the wogt had told me she's going to take care of and really everything was on the carriage and I asked the man when he finally arrived at Korulovka at the ghetto...this was ______.</span> <span id="s505">That means the aktion...I am I am coming back.</span> <span id="s506">Aktion had not taken place yet.</span> <span id="s507">In no time the whole ghetto, you know, uh knew that the Romanian doctor is with a whole...meantime the rumor that I am bringing a tremendous amount of kernels back.</span> <span id="s508">To make a long story short, we had wheat only twenty kilos, not twenty I don't know.</span> <span id="s509">Twenty pounds of that kernels we were able to turn into into flour and to bake it.</span> <span id="s510">The rest got lost during the inspection of a uh agricultural, German agricultural inspectors.</span> <span id="s511">They inspected the ghetto and this was really to to get the food out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: _____________change the tapes</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Alright.</span></p>

<span id="s519">I I was uh not only surprised but I wasn't too eager to meet, and...but he he greeted him as he answered and we stopped somehow to talk.</span> <span id="s520">I spoke a much better German.</span> <span id="s521">German was my native tongue than the man...not Singer (ph)...something Shiller (ph), Singer...something...I don't remember exactly his name.</span> <span id="s522">But he started to talk about it and to the man...as a matter of fact, he's from Vienna.</span> <span id="s523">He announced the policeman, he's he's uh he's a high school teacher and uh in his civilian...he teaches mathematics at the uh gymnasium.</span> <span id="s524">He mentioned in Vienna and he started to talk about it and uh uh we went to a place uh that Singer, whose name was, had...apparently he had to make an appoint...he wanted something from that man, and he knew him better uh because he had brought a bottle of vodka for him and uh uh the officer sat down...he brou...the German sat down and started to drink.</span> <span id="s525">After a few drinks he started to talk about Vienna...how uh how he he he would like to be back in Vienna, and then he started to talk about his father who's uh...and he he told us...apparently he felt he can uh talk to us very openly and for a uh Social Democrat he was member in the Shutzbund.</span> <span id="s526">I knew more about the Shutzbund.</span> <span id="s527">In Vienna the Shutzbund in Vienna was an organization, was a fighting organization of the Social Democrats in Vienna who had fought against Dolfuss when he was Chancellor of Vienna and uh they were beaten and why he told us this story I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s528">Maybe he felt we were candidates to any uh...but he...uh then he started to talk about the Jews.</span> <span id="s529">He was already drunk and he said to us in German, to me, uh yeah, Juden ______ ______.</span> <span id="s530">That means uh there is open season on you.</span> <span id="s531">Everybody can shoot you.</span> <span id="s532">There is no law to protect you.</span> <span id="s533">This would be the uh...it happened that after the incident when the _______, when the ghetto in _______ was annihilated, I was back into into uh uh Zaleszczyky also trying to...I tended toward the border, always to find maybe there is a way there to get out.</span> <span id="s534">And one day I saw from far the figure of that German and uh not being able any more to get out of his way, I greeted him and he was not in a very good mood and uh said, ah...and I asked him don't you feel well?</span> <span id="s535">You know, I'm a physician so I ask people how they feel and he said oh, I was asked by the...to take part in this, to surround the ghetto in in Czortkow, to which I said uh...apparently he knew what is going to happen to the Jews because then I asked him, do you let anybody escape?</span> <span id="s536">He said, escape?</span> <span id="s537">My orders there to surround.</span> <span id="s538">I I don't know what uh...I didn't uh take part in anything but...then he said, ____________________.</span> <span id="s539">I don't know how the German people will ever be able to to uh, not to answer for it..._________, to be responsible for what they did.</span> <span id="s540">It remin...it remains with me even today after so many years.</span> <span id="s541">Anyway, coming back to the ghetto after the aktion, I had decided to form for myself a boivka (ph), a fighting group, and I recruited for it a woman and her husband by the name of Padover.</span> <span id="s542">Why did I..</span> <span id="s543">.</span> <span id="s544">it was an energetic woman in her late thirties or beginning forties who was, who grew up in the area.</span> <span id="s545">She knew every area in the...and when she talked to me about it, I knew that she really was very familiar with it.</span> <span id="s546">She had, she had uh uh contacts with farmers.</span> <span id="s547">She knew farmers.</span> <span id="s548">She had contact with farmers who were uh her friends from before and I felt it was a good...she introduced me also to a very tall, six foot two, young, eighteen year old Jewish fellow whom I recruited also because they were survivors of what had happened in the ghetto and I had decided to go into the woods.</span> <span id="s549">Uh to make a long story short, when we met in the woods at our hiding place, it turned out to be a complete fiasco.</span> <span id="s550">Mr. Padover had decided meantime...he showed up at our meeting place with an eighteen year old kid.</span> <span id="s551">I said where is your wife, because the reason why I had recruited him was his wife, not he.</span> <span id="s552">And he said ah she's too old for me.</span> <span id="s553">The young man who had said he's going to bring a brother brought a fourteen year old kid...thin...I don't know if he was uh maybe ninety-five pounds...thin...you know, every uh wind uh draft would would...my whole fighting group turned out to be really nothing.</span> <span id="s554">Anyway we found...we had made an appointment with the Ukrainian fellow who took us to a place uh where he fed us really and uh hid us and two weeks or ten days later, there was an alarm.</span> <span id="s555">We had to run.</span> <span id="s556">During running there was panic.</span> <span id="s557">We ran in different directions.</span> <span id="s558">We lost each other and Gusti and I ended up together out in the woods.</span> <span id="s559">Meantime it was cold.</span> <span id="s560">We didn't have where to go.</span> <span id="s561">I'm reminded now the promise which Mr. Zarevski, the husband that Pole had told me...it took me one and a haLf days to get.</span> <span id="s562">He was in a little town...I think Smikow (ph), I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s563">He lived in a hut outside...I knew where he lived because he had brought me to see his wife there and uh was hard to get there.</span> <span id="s564">It was outside...he he tried to keep a very low profile, being Polish and I..</span> <span id="s565">.</span> <span id="s566">then later I understood why.</span> <span id="s567">Because it turned out he was a member of the underground, the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s568">When I knocked on his window it must have been four o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s569">Uh I heard somebody moving inside.</span> <span id="s570">Finally he opened and then I told through the window who it is.</span> <span id="s571">I uh...he opened and let us in.</span> <span id="s572">We were exhausted.</span> <span id="s573">He gave us some food.</span> <span id="s574">He let us sleep there and then he said, look, uh uh this is a bad place for you to stay.</span> <span id="s575">I didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s576">To me it looked like a very good place.</span> <span id="s577">But he said this is...I have to find a hiding place for you.</span> <span id="s578">A week later or six days later, he said I found somebody.</span> <span id="s579">He took us on a tour which lasted probably three hours, way into the woods, and he, on the way there, he said the furster (ph)...furster is a a uh uh Polanization or Ukrainization of the German word ______.</span> <span id="s580">It means a man who takes care of the woods, of uh uh...he's a representative of the of the county, in the woods.</span> <span id="s581">He sort of uh uh surveys the cutting of trees where they ma...where they collect wood for the winter.</span> <span id="s582">He he uh sells or gives the wood out to certain people in certain communities.</span> <span id="s583">He's an official person.</span> <span id="s584">We met him there and he again said...we came there.</span> <span id="s585">The first thing we ate something after these three and a half hours of walk and uh he was very respectful toward Mr. Zaresvki, as if he would be his superior.</span> <span id="s586">I didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s587">Whatever he...and that he knew about us already and he said yes, I have a place for you, but not here where he lived...he he was with his wife there.</span> <span id="s588">He was a rep..</span> <span id="s589">.</span> <span id="s590">he spoke Polish with Mr. Zarevski.</span> <span id="s591">He had certain loyalties toward the previous administration because he was the official representative of the Polish uh community there.</span> <span id="s592">He was an employee of the State, not of the county, and...but he was very respectful toward Mr. Zarevski, and they brought us to a barn some four kilometers far in the woods, an empty building - hay with an at...so-called attic, you know, and uh we...in the attic there was something which looked like a bed as if somebody had slept.</span> <span id="s593">I understood why he brought us there.</span> <span id="s594">That means if somebody would find out that Jews are there, he could say he didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s595">He said he will visit us every week.</span> <span id="s596">He gave us a couple of uh blankets and he gave us some food.</span> <span id="s597">______ he said he's going once a week to visit us, night time, and really uh it happened.</span> <span id="s598">For three weeks he came every week, brought us food.</span> <span id="s599">One day I saw around six o'clock...it was already slightly dark...two figures coming.</span> <span id="s600">It turned out to be Zarevski and Janek.</span> <span id="s601">_______ was the name of the person, and uh uh uh Zarevski or Zaremski, said I want to talk to you personally.</span> <span id="s602">My wife...so _______, the first thing, my wife uh sepa...stayed aside and he talked to me, he said to me uh, you know, you come from Romania, right?</span> <span id="s603">How well do you speak Romanian?</span> <span id="s604">I said perfect, I said.</span> <span id="s605">He said well, do you think you would like to join a fighting organization?</span> <span id="s606">Join a fighting...?</span> <span id="s607">Certainly, why not.</span> <span id="s608">Which is it?</span> <span id="s609">He said it's out near Armia Kraiowa.</span> <span id="s610">We are under the the uh government of the in the, the Polish government.</span> <span id="s611">He said I'll come in a week back.</span> <span id="s612">I am going to discuss with my superiors.</span> <span id="s613">I told him about you, and I gave...I have a plan.</span> <span id="s614">He says I'm not going to talk to you yet about my plan.</span> <span id="s615">He came back uh came back the next week and said, well, my plan seems to be a good one.</span> <span id="s616">It still has to be approved by the Center (ph).</span> <span id="s617">My next question was, if I join you, will I be armed?</span> <span id="s618">He said everybody in this organization has a gun.</span> <span id="s619">_____.</span> <span id="s620">He said I trust you.</span> <span id="s621">Uh then he left.</span> <span id="s622">He walked some three, four hundred feet, then he turned around and came back, took out a pistol, a German luger, and said here, you have this.</span> <span id="s623">Keep it.</span> <span id="s624">It had a full mag...I checked...it had a full magazine.</span> <span id="s625">It was a 9 milimeter.</span> <span id="s626">They called it the German Parabellum______.</span> <span id="s627">It was a a uh a fine gun with a long.</span> <span id="s628">Anyway, he came back a week later and he said, look, uh...oh yes, meantime we were...it was December, beginning of January...we were '42-'43.</span> <span id="s629">The...apparently the furster had a radio because he heard BBC.</span> <span id="s630">He told us about the Battle of Stalingrad which takes place and the Russians are beating the hell out of of the Germans and the Germans...in that time he said, he told me about Marshall Paulus who wants to uh to uh to...was picked up by by BBC.</span> <span id="s631">He he gets, asks the permission of Hitler to to uh to give up and Hitler says no, until the last man so our mood was...right now I was going to be a member of a fighting organization.</span> <span id="s632">I had a gun.</span> <span id="s633">You don't know what a gun in that time meant for a Jew.</span> <span id="s634">To have a gun, to be able to protect yourself.</span> <span id="s635">You couldn't...it it was worth its own weight in gold and here I got it without...I had you know...and the news about the Battle of Stalingrad...it was good news.</span> <span id="s636">Our morale was...anyway it didn't last for a long time.</span> <span id="s637">Now...he told me now about his plan.</span> <span id="s638">He said I'm going to be a courier for them (ph).</span> <span id="s639">He said the contacts of the army of _____ takes place only through Sweden and it is very hard because they have to go to Gdansk, from Gdansk to smuggle, to...by boat, to Sweden and from there to...and from Sweden they have no problem getting to England but because the Polish government in exile is direct organization from England and the contacts through through Sweden is bad.</span> <span id="s640">He still is waiting but his immediate superior in Lamberg (ph), in in...had said it's a wonderful idea.</span> <span id="s641">He should take me in so...and I speaking Romanian because Romania had a large group of refugees from Poland who had run away, military people, civilians, and there was an active Polish organization direct in charge of the Polish refugees in Romania.</span> <span id="s642">That means he had a a good in for Romania to get in touch with with England was much easier.</span> <span id="s643">Uh Romania at that time had contacts with Turkey and through Turkey they could they could get...so he felt I was the ideal uh person to make the contact.</span> <span id="s644">It...a week later with _____ the furster came also.</span> <span id="s645">Almost two weeks later...it was the beginning I think of February or the end of February and he came back in panic.</span> <span id="s646">You have to leave immediately.</span> <span id="s647">Next day a Ukrainian police is...militia is coming there.</span> <span id="s648">He doesn't know why they are coming but he heard one militia man who had a a Polish mother, you know, who had still...had told him about it, and uh apparently also uh ____ was on the run.</span> <span id="s649">Something had happened.</span> <span id="s650">He didn't tell me what and I have to give him back the gun.</span> <span id="s651">I thought that the whole thing is...he's going to bring me to somebody else he had spoke.</span> <span id="s652">He brought me...we walked, we walked I think the whole night.</span> <span id="s653">I think he couldn't have brought us farther to a place which looked very good for me, for...uh to me.</span> <span id="s654">It was...it's a hiding place under a stable.</span> <span id="s655">Unfortunately, that stable had...the floor of the stable were boards and the boards had spaces between them, small spaces.</span> <span id="s656">There was a cow there, and when the weather was bad the cow didn't want to go out or wasn't taken outside, so when the cow had to urinate or to defecate there, especially to urinate, it came down like a, like a shower and you had to run to the side.</span> <span id="s657">Still you ended up getting some sprinkles of that urine and that urine had a smell and it impregnated what our clothes and after two or three weeks, it...we start to smell badly.</span> <span id="s658">You know, we hated ourselves.</span> <span id="s659">As a matter of fact a few weeks later Gusti broke out in general furuncolosys , furunculs uh small infections of the skin.</span> <span id="s660">She was so depressed.</span> <span id="s661">It hurt.</span> <span id="s662">She couldn't scratch it.</span> <span id="s663">It was itchy.</span> <span id="s664">It was infected.</span> <span id="s665">It took me probably...slowly, slowly by treating each infection infection separately, to clean it up, it took maybe two months.</span> <span id="s666">Meantime you had to go out night time and you couldn't get out night and every night to to uh to try to get rid, to take off the the clothes and you couldn't...and it was cold...you couldn't take off the clothes.</span> <span id="s667">You were cold.</span> <span id="s668">But you have still to air these clothes in order they should get dry to loose, because we ended up smelling terrible.</span> <span id="s669">Uh two months...it had one good thing.</span> <span id="s670">We had a built-in supply of milk.</span> <span id="s671">I learned to milk the cow.</span> <span id="s672">I had to be careful because whenever she milked the cow, she gave us half a cup of milk each, but it wasn't enough, so I learned to try...Gusti was holding the cow and stroking her neck which the cow really liked very much and she got accustomed to Gusti stroking and I was milking her.</span> <span id="s673">In the beginning I tried...I didn't have a receptacle, you know, so I was trying to drink directly.</span> <span id="s674">You know, when you are hungry you do many things.</span> <span id="s675">But this was the built-in uh milk supply of that hiding place.</span> <span id="s676">The couple were under apparently Pole-friendly, Polish uh friendly to the Poles because the Furster never showed up again.</span> <span id="s677">I don't really know what had happened to him.</span> <span id="s678">Neither Zarevski nor the Polish Furster.</span> <span id="s679">They had brought us, but they were friendly to a degree.</span> <span id="s680">The husband was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s681">The wife was a mixture of Polish.</span> <span id="s682">She spoke well Polish...Maria...no...Anka (ph) was her name.</span> <span id="s683">Anka had...Gusti told her in order to give her...that she's a fine knitter.</span> <span id="s684">She's a good knitter.</span> <span id="s685">She saw her wearing an old pull-over she has.</span> <span id="s686">You know...let me have that pull-over.</span> <span id="s687">I'm going to take it apart.</span> <span id="s688">I'm going to wash the wool and knit for you a new one.</span> <span id="s689">She made her a new pull-over in three, two or three days and she was, Anka was delighted and she started to bring her more and more.</span> <span id="s690">Apparently she made it a business because she sold it for something or she exchanged it.</span> <span id="s691">She bartered it because uh Gusti was a very fast knitter.</span> <span id="s692">She was able to finish a pull-over in one and a half days working eight to ten hours and there was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s693">You know, we could go out only in the...and so it happens that in the spring or April or May, walking around by myself to air, to get a little fresh air and to get rid of that smell, that I happened and probably having strayed a little too far because I had strayed once too far and I got near a house and a dog started to bark.</span> <span id="s694">In small communities if one dog starts to bark, all the dogs in the whole community...and I started to run away because I had maybe fifty or sixty dogs start a whole...you know, naturally immediately their owners will come out to investigate what's going on, so this was bad because we could be found out and uh uh the stricter interdiction by our hosts were not to go too far, to stay...and I had impression while I walked...this must have been in April...it was already, or May uh that uh...oh yes...meantime because of that knitting business, the attitude of our hosts had had started to improve.</span> <span id="s695">It was only bad when they got drunk or had a fight, and usually then they uh then they had uh...they drank and they got a little high.</span> <span id="s696">They started to have a fight.</span> <span id="s697">It had to do with Polish-Ukrainian or I don't know because I didn't hear but there were times when he hit her and then she was yelling, but these were not good uh omens for us because uh if somebody would have found out that he was hiding Jews, he would, he could have been shot.</span> <span id="s698">Anyway, coming back, walking outside, I had the impression somebody is following me, and I went in circles, walking a little farther than usually, and I heard uh...really I was sure now somebody followed me because I heard...he must have stepped on on a on dry branches.</span> <span id="s699">I heard them uh the noise of uh branches until finally somebody told me from behind, hands up, _______, and...in Russian, and went through my pockets.</span> <span id="s700">I had a knife with me.</span> <span id="s701">They took my knife away and...he took my knife and not they.</span> <span id="s702">He took my knife away.</span> <span id="s703">Told me to lie down with my face down and started to inter...who I am and so I told him look, uh Romanian...now I told immediately I'm a Romanian physician, you know, and he said uh...he used the term evrei (ph) Evrei (ph) is a Russian term for Jews, but not derogatory.</span> <span id="s704">Uh it uh it means you are a Jew, but it's not a derogatory term.</span> <span id="s705">It's uh it's the way how in their, in the Russian passports you are being uh uh indicate your nationality.</span> <span id="s706">He wanted to know with who I am, where I am, how long I have been there, how uh...well, he said, uh I want to see...in next week I'm going to be here.</span> <span id="s707">I saw immediately he doesn't belong to the local Ukraine.</span> <span id="s708">I was afraid he might be a Banderovtzi (ph) from the Ukrainian uh organization which killed Jews.</span> <span id="s709">He was not.</span> <span id="s710">He didn't have the trizub.</span> <span id="s711">He uh he uh he had a a German uh uh sub-machine gun, a Schmeisser and uh didn't tell me...I asked him...he didn't answer.</span> <span id="s712">He says I would like to talk to, to see your wife.</span> <span id="s713">I want to see if it's correct.</span> <span id="s714">Alright.</span> <span id="s715">A week later or ten days later.</span> <span id="s716">.</span> <span id="s717">we had made an appointment.</span> <span id="s718">I brought Gusti there.</span> <span id="s719">What could I do.</span> <span id="s720">Yes, he said, no word to your house about me.</span> <span id="s721">I don't trust them.</span> <span id="s722">I don't know them.</span> <span id="s723">No word.</span> <span id="s724">And I came the uh first thing, when I came with Gusti to meet him, also night time, he looked at her, as much as he could see her in the dark.</span> <span id="s725">He said do you follow my orders.</span> <span id="s726">I didn't know what he meant.</span> <span id="s727">I said not to tell your host anything...orders, he said.</span> <span id="s728">So it was a military term, you know, and I didn't know...now he told us who he was.</span> <span id="s729">He said his name was Vasia.</span> <span id="s730">He is a part of an organ....of a parachute group which were uh parachuted near Tarnopol and they have to prepare the terrain for a large group.</span> <span id="s731">He

Petre Hreniuk lived near the Zastavna (ph).</span> <span id="s783">Now my sister was the uh in charge of a pharmacy in Zastavna and I knew the area.</span> <span id="s784">I had...I knew the area from Czernowitz, how to travel to Zastavna, but I never had done from _____ and Zastavna was not far from from uh the border.</span> <span id="s785">All those parts...you could reach it by uh walking.</span> <span id="s786">He said you have to meet Petre Hreniuk and uh try to to uh...he should hide fifty of our fighters.</span> <span id="s787">I said alright.</span> <span id="s788">You have to leave tomorrow.</span> <span id="s789">He told the couple, the woman of the...uh he went to the woman.</span> <span id="s790">She came over and he said you have to prepare for me uh food I should take from, for a week, ten days.</span> <span id="s791">He felt, he figured out...took me much longer because I did the biggest stupidity of my life while I was ______.</span> <span id="s792">It was...he told that he is...the woman knew the area and she gave me a contact where I could...I had to uh to cross the Dniester.</span> <span id="s793">The Dniester is the border between...the river Dniester is the border between Poland and uh the General Government in the northern part of Bukovina.</span> <span id="s794">Meantime the Bukovina had nearly occupied by the Romanian and was a Romanian administration there.</span> <span id="s795">I..</span> <span id="s796">.</span> <span id="s797">there...the crossing of the Dniester was no problem.</span> <span id="s798">It was a drought.</span> <span id="s799">The Niestra was very uh very uh shallow and I am a swimmer.</span> <span id="s800">I..</span> <span id="s801">.</span> <span id="s802">so it didn't uh affect.</span> <span id="s803">I came to Petre Hreniuk who...uh when I gave him uh...there was a uh a..</span> <span id="s804">.</span> <span id="s805">I had to tell him who sent me, everything.</span> <span id="s806">Finally he he knew about it.</span> <span id="s807">I think somebody else might have told him because he knew about the group.</span> <span id="s808">The group had had uh uh parachuted near Tarnapol (ph), between Tarnapol and Chotkow (ph) near Skalat (ph).</span> <span id="s809">They had first, while they had parachuted they had immediately a a uh a run-in with the Ukrainian police which brought Germans from Borszczow, from Czortkow and from from uh ________, to help them fight.</span> <span id="s810">And this is how the...but they they proceeded slowly, slowly toward _______ which that triangle and finally they destroyed it.</span> <span id="s811">But meantime all the way they had to fight the Germans and the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s812">It uh...I wanted to tell you something else.</span> <span id="s813">Yes...in that time before I left, uh Vasia had told me that the group which had parachuted had formed a Jewish echelon.</span> <span id="s814">They called it I think Third (ph) Echelon, formed by Jewish refugees whom they had picked up.</span> <span id="s815">But he said you are not going to to join them.</span> <span id="s816">You will have a special task.</span> <span id="s817">You'll be a courier.</span> <span id="s818">Here I was again...uh uh uh engaged to be a courier by a different group uh similar to do almost a similar task like for the Polish uh underground.</span> <span id="s819">They...I came to Hreniuk.</span> <span id="s820">Hreniuk when I told him fifty people he laughed.</span> <span id="s821">He said uh it, it's impossible.</span> <span id="s822">He said the only thing what I could hide, the only people, five...maybe six people.</span> <span id="s823">He says...how should I feed them.</span> <span id="s824">They...uh in...not far from him there was a little town where ___ Romanian gendarmerie post.</span> <span id="s825">He says you cannot hide fifty people easily in this here.</span> <span id="s826">You you need food.</span> <span id="s827">You know these are fifty human beings who who eat, drink.</span> <span id="s828">If you...he says five people I could make.</span> <span id="s829">While I was there eating and drinking...he he served me food and really he was very friendly.</span> <span id="s830">Uh the only thing is this is what he can do.</span> <span id="s831">Not more.</span> <span id="s832">Suddenly it came in my mind...here I am not far from Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s833">Why can't I go to Czernowitz?</span> <span id="s834">I forgot completely, and I I grew up there.</span> <span id="s835">That there is the River Prut which...who has a bridge over it which, when you come from the north...I have completely forgotten.</span> <span id="s836">And I decided to go on a Sunday to Czernowitz knowing that the market in Czernowitz takes place on Monday always.</span> <span id="s837">And there will be farmers who go to market.</span> <span id="s838">Suddenly I..</span> <span id="s839">.</span> <span id="s840">on the road I pick....I was picked, I picked up a couple who were on a little...who were taking food to Czernowitz to see at the market and they gave me a ride and I was sitting with them, talking with them.</span> <span id="s841">It was early...four, five o'clock in the morning and suddenly we arrived at the bridge and at the bridge there were Romanian uh soldiers.</span> <span id="s842">It was not the...the real bridge had been destroyed and there was a pontoon bridge.</span> <span id="s843">I couldn't go back anymore.</span> <span id="s844">I had told this couple that I have an appointment with the school uh revisor in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s845">I looked like a farmer but I spoke quite a Romanian and uh these were Ukrainian uh farmers, Ruthenians, and they...the soldiers didn't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s846">They...he asked the farmer in the...who was sitting in the front with uh guiding the horses...he said uh, market?</span> <span id="s847">He said, yeah.</span> <span id="s848">He let us pass.</span> <span id="s849">Anyway, I I was ready to uh to to collapse uh so emotional.</span> <span id="s850">Anyway I found myself on the other side.</span> <span id="s851">I went, knowing Czernowitz quite well, I went through side...uh you have to go uh uh _____ street, Banhofstrasse which is a very uh steep uh street that the tramway goes up toward the center of the city.</span> <span id="s852">I'm in side street, Morariu strasse, and I came to my street where I was born and to tell you the truth, when I saw the house, Marshall Fosh number 9, I I looked at it.</span> <span id="s853">I looked at it and yes...and on the way there I had seen a few people with the Juden star (ph).</span> <span id="s854">They didn't have what we had in Poland, that uh uh white band with the blue star.</span> <span id="s855">They had the yellow star here and uh I tried to pass, uh to keep a low profile as much as possible.</span> <span id="s856">While I was in my street I saw coming a former girlfriend of mine with a Romanian officer, arm in arm, and uh didn't even uh spent one look at me.</span> <span id="s857">I was dressed like a farmer.</span> <span id="s858">I recognized her.</span> <span id="s859">She didn't even look at me and then I decided I did enough stupidity coming in to the city and uh I still have to go back and...oh yes...what was very important, Vasia had told me my wife is going to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s860">He said it's the...if I let Gusti go with you you'll never come back and he was right.</span> <span id="s861">And yes...I had to leave my gun there.</span> <span id="s862">He said you cannot take the gun of course.</span> <span id="s863">It might uh, it might induce you to be, to start a fight or something not good.</span> <span id="s864">Better if you don't have a gun.</span> <span id="s865">And he was probably right.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Were your parents still alive at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No.</span> <span id="s868">My father and my sister, I found out later that they, you know, generally from the community of around a hundred thousand Jews, around eighty-five thousand were deported to Transnistria Moghilev and the centers in Transnistia.</span> <span id="s869">The area uh uh...Hitler gave the Romanian an area beyond the Dniester between the Dniester and the Bugr rivers, which the Romanians called Transnistria, where hey deported a few hundred thousand Jews and uh from Czernowitz they took eighty-five thousand.</span> <span id="s870">My sister was declared uh...eight uh fifteen thousand Jews remained in Czernowitz which were declared uh important for the economy of the city, as a former (ph) city, and she got a permit to remain in the city.</span> <span id="s871">She remained with my father.</span> <span id="s872">I didn't know who lived in the house.</span> <span id="s873">I didn't dare to go in not knowing who...it happens that my father and Melane (ph) stayed in that house where I was in front of that house looking at it.</span> <span id="s874">I didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s875">I didn't ask anybody.</span> <span id="s876">I tried to to to to sneak by and finally decided...oh yes...I had asked the, that couple with the horse who had brought me to Czernowitz when they returned and they said ah between two and three o'clock.</span> <span id="s877">I said do you have...but he said we have no watch.</span> <span id="s878">Neither did I.</span> <span id="s879">So I figured out more or less...I went back to what the Prut, toward the river where I fell asleep for a couple of hours because meantime it was only ten o'clock, and around twelve o'clock or twelve thirty I was back at the place where we had decided where we meet.</span> <span id="s880">They were already there waiting.</span> <span id="s881">They had sold what they had to sell, and they were wait...they were ready to leave even without me, but since I came earlier I still found them.</span> <span id="s882">We crossed the pontoon bridge again.</span> <span id="s883">Nobody asked any questions, and I..</span> <span id="s884">.</span> <span id="s885">when I came back to north toward the border I decided to go back to Hreniuk and to rest a little bit for a day, which I did, and this time he was quite hostile.</span> <span id="s886">He wasn't very...he said what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s887">I told him I was in Czernowitz and he said you went to Czernowitz?</span> <span id="s888">Aren't you afraid?</span> <span id="s889">I didn't tell him how stupid I was doing it, but uh I couldn't resist.</span> <span id="s890">I had completely...it was an emotional reaction which I couldn't explain.</span> <span id="s891">Coming back to Poland I uh told him...I found him in terrible shape, terrible.</span> <span id="s892">He had a wound on his his...two feet...he had walked probably a lot.</span> <span id="s893">He said he's trying to make...he came to say goodbye to us.</span> <span id="s894">He left me the gun.</span> <span id="s895">He told me the order of the day, of General Kovpak is every soldier got fifty bullets.</span> <span id="s896">He says since I had a Belgium gun, they didn't have...I got only what was in the magazine.</span> <span id="s897">He says you have twelve.</span> <span id="s898">Remember - the order of the day is forty-nine bullets for the Germans, one for yourself.</span> <span id="s899">Don't give up.</span> <span id="s900">That means for you it's only eleven for the Germans and one for you.</span> <span id="s901">I never got a chance to shoot it.</span> <span id="s902">But it uh...I mean to use it.</span> <span id="s903">He left me the gun, took...he embraced us both.</span> <span id="s904">He says I don't know if we'll ever see again.</span> <span id="s905">He was very...he was in terrible shape because he had to walk hundred plus kilometers.</span> <span id="s906">He told us that the front was now between Harkov and Kiev .</span> <span id="s907">Kiev...I think Kiev was liberated already.</span> <span id="s908">It was between Kiev and Kamenets Podolski, and the Germans are retreating but he said keep a low profile.</span> <span id="s909">Watch out for the Ukrainian, for the Banderoski, he said for the Nationalistic organization.</span> <span id="s910">The time were...the winter of '43-44 was a hard winter.</span> <span id="s911">We stayed with that couple.</span> <span id="s912">We had terrible problems.</span> <span id="s913">Problems mostly of food.</span> <span id="s914">Food was a a major item.</span> <span id="s915">The people had...I don't know...the nearer the front came to us, the friendlier the woman was but the more hostile the man was.</span> <span id="s916">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s917">Uh we dec..</span> <span id="s918">.</span> <span id="s919">we decided quite a few times to leave, but we didn't have a place where to hide.</span> <span id="s920">The area was hostile.</span> <span id="s921">The pop...population was hostile.</span> <span id="s922">So we stayed for them.</span> <span id="s923">Anyway when the...in in uh at the end of February the uh we saw already forerunners of the Red army and here our hosts suddenly got extremely friendly.</span> <span id="s924">They came out.</span> <span id="s925">They gave us a couple of new...for me a pair of new pants.</span> <span id="s926">They gave my wife a pair shoes.</span> <span id="s927">We took...uh say goodbye to them.</span> <span id="s928">They...and we started to make our way back toward Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s929">In the summer of '44 I decided to join the Polish army and uh I was brought by the Russian, uh one Russian _______ to what Poland...where the front was now in uh...Lublin (ph) was free.</span> <span id="s930">The suburb of Warsaw was Prague (ph)...not the Czech Praga but Praga of Poland is a suburb of Warsaw, was uh uh burning.</span> <span id="s931">There was an uprising, the Polish uprising, not the Jewish.</span> <span id="s932">Jewish took place in '43.</span> <span id="s933">The Polish uprising under uh General Bor Komorowski, which had failed.</span> <span id="s934">The German uh destroyed the city and we were looking at Warsaw burning.</span> <span id="s935">To tell you the truth, we didn't mind Warsaw burning.</span> <span id="s936">There was a feeling of...in spite of the hotilit...of the fact that I was now a Polish officer - in that time I was uh I was a Lieutenant, ear, nose and throat man.</span> <span id="s937">I uh...I forgot to mention when we to _____ (ph), he...I..</span> <span id="s938">.</span> <span id="s939">uh again one of these lucky incidents.</span> <span id="s940">I found that the person in charge of organizing the medical corps of the 2nd Army uh Army, Druga Army of Polska, the 1st Polish Army was formed in Russia.</span> <span id="s941">The 2nd Polish Army was formed on Polish territory.</span> <span id="s942">There was a man by the name of Lolek Cherzoff (ph), a former friend of mine, a Communist, who was a doctor who had studied in Prague.</span> <span id="s943">The only thing not in the...in in in uh German university but in the Czech university.</span> <span id="s944">It happened that I had met him in Prague, him and his wife.</span> <span id="s945">She was Anka Silvershatz from Lodz (ph).</span> <span id="s946">She wasn't there.</span> <span id="s947">He said she is un...still under the Germans.</span> <span id="s948">He knows only that she is alive and he is going to try her, try to get her out through the Polish underground but not the Armia Kraiowa.</span> <span id="s949">There were two Polish underground, the Armia Ludowa.</span> <span id="s950">That means the people's army, which was leftist.</span> <span id="s951">Here I was in, working in uh ______.</span> <span id="s952">I was clothed in the Polish uniform.</span> <span id="s953">I was an officer.</span> <span id="s954">I had found a friend who said where would you like to go, but they put into a group, an independent group, an ear, nose and throat and ophthalmology group with my own couple of trucks, with a group of four soldiers, four four nurses.</span> <span id="s955">We were...the Russians called this group gypsy outfit, Tziganski Outriat (ph), because that group was sent from hospital to hospital to operate the wounded and as soon as they finished their task.</span> <span id="s956">I was assigned in that time to a uh a city by...small city by the name of Shedlitz.</span> <span id="s957">Shedlitz is eighty kilometers south-east of Warsaw where the hospital to which I was assigned was called the 22nd Hospital for Light Wounded.</span> <span id="s958">The _____ ___________, in Polish.</span> <span id="s959">And here I stayed until January, until the front...Warsaw was liberated and we went west.</span> <span id="s960">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Tell me about liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: It is...you know, we asked ourselves many times...from...we at one point Gusti said to me...I think in '43...you know Fritz (ph), we probably are the only Jews around here.</span> <span id="s963">And it was a very frightening...and we started to discuss how come we are still alive, and in eight, uh in '44 when we were liberated, we we...I thought about it.</span> <span id="s964">I had no money.</span> <span id="s965">We were strangers.</span> <span id="s966">We were foreigners in Poland.</span> <span id="s967">Didn't know the language too well.</span> <span id="s968">I didn't know Ukrainian too well.</span> <span id="s969">I didn't know Polish too well.</span> <span id="s970">The only thing I was a physician and I came back to the term which they had called us always...the Romanian physician.</span> <span id="s971">Number one I was a physician.</span> <span id="s972">I was helpful to the population and I remembered what the priest in Belce, Father ______ had said in his sermon - with the uh local Jews you can do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s973">They regarded us as...yes, we were Jews but we were foreign Jews and we were helpful.</span> <span id="s974">I got, as a doctor as a matter of fact, a very good reputation as an obstetrician.</span> <span id="s975">I was not qualified to be an obstetrician.</span> <span id="s976">I got once a call to a delivery where the woman had been in labor three days, and I was very...I wanted...I was reluctant to go there because I felt I'm not qualified.</span> <span id="s977">When I came there I checked the woman.</span> <span id="s978">You know, you have to do something, and I made the diagnosis that the child had what they call in this country in obstetrics a rim (ph) of the cervix around the head.</span> <span id="s979">It was...that means it was almost fully dilated and while I was checking her she had one good contraction and out came a baby boy, yelling.</span> <span id="s980">The whole excitement with the delivery, number one it was a baby boy.</span> <span id="s981">It was a luck to be a crying baby, you know, and the doctor had just...they gave me the credit.</span> <span id="s982">I was just an innocent by-stander there but I got the reputation as a as a fine, good obstetrician.</span> <span id="s983">Undeserved I have to say, but I got that reputation and I certainly wasn't going to refuse the food which they gave me for that call, because we needed it very badly, so uh coming back why we survived.</span> <span id="s984">No money, no language, foreigners, but I was a doctor and this had helped.</span> <span id="s985">It had helped.</span> <span id="s986">Luck.</span> <span id="s987">I would say 99.9% the element of luck helped us in our survival.</span> <span id="s988">Who has the...basically, you needed only a couple of people or one person to find who is friendly toward you.</span> <span id="s989">I met Mr. Zarevski from the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s990">He was going to use me for his purpose as a courier, you know, to Romania, but I had somebody who stood, who who who trusted me.</span> <span id="s991">Somebody who wanted to help.</span> <span id="s992">True, I should do things for them, but who, where in the world do you find such a a uh lucky person.</span> <span id="s993">Number two, Vasia_.</span> <span id="s994">He picked me up.</span> <span id="s995">I didn't look, I didn't know him, and again, how well do you know Russian?</span> <span id="s996">How well do you know the northern part of Bukovina, because from there we were to get to the border with no problem, you know.</span> <span id="s997">You could.</span> <span id="s998">They, they had contact with people, but beyond they...you know, they needed somebody...here there was somebody who who could manage and I felt in that time I could manage and then I was young, was in pretty good shape.</span> <span id="s999">I was always a sportsman.</span> <span id="s1000">Uh I wouldn't say I was adventurous, but I was daring to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s1001">Why was I daring?</span> <span id="s1002">Because I had to.</span> <span id="s1003">I had to.</span> <span id="s1004">How many times in our, in our uh uh ______ in the woods, I came to a point, it's right and left.</span> <span id="s1005">There is no sign where it says where to go.</span> <span id="s1006">There were no people there to ask where to go.</span> <span id="s1007">Luck.</span> <span id="s1008">Luck, again, again.</span> <span id="s1009">Many times when I went to uh wrong I had to go back and go, you know, because it uh that part led me into a little community and we tried to stay away from communities.</span> <span id="s1010">The population was hostile.</span> <span id="s1011">You needed only one or two persons who were friendly, who were able to...or not able...willing.</span> <span id="s1012">99.9% luck.</span> <span id="s1013">That if they caught us, there was no question.</span> <span id="s1014">We had left our friends.</span> <span id="s1015">Doctor Gabriel Zinreich still in Korolovka and they hoped, they felt that what I'm doing and Gusti is, has no chance.</span> <span id="s1016">I knew that my chances were uh small, but my point of view was I'm going to try.</span> <span id="s1017">At least try.</span> <span id="s1018">To give in without trying, I wasn't going to do it.</span> <span id="s1019">No.</span> <span id="s1020">And uh as uh you know, it's the results which count and uh coming to this country, I tried, we tried to push that experience aside.</span> <span id="s1021">Very very uh uh convinced that we...in order to grow roots in this country, we have to put our experience and not to think about it.</span> <span id="s1022">Many things have to be accomplished.</span> <span id="s1023">Very eagerly a family, and when we found...Gusti had seven pregnancies and she, in these seven pregnancies...she had no problem getting pregnant.</span> <span id="s1024">She had problems carrying the baby.</span> <span id="s1025">She...the first baby uh was six months, then five and a half months, four and a half months...but we are talking not about the times today where you have a well-equipped pre uh uh...a baby with a premature nursery.</span> <span id="s1026">In that time they didn't have premature nursery.</span> <span id="s1027">We had one baby alive in 1971, and the baby...the chief of the anesthesia department came to me and said Fred, we know your history.</span> <span id="s1028">Uh you lost so many...uh the baby was two and a half pounds.</span> <span id="s1029">It...a two and a half pound baby in that time...I recessitated the baby myself.</span> <span id="s1030">As an anesthesiologist I am equipped to do it and it was a baby with a good sucking reflex and some and I wanted to keep...if I could have kept that baby even in my hospital, it was a hospital in Brooklyn, St. John's Street and, or St. John's Avenue, and uh it uh it may have survived.</span> <span id="s1031">He convinced me to send the baby to Baby's hospital.</span> <span id="s1032">He said this Presbyterian hospital, the finest hospital in New York, and there in order to to feed the baby they _____ the baby.</span> <span id="s1033">They put a tube and, but again, here we are in 1951.</span> <span id="s1034">The tube was not uh...it was a polyethylene tube and in that time they may have been short of polyethylene tubes because they they uh uh sterilized it, by changing every second or third day, by boiling it.</span> <span id="s1035">Polyethylene uh in that time when you boil it, it gets stiff like a board.</span> <span id="s1036">And in their uh in their uh procedures they perforated the stomach of the baby, and while they were feeding the baby the the belly of the baby got bigger and bigger and one day I get a call from the chief resident.</span> <span id="s1037">He was a Swedish uh resident.</span> <span id="s1038">He said Dr. Bernard, we'll have to operate on the baby.</span> <span id="s1039">I say why do you have to operate...it was five days later, or six days later.</span> <span id="s1040">She said we took an x-ray.</span> <span id="s1041">We put some uh some uh radio-opaque material, and we found the tube was not in the stomach but was in the abdominal cavity.</span> <span id="s1042">That means you have a perforated stomach.</span> <span id="s1043">They operated on the baby, and was a healthy, fighting baby, and uh but small, premature, and uh the baby survived surgery for two days and died of generalized ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1045">We're at the end of the tape.</span> <span id="s1046">We'll stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: I would like to mention a uh an event which occurred to me in 1943, which really didn't make sense to me uh in that time but it came so spontaneous.</span> <span id="s1052">Gusti and I were standing outside our uh our uh hiding place, uh some two hundred, three hundred feet away from it, and there was a (ph) in front of, to the right, to the left of the trees, and on that (ph) there was a shepherd with...I don't know if they were sheep.</span> <span id="s1053">It may have been uh goats, but it was such a pastoral scene that I started to sing...I started to sing a song by Schubert (ph), Shafer's klage lied (ph)_.</span> <span id="s1054">This is uh uh the shepherd's uh song, but he's complaining, you know.</span> <span id="s1055">And I knew the words from a child, that ___________ _______, and so on and so on, and I was singing it.</span> <span id="s1056">Gusti turned around.</span> <span id="s1057">She looked at me and said, I don't know...we are not only refugees.</span> <span id="s1058">We are so much of zurah (ph).</span> <span id="s1059">We have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1060">We don't know what's going...and here you are standing and singing Schubert's ______ uh Shafer's klage lied.</span> <span id="s1061">I said it it it brought back something here which I cannot explain but to be in the middle of of that woods...without Jews, you know, where the the area is Juden rein (ph) and to start singing a Schubert song...there must be an emotional uh substrata which which had its effect.</span> <span id="s1062">Uh I would like to come back to the element of evaluation of the attitude of the Red Army.</span> <span id="s1063">It is something which we found, and we discussed it in the Pole...while in the Polish Army among ourselves...we were a group of Jewish physicians there and uh when the Ger...the Red Army went back in 1941 under the uh German pounding, they...it was an army...</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Mr. Bernard, we're going to run out of so much time...we'd want to discuss the liberation and your coming to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I see.</span> <span id="s1066">Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Sorry to do that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s1069">Uh...coming to the United States as uh we came in the winter of '49-'50.</span> <span id="s1070">It was a cold winter for us.</span> <span id="s1071">We were new in this country.</span> <span id="s1072">We had to learn a language.</span> <span id="s1073">I had to prepare myself to to to pass an English exam, which I did after three months, and I had to submit my credentials to the Department of Education in Albany.</span> <span id="s1074">I was admitted to the to take the exam uh without an internship because I had graduated before 1940 and I could show that I had a residency of two and a half years in uh ear, nose and throat and _____ surgery.</span> <span id="s1075">Uh I took the exam.</span> <span id="s1076">I was lucky to pass the first time and uh after a year only in this country I found myself to have the license to practice medicine but I felt I would like to go into an American hospital to take an internship, and during the internship I really fell into anethethsia which in that time was a new specialty uh with all the challenges and uh since I liked challenges in life always I felt I might find, I may find in this specialty uh more satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1077">I spent the last forty years or thirty-nine years in this country in the operating room.</span> <span id="s1078">I uh...my work has been found to be quite satisfactory.</span> <span id="s1079">I was lucky to be uh to be uh nominated director of a department since 1961.</span> <span id="s1080">I uh...when I retired in 1985, uh from the from the practice of medicine, having arrived at the age of seventy-three and uh at Saint uh Saint uh Saint Joseph's Hospital in Queens uh the depart...the hospital administration was very appreciative of my of my uh, not of my retirement but of my actions.</span> <span id="s1081">They gave me a very as every retiree, a golden watch and uh they uh rented, uh the staff rented a uh yacht, the Riveranda (ph).</span> <span id="s1082">Invited the whole staff of the hospital and we traveled, you know, around Manhattan, so it was really a very appreciative gesture.</span> <span id="s1083">Uh I had the...I invited...my family was invited to that retirement party and uh I really cherished that thought.</span> <span id="s1084">During these thirty-nine years, I would say I uh performed probably close to over twenty thousand procedures.</span> <span id="s1085">Uh I uh handled probably seventy percent of our staff, doctors, families...we had a staff of around four hundred physicians and uh unfortunately in 1970 I lost my first wife to uh cancer of the breast.</span> <span id="s1086">Adele (ph) happened to be a neighbor of ours and our children grew up together.</span> <span id="s1087">She had two sons, has two sons and my two adopted children, Robert and Linda, grew up together with her children.</span> <span id="s1088">We found ourselves uh, you know, being thrown together in '74 and uh got married in '77.</span> <span id="s1089">Adele retired from her work.</span> <span id="s1090">She was a college professor.</span> <span id="s1091">She taught education and
