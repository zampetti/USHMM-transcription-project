<p><span id="s143">Q: So you might be already there without even knowing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: As a matter of fact –</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: You probably are.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: As a matter of fact, I show you.</span> <span id="s147">Before I left -- it's nonsense, but I took it with me because my daughter didn't see it.</span> <span id="s148">I was here last time on a trip, and last time we was here (inaudible) -- I already lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Is it a picture of your group?</span> <span id="s150">Is this it?</span> <span id="s151">Here's a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: See.</span> <span id="s153">There's my son.</span> <span id="s154">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s156">Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: And that's my picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: There you are.</span> <span id="s159">Oh, that's wonderful.</span> <span id="s160">And that's here or that's in your Kansas City –</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span> <span id="s162">That's here –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s164">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: -- In Washington.</span> <span id="s166">We had a group of 28 people, the mayor from the city.</span> <span id="s167">You See.</span> <span id="s168">Read this and –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: A delegation of business and community leaders from the Kansas City area including Mayor Emanuel Cleaver.</span> <span id="s170">Which one is he?</span> <span id="s171">Right on the end.</span> <span id="s172">Great.</span> <span id="s173">And then there was a dinner here, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s175">Oh, we had a couple days very much entertained and being (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Oh yeah?</span> <span id="s177">That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s178">That was great.</span> <span id="s179">I bet your daughter appreciated seeing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s181">I said I have to take this to –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s183">That's great.</span> <span id="s184">So they send you that to keep you updated, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s186">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Well, you are active.</span> <span id="s188">So you've already signed a release, and so I assume that this can be used for research purposes, that sort of -- great.</span> <span id="s189">So that's the formality.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: There's nothing there that cannot be used for anything.</span> <span id="s191">It's just I didn't -- I was not ready, let's say this way, to even come out and let my children be aware what -- I always give them my advice of life, and I teach them what can happen to people, how people lived before them, so on, so forth, back and forth, but I never tell them that that much, what I put in their mind.</span> <span id="s192">It's because what I went personally, because sometimes they wouldn't take it as – they would say, oh, you so prejudice because you went through this, but that's not necessarily true.</span> <span id="s193">It can happen.</span> <span id="s194">It just happened.</span> <span id="s195">But it was taken from me that I'm a strict mother, and I'm expecting them, I'm telling them, and I'm advising them, and they took my for granted.</span> <span id="s196">So maybe I had the wrong philosophy, maybe I dealt with them a different way, but now it's not too late.</span> <span id="s197">They already have -- I have grandchildren an age where, whatever, however they feel, they already raised my way.</span> <span id="s198">So it's a two-way.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We can see it both ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: It's not necessarily true, like I say, that I was so right how I handle it, but they didn't lost anything.</span> <span id="s203">My kids are very well aware of what life has to offer and know a lot of things.</span> <span id="s204">You can see my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s206">He's doing well.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: He's a lawyer.</span> <span id="s208">He's doing pretty good.</span> <span id="s209">He's involved in a lot of things that have to do with Judaism and life and other.</span> <span id="s210">He's trying to think of more than one thing only.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And I'm sure that's as a result of how you've raised him.</span> <span id="s212">So was there anything in particular that made you, besides his encouragement, that made you come forward and start talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No.</span> <span id="s214">I lost my husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: -- 15 months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: That's quite recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That was basically something I felt.</span> <span id="s221">There's more to it, why I keep this in my mind all the time, what I went through, what he went through and how we survived and what our life offered us.</span> <span id="s222">And God was good to us.</span> <span id="s223">We had something to be thankful and we want to teach the world to know that life is not -- nothing is forever and there is more to it.</span> <span id="s224">We cannot treat each other as we think we would like to.</span> <span id="s225">We have to treat them what's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s227">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: And gradually, like they say, if you put bread on the water it comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: That's true.</span> <span id="s230">Did you talk to each other, you and your husband, about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">We did.</span> <span id="s233">We always had conversations in a different way, just saying now listen, let's see.</span> <span id="s234">After all, we thought it's not worth it.</span> <span id="s235">We shouldn't fight for it.</span> <span id="s236">It's just such a miserable, uncomfortable life.</span> <span id="s237">It's so embarrassing to live that kind of life.</span> <span id="s238">Why fight?</span> <span id="s239">Then we come -- our answer was in our conversations after.</span> <span id="s240">It was worth it.</span> <span id="s241">True, we lost a lot, true, we went through a lot, but the ones we lost, we're here to talk for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: They died in vain, and we have to protect and talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: That's why it's important to make a testimony.</span> <span id="s245">I agree.</span> <span id="s246">I agree.</span> <span id="s247">So your date of birth, when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: June 1, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: January 1920?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Oh, June 1920.</span> <span id="s252">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I was born in Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And your name at birth was Maria Braun?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Braun.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And were there any other names that you used between 1933 and '45?</span> <span id="s259">Some people change their names if they went into hiding or anything.</span> <span id="s260">No?</span> <span id="s261">Did you grow up in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: No?</span> <span id="s264">Where did you grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Wodzislaw.</span> <span id="s266">Do you know how to spell this?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: I don't.</span> <span id="s268">Wish I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I was afraid.</span> <span id="s270">Give me a pencil.</span> <span id="s271">I have to -- there's going to be more names than this.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Right there.</span> <span id="s273">My father would be able to spell it.</span> <span id="s274">He speaks Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: You don't -- You read this as a T, and that's not a T.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s279">My name in Polish is Malgorzata, and it's got one of those in it.</span> <span id="s280">So that's in Poland.</span> <span id="s281">And that's the only town?</span> <span id="s282">Did you move at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: No.</span> <span id="s284">I was in Sosnowiec, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Another city.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Can you spell that one, too?</span> <span id="s288">Are they in central Poland?</span> <span id="s289">Okay.</span> <span id="s290">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: You will see on the glass windows those names.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Those names.</span> <span id="s293">Okay.</span> <span id="s294">And now I'm just going to ask you some questions about your life as a child before the war.</span> <span id="s295">What was the occupation of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: My father was in World War II.</span> <span id="s297">He was a -- he was -- their family was five brothers.</span> <span id="s298">He was the oldest one.</span> <span id="s299">And as a rule, in a very religious family, they cannot take more than one son to the Army.</span> <span id="s300">And he was the oldest one, so he went to World War I.</span> <span id="s301">He was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: In World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s304">He was captured as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s305">He was also hurt by some kind of bombing.</span> <span id="s306">He Had -- His left hand was ruined.</span> <span id="s307">Two fingers was cut off by whatever, and he had a mark on his back, back here.</span> <span id="s308">Or was it two?</span> <span id="s309">But it was pretty severe.</span> <span id="s310">As a matter of fact, he was there for two years in Russia.</span> <span id="s311">He was captured by the Russian, and he was there for two years.</span> <span id="s312">After he come back from there, he married in that little city of Wodzislaw, and from there they moved to Hanover, and that's where i was born, in Hanover.</span> <span id="s313">Of course, being involved in such a situation, the Polish government assigned, like here we have the veterans, what they get some kind of benefits, the Polish government give them also some kind of a benefit.</span> <span id="s314">And his benefit was like he had permission all legalized, certain things, what was not permitted to be sold in every store, like liquor, cigarettes, salt, sugar, tea, coffee.</span> <span id="s315">This was items, of course, to ask here now it's nothing, but in those years, 50 some years back, especially in small city, this was big demand and it was very difficult to get.</span> <span id="s316">He had a pension, too.</span> <span id="s317">He probably was pretty hurt and pretty much damaged since they give him all –</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: From the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: -- The privileges.</span> <span id="s320">Yes.</span> <span id="s321">Yes.</span> <span id="s322">But the point is so my mother -- and he was a religious person coming from a very religious home.</span> <span id="s323">So those people conducted more religion than cared about business, and my mother took over the business and she operated the store with all those imports.</span> <span id="s324">All those things has to come in from Germany, from Czechoslovakia, from Italy to Poland.</span> <span id="s325">Poland had most of them, more like wheat, potatoes and other sources of food, but all of those luxury things was coming from different countries, and we had the privilege of having open business for all those things.</span> <span id="s326">So that was our business.</span> <span id="s327">We lived very comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s328">My mother was a good business woman.</span> <span id="s329">She was operating all those things.</span> <span id="s330">We lived in a very good neighborhood in that city.</span> <span id="s331">We had a good clientele.</span> <span id="s332">As a matter of fact, the majority of our clientele was not even Jewish people, because we didn't live in an area where too many Jews was living.</span> <span id="s333">This was like the higher class of neighborhood.</span> <span id="s334">And we operated business for years.</span> <span id="s335">And it was three children, two brothers and me.</span> <span id="s336">We all went to school.</span> <span id="s337">We all graduate from -- of course, in Poland it was seventh grade.</span> <span id="s338">After seventh grade you graduate.</span> <span id="s339">And by that time you was 14 years old, because you start when you're seven.</span> <span id="s340">And after graduation I went back to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s341">I had two years of gymnasium.</span> <span id="s342">I couldn't go too much farther, because the time got where they start everything in Germany, and the rules and regulations start getting pretty bad for Jews.</span> <span id="s343">Even in '36, '37 we didn't feel that much, but there was already a lot of things going on in Germany with the Kristellnacht and other things.</span> <span id="s344">The news was coming this Hitler is took over the country, and it started getting very difficult for Jewish People, for particular business people, professional people, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Even though you didn't live in a neighborhood where there were primarily Jewish People living?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Doesn't make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: It didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Frankly, I tell you, if this is taped, what I'm saying, I cannot say what I want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No.</span> <span id="s351">I -- that would be a joke what I want to say, and I hate to put a joke in something like this.</span> <span id="s352">When you say you live in the neighborhood, so it's an answer for this.</span> <span id="s353">At the very end I tell you that answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s355">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I don't know where I am now.</span> <span id="s357">Anyway, so my school stopped.</span> <span id="s358">I went two years to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s359">I had one more year to finish and I could be a mathematic teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I went for math, but not allowing any more Jews to attend school, types of school.</span> <span id="s362">They cut it off in certain cities and certain schools.</span> <span id="s363">So I had to do something else.</span> <span id="s364">I stepped in and helped my mother to operate the business.</span> <span id="s365">And I was working with her and so was my brothers.</span> <span id="s366">One of my brothers was working as a bookkeeper in a little factory.</span> <span id="s367">What you call it?</span> <span id="s368">Steel, iron, stuff like this for building suppliers.</span> <span id="s369">He finished -- he actually didn't finish.</span> <span id="s370">He had the same problem.</span> <span id="s371">He couldn't finish everything, but he finish business school.</span> <span id="s372">So they hired him for this.</span> <span id="s373">So he worked there.</span> <span id="s374">I worked with my mother.</span> <span id="s375">My youngest brother was 14, 13, 14.</span> <span id="s376">When the world broke up he was 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Were you the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No.</span> <span id="s379">My brother was the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You were in the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I'm the middle, yes.</span> <span id="s382">After – we heard the bad news, but there was -- nothing specific was -- we didn't have any televisions or that type of information we have now, that much newspaper, news medias and everything goes with it.</span> <span id="s383">We had a radio.</span> <span id="s384">Every once in a while there was a broadcast, but we just could hear what they want us to hear.</span> <span id="s385">We couldn't have the true story.</span> <span id="s386">So the fact is that we lived with the idea of, oh, it will pass.</span> <span id="s387">It's just some kind of a bad situation right now, and we'll go back to history, if somebody is educated, you know, happened to so and so, and so and so, and all through life, all through thousands of years, but didn't pass so easy.</span> <span id="s388">1939, September 1, German Army stepped in our city, took over the city, and from that day on we seen killing, we seen unusually things what we never expected or lived through, i mean, as far as I can say.</span> <span id="s389">I never known that a person kills a person.</span> <span id="s390">Life was taken by God.</span> <span id="s391">This is something if you get old and you get sick you die.</span> <span id="s392">I was too young to understand this, you take a gun and -- we didn't know too much about guns.</span> <span id="s393">We know that you're going to die when you get a gun, but living in the city was peaceful.</span> <span id="s394">Life was just different, totally -- maybe now it's a little different, too, than my vision is, but 50 years ago –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s396">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: -- It was totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: So you were 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I was 19 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you notice, was there any clue before -- was there any Antisemitismus or Anti-Semitism or anything that gave you a clue about what the Germans were doing or –</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Like I say, we heard what they want us to hear.</span> <span id="s402">They didn't tell us they're killing people.</span> <span id="s403">They didn't tell us they're sending out anybody to camps.</span> <span id="s404">It was just stories going around.</span> <span id="s405">Of course, the Polish people was not very kind to us in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: They weren't?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No.</span> <span id="s408">There was hope – not exactly, if I want to say -- it's not exactly all the Polish people.</span> <span id="s409">You had a group of Volksdeutsche, and if you know what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: If you have a name -- like my name is Braun, so I could be German.</span> <span id="s412">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: If you married somebody from the German people and you're half German, or whatever, and - live in Poland, then you were Volksdeutsche, not a full-Deutsche.</span> <span id="s415">And those people was taken a lot advantage.</span> <span id="s416">They were stupid.</span> <span id="s417">There was not too many -- of course, in the city I lived, I have to say, it's farm towns.</span> <span id="s418">There's not too many educated people, not too many intelligent who understand it's a war and we're all going to suffer.</span> <span id="s419">It's going to be a lot of tragedy going on, but they say it's opportunity.</span> <span id="s420">They have a store, we take everything away from them; they have jewelry, we take everything; if they are bankers, whatever the case would be.</span> <span id="s421">And that was going on.</span> <span id="s422">And through the schooling there was the same thing.</span> <span id="s423">there were students in even a nice school where I used to go that was doing a lot of uncomfortable things for the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s424">Like they could take a match and put it under your coat.</span> <span id="s425">It was a joke, but they did this to a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: And the school where you went, it was an assimilated school?</span> <span id="s427">It wasn't particularly--</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No.</span> <span id="s429">I went to a school where it was Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s431">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: There was -- i went to another school.</span> <span id="s433">It was a Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: But that was all through my years, since five years, from 5 to 17 years, and I was graduating to the highest whatever, that's available.</span> <span id="s436">That school was just for Hebrew, nothing to do with any—</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: -- Public class schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And in the public school who were your friends would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I had quite a lot of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s441">As a matter of fact, i was very popular at school.</span> <span id="s442">I was a good student, that's number one, and I was well dressed, and that means a lot, even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: It sure does.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: And we lived in neighborhoods where I had most of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s445">We was doing our homework in my house.</span> <span id="s446">We lived in a pretty good size house.</span> <span id="s447">All the girls was coming to my house, and I was the popular one, do the mathematics for them, the painting, all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s449">You wanted to be a math teacher.</span> <span id="s450">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I was good in it.</span> <span id="s452">So i had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s453">The fact is that just in short time everything changed.</span> <span id="s454">When Hitler come in, they start --of course, he come in in '39, and right there and then start a little uncomfortable situation where Main Street was separated, trying to block off the windows of those people that live on Main Street, if they're Jewish families, so they have no view to the front.</span> <span id="s455">They have to have a view to the back.</span> <span id="s456">And questions start getting around in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s457">Oh, you see what done at the so and so, what done at the so and so?</span> <span id="s458">And children are children.</span> <span id="s459">What they understand?</span> <span id="s460">They say, uh-oh, something wrong with those people.</span> <span id="s461">They must be sick.</span> <span id="s462">There must be something.</span> <span id="s463">They didn't want to have a part of it, till we find out, all of us, the young and old, there is no -- it's not an easy thing.</span> <span id="s464">It's going to be more serious than that.</span> <span id="s465">By then it was too late.</span> <span id="s466">Of course, it was going on for months, and later on they start taking us out to work, my two brothers and me.</span> <span id="s467">They didn't use my father or my mother in '39, just used the children.</span> <span id="s468">We was working on the railroads.</span> <span id="s469">We was working on streets.</span> <span id="s470">Like, for example, here they have paved streets.</span> <span id="s471">In that part of the city they had like stones, brick stones and underneath sand.</span> <span id="s472">We'd throw in the stone and just make a street for them.</span> <span id="s473">And naturally this was good to take a bunch of kids like us.</span> <span id="s474">The women was throwing the sand and the men was putting in the stone.</span> <span id="s475">Of course, they didn't pay us, and we had to be there nine o'clock, eight o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s476">We had to group all in some kind of a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: How did they tell you that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: They'd go from house to house.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: They'd go from house to house?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: It was the Polish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: It was the Polish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: For sure.</span> <span id="s483">They had to cooperate with the German, otherwise they would be killed.</span> <span id="s484">When they take over the country then nobody has the power but them.</span> <span id="s485">And they want to live and was really cooperating for one reason.</span> <span id="s486">They want to exist.</span> <span id="s487">And the other was cooperating to make money or to take advantage of.</span> <span id="s488">And a lot did take advantage on it.</span> <span id="s489">And, of course, they paid the penalty later.</span> <span id="s490">That's another story.</span> <span id="s491">So from one thing to another, when they was through with one job they looked for another, whatever was necessary to do in that city.</span> <span id="s492">They send us away on the railroad, and we was working on – not far from us was a station, six miles from the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did you live at home while you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span> <span id="s495">We had to go there every morning to work and come back in the evening.</span> <span id="s496">Later on, when start getting a little bit more serious, they kept my brothers there, the two brothers, and they released me.</span> <span id="s497">And that was already in '40, in the middle '40.</span> <span id="s498">And the city start getting a little more crowded and food -- shortage of food.</span> <span id="s499">We had problems.</span> <span id="s500">People have to bake their own bread, because you couldn't buy too much, because the army used a lot and naturally didn't worry about anybody else but for them to be protected.</span> <span id="s501">And some of them shifted even, took stuff away, because they didn't have to pay anything if they went into a bakery or went to any place else.</span> <span id="s502">They didn't have to pay nothing.</span> <span id="s503">For example, one good day two of those Gestapos come into our store and they cleaned up everything.</span> <span id="s504">They had a truck in front of it, threw everything in the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">And I was stupid enough to stay in front of my mother, and I say -- my mother was taking away some -- everything was in bulk, not in packages.</span> <span id="s508">She was taking off from the bulk a little bit of tea, coffee, chocolate, whatever, things.</span> <span id="s509">And he said, no, no, she cannot do this.</span> <span id="s510">So I kind of asked him -- I asked him, why?</span> <span id="s511">She needs it.</span> <span id="s512">She has three children to feed.</span> <span id="s513">And he took a strap and cut on my face back and forth.</span> <span id="s514">I had stripes here for month, didn't heal.</span> <span id="s515">And he said you -- the people was telling me later I was lucky.</span> <span id="s516">He could have killed me, because he did this on other occasions.</span> <span id="s517">So there was no question about it that life was unsecure, no justice.</span> <span id="s518">You couldn't ask anybody why he's doing this to me, what I done wrong.</span> <span id="s519">I'm a normal person like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: They took everything you had.</span> <span id="s521">How did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: That's the second question.</span> <span id="s523">We -- like i say, we was -- that's what we had -- (tape went quiet for a moment.)</span> <span id="s524">We were still connected with farmers, and money, some money we had.</span> <span id="s525">Everything what we had on pekao we lost, because military generals took over it.</span> <span id="s526">It's like stocks and bonds, government things.</span> <span id="s527">That was pekao.</span> <span id="s528">And this was what my father was receiving for his pension, went straight to pekao.</span> <span id="s529">And, of course, this was military that claimed it, because nobody -- no jewish people can take out any more money from there.</span> <span id="s530">We were secured by all type of -- what everybody else.</span> <span id="s531">If you're wealthy, you have a little bit more clothes than somebody else, if you have some jewelry, some money in the house.</span> <span id="s532">In the old country not everybody put money in the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: You kept something for security.</span> <span id="s535">That for a while was -- we lived.</span> <span id="s536">We could buy food from the farmers.</span> <span id="s537">We could exchange for goods what we still had, till it got from one to another that they decided that we had to separate the jews from the gentiles and make the ghetto in the city.</span> <span id="s538">Everybody has to move in a few block circle, whatever it is, and give up their belongings and the houses.</span> <span id="s539">We had a big house.</span> <span id="s540">We had to move in in the quarters where our janitor was living and give this to the Germans.</span> <span id="s541">We lived there with seven people.</span> <span id="s542">We lived in two rooms till '42, when they start Ausweisung.</span> <span id="s543">They come in with Ausweisung, partial deportation, like take the young people, then take the older people, then clean up completely.</span> <span id="s544">They like to say -- in Germany they would say that Judenrein, if you know what that means.</span> <span id="s545">In 1942, September, we was contacted with some people that had authority, the Polish authority, because since we was in the business a lot of those people was buying on credit, never paid us, because -- of course, we didn't expect them to, but we had still contact with them.</span> <span id="s546">We talked to them.</span> <span id="s547">They tried to help us by virtual telling us stories.</span> <span id="s548">And one of those policemen was telling us there was jewish people involved in that police station.</span> <span id="s549">They come in and told us this.</span> <span id="s550">This was the final ausweisung, and everybody started looking where to get away.</span> <span id="s551">At that time my father was already taken away, and he sent to treblinkA: I didn't know where he was sent.</span> <span id="s552">We just know they took him away.</span> <span id="s553">When they took him away we were told he's in a working camp, he might stay in a working camp for a while, but we had no contact.</span> <span id="s554">There was no something you can write a letter to each other, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: You thought he would come back.</span> <span id="s556">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s558">And my two brothers was close enough, six miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: So they was working on that station.</span> <span id="s561">By that time, before the ausweisung come up, they come in and took them and took us, me, and send us to skarzysko.</span> <span id="s562">Skarzysko is a city.</span> <span id="s563">We had camps there, but not dead camps, working camps.</span> <span id="s564">They was making ammunition for the army.</span> <span id="s565">And we last over there a short while.</span> <span id="s566">And i tell you the story how we come out from there, but that's -- it's confusing because i don't follow up.</span> <span id="s567">When that happened, that contact told us what's going to happen, my husband come into the railroad.</span> <span id="s568">And i was working, and we was not married yet, and he told me so and so going to happen and they're going to send everybody away to some kind of camps where we're not going to see each other.</span> <span id="s569">We didn't know dead camps.</span> <span id="s570">We know camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: He says, but i was told the young couples have a chance.</span> <span id="s573">The older couples will go there, but young singles, they're separated.</span> <span id="s574">You don't know where you are.</span> <span id="s575">Young couples have a chance because they need workers, healthy workers.</span> <span id="s576">If we get married we have a better chance to survive and we could vouch for each other.</span> <span id="s577">I said, it's not a bad idea, but it's not the time to get married, and my father is not here any longer.</span> <span id="s578">I don't even know where he is.</span> <span id="s579">My brothers are here.</span> <span id="s580">Who is going to marry us?</span> <span id="s581">What kind of marriage you expect?</span> <span id="s582">He said, who cares?</span> <span id="s583">It's not a time to worry about anything extreme –</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: -- but just to be together.</span> <span id="s586">Oh, we know each other for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s588">Were you in school together?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s590">Yeah.</span> <span id="s591">No.</span> <span id="s592">He was older.</span> <span id="s593">He was seven years older than i was.</span> <span id="s594">He was watching me since i was a little girl, since i was going to public school, high school and every place else.</span> <span id="s595">We was very close friend as he's older, young man.</span> <span id="s596">And i was too young, so we just flirt but nothing serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: The head of textile business.</span> <span id="s599">They were very wealthy people, had a big operation in that city.</span> <span id="s600">And, of course, it happened to them, the same things.</span> <span id="s601">They come in and cleaned up all of their houses and their retail store and everything else.</span> <span id="s602">Again, like i say, that was the last things everybody worried, we had less clothes or we'll have less food, as long as they leave us alone, because for some reason other -- we didn't experience anything like this.</span> <span id="s603">And we was young, 19 years.</span> <span id="s604">I had friend for 19 years, and i know she wouldn't dream what i do in a time like this.</span> <span id="s605">I was smarter then than she smart now.</span> <span id="s606">Like the whole thing is not clicking, because i'm going from one to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I'm telling you a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s610">I wanted to know –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: It's just like sometimes you read a book and it just doesn't follow up.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: No.</span> <span id="s613">It's actually -- i mean, i'm hearing it for the first time, so it makes sense to me.</span> <span id="s614">I wanted to ask you about the two years that you lived in a small quarters with seven people.</span> <span id="s615">That was you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Me, my mother, my father and the two brothers, my two brothers and my mother's sister and aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Because they all lived in that -- we had a very, very big house of two blocks, and it's not just ours.</span> <span id="s619">It was left by a grandfather in the old country that, when they was building something, our family structure was built like a castle for the whole family.</span> <span id="s620">And there was my mother's sisters, brothers, uncles.</span> <span id="s621">Everybody has his own quarters, like five rooms, seven rooms, whatever the size of the family.</span> <span id="s622">And they took all of this away.</span> <span id="s623">My aunt was a widow.</span> <span id="s624">She was 83.</span> <span id="s625">And she has a sister.</span> <span id="s626">She was not married.</span> <span id="s627">She was married and lost her husband.</span> <span id="s628">So we all shared this two rooms, all seven of us.</span> <span id="s629">But that was not the worst.</span> <span id="s630">We shared something else, too, in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So that was two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Two years, yes, yes, we lived there.</span> <span id="s633">And then, when the ausweisung come out, there was like -- no.</span> <span id="s634">We got married.</span> <span id="s635">I'm going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Oh, so you did get -- okay.</span> <span id="s637">You got married, you said, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: We come back to the city.</span> <span id="s639">It was like, like i'm saying, six, seven miles away from the railroad.</span> <span id="s640">We come back to the city and there was – we found -- a few of our friends our age was with us in that group of young people, and we discussed this with them.</span> <span id="s641">And they decided, yes, it's a good idea.</span> <span id="s642">Four couples of us went to a specific place where they have services in the evening for somebody to marry us, because we didn't have the parents to do anything for us, and there has to be somebody to give us some kind of authority to be married.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: When we at that place there was not too many jewish people that have that authority.</span> <span id="s645">The only one that has authority, if you had to rule it, it could be a rabbi, if you understand what this is.</span> <span id="s646">There was -- one of those jews was one of my uncles.</span> <span id="s647">He was in the group of ten, and he married all four of us, the four couples.</span> <span id="s648">Of course, from the four couples i'm the only one alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s651">They all went.</span> <span id="s652">And after we was married we was called one good day.</span> <span id="s653">They come in -- the night before we heard in the city it's going to happen tomorrow, next day or whatever.</span> <span id="s654">And everybody -- we didn't hide because there was no place to hide.</span> <span id="s655">And if to hide we have to be prepared.</span> <span id="s656">Somebody has to give us some kind of places or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: At 7:00 in the morning – the night before we heard about.</span> <span id="s659">We were told it's going direct for a week or so.</span> <span id="s660">Seven, eight o'clock in the morning they knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s661">And my grandfather was living in the same house, also, and his wife.</span> <span id="s662">He was 83 or 84, also, in age.</span> <span id="s663">They knocked on his door.</span> <span id="s664">They come out.</span> <span id="s665">And she didn't see.</span> <span id="s666">She was elderly age and she didn't see, blind.</span> <span id="s667">She was holding his arm because she didn't see where she was walking.</span> <span id="s668">They're screaming, yelling, get out, get out, get out.</span> <span id="s669">And she hold him by his arm, not even dressed, and one of the gestapos knocked her over her head with a -- it was some kind of -- was it a gun or was it some kind of instrument.</span> <span id="s670">It was pretty serious.</span> <span id="s671">She fall on the floor.</span> <span id="s672">And he grabbed him, the old man was (indecipherable) because all the people shame, and throw them -- outside was a truck sitting right by the street, and on the truck.</span> <span id="s673">How long he last, it's -- just god knows.</span> <span id="s674">Could be an hour, could be – who knows, but they killed him or die.</span> <span id="s675">Anyway, he was going.</span> <span id="s676">And then they're going from house to house.</span> <span id="s677">Of course, they come to us.</span> <span id="s678">We got up, woke up, and they took us on -- the older people went right away on trucks.</span> <span id="s679">The younger people, they took us on plots, like they call the plaza, a spacious place where they can put everybody out and say left, right, left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s680">We didn't know who was the left, who was the right, but one went to camp, one went to Auschwitz or any other.</span> <span id="s681">I call in to look, call in to the whatever, the cnp (phonetic).</span> <span id="s682">Me and my husband were safe, but we know it's not going to help in a few weeks or months, whatever, after we work.</span> <span id="s683">Our health will come down and we're not going to be capable to go on with whatever, or whatever.</span> <span id="s684">Who can predict?</span> <span id="s685">We started looking for a way -- everything -- we had times like, you know, a second, a minute, a minute and a second.</span> <span id="s686">That's not anymore.</span> <span id="s687">I had a friend, a non-jewish friend.</span> <span id="s688">He was also in the polish army as a main person, an army man, and he was working in the underground in the polish army.</span> <span id="s689">What was his reason, i don't know.</span> <span id="s690">He was trying to save us.</span> <span id="s691">He came to me before and he asked me, if time gets so serious you want me to find a saving place, before i got married, a place where to hide you.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: And at that time i was not serious enough to say yes or no, but when it happened i contacted and i says, you remember what you told me?</span> <span id="s694">He says, okay.</span> <span id="s695">It's still open.</span> <span id="s696">We take you in a farm, he and a teacher at school.</span> <span id="s697">And on that farm -- i already talked to the farmer, he said, because i talked to him at the time when i approached you, and he's willing to do this for so much a month, money.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: He was willing to do it for money?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s700">What do you think?</span> <span id="s701">For A Fee.</span> <span id="s702">(Tape Went Quiet For A Moment.)</span> <span id="s703">Anyhow, I believe -- there was some other things left, what could be exchanged.</span> <span id="s704">And, of course, nobody know how long this will last.</span> <span id="s705">We was hoping maybe three months, maybe six months.</span> <span id="s706">And nobody predicted a five-year history, but the point is they picked us up.</span> <span id="s707">Well, i -- it's the whole story -- in skarzysko.</span> <span id="s708">My brothers was in skarzysko and i -- no.</span> <span id="s709">After this we went to skarzysko.</span> <span id="s710">I really don't -- i'm confused with the marriage business.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s712">Wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s713">When you got married, that was in forty –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: In '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: In '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And you had lived from 194 –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: September 20, 1942.</span> <span id="s719">I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: September 20th, 1942.</span> <span id="s721">And so you -- between '40 and '42 is when you lived with your family in the very close quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s723">We didn't live there.</span> <span id="s724">We just come back to sleep or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: You were there while you were working on the railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: We was working –</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: -- yes, back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And then you talked to him in '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: And you got married with the four –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: -- by your uncle?</span> <span id="s734">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I -- we was transferred to skarzysko after this, all of us, the group that was married and not married, but we contact him that we need a hiding place.</span> <span id="s736">The situation is like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: How did you contact him?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: How?</span> <span id="s739">There was visiting.</span> <span id="s740">There was still people coming to the -- there was workers to Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: At the –</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: It was not just Jews, because Jews was the slavery, and the non-Jews was the one that supervised.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: They watched over us.</span> <span id="s745">It's not -- the germans couldn't spread around the army between such a nonsense, working on the railroad, working on the city.</span> <span id="s746">So they used the polish people, the one that assigned it, like i said, a half-german or even a polish policeman or whatever.</span> <span id="s747">And when we come -- we had contact.</span> <span id="s748">I know we know quite a lot of people.</span> <span id="s749">We lived in that city for long time, and my husband had a wealthy family, another business.</span> <span id="s750">And if you do business with people, they like you enough, there's still some kind of connection.</span> <span id="s751">My brother approached, when we was in skarzysko, the youngest one, 15 years old, approached one of those (indecipherable), or whatever he was, gestapo or somebody, that he give him all his clothes.</span> <span id="s752">He was just in boots and -- it was already in the fall, and a jacket and everything, because he had gold pieces in the boots, hide it away.</span> <span id="s753">We all put some jewelry in places that we can dispose it and be able to get out some bread money for.</span> <span id="s754">And he said, i give you my boots, i give you my clothes, and give me a uniform and take me to the station.</span> <span id="s755">And that man fall for it.</span> <span id="s756">He opened the boot and he found out it's gold pieces.</span> <span id="s757">He fall for it.</span> <span id="s758">He could have killed him, but it's god's will for him not to kill him, because he could have all the things and kill him and forget about it.</span> <span id="s759">He took all of those things and took him, took us, all three of us to the station, to railroad station.</span> <span id="s760">And we all arrived in that city where we supposed to go to hiding.</span> <span id="s761">And that man was waiting for us on the station and picked us up in a wagon of hay.</span> <span id="s762">We all crawled in and went to that place with that farmer.</span> <span id="s763">We dig a hole in the barn.</span> <span id="s764">You know, they had those barns for cattle, for pigs or whatever.</span> <span id="s765">We dig a hole in the barn six foot deep, ten foot square and covered this up in boards and covered the boards with hay and straw, with whatever, just pretend it's a part of the barn.</span> <span id="s766">And little by little that gentleman, the gentile, brought in my mother.</span> <span id="s767">My mother was in hiding, because he hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s769">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And brought in my husband and my husband's sister.</span> <span id="s771">So it was a total of six.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s773">So then you and –</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: My mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: -- your mother, your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: -- my husband and two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: The two brothers.</span> <span id="s778">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: And my husband's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Four of you -- or the six of you in this hole?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: In that hole.</span> <span id="s782">That was not the end of it.</span> <span id="s783">We even brought in my sister's two children, but we lost them in a short time.</span> <span id="s784">They were just there a few months, couple of months, but tried to save them.</span> <span id="s785">Didn't succeed.</span> <span id="s786">They were too young and they went out for things and they got killed.</span> <span id="s787">One was nine, one was eleven.</span> <span id="s788">But we was trying in that.</span> <span id="s789">We didn't sleep laying flat but sit.</span> <span id="s790">Everybody would sit in their clothes, whatever clothes we still had.</span> <span id="s791">We stayed in that bunker for months.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: How did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s794">She bought -- it was very difficult with food, because if the lady, the farmer lady was in a good mood, she cooked.</span> <span id="s795">She brought down potatoes and baked a bread.</span> <span id="s796">This was good enough.</span> <span id="s797">As long as we had potatoes, we had bread, we had water, we can live, but if something just didn't work very well in her household, we could sit two and three days without food, without anything.</span> <span id="s798">The only advantage we had, in the middle of the night we went up and we could pull out from the barn – they have those spaces for the animals where they're throwing potatoes, cooked potatoes for –</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Oh, a trough.</span> <span id="s800">Trough.</span> <span id="s801">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: And from this, the leftovers, we took it down, and that was the -- and if we needed to drink water something was available outside.</span> <span id="s803">We had to go down -- and this was for -- to clean us, to wash up, too, because in daytime we didn't have that opportunity.</span> <span id="s804">So we had to wait till midnight and when everybody on the farm was quiet, asleep, we went out one at a time and washed ourself, cleaned up to a point.</span> <span id="s805">I don't want to even remember how.</span> <span id="s806">Of course, we got sick.</span> <span id="s807">I had all type of sickness, and my mother was sick.</span> <span id="s808">We didn't even think we would survive.</span> <span id="s809">There was -- there was not even -- we didn't care, frankly.</span> <span id="s810">I personally – I cannot speak for everybody.</span> <span id="s811">I personally didn't care.</span> <span id="s812">I was just doing a favor for the rest of them I'm with.</span> <span id="s813">That's my opinion.</span> <span id="s814">But my opinion was big deal, who needs that kind of life, being a princess, having everything in home and being dressed and being popular and being somebody.</span> <span id="s815">And no time nobody even cares.</span> <span id="s816">All my friends, they don't even want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s817">I'm just like a disease.</span> <span id="s818">So who cares to live in a time like this.</span> <span id="s819">It's even embarrassing.</span> <span id="s820">You can be the most beautiful child, but you still a child.</span> <span id="s821">You think like a child.</span> <span id="s822">The fact is, myself, I didn't know what's commit suicide.</span> <span id="s823">I didn't know what you do not to live, but i didn't care.</span> <span id="s824">I say, whatever happens to me, if they take me out, they kill me, so they kill me.</span> <span id="s825">I didn't know how the feeling of killing, but just listening to it I agreed to be the victim.</span> <span id="s826">And what can I say?</span> <span id="s827">Time went by.</span> <span id="s828">After quite some time the man was getting wealthier and wealthier, the farmer, by paying him so much money each month.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Who paid him?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: The outsider, the gentleman outside, what find us the place, give him an ultimatum.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: So your friend, the one that –</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yes, my friend.</span> <span id="s833">He told him before he board us in, he said, listen, i know a lot of farmers taking this and after a few months they get tired of it, they kill and take away everything they have.</span> <span id="s834">They have nothing.</span> <span id="s835">Everything they have I have, and I'm the witness.</span> <span id="s836">If anything happens to them same thing will happen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: He said that to the farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s839">And on those agreement he took us in.</span> <span id="s840">So we had some security.</span> <span id="s841">We know as long as he is not going to be tired of us we will live, unless we die from diseases or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: And, of course, they used to come on the farm for food, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s844">The German army used to come every farmer, take out a pig, a cow, poultry, eggs, whatever.</span> <span id="s845">This was common.</span> <span id="s846">Every time they come in, three, four of them with a truck, they was going around with their rifles and digging, trying to in the ground to see if it's soft.</span> <span id="s847">If it's soft, somebody is hiding.</span> <span id="s848">And the minute they come in they asking, have you this here, or do you have Jews?</span> <span id="s849">They say no, but that was already common that a lot of people in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: One Sunday he comes home and he says he wants to talk to us.</span> <span id="s852">He knocks on the things.</span> <span id="s853">He even -- what is it?</span> <span id="s854">His name was Wadick (phonetic).</span> <span id="s855">What is it?</span> <span id="s856">He said, we heard in church stories that the rumors go around on the farm that we have Jews.</span> <span id="s857">And i asked him, i says, what makes you think it's serious?</span> <span id="s858">He said, because i told them I'm going to build a house.</span> <span id="s859">They say, how can you build a house if you don't have Jews there to pay you for it?</span> <span id="s860">Because farmers were poor people.</span> <span id="s861">They had a little house, you know, from straw, whatever.</span> <span id="s862">He said he's going to build a brick house, and he's bragging about it, and his wife is going to the city buying better clothes than she used to wear.</span> <span id="s863">Naturally, things like this give you some suspicion.</span> <span id="s864">So we decided if that's -- and that was already in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: We decided if that's going – if he already told us this, it's not going to take very long, or he himself can call the police –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: -- and tell them, I have Jews here not by will.</span> <span id="s871">They just come in and they hide and I discovered that they are there, or tell them they come in to rob me, or anything.</span> <span id="s872">You know, what – to rob even potatoes is a robbery, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: So we decide it's not going to work, we have to see -- to find another place.</span> <span id="s875">And my man -- I say man.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s878">He come out, because he used to come out –</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: And visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: -- every once in a while and talk to us.</span> <span id="s881">And he picked days, because he was in the city and knows what days in the week the Gestapo comes in.</span> <span id="s882">Not every day they were there.</span> <span id="s883">The army was there, but the -- you know, the one in the black uniforms.</span> <span id="s884">They just come in for visits, like stake everything out for everybody or killing somebody.</span> <span id="s885">So he chose those days what's safer for him to visit us.</span> <span id="s886">And we told him the story, it's not going to work.</span> <span id="s887">And he said, okay.</span> <span id="s888">I have another place for you.</span> <span id="s889">The guy's a very poor farmer, but i told him i expect one day it's going to happen.</span> <span id="s890">He was a very smart businessman.</span> <span id="s891">He was in business.</span> <span id="s892">They had a lot of farms, but he himself had -- was in the automobile business.</span> <span id="s893">Like the bosses we have going back and forth, he had those bosses, that man.</span> <span id="s894">He was with people.</span> <span id="s895">He was not just a person that don't understand life.</span> <span id="s896">He could see what is going on and he was, like they say, a patriot in polish.</span> <span id="s897">They say he was a real patriot.</span> <span id="s898">He believed that one of those days we get rid of the Germans and Poland is going to be Poland like it used to be.</span> <span id="s899">And to him it was a challenge that he had the opportunity to save lives, Jews or non-Jews or somebody.</span> <span id="s900">That's my opinion, because why would he -- he didn't get any money.</span> <span id="s901">We just reward him a gift later, but he had no benefit as far as financial.</span> <span id="s902">Everything what we left with him he used for –</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: -- for that purpose.</span> <span id="s905">As a matter of fact, he was short when he took us over to the other farmer.</span> <span id="s906">He told him, i don't have any more money to pay you, but they have pretty nice homes from both sides of the family.</span> <span id="s907">If they survive you will have something.</span> <span id="s908">If they don't survive i will see to it that you get all the things that belongs to them.</span> <span id="s909">So the farmer fall for this, too.</span> <span id="s910">You know, after all, smart or not, they took a chance.</span> <span id="s911">Frankly, they took a chance --</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: -- For their life, too.</span> <span id="s914">Not as we had having there, but the same token, they didn't have to do this either.</span> <span id="s915">A lot of people didn't want to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s917">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: He come back and told us that he made the arrangement with other guy, but it's a good walking distance.</span> <span id="s919">It was quite a few miles, four, seven, eight miles.</span> <span id="s920">And i remember it was farm, farm, farms.</span> <span id="s921">Monday we have in our city like exchange food, like a market.</span> <span id="s922">The farmers come with food, with everything to the city, exchange for clothes, for equipment to work on the farm for appliances, for stuff like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">End of File One Beginning of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: We decided that night it's going to be the best night to walk out from this place and go to the other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: You had to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: We (indecipherable) who is going to take us.</span> <span id="s928">We dressed as women and men, and the women in those little babushkas, what the farmers wear, and baskets of eggs.</span> <span id="s929">Everybody has a basket and three eggs, whatever.</span> <span id="s930">If they catch us or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: You have --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: -- the language we know.</span> <span id="s933">Germany, I could speak German to them.</span> <span id="s934">Polish, I can speak Polish to them.</span> <span id="s935">Where they're going, cover my face to see whether I'm a Jew or not, everything I have to just answer.</span> <span id="s936">So we walked by and, of course, it's always a (indecipherable), always somebody watches the -- where they had stations, like a station of so many soldiers or somebody, certain places.</span> <span id="s937">We had to by walk by something like this.</span> <span id="s938">Regardless of which part of the city we will go, it was all four corners, and we walk by and he come out and he stop.</span> <span id="s939">Okay.</span> <span id="s940">Where you going?</span> <span id="s941">A German, this was a German, and I says we going back to the farm.</span> <span id="s942">What do you have?</span> <span id="s943">Eggs.</span> <span id="s944">I was afraid if he come close to me, I cannot lie.</span> <span id="s945">He said go.</span> <span id="s946">I couldn't eat your eggs.</span> <span id="s947">You know, if I would say kielbasa or vodka or something else, he probably would stop me.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And take it or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: But eggs, go.</span> <span id="s950">They had plenty eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: (Indecipherable).</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Back to the place, and we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s953">We did the same thing, and we moved in in that place, and that was in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: (Inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s956">Didn't have any contact with nobody.</span> <span id="s957">Was very primitive, old people, farmers.</span> <span id="s958">No newspapers, no radios, no anything.</span> <span id="s959">We couldn't send them to the city to buy papers because be suspicious.</span> <span id="s960">Farmers know who is ignorant and who is not educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: We lived the kind of life we possibly could live, very boring, very uncomfortable, short of money.</span> <span id="s963">My brother went out to a near farm where he left all of his clothes, all his necessary things at a friend of his.</span> <span id="s964">Since we so short, he was hoping when he survive, he needs the clothes.</span> <span id="s965">Didn't bother taking away from him, but since we were so short and the farmer really didn't have enough money to buy even for the cattle's food, so we felt for him.</span> <span id="s966">So my brother on a Saturday night he went out to that other farmer, and he said I have couple of suits for you.</span> <span id="s967">I have to take him and sell it.</span> <span id="s968">He said I buy them from you.</span> <span id="s969">He said okay.</span> <span id="s970">Well, whatever you want to pay me for it.</span> <span id="s971">He said 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s972">He said fine, 30 dollars, and visit with a friend of his for a while and walked back to us.</span> <span id="s973">Walking back a few, maybe a mile or whatever from there, he followed him.</span> <span id="s974">Took away the 30 dollars and kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: We see one day he's not there; the next day he's not there.</span> <span id="s977">We told he was visiting those people that were friends.</span> <span id="s978">One good day the farmer come down and he said in the city they say they killed another Jew because every day you could hear, and my mother immediately for some reason she felt like that's the one.</span> <span id="s979">She said -- she said to him you know who they killed?</span> <span id="s980">No, a young man.</span> <span id="s981">She send him back to the city and says find out what kind of clothes he wear or somebody going to tie us up and he come back and he said he wear a jacket.</span> <span id="s982">Describe the jacket.</span> <span id="s983">That's when we know it's my older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Who was it; was it his friend that bought the -- was it his friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s986">For 30 dollars they killed a person.</span> <span id="s987">That's the way -- that's the kind of time we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: And a lot of cases, frankly, I take -- the Polish people was as guilty as the Germans.</span> <span id="s990">They did more harm to the Polish Jews as the Germans.</span> <span id="s991">Germans took us to work, put us in the crematorium because that was the Fuhrer wanted them to do and they claim they had to believe in his philosophy and his -- that (indecipherable) people.</span> <span id="s992">Even got paid them for it, and time changed but still they had their own explanation and they come to judgment, but the Poles didn't have any interest whatsoever to do anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Because after all their country was already occupied by the Germans, and the Germans should be to them somebody not a friend but the enemy.</span> <span id="s995">Why help an enemy?</span> <span id="s996">They didn't (indecipherable) to help the enemy.</span> <span id="s997">They done it for a lousy $30, but that's another story because everything -- if we go back in history and people are not ignorant, we know.</span> <span id="s998">We're all human.</span> <span id="s999">We all have some kind of evil time of life.</span> <span id="s1000">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s1001">So we lost one.</span> <span id="s1002">That was already April 15, 1944.</span> <span id="s1003">We continued with a shortage, and January Russia -- the Russians start coming in to -- what you call it -- in '45, January '45.</span> <span id="s1004">We heard the planes cruising around those farms and those little cities.</span> <span id="s1005">We was wondering being underground, what were planes doing on the farm?</span> <span id="s1006">We know that the Germans have no reason now.</span> <span id="s1007">They (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1008">They have no reason to be in that part of the country.</span> <span id="s1009">If we -- we know the map, we know what part of the world they should be now and knowing they was fighting with Russia, they should be far, far away from that part we be in, but who can tell?</span> <span id="s1010">We had no newspaper, no radio.</span> <span id="s1011">How can we even say?</span> <span id="s1012">We estimate or we heard anything that's going on, people on the farm talk, and they say -- and he said, yes, the planes was going through Warsaw, was throwing bombs and they say the Germans are losing the war.</span> <span id="s1013">Okay.</span> <span id="s1014">That's good news.</span> <span id="s1015">But how soon or what?</span> <span id="s1016">One good day he's knocking on our thing.</span> <span id="s1017">He said, folks, you free.</span> <span id="s1018">You can come out.</span> <span id="s1019">My husband says huh-uh, the Russians, we not coming out.</span> <span id="s1020">We thought they want to do something to us.</span> <span id="s1021">He said the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s1022">So we opened a little bit, and we said Russians (indecipherable) why you have that news, and he said the Russians are new city.</span> <span id="s1023">Everybody under fire is hiding because we don't know what they're going to do to us, but if you're Jews, you can go back to the city, and we said if you're hiding, why would they be so good to us; we hiding with you.</span> <span id="s1024">Because another day we got out from the bunker.</span> <span id="s1025">We had no clothes.</span> <span id="s1026">It was wintertime.</span> <span id="s1027">It was the 17th of January.</span> <span id="s1028">We had no clothes, able to walk on such -- and winter in Poland is very cold in this time of year and the ice on the ground.</span> <span id="s1029">We have no shoes.</span> <span id="s1030">Everything deteriorated in five years, what we have.</span> <span id="s1031">So the lady, the old lady, she was so poor, give us blankets from the horses, torn, in rags, you know, something not worth even saving for a rag, but it's still something you cover yourself up, and we walk back to the city.</span> <span id="s1032">We come back to the city.</span> <span id="s1033">Everybody was in turmoil because everybody was again afraid of the Russian.</span> <span id="s1034">We still not free.</span> <span id="s1035">We are still under some kind of -- we settled in a house because everybody – everything was occupied by not owners, but Germans supply the houses for whoever worked for them, whoever did something for the German army or whatever.</span> <span id="s1036">So we couldn't get in our house.</span> <span id="s1037">A postman was living there.</span> <span id="s1038">So we went to my sister-in-law's house.</span> <span id="s1039">We moved in.</span> <span id="s1040">Another couple come in a day later, a single man come in, grouped together.</span> <span id="s1041">There was -- that particular city had 3,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1042">By the time they all got in in the city, we have 17 alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: 17 from the 3,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: From the 3,000 that was hiding in bunkers and camps or whatever.</span> <span id="s1045">We grouped all 17 in the same area.</span> <span id="s1046">Was afraid to separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Did you know them all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1049">Small city.</span> <span id="s1050">We lived there for a while.</span> <span id="s1051">As a matter of fact, I went to my -- I was a very close friend of the mayor's sister.</span> <span id="s1052">She was my age.</span> <span id="s1053">Mayor over there was the burgomeister, if you know what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: We lived across -- I told you we live in a good neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Across from us we have an architect, a drugstore, and his wife's sister was my best friend.</span> <span id="s1058">So I left her all my clothes, all my goodies, whatever.</span> <span id="s1059">When I come back, I have no (indecipherable) because just (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1060">I will stop and she would give me back my clothes.</span> <span id="s1061">I went in and I thought she was passed out seeing me.</span> <span id="s1062">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1063">Is the reason because she felt sorry for me the way I look or is it the reason -- I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1064">So I start -- I was waiting for a good answer.</span> <span id="s1065">She said, you know something, I wouldn't want you to be here.</span> <span id="s1066">I said I don't intend to be here.</span> <span id="s1067">I just like for you to give me some of my clothes or some shoes, something so I can start getting dressed.</span> <span id="s1068">She said I'm sorry to tell you there's no clothes left, nothing.</span> <span id="s1069">Your jewelry, your clothes, your coat, everything the police took out from my house.</span> <span id="s1070">I said you sure you have nothing left, and if she would be really a sincere person, she could have given me something from her clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: -- if it's true, but that's okay.</span> <span id="s1073">That's what I'm trying to tell you.</span> <span id="s1074">And I said how did the police know to take my clothes.</span> <span id="s1075">She said you know you was too popular, everybody know what kind of clothes you wear.</span> <span id="s1076">When they come in, they know.</span> <span id="s1077">The jealousy was so extreme.</span> <span id="s1078">Know what you wear.</span> <span id="s1079">I said what can you give me?</span> <span id="s1080">I cannot give you nothing.</span> <span id="s1081">I want you to leave.</span> <span id="s1082">I said can you give me some potatoes.</span> <span id="s1083">We are really hungry.</span> <span id="s1084">She gave me a couple of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1085">That was my best friend.</span> <span id="s1086">Okay.</span> <span id="s1087">So no reason for me to worry and stay in that city or do anything.</span> <span id="s1088">I said to my husband, we have to move.</span> <span id="s1089">We have too many friends here from the past but they wouldn't want us.</span> <span id="s1090">They don't want us period.</span> <span id="s1091">First they are occupying our homes.</span> <span id="s1092">They have our goods.</span> <span id="s1093">We stuffed up so many different friends with goodies and goodies and goodies, and everybody was afraid we want everything back or want some back or whatever.</span> <span id="s1094">So I said it's no place for us.</span> <span id="s1095">Let's go someplace else.</span> <span id="s1096">I was -- even I was young, I was always capable to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: I could sew, I could write, I could read.</span> <span id="s1099">I could do anything I want to do.</span> <span id="s1100">We pack, and I stopped a Russian truck and they took us to a different city, me and my husband.</span> <span id="s1101">I settled in that city.</span> <span id="s1102">I know that city from before, Szczecin I went to that city.</span> <span id="s1103">I start peddling around.</span> <span id="s1104">I see clothes is good there.</span> <span id="s1105">This is three miles away from the German border.</span> <span id="s1106">We could walk over from one place to another.</span> <span id="s1107">It was open already.</span> <span id="s1108">There was no -- because there was always Germany and Poland had a border and (undecipherable) where we could go back and forth and not worry about (indecipherable) or whatever.</span> <span id="s1109">I bought some clothes I exchanged for food.</span> <span id="s1110">I went down to Union Station and I bought food from the farmers in exchange for clothes.</span> <span id="s1111">The people, they need food because the big city had a very good shortage of everything, and went one to another, I make myself a little money.</span> <span id="s1112">I opened a store, a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1113">I don't know too much about grocery stores but who cannot sell groceries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: What is it, it's food.</span> <span id="s1116">I worked in that store for a while, and I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1117">My mother and my brother is still in that city, but my brother was a very capable person, for you have a fact already that he took us out from camp by age 15 and now he's age almost 20.</span> <span id="s1118">So I was not comfortable and I worried about not contact him constantly because I want him to move away from that city.</span> <span id="s1119">He said he's doing well financially.</span> <span id="s1120">He was a good mechanic too.</span> <span id="s1121">At 15 years already drove a car.</span> <span id="s1122">He is fixing bicycles, cars, sewing machines, and he's selling them.</span> <span id="s1123">Buys an old one, broken one, fixes it and sells it.</span> <span id="s1124">So he was doing pretty good for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: But for me being so restless, not having him close to me since I have nobody, I lost everybody and that's the only thing I have is my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s1127">That's the whole family from 96 people.</span> <span id="s1128">It was a family of 96.</span> <span id="s1129">He decided he's going to move, find him a place there and, as a matter of fact, he come to see the place and he supposed to move on a certain date.</span> <span id="s1130">He came to see the place.</span> <span id="s1131">He bought a lot of stuff to take home with him from (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1132">When he brought everything home, it was May 1, 1945 -- 1945, yes.</span> <span id="s1133">It was already four months after liberation.</span> <span id="s1134">Coming home with a truck with goodies, going into his house.</span> <span id="s1135">The (indecipherable) stopped him and killed him.</span> <span id="s1136">It was four months after.</span> <span id="s1137">He was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s1138">So I lost another one.</span> <span id="s1139">I went back to that city, packed my mother, and I took her with me to Szczecin and decided there's no room for us, not in Szczecin, not in (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1140">We have to go some places.</span> <span id="s1141">We have to forget about that country, forget about that part of the world.</span> <span id="s1142">There was choices.</span> <span id="s1143">It was two choices.</span> <span id="s1144">Can go with a visa to United States or to Israel.</span> <span id="s1145">Israel was not yet a country.</span> <span id="s1146">It was '45.</span> <span id="s1147">But they accepted people, took a long time, like you have to have -- you have to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: And who is coming from, takes a year, two, three, whatever, but it's a question when you get your visa.</span> <span id="s1150">Our visa came in in 1958.</span> <span id="s1151">No.</span> <span id="s1152">Pardon me.</span> <span id="s1153">But in the meantime, I have to move away from Poland.</span> <span id="s1154">This is number one.</span> <span id="s1155">We packed again what we have.</span> <span id="s1156">We moved to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: You moved to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: We moved.</span> <span id="s1159">We took our route.</span> <span id="s1160">Wherever we going to get stopped or hold back, we stay.</span> <span id="s1161">We was traveling.</span> <span id="s1162">We was in (indecipherable), we was in Linz, we was in cities, all to drove, until we finally come across in Linz some people from a neighbor city we know, and they say they are going to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1163">Who is in Regensburg?</span> <span id="s1164">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1165">We heard it's a city.</span> <span id="s1166">Let's go.</span> <span id="s1167">We went.</span> <span id="s1168">The whole group from the camp over there in Linz went to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1169">We went.</span> <span id="s1170">We settled in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1171">This was '45 settled.</span> <span id="s1172">Such a fast transaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1174">How did you get there; by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: By halting the Russians trucks, stop and take me, three miles, six miles, twenty miles, whatever.</span> <span id="s1176">Rest of it, if we have to walk, we walk.</span> <span id="s1177">We walked through forests because it was (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1178">It was (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1179">In some places you couldn't pass through without the passport.</span> <span id="s1180">Where you going, who are you?</span> <span id="s1181">That's a very uncomfortable time, one country take over the other one and don't trust anybody.</span> <span id="s1182">Could be espionage, could be anything.</span> <span id="s1183">The fact is that we went through -- we walked and whatever, however we smuggled out through.</span> <span id="s1184">We arrived in Regensburg, and Regensburg was organization.</span> <span id="s1185">There was help.</span> <span id="s1186">Survivors already established.</span> <span id="s1187">They give us temporary.</span> <span id="s1188">We're always in one place, but food was available, clothes was available.</span> <span id="s1189">It was an organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">You go in and you can find a dress, a dress, old, new, whatever, just something to cover your body, and so we had the -- like they have here, those stamps.</span> <span id="s1191">We had those kind of stamps to go and get -- we get cheese and we get milk, and you get whatever, and we lived among the (indecipherable) and then we got a little apartment for us, for me and my husband.</span> <span id="s1192">My mother was not with me yet.</span> <span id="s1193">The two of us went because we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1194">We couldn't drag an older person with us.</span> <span id="s1195">Wherever we would go finally if we have a destination we stay, then I go pick up my mother.</span> <span id="s1196">I did so after three months being in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1197">I went back.</span> <span id="s1198">I didn't have enough money to travel like a human being by train.</span> <span id="s1199">Went back to Szczecin, picked up my mother and brother to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1200">We stayed.</span> <span id="s1201">We all applied for United States because my husband had an uncle in New York.</span> <span id="s1202">We was hoping through him our visa would come a lot faster but sounds like he was too old to sponsor three people.</span> <span id="s1203">So we had to wait for the federation, UJA, whatever you call it now, for them to help us in that respect, but they absolutely did, last quite some time.</span> <span id="s1204">In the meantime, since we was in Regensburg and waiting, we had to do something.</span> <span id="s1205">We opened a business.</span> <span id="s1206">We begin -- we worked different things.</span> <span id="s1207">I was doing a lot of sewing, a lot of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: And trying to make dollars and cents, and my husband was trying to buy whatever he possibly could.</span> <span id="s1210">We had good connection.</span> <span id="s1211">We have languages in that respect.</span> <span id="s1212">We went to old factories for the old sew purses, whatever was not saleable and was not -- and brought into the city, and then we got -- we was -- got the opportunity from the city to get the stamps.</span> <span id="s1213">When you need clothes, you need stamps.</span> <span id="s1214">You need shoes, you need stamps.</span> <span id="s1215">There was no such thing in those years you can buy direct for money.</span> <span id="s1216">Everything in the city is assigned to you.</span> <span id="s1217">We got the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1218">We ran the store.</span> <span id="s1219">We did that type of -- my husband was pretty capable, and I had the languages, and I didn't worry about whether write, read or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Was not like some survivors at that time who couldn't help themselves as far as -- not that I was so knowledgeable, but I was good enough to do all those things, and through this, we had a store.</span> <span id="s1222">We make good money.</span> <span id="s1223">We was pretty good off in no time.</span> <span id="s1224">We have everything, but human being expect and my son was born in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1225">Of course, 1950 we give everything.</span> <span id="s1226">I had a partner to that business.</span> <span id="s1227">We took in also a Jewish man, a German, from our state, from Hanover.</span> <span id="s1228">He was from Hanover.</span> <span id="s1229">She was from Prague, the wife.</span> <span id="s1230">We took them in as partners, so we left them the business, and we walked out with just what money we had.</span> <span id="s1231">We moved to Kansas City.</span> <span id="s1232">We was assigned to Kansas --</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: -- according to the visa.</span> <span id="s1235">We didn't pick Kansas City.</span> <span id="s1236">We didn't know what Kansas City is.</span> <span id="s1237">We want actually go to New York but didn't get the privilege of going to New York because they say a lot of people settling those years in New York like it's overdoing.</span> <span id="s1238">So they send us to Kansas City, and very nice lady from the UJA was waiting for us and picked us up in a car.</span> <span id="s1239">We was people back to life.</span> <span id="s1240">Somehow nothing is forever, not the good, not the bad.</span> <span id="s1241">We have a good (indecipherable) who always watches us.</span> <span id="s1242">It's not true.</span> <span id="s1243">Some people feel like why God let this happen if it's really such an unjustice.</span> <span id="s1244">Sometime even a good father spank their child.</span> <span id="s1245">If you don't live the right way, you have obligations to deliver what -- what your religion tells you, and you go against, you lose those opportunities.</span> <span id="s1246">Somehow the same thing is happening now.</span> <span id="s1247">If we don't watch out and we don't look because we all equal.</span> <span id="s1248">We don't worry about one is black and one is blue, one has more money and one has less money.</span> <span id="s1249">We should all be equal because we all gots children.</span> <span id="s1250">I raised my children this way, and I hope they will continue to be what they are now and that they be some kind of benefit to the world because they are good children and they believe what I believe.</span> <span id="s1251">Prejudice is not going to bring us no place.</span> <span id="s1252">Whether it's Jewish or it's another religion or whatever it is, if we're not going to teach the children and bring them to a point to understand, don't think a Jew have (indecipherable) or don't think a black is dirty and filthy or whatever.</span> <span id="s1253">You give them the opportunity, he can wash himself as well as you can do.</span> <span id="s1254">He can be as good as anybody else.</span> <span id="s1255">You don't have to be pure white to be the best person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: You can be anything and be a good person.</span> <span id="s1258">Just think of what the world -- why you're here, why -- we all gots children.</span> <span id="s1259">We all here for a purpose.</span> <span id="s1260">So let's think about it.</span> <span id="s1261">Let's do the right things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: That's what I can tell you about my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Do you still have contact with the people who hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: I had contact until two years ago.</span> <span id="s1266">He passed away.</span> <span id="s1267">The wife is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Is that the farmer or the friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: No.</span> <span id="s1270">I never had contact with the farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: With the farmer.</span> <span id="s1272">Just with the friend who helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1274">I would send him money from Germany when I lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s1275">I would send him money from the United States.</span> <span id="s1276">Whoever went to visit Poland, I send money with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: My cousin from Canada went and I sent with him.</span> <span id="s1279">He send me beautiful pictures of him and his wife and children, and he wrote me letters.</span> <span id="s1280">We was in contact constantly, constantly.</span> <span id="s1281">In the beginning it was difficult to send money.</span> <span id="s1282">So I sent packages from Chicago from (indecipherable) --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: -- at the time for Christmas half a dozen packages that (indecipherable) and clothes.</span> <span id="s1285">I was buying those coupons they would sell for a suit, three yards of coupons (indecipherable) so and so much.</span> <span id="s1286">I always send three or four coupons.</span> <span id="s1287">He sold them and make some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: And whatever was available, every connection I had to send them something, I sent them.</span> <span id="s1290">One time a nephew of ours was there to visit him, and he said (speaking in a foreign language).</span> <span id="s1291">Because I told him, I says I want you to leave him the money.</span> <span id="s1292">That's the reason I send it, and he left it he said to him.</span> <span id="s1293">(Speaking a foreign language).</span> <span id="s1294">Of course, he was the angel of life.</span> <span id="s1295">Let's face it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: That could be both ways or God send them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: -- or it was just he so righteous to achieve something like this.</span> <span id="s1300">That's a good question because he's the heaven.</span> <span id="s1301">I know.</span> <span id="s1302">He have to be born for something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: What else can I tell you (tape goes quiet) because there's a back story, there's a front story, and what's going on.</span> <span id="s1305">Certain things that come to me after I walk out from here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: -- because it's just -- like I remember a story, we was like girls and we had the -- the Typhus start in the city, and they picked up a number of girls, we was eight, nine girls.</span> <span id="s1308">Most of the time the kids were the more educated and understand, and they can read and they can go through certain alphabetical things to find out what to do in a case like whatever it is, and we was given -- instead of having just the armband, the star, the Jewish star, we had the Red Cross on top, and able to go to those sick people and help them because they was afraid to go.</span> <span id="s1309">That would kill them.</span> <span id="s1310">They was afraid.</span> <span id="s1311">Typhus is such a disease that they would catch it.</span> <span id="s1312">So they assigned us to catch this good (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1313">There was some -- and from those -- it was nine girls.</span> <span id="s1314">From those nine girls, I'm the only one alive.</span> <span id="s1315">Every week somebody else was killed from the nine girls, just taken out and killed for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s1316">There's so many things that comes to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s1318">What about when you were living underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: There is no -- no -- actually there's no way a human being can even have the feeling or understand unless -- my kids don't even understand.</span> <span id="s1320">If I tell them how sick I was and when I had -- that was (speaking a foreign language).</span> <span id="s1321">For that reason, very few people survived with medication, and I had -- you don't supposed to drink water for this.</span> <span id="s1322">You don't supposed to -- everything has to be boiled, cooked and whatever, and cleanser is very, very important.</span> <span id="s1323">We have no cleanser.</span> <span id="s1324">We have no bath.</span> <span id="s1325">We have no hot water.</span> <span id="s1326">I had no tea.</span> <span id="s1327">I had to drink the water from that -- bailed from the outside, and the bread, sometimes she brought down, it was molded inside.</span> <span id="s1328">She didn't give us the bread which she baked today or yesterday.</span> <span id="s1329">What was left through the week, she put another batch of bread so she give us the old one, and that bread I had to eat, and my time was six weeks I had trebunk (phonetic).</span> <span id="s1330">My son asked me one time what is trebunk (phonetic).</span> <span id="s1331">I said it's red.</span> <span id="s1332">I don't want to tell him.</span> <span id="s1333">It's a joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Did you -- did you need to be quiet during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Oh, yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1336">There was no conversations, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1337">(Indecipherable).</span> <span id="s1338">He brought us every once in awhile a paper.</span> <span id="s1339">Of course, the papers didn't give us that much, but at least we had something to read, and I was the one allowed to crochet, sewing for the people, for the farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: She brought me materials from the city, and I cut -- as a matter of fact, I had a couple nightgowns, beautiful nightgowns, I took it with me, and she liked it, but she didn't -- she was tall woman and I was a little short girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: So she wanted me to make community dresses for the – she had a little girl three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: So I cut them through and make them and put little ribbons around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: You did that -- you did that without talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: As a matter of fact, we had no light.</span> <span id="s1348">If you ever talk to your father, he would understand what I'm saying.</span> <span id="s1349">He had those little lights, No. 3, with kerosine inside, and there were little things that sticks out, what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: A wick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes, the wick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: That you would light?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: And this couldn't stay lighted because there was no air.</span> <span id="s1354">This was covered.</span> <span id="s1355">With seven people, had no air.</span> <span id="s1356">The light went out.</span> <span id="s1357">Sometimes I was sewing, and in the middle of everything the light is out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: The light went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: You don't open the window because no window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: There's no window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: You don't open the opening because you're afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1363">How terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">As long as we can talk about it, we are alive.</span> <span id="s1366">We are happy.</span> <span id="s1367">We can tell the story.</span> <span id="s1368">What my father could tell, what my mother could tell, what my brothers.</span> <span id="s1369">They're not around to even hear that story.</span> <span id="s1370">I'm left by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: What about your father; what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: He went to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: He went to Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yes, 1993 (sic).</span> <span id="s1375">I had a friend when she was in the same train.</span> <span id="s1376">That's the reason I know.</span> <span id="s1377">The 6th of January, '93 (sic) the train went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: So that was after you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: My father didn't see me from the day he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So you took care of your mother, and she came with you to Kansas City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Came to Kansas City.</span> <span id="s1384">She died here 25 years ago.</span> <span id="s1385">She was a sick woman but we took care of her.</span> <span id="s1386">We did the best we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1388">I'm sure she was very glad to have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: She was a beautiful person, so talented.</span> <span id="s1390">She could do everything.</span> <span id="s1391">It's unbelievable, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1392">She got herself a little house in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: And she put in her own little (indecipherable).</span></p>

She was going around buying little hooks, all those things and make jewelry, went to the dime store and sold the jewelry.</span> <span id="s1399">She could do anything.</span> <span id="s1400">She could sew.</span> <span id="s1401">She could -- it was nothing she couldn't do.</span> <span id="s1402">Just a very talented person, but she suffered.</span> <span id="s1403">She had heart trouble since she come out from the bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: It's not surprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: We was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Terrible, yeah.</span> <span id="s1407">A: Younger people.</span> <span id="s1408">Another thing, what killed her is when she lost that second son.</span> <span id="s1409">They killed him after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: After this, she was totally, like almost gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: That was so unexpected too.</span> <span id="s1413">That's why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: You thought everything was fine with liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: It could happen.</span> <span id="s1417">A car accident could happen, a sickness.</span> <span id="s1418">Somebody is going to kill you after something like this and for no reason.</span> <span id="s1419">They didn't want anything.</span> <span id="s1420">Just we don't want you.</span> <span id="s1421">That's all.</span> <span id="s1422">Yes.</span> <span id="s1423">All the stories, like I say, people give you all those testimonial things, whatever, but there's really no way anybody can remember.</span> <span id="s1424">Maybe to them this is important, but there's so many more important things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: And it's important -- it's most important is to tell the world to watch out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: That's true.</span> <span id="s1428">That's true because you could see -- you can see things happening in the world and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1430">We should all feel the same way.</span> <span id="s1431">We should support education.</span> <span id="s1432">We should support all those organizations, what they are doing, because that's the only survival, and people are stupid and uneducated, don't know why, and somebody come in like Hitler, I will give you food, I will give you everything, screams and yells, and everybody says, okay, Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, not knowing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Not knowing what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1435">All right?</span> <span id="s1436">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: I've taken up a lot of your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: It's okay, it's okay.</span> <span id="s1439">I don't know how important the story is to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: It's very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Will I get some tape?</span> <span id="s1442">I'm interested to know what I said because admittedly I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1443">I start talking and it comes to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: And you know when you listen, more things will come to you too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: But I think, like you said, it's very important to do it.</span> <span id="s1447">Very important to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: It's a different -- it's a different story than a lot of -- there's quite a few survivors from bunkers, from (indecipherable) in the forest and place like this, but the bunker story was really critical, very critical.</span> <span id="s1449">Life was so -- and the camps was uncomfortable, we know this, and there was nothing but danger and everything else, but to be and not to have the opportunity even to look out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: -- and see, is it sunny?</span> <span id="s1452">Is it raining?</span> <span id="s1453">When is a holiday?</span> <span id="s1454">We didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Anything at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: My mother had a book with her, a religious book, and we was trying to establish when is the holiday without trying to see, is it dark, is it moon, is it what.</span> <span id="s1457">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Well, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
