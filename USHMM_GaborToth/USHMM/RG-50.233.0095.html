id="s163">Because they were apprehensive and they knew that somebody was after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Is this because of your father’s Jewishness or his political activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Both, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So you can talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: My father was the District Supervisor of the

That was way in the twenties.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: But he was a marked man as far as the Nazis are concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: A lot of Social Democrats were imprisoned starting then, right?</span> <span id="s178">He had friends or other party members who were in prison then?</span> <span id="s179">Did they have to leave fairly quickly or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah, they had to leave fairly quickly because I remember one evening my father got this note was pushed under the door.</span> <span id="s181">The post office wasn’t reliable any more.</span> <span id="s182">People would open up each other’s mail and look for trouble.</span> <span id="s183">So this note under the door said something to the effect that -- change your domicile, somebody’s after you.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Do you remember the month and the year?</span> <span id="s185">But you think it was early ’34?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: It was early -- well it was shortly after the election in April 1933.</span> <span id="s187">My father was very upset.</span> <span id="s188">He came home; he says, guess what, the Nazis won.</span> <span id="s189">So they changed - they gave up the apartment and they lived under an assumed name someplace else as a -- in a room sublet by somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Still in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Still in Berlin, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: So they stayed there for a few more months and they --?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Incognito.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: But when they changed their identities, that’s when you went to live with your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s196">I was getting to be too much for my grandmother so I ended up in this orphan asylum.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: 19 --, 1937, yes, early 1937.</span> <span id="s199">They put me on a train bound for Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So you were in the orphan asylum from -- what

anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No.</span> <span id="s211">I remember my Hebrew teacher -- he was a tall fellow, blond, pug-nosed, blue-eyed, a real image of the typical Aryan and they wanted to get him into the Party, a party member.</span> <span id="s212">They didn’t believe that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s213">He was tall, he was six and a half feet tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Oh, I can see why they wanted him.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Blond, blue-eyed, ruddy-faced, a typical Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What happened to him?</span></p>

school when you went to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No, I went to a training institute that would prepare me for mechanical, mechanics.</span> <span id="s322">I would up in employment at the HIspano-Suiza Works in Courbevois, Paris, in 1938.</span> <span id="s323">They made engines similar to the Rolls Royce Company.</span> <span id="s324">As a matter of fact they were compared to it.</span> <span id="s325">They made engines and engine parts and I was employed there as a mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Had you studied French in Germany so that you could get around or did you just pick it up when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I was very bad at languages.</span> <span id="s328">But it took me only thirty days to master the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s330">So you worked there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I worked up to the end of 1939, when war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you have teenage friends in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s335">I know there were lots of girls after me but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: It was passé.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s339">So when the war broke out in ’39 in Poland, --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yeah, after Hitler invaded Poland and thinking that the Russians would be with them.</span> <span id="s341">Then he turned against the Russians and that’s when England declared war first and then France.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What did your father think when the Soviets signed the pact with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s344">He was pretty upset.</span> <span id="s345">I had my own apartment.</span> <span id="s346">I wasn’t very much in contact with them at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Oh really.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I was alone, by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: But you were living in the 15th?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I was living, no, at Courbevoie, near the plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Courbevoie is one of the outskirts of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Okay, so you were in Courbevoie living by yourself and working when war broke out?</span> <span id="s354">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Then, since the French classified us as hostile aliens, they rounded us up and took the young ones into the inner, into the inside of the French country, the countryside where we were harvesting sugar beets.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Where was that exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: In the Touraine.</span> <span id="s358">The little villages where we were quartered was -- the little village was Marrolles, M-a-r-r-o-l-l-e-s.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: When did you arrive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: It took us, was eleven weeks after the -- no eleven days after the outbreak of the hostilities, they took us into the Touraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Can you describe the circumstances of your being rounded up?</span> <span id="s362">How did they get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Well, the gendarmes just showed up and told us to pack ours -- off your belongings and go with them.</span> <span id="s364">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: You were registered with the police, so they knew your address and they cam to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Oh, yeah, everybody was registered with the police.</span> <span id="s367">Every resident.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s369">So you were taken by truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: We were taken to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s371">The railroad station -- and were freighted into the --.</span> <span id="s372">Well freighted, we had passenger cars.</span> <span id="s373">Passenger compartments; going into the French corn belt as it is called, the wheat belt.</span> <span id="s374">It’s called the Touraine.</span> <span id="s375">A series of little villagers, farmers, farming villages ----</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Were there other Jewish kids with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Some of them yes, some of them not.</span> <span id="s378">But they were all foreigners.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: From all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: All over.</span> <span id="s381">Some were students.</span> <span id="s382">They helped with the harvest because the men went to the front.</span> <span id="s383">So we went to the interior helping with the harvest.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: How did the French gendarme treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: They were ice but authoritarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: You stayed in farmhouses, with families, when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s388">We stayed as guests of the farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: You were with one family there?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: We were housed in an old barn because we were many, we were about forty people.</span> <span id="s391">At three o’clock in the morning, we were out there with our machetes harvesting the beets.</span> <span id="s392">The dew was heavy so in order to prevent the outbreak of rashes and other disturbances of the skin, they fed us with vitamin, heavily with vitamins A and D, giving us boiled lard to eat in the morning, black bread from the real stuff.</span> <span id="s393">I liked it.</span> <span id="s394">I was very fat, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Fat was just dripping off me.</span> <span id="s397">Boiled lard?</span> <span id="s398">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s399">Potatoes and bread and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You were all men or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: All men.</span> <span id="s402">The weekends, we whiled away our time with playing cards and going to the local pubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: So you had your freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s405">We had freedom there, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Were you paid a wage?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s408">That arrangement was not bad at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Why did you start work so early in the day?</span> <span id="s410">I mean you couldn’t see --?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Apparently sugar beets get stuck in the ground when the sun is up.</span> <span id="s412">To collect these beets.</span> <span id="s413">You have to pull them straight up not to break them.</span> <span id="s414">You want the whole beet, you see.</span> <span id="s415">Once they break, they’re no good any more.</span> <span id="s416">That’s it.</span> <span id="s417">Can’t do a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: So the ground had to be slightly wet to pull them out.</span> <span id="s419">That as why --.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s421">The work had to be done before sunrise.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What did you do the rest of the day?</span> <span id="s423">Did you work on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: By the time the beets were out of the ground, the sun was up and then you went down the rows with your machetes and cut off the greens.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: So you worked real hard there?</span> <span id="s426">What time did you get off work?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s428">Well, three in the afternoon was quitting time.</span> <span id="s429">The rest was ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How many months were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: I don’t know, when the harvest was over, they took us away.</span> <span id="s432">I guess it was eight weeks, something like that, eight or ten weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Then we went back and in the meantime, my parents moved from Paris to Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: They did that because they were worried about being rounded up in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No.</span> <span id="s437">My father had a fallout with his partner and he said, okay, you take your business and stuff it.</span> <span id="s438">They went into Nice because they had a good offer there and established a lending library instead of the delivery.</span> <span id="s439">I joined them there and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Is this picture taken in Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: That’s the picture in Nice in front of part of the books.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So this must have been 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: It was before, before we were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Oh, yes, ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: They went to Nice in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: I can’t see this very well but your father looks very bookish.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Right after I arrived in Nice, I was told that as a hostile alien, being of a relatively manageable age, I had to go into military duty.</span> <span id="s450">Since I couldn’t join as a non-French, since I couldn’t join the regular French armed forces, I had to go into the French Foreign Legion.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: That was in 1941? ’</span> <span id="s452">42?</span> <span id="s453">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I was in --’41, yes.</span> <span id="s455">No, that must have -- no, it was in 1940.</span> <span id="s456">What am I talking about?</span> <span id="s457">It was in 1940- right after I had joined my parents in Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How long were you with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: So then I -- it was only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s460">I had to pack my bags and leave -- got my walking papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What was their living situation in Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Their living situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Well, we had only this one big room with the books and with --.</span> <span id="s465">I slept on a couch and they slept in a double bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: In this room -- in the same room?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yeah, it was a big room.</span> <span id="s468">It was partitioned off with a drape, with a curtain.</span> <span id="s469">So they put the curtain and made a bedroom out of part of the living room.</span> <span id="s470">The living room was full of books.</span> <span id="s471">That’s how they lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Did a lot of people come into the lending library?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s474">They had a good business there</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did you go to -- was there still a beach life there or anything at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Beach?</span> <span id="s477">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Do you remember that at all before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Well, Nice is up against the French Alps.</span> <span id="s480">They fall right off, sort of -- it’s nestled in a cliff sort of.</span> <span id="s481">Matter of fact, the bay reminds one of Los Angeles because --.</span> <span id="s482">It’s called the Bais de Anges and it’s --.</span> <span id="s483">The beach is all pebbles, no sand.</span> <span id="s484">I had the hardest time to walk on these pebbles but you get used to it after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Were you there in the winter or the spring?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s487">You see people bathe in the winter time and you look up --.</span> <span id="s488">As a matter of fact, we were up in the mountains and we looked down to the sea, to the beach and we saw people bathe and we were having a snowball fight up in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Right after you got there, you went to the mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">(End of Side A)</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: ….</span> <span id="s492">years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: We had boot camp in Leon, France which lasted five weeks.</span> <span id="s496">We went on to the Sahara Desert.</span> <span id="s497">I remember the crossing of the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s498">The Mediterranean is a nice smooth body of water, very innocent looking but every once in a while, gets stormy.</span> <span id="s499">When it gets stormy, watch out.</span> <span id="s500">So we had one of those passages on a sloop, going to North Africa.</span> <span id="s501">The water was terrible, oh was it ever choppy.</span> <span id="s502">I couldn’t remember a thing like that.</span> <span id="s503">It was stormy, outright stormy.</span> <span id="s504">That things was, I don’t know how he could have made headway, but he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Was it a small boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Was a sloop, was slightly bigger than a fishing trawler.</span> <span id="s507">I saw people standing up, lining up on the railing, green in their faces and giving to the sea what’s -- whatever they ate.</span> <span id="s508">Giving it back to the sea.</span> <span id="s509">I was down, sitting there, down at the captain’s table and ate everything in sight.</span> <span id="s510">No, I had no fear of the sea at all.</span> <span id="s511">So then we ended up in North Africa, we were ferried to -- we were transported in trucks, military convoys to the Sahara Desert.</span> <span id="s512">A little village tight at the outskirts of the desert, Bou Arfa.</span> <span id="s513">That I remember.</span> <span id="s514">Wasn’t far from the Algerian border with Morocco.</span> <span id="s515">But we were on the Moroccan side.</span> <span id="s516">We were told to -- regular little garrison, you know, garrison duty.</span> <span id="s517">We were told to watch out for the Arabs because they are very treacherous.</span> <span id="s518">They can sneak up behind you; you don’t even know what hit.</span> <span id="s519">They just come out.</span> <span id="s520">The desert is just a mass of sand, you know, dunes and what-not.</span> <span id="s521">They have ways of fighting.</span> <span id="s522">They make no noise when they come up on you.</span> <span id="s523">You had to watch out.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Were you scared when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span> <span id="s526">But the -- I had a carbine which was, oh my God, it always --.</span> <span id="s527">I don’t know -- shooting around the corners.</span> <span id="s528">Never hit the target.</span> <span id="s529">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s530">We had target practice and I always ended up hitting somebody else’s target.</span> <span id="s531">I looked at the bayonet of the thing and it was dated 1792 or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You’re kidding!</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yeah, from Napoleon’s time.</span> <span id="s534">That’s what we had.</span> <span id="s535">Then we did our little garrison duty.</span> <span id="s536">Then the Germans came in after France laid down her arms in 19 --, late 19___, well, actually 1940, she laid down her arms but the Germans took a little while to get in there and to get organized their things.</span> <span id="s537">It took about half a year until they found out about our garrison.</span> <span id="s538">I guess in early 1941, they disbanded the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s539">Oh yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s540">We were under the Vichy regime.</span> <span id="s541">Marshall Petain.</span> <span id="s542">He was -- he took care of the running of the French Foreign Legion until the Germans were good and ready to organize it their way.</span> <span id="s543">So we had a little time there.</span> <span id="s544">Meanwhile we kept on functioning as a garrison, as an outpost.</span> <span id="s545">Then the Germans came in and took all our weapons away and got us to work on their railroad project.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q” When was that?</span> <span id="s547">That was in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: That was in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Do you remember who was in the group with you?</span> <span id="s550">Some of the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Oh, we had -- our group was made up of all kinds of renegades, breakers of the laws, and things like that.</span> <span id="s552">I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What were they like?</span> <span id="s554">I mean, did you make any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, you can’t make friends with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s557">They were totally foreign kind of -- to you?</span> <span id="s558">They were really bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: They were rough, yes.</span> <span id="s560">It was a rough and tumble bunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did they leave you alone?</span> <span id="s562">Or did they give you a hard time?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Some were murderers.</span> <span id="s564">Well, I was once frightened by somebody who wanted to cut off my ears.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Was the fact that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s566">Was that known to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Made no difference, made no difference.</span> <span id="s568">We were all in the --.</span> <span id="s569">As a matter of fact, I remember when one of the colonels at the end of boot camp in Lyons, in the French mainland, gave us charge before dismissing us.</span> <span id="s570">He said, you are in the French Foreign Legion, you are here to die.</span> <span id="s571">To fight for your fatherland and to die.</span> <span id="s572">Little did he know that these are all a bunch of foreigners.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: I’m sure you didn’t look at it so ironically then, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s575">But it struck me as out of place.</span> <span id="s576">Completely out of place.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s578">So you did the Foreign Legion and then the Germans took it over.</span> <span id="s579">That’s when they made you start working --?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: They disbanded, the first thing they did is disband the French Foreign Legion.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: But they took over your regiment or whatever it was called?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s583">They took over our regiment and made us break up those stones they trucked in from some place, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: You stayed in the same barracks, the same location?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: They put us a little deeper into the desert.</span> <span id="s586">At that time they housed us in pup tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: When you were in training, did they give you survival -- did you learn how to survive in the desert?</span> <span id="s588">I mean did they give you special training for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So that wasn’t a problem, adjusting to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: That was not a problem, no.</span> <span id="s592">The French government fed us and the Germans made us work.</span> <span id="s593">That’s what.</span> <span id="s594">--- In other words, we still were, we were still obeying the French and the Germans were in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: It was German army units or Wehrmacht or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: A couple of higher-ups once in a while came to inspect the work we were doing and sniff around a little.</span> <span id="s597">But largely they left us alone because we were doing our job.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Was that hard, breaking up the stones?</span> <span id="s599">Hard work?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Oh, yes, was hard.</span> <span id="s601">You had -- there was a quota that you had to meet but it wasn’t too hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: No.</span> <span id="s603">How long did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Until my father coughed up 20,000 francs and I guess in ’41, ’42.</span> <span id="s605">Yeah, in early ’42, he was able to get me out of there -- to buy me out.</span> <span id="s606">To have me shipped back to the mainland, the French mainland.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s608">How long were you there before you were deported?</span> <span id="s609">You went back to Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Went back to Nice.</span> <span id="s611">I’m thinking that Nice was a safe area because it was under the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So you were there for a couple of years or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I don’t know how long --.</span> <span id="s614">Again this is -- when did Italy lay down her arms?</span> <span id="s615">When Italy laid down her arms, the Germans took over the entire area.</span> <span id="s616">Italy surrendered in September, 1943.</span> <span id="s617">They made the -- they rounded up the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Were these SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: These were SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Who went around rounding up?</span> <span id="s621">So you were deported with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, with my parents.</span> <span id="s623">I was first put into a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: In Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: In Nice.</span> <span id="s626">From there regular shipments were going to Paris, collection camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: What did the SS tell you when they rounded you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: That they had work for us in some other

Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: I mean was there a large Jewish population there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes, it was a fairly large Jewish population because the Italians left the Jews alone.</span> <span id="s634">The Jews were working in Italian occupation offices.</span> <span id="s635">Military offices -- they had it good as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span

rudimentary things.</span> <span id="s648">We had to leave things, many things behind.</span> <span id="s649">We couldn’t take money along, we couldn’t --.</span> <span id="s650">They let us have

G-o-w-a.</span> <span id="s655">As a matter of fact, I came across a -- you read French?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: The library was confiscated by one of

to get your uncle’s help to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, he was thinking of going to Spain.</span> <span id="s670">From Spain to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s671">But he somehow missed the boat.</span> <span id="s672">He thought it wasn’t going to be this drastic.</span> <span id="s673">He had his confidence in France, in the French people.</span> <span id="s674">He missed it and it was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: He wasn’t the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: He was interned in Gurs, in the camp of Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Oh, he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Before I was picked -- before

<p><span id="s706">Q: Okay, so you were deported from Nice to Paris?</span> <span id="s707">This was after Italy surrendered to the Allies on September 8, 1943?</span> <span id="s708">And then to Auschwitz, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Then to Auschwitz, and there we were separated.</span> <span id="s710">They got loaded on a truck and, of course, it went right to the gas

id="s716">Q: You didn’t have any idea then what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I smelled it.</span> <span id="s718">I smelled it.</span> <span id="s719">It was sickening.</span> <span id="s720">They didn’t have to tell me anything there.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You were on these cattle cars?</span> <span id="s722">You were deported on cattle cars out of Paris?</span> <span

these cattle cars were sealed in them.</span> <span id="s728">Conditions were horrible.</span> <span id="s729">I don’t have to describe it.</span> <span id="s730">That’s pretty well established.</span> <span id="s731">(This was convoy 69 from Drancy on March 7, 1944; source: Klarsfeld)</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: But you were still with your parents then?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Everyone else on the cattle car with you, were they all from Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, they were all from France.</span> <span id="s736">This was a collection camp at Drancy, outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s737">It came from various regions.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Were there young children on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Some of them were young children.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Families?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Families, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: How many days did the trip take from Paris to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I guess four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Was that the summer time when you were deported?</span> <span id="s745">What time of year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Must have been in the fall.</span> <span id="s747">(Was actually in March, Convoy 69, March 7, 1944).</span> <span id="s748">Because the

were?</span> <span id="s752">From starvation and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Starvation and what you call it, conditions.</span> <span id="s754">It was a horrible stench.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: When you go to the camp, you were separated and where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: The first time, the first thing I notices we were stripped of all clothing, all belongings.</span> <span id="s757">Next thing I got a number tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: That was done right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Then we were told to go into the sauna.</span> <span id="s760">Our heads were shaven and all this other stuff -- cleansed with kerosene or something to -- I don’t know what went on there.</span> <span id="s761">Some chemical, it smelled like kerosene, it’s awful.</span> <span id="s762">It was like a shower, you know.</span> <span id="s763">Then they dried us off and gave us some things, some rags to put on.</span> <span id="s764">Were not fitting well at all and wooden shoes, clogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: You were -- I had your -- you were at Auschwitz for the whole -- for the remainder of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: What -- do you have any experiences that you want to talk about there in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Well, some representative of the Siemens Works came and they were both recruiting officers, civilians by the name of --.</span> <span id="s769">One was Hanke, H-a-n-k-e, and the other was Jungdorff, J-u-n-g-d-o-r-f-f.</span> <span id="s770">They were representatives of the Siemens Works.</span> <span id="s771">They were looking for mechanics.</span> <span id="s772">They asked me to do certain things to explain to read the scales on calipers and to identify mechanic’s tools and things like that and they were satisfied.</span> <span id="s773">They were hiring me on the spot.</span> <span id="s774">From that moment on, I was treated fairly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Did you leave camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: We left the camp and we were transferred to a little -- used to be a tile factory, a brick factory.</span> <span id="s777">A brick factory which was abandoned of course, near the Elbe River, which was taken over by the Siemens people.</span> <span id="s778">They were giving us lathes and drilling presses and all these tools to make jigs for using electrical components, like switch components, contacts and things like that.</span> <span id="s779">So we had the tools.</span> <span id="s780">I don’t know where they got them from but we had the tools.</span> <span id="s781">They were pretty good too, they were pretty good quality.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did you live --?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: We had, yes.</span> <span id="s784">We had bunk beds with mattresses and bedding.</span> <span id="s785">We had horsehair covers and pillows.</span> <span id="s786">Strangely enough, we had -- was --.</span> <span id="s787">That’s why I say.</span> <span id="s788">You see, I don’t open my mouth too wide because I don’t have the experience that others had.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: You had enough!</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I had enough?</span> <span id="s791">Compared to what others experienced, I was pretty well treated.</span> <span id="s792">We had good food --.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: You had enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: We had sausage, we had cheeses, we had -- you name it.</span> <span id="s795">I was pretty well nourished, couldn’t complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You spent the duration of the war there?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Potato soup and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s798">Well, this went on, this arrangement went on until the Russians came uncomfortably close to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s799">It was in February or March, of ’46, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: ’45.</span> <span id="s802">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s803">We had to leave in a hurry, had to abandon everything and we went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s804">[See NOTE at end of transcript]</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: We were transported again in wagons, in cattle wagons but there was one difference.</span> <span id="s807">We could take our belongings and our foods along.</span> <span id="s808">The trip took only about a day.</span> <span id="s809">We spent about, I would say, five days in Dachau before the two recruiting officers from Siemens found us again.</span> <span id="s810">We were again singled out.</span> <span id="s811">This time we were transported by truck, military convoy to Berlin; Siemens, their main factory there.</span> <span id="s812">That’s where we continues doing our little thing.</span> <span id="s813">Except that every time the Allies laid down one of those bomb carpet, we had to go into the bunkers, into the shelters.</span> <span id="s814">This was in Arbeitslager.</span> <span id="s815">This was not a concentration camp, this was a work camp.</span> <span id="s816">At that time we had to go hurriedly back to the work camp and go into the bunker because Siemens had in itself, only bunkers enough for their own employees.</span> <span id="s817">So we had to go back.</span> <span id="s818">We had to share these bunkers with the SS.</span> <span id="s819">But again, they left us alone.</span> <span id="s820">They were humans, human beings.</span> <span id="s821">They left us alone.</span> <span id="s822">There was one bunker next to ours; there was only SS.</span> <span id="s823">We didn’t - they didn’t --.</span> <span id="s824">One of those bombs really hit hard.</span> <span id="s825">I was standing near the door and I felt the impact from the air rushing in, you know, the pressure, the sudden air pressure.</span> <span id="s826">The bunker next to us got a direct hit and when they dug these -- got all these bodies out, one guy had a gun, the thing was turned around and looked like a trumpet, one of those French horns.</span> <span id="s827">That was the impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Was that he most terrifying thing that you experienced, the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, it stood out in my mind.</span> <span id="s830">We had to -- there were lots of incendiary bombs they dropped and they never exploded.</span> <span id="s831">You know these pencils, they were octagonal in shape and they had a pin, you know.</span> <span id="s832">The idea was when these things dropped down, the pin got pushed in and the flame threw out.</span> <span id="s833">They had us pick up those things that did not go off and just hold them away from us; push the pin and let them flame out.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Oh, so they were little, they were small bombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: They were the incendiary bombs.</span> <span id="s836">The incendiary bombs; they look like gigantic pencils with a pin at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: They made you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: They made us do that to neutralize those things, to get all the stuff out.</span> <span id="s839">Now actually, when the flame gets thrown out, these things don’t get hot.</span> <span id="s840">The flame is far enough away from these pencils --.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So on one got killed doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No one got killed doing that.</span> <span id="s843">We went into a neutral area.</span> <span id="s844">As a matter of fact, they had a whole sack full of potatoes for us.</span> <span id="s845">For what was in the kitchen, raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s846">We amused ourselves to discharge these things against the potatoes.</span> <span id="s847">So we had some nice roasted potatoes for dinner.</span> <span id="s848">No, we didn’t -- I personally didn’t suffer too much.</span> <span id="s849">The skills --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, then Berlin got too hot.</span> <span id="s852">The Siemens complex was destroyed.</span> <span id="s853">Our work camp was destroyed and they ferried us up to Oranienburg concentration camp, back to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s854">That was already the later days of the Nazi era.</span> <span id="s855">Most people saw the light; that this was an untenable situation and the Germans were done for.</span> <span id="s856">Was only a matter of time.</span> <span id="s857">They prepared us -- again no hardships.</span> <span id="s858">They prepared us for a march to Meklenburg, to the Meklenburg region and we were supposed to board a Red Cross ship in Bremen but we had to walk over there.</span> <span id="s859">The order came to march us into a forest and to machine-gun us all to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: You knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes, yes, the SS told us.</span> <span id="s862">We got the orders to shoot you all.</span> <span id="s863">But we refused to do that.</span> <span id="s864">We don’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s865">Orders, nobody checks on these orders as the war is over.</span> <span id="s866">The war is finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: So this was April, probably?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: This was April of ’45, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: They were afraid at that point of retaliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: They were afraid it was that point retaliation.</span> <span id="s871">They said to hell with these orders.</span> <span id="s872">We just march on.</span> <span id="s873">Let’s go.</span> <span id="s874">So we go.</span> <span id="s875">We went to that one forested area, full of foxholes, for the night.</span> <span id="s876">Bedded ourselves down in one of the foxholes.</span> <span id="s877">We had our -- at that time our hair was starting to grow and we had our -- we took our blankets along and all that.</span> <span id="s878">We were pretty well organized there.</span> <span id="s879">In the morning, we looked around, no SS.</span> <span id="s880">No German officers.</span> <span id="s881">There was a clearing.</span> <span id="s882">In a far clearing, I saw a rider, man on horseback.</span> <span id="s883">Turned out to be a Russian soldier on reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s884">They discovered us and took us in to a gigantic farmhouse with a barnyard and what-not.</span> <span id="s885">The Russian colonel who turned out to be a medical doctor, spoke a good German at that time, he said, look, you’re free.</span> <span id="s886">But if you want to do yourself a favor, don’t eat right away anything that comes into sight.</span> <span id="s887">I know you are hungry.</span> <span id="s888">We will give you some thin soup and we’ll gradually increase your diet to where your stomachs can digest it, because if you eat, you die.</span> <span id="s889">That’s what the colonel said.</span> <span id="s890">He said you get sick and you’ll die.</span> <span id="s891">We were a couple of days with the Russians.</span> <span id="s892">They fed us pretty well.</span> <span id="s893">They gave us no solid food for the first two days and then they started out with a slice of bread here, a little ____ there and so on.</span> <span id="s894">But somehow I reacted, I came down with dysentery.</span> <span id="s895">Then the Russian said, we have no ill facilities.</span> <span id="s896">I’ll tell you what, we’ll deliver you to the British.</span> <span id="s897">They have a field lab, a field infirmary and they can get you back, straightened out.</span> <span id="s898">They put me on a -- what the Russians call an ambulance, and got me over to the British lines which weren’t far away.</span> <span id="s899">There, I spent about three weeks on a diet of all horsemeat hamburgers.</span> <span id="s900">I gained weight at the rate of three pounds a day.</span> <span id="s901">I was simply emaciated.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So even though you were treated so well, you were emaciated?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I got three things.</span> <span id="s904">I got sulfa drugs, I got aspirin and I got all meat hamburgers, horsemeat hamburgers.</span> <span id="s905">All horsemeat hamburgers -- that’s how they put me back on my feet.</span> <span id="s906">Then I was repatriated to France because everybody went where he was taken from.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Did you go back to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Yes, we went back to Paris when the first stop.</span> <span id="s909">There we -- they welcomed us as heroes.</span> <span id="s910">We were quartered in one of the luxury hotels.</span> <span id="s911">I think it was the Ritz, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s912">We were given clothes and things to wear, my first haircut.</span> <span id="s913">After this died down, went back to Nice and I reclaimed my old apartment.</span> <span id="s914">The books were gone, of course.</span> <span id="s915">I lived there for a year before I came down with the -- the diagnosis was water on the lungs.</span> <span id="s916">I went to the hospital and they found that I had water, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s917">They took one of those gigantic syringes, those horse syringes, big needle, heavy gauge needle.</span> <span id="s918">The doctor felt me between the ribs and just jabbed that thing into the lungs and pulled out water.</span> <span id="s919">Pulled the water out of my lungs.</span> <span id="s920">Thank God the water was clear so there was no evidence of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s921">They put me in a ward together with tubercular patients.</span> <span id="s922">So in order to prevent me from catching tuberculosis, they inject me with an aspirin solution.</span> <span id="s923">A sugar solution of aspirin, 500 milligrams a day, three times a day.</span> <span id="s924">They reduced it to 200, twice a day and then I came out of it, no evidence of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s925">Well, here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: When did you emigrate to the U.S,?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: In 1947.</span> <span id="s928">Matter of fact, it was May 4, 1947.</span> <span id="s929">I landed in La Guardia, on a regular immigration visa.</span> <span id="s930">My uncle furnished the affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Could we just -- I’d like to --.</span> <span id="s932">You told me your father’s birthplace and birthplace already and he had a university degree and his background.</span> <span id="s933">Do you know what your stepmother’s birthdate was?</span> <span id="s934">Approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No, but I could find out, I can find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">NOTE: After interview was concluded and recording equipment removed, Mr. Munzer recalled that he had not given correct information concerning the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s937">After Auschwitz, he was sent to Buchenwald, not to Dachau as stated.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Review of transcript necessitated further minor changes from the taped interview.</span></p></body></html>
