<p><span id="s345">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s347">And did the teachers teach when you said you were good in history, was politics talked about at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: A little bit.</span> <span id="s349">For the history teacher it was German who had escaped from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: So, he didn't have much time for the Germans, or at least for the Hitler regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s353">Were there Jewish kids at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: A lot of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: But at that time, you didn't really know the difference</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: until the war broke out and they had to wear the yellow star</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: and then disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: So, were you at that school when the war did break out?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: You had just finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I was gone from there.</span> <span id="s367">My parents had discovered that I hadn't learned much, so then I went to live with a family in Hilversum.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: And there, well, I guess I was brought uptodate to my age and school.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So, you went to another school there, a more traditional one?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s373">Where people kept their clothes on?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah, uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Sorry.</span> <span id="s376">I shouldn't joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: And, and by the time 1940 rolled around, you would have been 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I was 15 when the war broke out, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Do you remember where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s382">I was down in Hattem.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: In Hattem?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah, for I was going to go to England.</span> <span id="s385">We went to the British consul on the way and he refused my visA:</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: And he said it turned out that he was actually a Nazi and, you know, how would you call that a double agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: He was a Dutchman working as a consul, as a British consul.</span> <span id="s390">But later on we found out that he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s391">But he said that I would be safer in Holland and not subjected to the bombing in London.</span> <span id="s392">So, he refused the visA:</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: And then I went with my grandparents, my grandmother to Hattem and then stayed there.</span> <span id="s395">And on May 10 May 9, 1940, we got a telegram that everything was approved.</span> <span id="s396">I could go back to England.</span> <span id="s397">And then the next morning the Germans invaded Holland.</span> <span id="s398">So, we were stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: And do you remember the first Germans that you saw?</span> <span id="s400">Were they also paratroopers?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No, not in our areA: We didn't see Germans for about months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Wow, that's quite a time</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: for a small country.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: And they were busy in the that part of Holland apparently was not too important.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Strategically?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: And the British across the River IJssel had been blown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">So, can I assume, then, that life hadn't changed much for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: In that month or so, life hadn't changed much for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: But my grandmother had when the war broke out in '39, she had survived the first World War.</span> <span id="s415">So, she had slowly accumulated quite a lot of food already.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Because she remembered what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s418">And</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: By the time World War II broke out, your grandparents, were they already elderly or were they middleaged?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s421">My grandmother my grandfather was a lot older.</span> <span id="s422">He died in '43 I think.</span> <span id="s423">He was about 93.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Wow, Wow.</span> <span id="s425">So, he was quite old by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s428">And how did they respond to</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How did your grandparents react to Holland being occupied, the Netherlands being occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s432">They just</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: They didn't talk about it with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s435">They didn't like the Germans.</span> <span id="s436">But, also, my grandfather had done an awful lot of business in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Your brother and your half brother your brother was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: I mean, was his fate your fate?</span> <span id="s440">That is, that when you were denied a visa, he was denied a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: He lived in a different town with different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Your own brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And your half brother also?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No.</span> <span id="s446">My half brother lived with my parents in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I get confused too.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s450">So, had you finished your studies by then or were you still due to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, I was still in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You were still in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: When the war broke out, I was 15,</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Did you have any chance to communicate with your parents during that, during that time or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Not after the war broke out, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s459">So, how did that summer progress for you?</span> <span id="s460">What was that summer like?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: How was that summer, that first summer of, of the war and of the occupation?</span> <span id="s463">If the Germans invaded in May</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: It was pretty normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We sailed a lot.</span> <span id="s467">We had a boat at the River IJssel.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s469">And you say it took about a month or so until you saw the first Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And do you remember in what capacity you saw them, what they were doing?</span> <span id="s472">Were they marching?</span> <span id="s473">Was it tanks?</span> <span id="s474">Was it</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No.</span> <span id="s476">A patrol came by and entered our property and put the rifles in the racks around the fish pond and made themselves comfortable to take a break.</span> <span id="s477">And my grandfather went out and yelled at them in German and chased them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And they went?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">Well, he spoke fluent German.</span> <span id="s481">And, you know, a lieutenant I guess it was the second lieutenant he had been addressed in fluent German by an older man and he packed up and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Yeah, he was gehorsam.</span> <span id="s483">That is, he'll be obedient.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s485">But they were troops.</span> <span id="s486">They were not</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Regular soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: That reminds me, did you speak German when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s490">Did you were you studying German in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s492">You get in elementary school you start with French.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: And then later you get English and German</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: and Catholic classical education.</span> <span id="s497">You also get Greek and Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes, and Dutch of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: That's a lot.</span> <span id="s501">That's a lot.</span> <span id="s502">When you returned to school the following fall, was it the same school you were in before or was this a different one?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No.</span> <span id="s504">I had been in the Lyceum which is the more classical education.</span> <span id="s505">And then in Hattem there was a very good school.</span> <span id="s506">It was actually a Christian school.</span> <span id="s507">But my grandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us.</span> <span id="s508">And that school did in three years what all others did in four.</span> <span id="s509">And it also was recognized by the Merchant Marine Academy that I wanted to go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: So,</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: So, you went there.</span> <span id="s513">Boy, you certainly had the gamut, you know, from a progressive school to a Christian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s515">But the head master was very religious, but we went sailing on Sundays.</span> <span id="s516">So, we often met him coming back from church.</span> <span id="s517">He came back from church and we were on the way to the boat.</span> <span id="s518">So, he gave me a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Because of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s522">And did the curriculum change because was it different because of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: So, there wasn't</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: There wasn't much influence by the</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No, not</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s529">I see.</span> <span id="s530">So, you, you finished your studies in three years there?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: And then I went to the Merchant Marine Academy up north.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: And there by that time, all students had to sign a declaration that they agreed with the Nazi ideas and principles and would not do anything against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: If you didn't sign that, that was the end of your education.</span> <span id="s538">So, it was the end of my schooling too.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So, you didn't sign it?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Was that unusual that people wouldn't sign?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s543">But then you run the risk you have to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s544">You had to work for the Germans either in Holland or France or Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So, a lot of kids didn't sign and took that risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Oh, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What did you do when you didn't sign?</span> <span id="s548">What did you</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I went back to Hattem, the place where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s550">But I went to live with another family not too far away and, in a sense, in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s552">And during the time you were in school, were you involved in any kind of extracurricular activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah, field hockey.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Field hockey?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Organized, and sailed a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s557">But not politics and not resistance and not going, nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Didn't like the Nazis, but the Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: When you then went into hiding, how did your life develop?</span> <span id="s562">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Well, I lived with them but I could not get (inaudible) cars any more.</span> <span id="s564">So, the resistance provided those I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: And this was in what year?</span> <span id="s566">In 1943 or '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Oh, in '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So, 1940, '41, '42.</span> <span id="s571">And, so, you never did get to the Merchant Marine school?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: I never did.</span> <span id="s573">Finally I was, but it was very short.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s575">So, in 1942 that's still your there's three more years of war left?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: What happens to you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, I got involved in the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Well, tell me about it.</span> <span id="s580">Tell me how were you brought in?</span> <span id="s581">How the same sort of questions.</span> <span id="s582">How did you start?</span> <span id="s583">Who involved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: A good friend of mine and I decided he decided that his father was an officer in, say, call it the fellow police and they were mounted.</span> <span id="s585">And his father stayed as an officer.</span> <span id="s586">And then Harry felt that his father was a collaborator and a traitor and we would try to get to England.</span> <span id="s587">And he did quite a bit of research.</span> <span id="s588">And we went on a hiking trip and got into Belgium and almost to France.</span> <span id="s589">There were safe houses, farms where you could stay.</span> <span id="s590">You could not camp overnight outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: And these safe houses Harry had figured, found out.</span> <span id="s593">And that way, we could get through France into Spain and then Portugal and to England.</span> <span id="s594">But we lost the trail and we got short of food, so we started going back.</span> <span id="s595">And just back in the Dutch, across the Belgium Dutch border we were picked up by a patrol.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: German?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: German patrol, oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s598">And they took us actually to a police station and we were interrogated there separately.</span> <span id="s599">But we had a good story.</span> <span id="s600">We had been on a hiking trip and we were on our way back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: So, we spent overnight in separate cells.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: And then they let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: And then Harry's father called us and said, "What the hell were you trying to do?"</span> <span id="s607">And Harry says, "Well, you're a traitor and we wanted to try to go to England."</span> <span id="s608">He said, "Yes, but I'm involved in the resistance.</span> <span id="s609">So, if you want to do something, start " we started actually taking downed airmen we called them pilots but, of course, they were any kind of airmen from one place to another.</span> <span id="s610">We would be told to go somewhere</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: and pick up a couple of guys and take them somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did Harry feel did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I don't remember that, but I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So, you would be so downed airmen, you would take them these were British airmen?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Or American, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Did you speak any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: A little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And you were your job was to go there and bring them from where they landed to</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Go to a house where, a safe house where they were.</span> <span id="s627">They were brought there</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: by other people.</span> <span id="s630">And then we had phony passports and we'd take them to another house.</span> <span id="s631">And then we didn't know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: You never knew the people that you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Were you and Harry doing this together?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So, if you had been caught, you would know about what his activities were and he would know about yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: That was the problem, that I knew his father.</span> <span id="s638">I knew way too much.</span> <span id="s639">I also knew the guy who was in charge of the whole resistance of the whole areA: I just happened to know the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: So, how long did you do this?</span> <span id="s641">How long were you involved in this kind of activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Until I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And that would have been how long?</span> <span id="s644">A year?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: That was in on December 5, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Certain dates you don't forget, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: There are certain dates you don't forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's an easy one, though.</span> <span id="s651">December 5th is Sinterklaas in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s653">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s654">What happened?</span> <span id="s655">How were you picked up?</span> <span id="s656">How were you arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well, I was staying in a house of Mrs. (inaudible).</span> <span id="s658">My friend's fiance lived there and his two sisters.</span> <span id="s659">He was living somewhere else.</span> <span id="s660">And in the morning one morning I was sitting looking at a magazine when German troops, an officer and I think 10 or 12 men came into the yard.</span> <span id="s661">And I thought at first I could have run out into the woods through the back door.</span> <span id="s662">But then I thought nobody knows you're here, so</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I stayed.</span> <span id="s665">And then they arrived at the house and knocked on the door and asked the girls if they would open the door and if there were any men in the house.</span> <span id="s666">And she said, "No," of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">So, the living room where I was,</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: the corridor is here and the door opened this way.</span> <span id="s670">So, I stood in the corner behind the door.</span> <span id="s671">And they went through the house.</span> <span id="s672">But well, they saw a shaving brush upstairs, of course, and knew.</span> <span id="s673">Then the guy in the living room looked under the couch, which was only this high, and they looked through the house and didn't find me.</span> <span id="s674">They were outside again talking.</span> <span id="s675">And all of a sudden, I heard the guy run back.</span> <span id="s676">And he pulled the door open and there I was.</span> <span id="s677">So, he poked a rifle in my gut and he yelled, "Da ist er," there he is.</span> <span id="s678">So, then I knew that they knew that they were looking for somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: So, then he said, "Where's your friend?"</span> <span id="s681">I said, "I'm the only one here."</span> <span id="s682">They said, "Well, it will be more pleasant if you go with somebody."</span> <span id="s683">So, I kept saying I was the only one.</span> <span id="s684">They said, "Go upstairs, get your toothbrush, and get on the bike."</span> <span id="s685">And I could have escaped many times on the way to their headquarters, but they would go right back and pick up the family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So, they already knew that the two of you were involved, that you and Harry were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Not that I was involved, simply that there was a man that lived there, or a boy, a man who was not working for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s689">They picked you up because there you were,</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: you're the right age, and you're not working for them in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: And that's suspicious?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: And then at headquarters they asked me many questions and you saw the ID cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Now, Jews had a great big purple J on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Of course, I'm not Jewish and I didn't have that.</span> <span id="s701">But they still thought with the dark hair maybe I could be Jewish.</span> <span id="s702">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s703">They said, "Drop your pants."</span> <span id="s704">Well, I'm not circumcised, so I said, "Okay."</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s706">And, so, then that part was at least safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: But then they said, "You have to be punished."</span> <span id="s710">And but they didn't really know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s711">So, they said, "Let's take you to the gestapo in the town across the river."</span> <span id="s712">And there the gestapo questioned me again.</span> <span id="s713">They never beat me.</span> <span id="s714">They never hurt me.</span> <span id="s715">But my story was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I'm a student up north.</span> <span id="s718">I came down here for a vacation.</span> <span id="s719">In September the trains stopped running for civilians, so I got stuck here.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: That was your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: And it was so simple and it was partially true.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: So, then they said, "Well, you don't work for us.</span> <span id="s726">You have to be punished."</span> <span id="s727">There was a hard labor camp, Klein ErikA:</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Klein Erika?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: It was called Klein ErikA: There was also a camp called ErikA:</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: And it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: And these were within, within the Netherlands, these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s735">Klein Erika and Erika, the two of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Klein Erika was the German name for it, but also in Dutch Small ErikA:</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Small Erika and Erika herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So, you were sent to Klein Erika?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: You were sent to Klein Erika camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s744">What did you</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well, it wasn't too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: The camp commander had been a professor at the university in (inaudible).</span> <span id="s748">And the guy in charge of the work detail had also been a professor.</span> <span id="s749">But when the war got bad, they were drafted and put in charge of a hard labor camp.</span> <span id="s750">"When one man escapes, shoot two," you know.</span> <span id="s751">But</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: So, one escapee; two are shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s754">And they had hostages.</span> <span id="s755">And the first morning when a new person came in, they selected so many of them to become a hostage.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: And then the old hostages were not hostages anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: They were released from being hostages?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: But they were still within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s763">So, were you chosen to be a hostage?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So, that meant if someone escaped, you were in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I run the risk.</span> <span id="s769">So, I looked at my buddies and said, "If one of your guys goes, I will go with you," but nobody ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s771">So, what how did things progress from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: How did things develop from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, we were marched off every morning to work somewhere, install trenches and gunnery placements or unload barges and do any kind of hard labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Well, this was already towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you marched, you had to sing; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Pardon?</span> <span id="s778">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s779">When we were marching through the town, we had to sing.</span> <span id="s780">And we had about, I think, 25 soldiers, then came the group.</span> <span id="s781">Then we came, soldiers on the side.</span> <span id="s782">And then behind us again we marched in fives.</span> <span id="s783">And behind us again, 25 soldiers.</span> <span id="s784">And two firemen from Rotterdam had been picked up in a raid.</span> <span id="s785">They were still in uniform.</span> <span id="s786">They had jumped off a train to Germany and were put in our camp.</span> <span id="s787">And they were there, one on the left and one on the right.</span> <span id="s788">And then the group leader would go and lead a song.</span> <span id="s789">The guy on the left would call the name of the song.</span> <span id="s790">And then the guy on the right would call (German phrase) whenever the feet came down and then we all burst out in song.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Oh, good God.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: I can't sing.</span> <span id="s793">And I was a hostage and I was miserable and I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s794">So, I marched along quite grim.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: One of the guards along the side noticed that I wasn't singing.</span> <span id="s797">So, he came in behind me and beat me with a rifle butt and told me to sing.</span> <span id="s798">So, I sang off tune and I brought a whole bunch of others out of, out of tune.</span> <span id="s799">Another guard heard the discord and finally found out the source and beat me with a rifle butt again and told me to shut up, "Halt mund."</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Halt mund, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: "Keep your trap shut."</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: So, I marched along.</span> <span id="s804">And a soldier saw that I wasn't singing, so I got beaten again.</span> <span id="s805">And then after that, I just mouthed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: You just mouthed the words?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s809">Oh, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I didn't have no more problems, but it took three beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: That was a hard lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s814">What kind of work were you doing once you got to the place you had to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: We were digging trenches for, along the river</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: at gunnery placements and ammunition bunkers.</span> <span id="s818">We also unloaded barges, did all sorts of stuff.</span> <span id="s819">Once in a while, we had to unload the barge with carbide.</span> <span id="s820">Carbide makes acetylene gas, so it comes in steel drums.</span> <span id="s821">Two men could easily lift them and then pick them up and roll them down the gangway</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: to shore.</span> <span id="s824">So, we would break it, crack it, and made sure that it ran into the water.</span> <span id="s825">So, a lot of gas would come out and the Germans would scream and panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s828">And everybody would be evacuated and sent to wait until the boat stopped.</span> <span id="s829">So, we got a break that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: When you were arrested, it was December?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: When you were arrested, it was December 5th, '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: And how long did it take between the time you were arrested and the time you were in this labor camp, Klein Erika?</span> <span id="s835">Was it a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: The evening of the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: It was that fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Did anybody interrogate you about resistance activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: My story was simple and good.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: And, so, they didn't question it?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: The train stopped running for civilians.</span> <span id="s847">I couldn't get back and that's why I'm here.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: When you were in Klein Erika, though, there are two things that come to mind.</span> <span id="s849">One, it's wintertime.</span> <span id="s850">It's December, January.</span> <span id="s851">And, so, conditions probably are not very comfortable.</span> <span id="s852">But I want to ask you about that.</span> <span id="s853">And, number two, we're already going into 1945 and there's only four months left of the war.</span> <span id="s854">Were there battles that were already being fought around the area where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span> <span id="s856">That was further south.</span> <span id="s857">The allies didn't come up September, '44, it was not part of Holland.</span> <span id="s858">And, actually, later on in '45 our area was liberated before the western part of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: My father did mention that they would use their shovels as helmets from the antiaircraft fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Yeah, tell me about that.</span> <span id="s862">You said you used shovels?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: We were digging the trenches</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: from the bridges across the river.</span> <span id="s866">One was a railroad bridge.</span> <span id="s867">The other one was a traffic bridge.</span> <span id="s868">And the allies would come by and try and bomb these.</span> <span id="s869">And then the Germans would and also heavy antiaircraft.</span> <span id="s870">And when the shells broke, of course the fragments have to come down again.</span> <span id="s871">So, we would sit in the trench and have the shovels over our head for the</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: So it wouldn't hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Did they ever land on one of the people who was a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: The guy next to me had one land on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s876">He was wearing an overcoat and a jacket.</span> <span id="s877">Both had padded shoulders</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: but it tore both padding out and it knocked him down.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: But he, he had a sore shoulder, but it didn't break the skin.</span> <span id="s882">Thanks for reminding me.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s884">So, how long did this continue for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well, you've maybe heard about the Battle of Arnhem or A Bridge Too Far."</span> <span id="s886">It was a movie.</span> <span id="s887">Well, the allies were on the south side of the river.</span> <span id="s888">The Germans were digging in and the allies were shooting them.</span> <span id="s889">So, they lost too many troops.</span> <span id="s890">So, they decided that they had expendables in camps.</span> <span id="s891">So, our camp was one of the camps that provided labor to the area.</span> <span id="s892">And that night, it was my turn and there was always confusion.</span> <span id="s893">The gates were open.</span> <span id="s894">It was a blackout, quite dark.</span> <span id="s895">Two guards came marching towards each other and presented arms, about face, and marched back.</span> <span id="s896">And they did it and I watched them for a while.</span> <span id="s897">And, like I say, it was very black out.</span> <span id="s898">And the trucks were there ready to drive off.</span> <span id="s899">The gates were open.</span> <span id="s900">And I went up there and walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: You just simply walked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s903">I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s904">Not too far away was the house of a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s905">Now, he and his father were in hiding somewhere.</span> <span id="s906">But I knocked on the door and I borrowed a bicycle there and went back to my apartment the other side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: A bicycle with rubber?</span> <span id="s908">With wheels?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: The bicycle had wheels?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: It had even tires.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: It had tires?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: But she never saw the bike again.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: So, you went back to this was your grandparents' place?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yeah, but I didn't go to her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Your grandmother's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I went to the house where I had been arrested, where I'd been in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s921">And what why did you go back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well, my grandmother's house was right in between two estates that the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s923">Actually, my grandmother's garage had a cannon in it.</span> <span id="s924">The Germans had put it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: They stored their cannon in her garage?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s927">And at that time, somehow she had been able to stay in the house.</span> <span id="s928">And later on, she was kicked out and the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s929">But</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s931">So, this when you walked out and escaped from Klein Erika, that was when?</span> <span id="s932">January already or February?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No, it was about March.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Oh, so you still were there for quite a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s937">So, it's March and you go back to this other house.</span> <span id="s938">And was it safe for you there to be in that place?</span> <span id="s939">Wouldn't they come looking for you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I didn't think that the camp would really know who had brought me there.</span> <span id="s941">So,</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: And where else could I go?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: And, so, what did you do then?</span> <span id="s945">After that, you returned to this house.</span> <span id="s946">Did you go back into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I stayed there.</span> <span id="s950">And, gosh, we had, we had weapons.</span> <span id="s951">We had stun guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: So, our group went near the bridge across the canal.</span> <span id="s954">The river was further to the east.</span> <span id="s955">And the Canadians were coming up on that side.</span> <span id="s956">So, we were supposed to hold the bridge in case they came, the Canadians came across.</span> <span id="s957">They never did.</span> <span id="s958">And then one day the Germans came and they wanted our house.</span> <span id="s959">So, we could not go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: And that night the Germans ambushed the guys that were at the bridge and they were wiped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: So, this was part of your resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: And the farmer and his wife were hung in the door of the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Who was hung in the door of the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: There was a farm, and the farmer and his wife were strung up in the door of the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Because they were suspected of having helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Then later on we were asked a German General Blaskowitz had been in the southern part of Holland or not the southern, central part of Holland.</span> <span id="s970">And he had been harassed there.</span> <span id="s971">Then he was in Hilversum where the allies had their headquarters.</span> <span id="s972">And he had come to our area and we were asked to harass him.</span> <span id="s973">And, so, we went and cut his wires, telephone wires across there was a small road into the woods with three rows of birches on each side.</span> <span id="s974">It was somekind of a fire break.</span> <span id="s975">But there were two paths you could walk through more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: There were several houses, summer homes that now the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s978">The telephone wires strung through, across the road through the trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: And we were asked to cut the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: They said that I was the most technical, so it was my job.</span> <span id="s983">But we had to pull down the wires and cut out about six feet so they couldn't just splice them back.</span> <span id="s984">And we did.</span> <span id="s985">And then we cut several wires.</span> <span id="s986">Then somehow the Germans started blowing whistles and they all barged out and started shooting at each other and we backed out through the woods.</span> <span id="s987">I had a whole bunch of wires wrapped around my waist.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Yeah, the guilty guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: And that was already March, or is that April?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: That was about March or April, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Near the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Who liberated your area?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Who liberated your area finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: We did ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: You did yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Tell me how that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Well, the Canadians were on the east side of the River IJssel and the resistance decided to like I said, there were two estates with ammunition in them and a small group of Germans.</span> <span id="s1002">But then they decided that we could take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: So, we went to talk with the officer of the Germans and he said he would not surrender to terrorists, only to an allied officer, equal or superior rank.</span> <span id="s1005">But he also said that we could blow him up so he would not do anything anymore.</span> <span id="s1006">And we put a guard</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: next to the place for there was a chance that people in the town would come up and harass them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: So, it was very how would you call it quite friendly actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And then we waited until the Canadians came close, and we got one officer to come over and they surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: To that officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: But it was only one officer and the rest of the military forces were further away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And, so, what happened?</span> <span id="s1018">They came went into they were then taken prisoners of war or they just retreated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yeah, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1020">I don't know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: I guess to a POW camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1024">So, that would have been in April?</span> <span id="s1025">Would that have been in April, '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: No, that was later.</span> <span id="s1027">That was probably, yeah, late April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Late April.</span> <span id="s1029">So, very close to the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: And when that happened, when the area was then liberated, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: What did we do?</span> <span id="s1033">Get drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No, I don't really know.</span> <span id="s1036">We became the police force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">We, we then had to guard the bridge and we also we had to be recruited.</span> <span id="s1040">Several people from the village, we taught them how to shoot, just operate a rifle and gave them, I guess, about five or six rounds to shoot.</span> <span id="s1041">And then from headquarters, they would police the areA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: And we were police.</span> <span id="s1044">And then we felt that our resistance group, that we had done enough and wanted out, but we couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: We became part of the internal military forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: And the only way to get out was to join the regular military.</span> <span id="s1049">So, we all signed up for the Army, the Navy,</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Air Force, and the Marine Corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: And two other guys and I were called by the Marines.</span> <span id="s1054">My brother was called by the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1055">And then they said, "We have enough pilots.</span> <span id="s1056">Why don't you go and work at a farm for a while."</span> <span id="s1057">So, he went into the expeditionary forces.</span> <span id="s1058">He was trained in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: And what did you do then as a Marine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Well, I trained here with American Marines for the final hit against Japan.</span> <span id="s1061">But then while we were training, Japan surrendered.</span> <span id="s1062">And we had signed up for the duration of the war plus so many months.</span> <span id="s1063">But at the bottom of the contract it said unless the Minister of the Army or the Navy decides otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: So, he decided otherwise and we finished our training and were sent to Java and were there for two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: I said, oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So, you were in Java for two and a half years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yeah, got shot at by people that wanted to be free like we wanted to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was Sukarno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah, Sukarno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: So, tell me, the day that the war was over for you in Europe, do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I was in Hattem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: At your grandmother's place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: In your grandmother's place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did your grandmother know of your resistance activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I think she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: She didn't want to know.</span> <span id="s1086">Yes, she did for in the beginning sometimes we would at night clean our stun guns.</span> <span id="s1087">So, she, she knew, but</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1089">And when do you did you start communicating with your father and, and his wife and child?</span> <span id="s1090">When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: In the Marine Corps we went first to Scotland to a transient camp and then came here to the states.</span> <span id="s1092">But it was in Scotland I told them that my father or my parents lived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: The sergeant in charge of our group they were all professionals who didn't really like us for we were much better educated than they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: So, he said to write a letter to request a pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: But he never, he never sent the letter or gave the letter to the headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Then I was in transport for AmericA: And, so, I went to the headquarters and wanted to talk to the Colonel.</span> <span id="s1101">Well, I talked to a Captain and I told him</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: I had copied the letter.</span> <span id="s1104">I had just written another one.</span> <span id="s1105">I said, "My parents live here.</span> <span id="s1106">I haven't seen them since '38, and I had requested transport."</span> <span id="s1107">And he looked at it and he called out he signed the orders and gave me money.</span> <span id="s1108">And he called the Sergeant that had refused to give my request and he caught hell.</span> <span id="s1109">And I was on the train a few hours later to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: And then my father was in America.</span> <span id="s1112">So, I never saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1114">Where in London did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: In Watford just outside London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: And my younger brother I think was six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: And he spoke English very fast and I wasn't all that good.</span> <span id="s1120">So, I asked him to slow down.</span> <span id="s1121">And he looked up at me and said, "Don't be silly."</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: The things a person remembers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1125">What a disappointment that your father wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1128">And, so, then you were sent to Java?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Tell me a little bit about what that was, what that all involved, what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Well, for the Marine Corps I had applied for the artillery or the tanks.</span> <span id="s1132">But I was given some kind of aptitude test.</span> <span id="s1133">And I'm good with tools, so they made me a motor mechanic and a driver.</span> <span id="s1134">So, I learned to drive the jeeps, the trucks and tanks, any of the motor vehicles.</span> <span id="s1135">And they made me a motor mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Can you tell her really quickly how you learned to drive a stick shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: How you learned to drive a stick shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1141">Well, I didn't know anything I was in England in a truck.</span> <span id="s1142">I knew how to drive a civilian car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Not a military one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And the trucks there needed double clutching.</span> <span id="s1145">What did I know about double clutching so I could shift?</span> <span id="s1146">But</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: It was with the left hand.</span> <span id="s1149">But I really screeched the gears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Well, you learned on military equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You used to take your cigarette packs and put them on top of the wheel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Oh, that was later in AmericA: UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: But, you know forgive me.</span> <span id="s1155">I'm a little confused.</span> <span id="s1156">When you were sent to Indonesia, you were sent under which military force?</span> <span id="s1157">Was it Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps, okay.</span> <span id="s1160">Because if you were in Britain and then the United States, I wondered</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He was being trained by the American Marine Corps, but as a member of the Royal Dutch Marines.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1164">I see.</span> <span id="s1165">Okay.</span> <span id="s1166">All right.</span> <span id="s1167">So, there you are and you worked as a mechanic and motor driver for two years, two and a half years in Java?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1169">I drove more, but</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Were you just waiting to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yeah, I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Where did your life take you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Where did your life take you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: I came back to Holland for demobilization and then I went to England.</span> <span id="s1176">And I got a job there with grass dryers.</span> <span id="s1177">England and Europe did not have dollars, and cattle food with high protein and carotene was very scarce.</span> <span id="s1178">It had to come from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: They had no dollars.</span> <span id="s1181">So, there was a Dutchman that found out that if you dried grass, it grows to about four to six inches high very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: It was high in carotene and protein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Oh, for the cattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yeah, for cattle.</span> <span id="s1186">And then it could be ground up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: And these were not small factories.</span> <span id="s1189">And I got involved with that company through my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: So, you saw him finally after you returned from Indonesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And that had been probably ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: And the somehow with the grass dryers my first job would be to lay out the anchor bolts in the concrete slabs and then supervise the building of these things.</span> <span id="s1196">I have a picture somewhere.</span> <span id="s1197">I don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: And then there was a brick furnace on one end to heat the air.</span> <span id="s1200">And then there was a rotating drum and the cyclone where the air the grass was blown in, chopped up, and then dried quickly; high protein, high carotene.</span> <span id="s1201">And then it was ground into meal and then made into pellets for cattle food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s1203">How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Oh, until 1950.</span> <span id="s1205">And then I, I that job gave an awful lot of free time.</span> <span id="s1206">It was a very generous salary.</span> <span id="s1207">So, I was doing quite well and I sailed a lot in the free time.</span> <span id="s1208">I sailed the south coast of England and the Channel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">And then in 1950 we decided that it might be fun to sail across to over here and then race in the transatlantic race back to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Wow, what adventures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: So, in '50 I quit my job and went sailing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And did you sail across?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1215">You sailed across to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Sounds like you never sailed back, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Did you ever sail back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Oh, yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: You sailed back to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: The transatlantic race.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: We sailed we raced the Bermuda race and then the transatlantic race.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: That's 40foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span> <span id="s1228">I'm so impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: When did you eventually come to the United States for good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: To knock about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Just to knock around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Just to knock around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Not to really stay here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was in 1951.</span> <span id="s1240">You were just going to check out the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: And then on the steamer across I met a woman who didn't want the fish.</span> <span id="s1244">The ship was on the way out to the North SeA: When lunch was served, there was open tables.</span> <span id="s1245">I had already reserved a seat at another table, but</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Soup was served.</span> <span id="s1248">Then the steward came by with fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: And the woman next</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s1252">I was just hearing a noise.</span> <span id="s1253">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1255">Then the steward came by with the second serving of fish.</span> <span id="s1256">And the woman next to me refused and said, "No, I don't want the fish.</span> <span id="s1257">I have to go on deck to wave to somebody before we pass the yoke of Holland."</span> <span id="s1258">So, the steward asked would I mind to take her dish and I said, "No."</span> <span id="s1259">We smiled at each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: And then I got her fish dish and she never came back.</span> <span id="s1262">Then later on the afternoon she was sitting on the deck chair on deck and I asked her if she had been able to get back on the deck on time.</span> <span id="s1263">And then we would still talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: And that was the beginning of a conversation that has lasted until now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: And, so, when you came to the United States, neither of you had intended to stay here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: But you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1270">Then we had decided we might like to get married.</span> <span id="s1271">So, she went to Washington, D.C., and I went to Stamford, Connecticut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: When I told my father that I wanted to go back to the states and knock around, he said, "But you know about grass dryers.</span> <span id="s1274">They don't need them in AmericA: They're no good.</span> <span id="s1275">Learn to milk cows."</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: He said, "In the midwest, a good dairy, you can always find a job if you run out of money."</span> <span id="s1278">So, I had to work as a pupil and pay a farm to learn to milk by hand</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: first.</span> <span id="s1281">He said, "Learn to milk by hand first."</span> <span id="s1282">So, after a couple months, they gave me a good record, a letter, and I went to another farm to learn to milk by machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: And this was in Stamford, Connecticut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: No.</span> <span id="s1285">That was</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Still in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: In the states, in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Then when I came to Stamford, a friend of the family there had just bought a farm in Vermont and needed somebody.</span> <span id="s1290">And, well, I went with them for I needed a job.</span> <span id="s1291">And I milked cows for a while.</span> <span id="s1292">And then we got married in Vermont.</span> <span id="s1293">But then I came down here to (inaudible) Manor and they needed a dairy manager.</span> <span id="s1294">So, it worked out for a while.</span> <span id="s1295">And then somehow</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: And, so, you ended up staying in the Baltimore area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Yes, until we retired.</span> <span id="s1298">Then we went to FloridA: Well, every winter we took a vacation and we went to FloridA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s1300">And then you came back here to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q:
