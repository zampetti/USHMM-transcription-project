1</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Question: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: It’s finally nice to see you here in Washington, after all these months of waiting.</span> <span id="s15">So, thank you for coming.</span> <span id="s16">Lucille, let’s just start very simply tell me when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: February 1st, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in Hamburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And your name at the time of your birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Cecilia Landau.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: So, it was Cecilia all through your childhood.</span> <span id="s23">When did it become Lucille?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: When I came to New York, and the abbreviation for Cecilia was Cillie, and in English it sounds “Cillie”.</span> <span id="s25">So, somebody talked – talked me into changing the name to Lucille, Cecilia, and I should have just left it Cecilia, but it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: So, do you think of yourself as Cecilia when you think about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No, not really, but sometimes when somebody says, “Lucille, come here.”</span> <span id="s28">I don’t hear it.</span> <span id="s29">If somebody would say, “Cecilia” I would hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So, should I call you Lucille?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, Lucille is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Lucille, let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s35">Tell me about you’re growing up.</span> <span id="s36">So, first I want to know what was your father’s name and your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My father’s name was Benno Landau, short for Benjamin.</span> <span id="s38">My mother name was Sala Landau before that it was actually Sala Baumwollspinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Very long name.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And where did they meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: They met shortly after the First World War, in Cottbus, Germany, where my mother’s older brother had established a wine import-export business and was very successful.</span> <span id="s43">And, my mother – my father was already in Vienna and in Germany.</span> <span id="s44">My mother came from Sambor, Poland, because she was already in her late 20s, and there was no suitable suitor who came knocking.</span> <span id="s45">So, my grandmother sent her – she was the youngest of eight or ten children – to Cottbus hoping she would find a husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: She did, because my father worked for her older brother as a salesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Tell me what growing up with them was like.</span> <span id="s49">I know you were born in 1925.</span> <span id="s50">So, you don’t have to talk about the first couple of years unless you actually have a memory.</span> <span id="s51">What was home life like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: It was very predictable.</span> <span id="s53">It was very middle class.</span> <span id="s54">It was very secure.</span> <span id="s55">It was very unpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we went on nice vacation.</span> <span id="s56">There were music lessons and English lessons and dancing lessons.</span> <span id="s57">But we took it for granted.</span> <span id="s58">My parents were rather strict – strict in terms of schooling, of grades, strict when I didn’t practice violin.</span> <span id="s59">Children had to be seen but not heard.</span> <span id="s60">When my parents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish.</span> <span id="s61">I did not understand.</span> <span id="s62">When they talked to me and later on to my sister, it was in German.</span> <span id="s63">Occasionally, they would speak French, but not very often.</span> <span id="s64">It was – it was a nice childhood.</span> <span id="s65">The memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving.</span> <span id="s66">I really could not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very demanding.</span> <span id="s67">It was very important that a report card had an “A”, maybe a “B”, but anything below that was not acceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What would happen to you if…?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the teacher, and after ’33, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor every afternoon – one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the grades did improve.</span> <span id="s70">What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an influence on children.</span> <span id="s71">They told us that things would change.</span> <span id="s72">It would not remain this way.</span> <span id="s73">The neighbor’s children would begin to play with us again.</span> <span id="s74">The boys would no longer beat us up on the way to school.</span> <span id="s75">It would – life would normalize.</span> <span id="s76">They didn’t say exactly when, but they were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change.</span> <span id="s77">And my parents, of course, could not vote in German elections.</span> <span id="s78">They never became naturalized German citizens.</span> <span id="s79">They didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s80">We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family, to see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in Germany, are complaining about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s81">You don’t know what it’s like in Poland.</span> <span id="s82">Your economic conditions do not compare to ours.</span> <span id="s83">To me, it did not make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You didn’t understand what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No.</span> <span id="s86">I could not comprehend.</span> <span id="s87">My grandmother spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s88">She spoke Yiddish to me, and I answered in German, but I really did not comprehend.</span> <span id="s89">The family in Poland was well-off, but nothing compared to life in Germany.</span> <span id="s90">For instance, the streets in this little town were not – the streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the main street of the town, they took their shoes off because it was muddy, and I could see their feet with the – with the mud oozing through the toes.</span> <span id="s91">When we arrived by train in Poland, we were picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s92">Well, I would not go into the buggy – not with a horse in front of it that was moving.</span> <span id="s93">I was used to a black taxi with white stripes.</span> <span id="s94">So, these things I remember.</span> <span id="s95">I remember them warmly.</span> <span id="s96">I – I remember that, and I appreciate that, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Your father remained – he was in the wine business.</span> <span id="s98">He was a wine importer.</span> <span id="s99">Was he home a great deal, or did he travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, he didn’t travel at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: He didn’t travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s103">He had traveling salesman, and he was home continually.</span> <span id="s104">He came home for lunch time.</span> <span id="s105">He went with us on vacations every summer.</span> <span id="s106">It was usually a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s107">How well the business did, I never knew.</span> <span id="s108">I was never told.</span> <span id="s109">I had a small allowance, probably of 50 cents a month.</span> <span id="s110">I didn’t need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items.</span> <span id="s111">The clothing for the kids was custom made.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Was that unusual?</span> <span id="s113">The middle class that you were-</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Middle class and upper-middle class it was custom made, yes.</span> <span id="s115">In those days, a man did not buy ready-made suits.</span> <span id="s116">There were hardly any.</span> <span id="s117">I went to a private Jewish school.</span> <span id="s118">The teachers were – at that time – in their late 50s, and to me terribly old.</span> <span id="s119">They were very strict and they were very orthodox.</span> <span id="s120">You had to adhere to the rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s121">On Saturday, you didn’t take a streetcar.</span> <span id="s122">You didn’t write.</span> <span id="s123">You did not carry a purse.</span> <span id="s124">You pinned your handkerchief to your jacket.</span> <span id="s125">You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew.</span> <span id="s126">You learned Humash and Gemora and you had to translate.</span> <span id="s127">It was mandatory, five days a week.</span> <span id="s128">School was not a happy experience.</span> <span id="s129">It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that the teachers were all Jewish, very demanding and it lacked compassion, understanding for the children.</span> <span id="s130">We were told going home on the streetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not to talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember saying one day, “They want us to become invisible.</span> <span id="s131">How does one do that?”</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And who did you say this to?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I said it both to my parents and to some friends, because I could not understand the restrictions.</span> <span id="s134">I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being beaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names.</span> <span id="s135">I did not – I did not realize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So, is your memory that 1933 creates a real change for you, when you’re eight years old?</span> <span id="s137">Is that how your memory-</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: It’s between ’33 and ’36.</span> <span id="s139">It was over a three-year period.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Let me go back to your parents for just a moment.</span> <span id="s141">Did you feel closer to one parent more than another?</span> <span id="s142">Or were they both very similar for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: They were very similar both in background, in education, in upbringing.</span> <span id="s144">I would say my mother was more reserved.</span> <span id="s145">She never contradicted my father.</span> <span id="s146">She agreed with all of his decisions.</span> <span id="s147">I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed.</span> <span id="s148">She came home one day and had cut off her long black hair which was tied to the top of her head, and she came home with a fashionable bob.</span> <span id="s149">And the other thing she did – which was before I was born, but I heard the story – during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to keep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission.</span> <span id="s150">After the business prospered, she of course got it back, but I think during the middle ’30s, early ’30s, she deferred him in all other decisions.</span> <span id="s151">I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate.</span> <span id="s152">It was never mentioned.</span> <span id="s153">The decision was made between my father and my mother’s brother, younger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it.</span> <span id="s154">We might have picked up a word or two, but we would have never asked.</span> <span id="s155">That wasn’t done.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: So, when you would sit at lunch – I assume you ate lunch together with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: At two o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: At two o’clock, or dinner, would you – and after your sister was born and she became a little bit older, she was born in 1930, I think-</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Were you supposed to sit there very quietly and they would carry on the conversation, or would people ask you questions about what had happened at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: There were very few questions at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s162">The maid would sometimes bring in a dish or plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish.</span> <span id="s163">We were asked questions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s164">It was when it came time to do homework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, “No, homework first.”</span> <span id="s165">It was a typical education of the ’30s when you had to be within the role of a child, not have the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories.</span> <span id="s166">It wasn’t done.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: But you seem to remember it very fondly.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: In spite of the restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes because it was very secure.</span> <span id="s171">It was very predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging.</span> <span id="s172">It gave us a sense of being cared for.</span> <span id="s173">It gave us a sense of never missing anything.</span> <span id="s174">Anything that was necessary for a normal life or a satisfactory life was provided.</span> <span id="s175">You didn’t have to ask for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Were you happy when Karin was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes, I was delighted.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did that mean that you had a place, even though she was so much younger, to laugh and be liked?</span> <span id="s179">I mean, did it give you something that you hadn’t had?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, I wanted a sister, and I put a cube of sugar on the windowsill so the stork would come and take the sugar and bring a sister.</span> <span id="s181">Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year difference.</span> <span id="s182">She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started school, I had to listen, “Why can’t you behave like your sister?</span> <span id="s183">Why can’t you be as intelligent as your sister?</span> <span id="s184">Why do you have to talk out of turn?</span> <span id="s185">Why can’t you bring home A’s like your sister?”</span> <span id="s186">And that was a little difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So, were you a little bit rebellious in that household?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Maybe not in the household, but definitely at school.</span> <span id="s189">At school, I got into trouble here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher.</span> <span id="s192">I could think of putting thumb tacks some place, or put some glue on the chair.</span> <span id="s193">Or, when it’s later on, when the physics professor said, “Turn the Bunsen burner on low,” I turned it on high, and all the windows blew out, and my dad had to pay for new windows.</span> <span id="s194">So, I had my share of troubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did your parents explain about the Nazis, or simply said there was a change of government?</span> <span id="s196">Did you see things in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, I saw the uniforms - first the brown uniforms with the red arm bands and the hats, which was called the SA.</span> <span id="s198">We saw the children in uniform, young children – white shirts, brown skirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish necktie.</span> <span id="s199">We did not see many other uniforms at that point.</span> <span id="s200">The green uniforms came much later.</span> <span id="s201">The local police wore greenish uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Wait one second.</span> <span id="s203">The noise is really too much.</span> <span id="s204">Okay, I’m sorry, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets, but they were separate.</span> <span id="s206">Each precinct had a – each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you moved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct – name, address, occupation, tax id number, and religion.</span> <span id="s207">When you decided to move from A Street to B Street, you went back to the precinct.</span> <span id="s208">You told them where you’re moving to.</span> <span id="s209">You went to the new precinct, and you went through the procedure again.</span> <span id="s210">This system still exists in Germany and in France, and this was probably one of the reasons that you could keep tabs on people.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: But you clearly experienced a difference in terms of when you said that you felt, on the one hand, you’re invisible, on the other hand, people know you’re Jewish, and you’re receiving all sorts of punishment of one sort or another.</span> <span id="s212">So, you’re both invisible and not invisible at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Well, I was visible, but the adults wanted me to be invisible, not to draw any attention.</span> <span id="s214">While, on the other hand, we took the punishment regardless of where we stood, where we walked or what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And when you would come home having been taunted or beaten up, your parents would know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, and could tell it by the dirty clothing because it was soiled from the stones and from the dirt that they threw at us.</span> <span id="s217">Sometimes, it would be a black eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So, it was really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: It got progressively worse.</span> <span id="s220">At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical.</span> <span id="s221">But they tried to comfort us, but I think, as children, or as growing children, we were afraid and became subsequently more so.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: So, you became much more afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Of a lot of things, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So, did you then retreat into yourself?</span> <span id="s227">Did you stay at home more than you used to?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I stayed at home more, or somebody had to bring me to a friend’s house or pick me up.</span> <span id="s229">I started to draw and paint a great deal.</span> <span id="s230">My grades slipped terribly, and that’s when most of my spare time was occupied with tutors.</span> <span id="s231">The grades improved, but I don’t think the happiness changed or the unhappiness changed.</span> <span id="s232">I would have like to leave the country like many of my school friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former nationals.</span> <span id="s233">We had the protection of another government and we were untouchable.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did they say this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Now, how was Karin, your younger sister, responding?</span> <span id="s237">Equally fearfully, or was she-</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: She wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: She was not.</span> <span id="s241">She was somehow able to ignore it, to shut it out, and she was probably less molested because she was blond and curly-haired at times.</span> <span id="s242">I had dark hair.</span> <span id="s243">I was older.</span> <span id="s244">It did not seem to bother her, or maybe she was so much younger that she did not get the impact from the beginning.</span> <span id="s245">She grew into it.</span> <span id="s246">When she started school in ’35, this is the way it was.</span> <span id="s247">It hadn’t just changed overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you talk with her, once she started school?</span> <span id="s249">Did you talk about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s251">We talked about the teachers.</span> <span id="s252">We talked about grades.</span> <span id="s253">We did silly things.</span> <span id="s254">We would hide things or play tricks on our parents, or when my mother was looking for a pair of shoes, and one shoe was missing.</span> <span id="s255">We shared a room.</span> <span id="s256">The two beds were divided.</span> <span id="s257">In the middle was a big wardrobe.</span> <span id="s258">We had dolls and dolls’ carriages, and we played like normal children in a home.</span> <span id="s259">She had her friends.</span> <span id="s260">I had mine.</span> <span id="s261">But as we grew older, there was less interaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: How did your fears affect you, besides the grades?</span> <span id="s263">Were you able to sleep?</span> <span id="s264">Was it disturbed sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I was dreaming a great deal.</span> <span id="s266">When my parents would go in the evening to a concert or to the theater, to the opera, and the maid would stay with us, they normally took a streetcar or taxi.</span> <span id="s267">I would not sleep until they got home, and it was sometimes one o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s268">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s269">It was just fear – fear of something that I could not verbalize.</span> <span id="s270">I thought maybe the streetcar would crash, or the taxi would have an accident.</span> <span id="s271">There was no coherent explanation of why this terrible fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did it affect your eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes, I was a very poor eater, and the school doctor recommended that I go for summer vacation to a children’s home so I could recuperate a little bit, and my father had to convince them that we went on vacation every year, and it was, you know, there was no shortage of food, and they didn’t have to worry.</span> <span id="s274">And I never did go.</span> <span id="s275">I would not go away from home alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Do you think your personality changed as you were by yourself a little bit more and you’re painting?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, I don’t think at that point, not at that point, probably later, but not at that point.</span> <span id="s278">The change that I remember took place in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: When your father is-</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, when my father was taken to Poland, and then, of course, when I walked to school on November 10th, after the Night of the Broken Glass, and I saw the synagogues burning.</span> <span id="s283">I saw the stores vandalized, and we turned around and went back home.</span> <span id="s284">That’s when it really became clear to me that this was not a place to stay or to live, but since I had no influence, there was nothing I could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And, you’re over 13 then, 13 and a half or something right?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s287">I could have gone on a children’s boat to England, but I would not go alone, not without -</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Not without your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: No, just alone, and you wouldn’t do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Tell me about your nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Then or now?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Then.</span> <span id="s295">Now we’ll do later.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: My nightmares then were of accidents, of vehicles crashing, of streetcars derailing, of trains catching fire, because they had old-fashioned locomotives, of catastrophes.</span> <span id="s297">I was worried in a thunderstorm.</span> <span id="s298">I was petrified of lightening and these were the nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And you’re in these situations all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Right, right, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Do you survive them or you don’t survive them in the dreams?</span> <span id="s302">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I know that I talked in my dreams and I know that I screamed in my dreams, and I know I woke.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Now, before your father is sent to Poland, in 1937, you leave the place where you’ve been living all your life.</span> <span id="s305">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: In 1937, my father voluntarily closed the business.</span> <span id="s307">I assumed the reasons to be because we were Jewish, but it really wasn’t the main reason.</span> <span id="s308">The main reason was that he didn’t need the business.</span> <span id="s309">There was enough money.</span> <span id="s310">There was enough income.</span> <span id="s311">There was sufficient real estate.</span> <span id="s312">So, why bother?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So, he was getting sufficient income from the real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: And he just voluntarily liquated in ’37, and his brother in Palestine, who left from Berlin in ’34, asked that we come, and they said, “No, we are not coming.”</span> <span id="s317">And the letter that my father wrote to my uncle, which was lost but I know of the letter, was if he can eat doves in this country, why should we come with a Bunsen burner to Palestine?</span> <span id="s318">So, that was never a consideration of leaving the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Although you had it in your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes, because my classmates left, and it was an adventure.</span> <span id="s321">I did not know what it meant to go to Palestine, or to the USA.</span> <span id="s322">It was a change.</span> <span id="s323">It was an adventure.</span> <span id="s324">Everybody was doing it.</span> <span id="s325">Why shouldn’t I do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Did you say this to your parents?</span> <span id="s327">Did you say-</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I said, “Why can’t we leave?</span> <span id="s329">Everybody else is leaving.”</span> <span id="s330">And they said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s331">It’ll be – it’ll be okay.”</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: So, in ’37, you don’t leave the apartment, you stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Towards the end of ’37, we lived in a condominium, and the whole complex – and the street is still standing – made it clear that the six or seven Jewish families who occupied I would say a total of probably a hundred condominiums, they were no longer desired, and would we please sell our interest and move.</span> <span id="s334">And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a Jewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but acceptable area, and all I remember of that apartment is that it had a tiny little orthodox synagogue in the backyard.</span> <span id="s335">We never went there, but there was one, probably a hundred members at the most.</span> <span id="s336">The other thing I remember is that on November 10th or 11th, we had a knock on the door at four in the morning, and there was my mother’s brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the night in a train from Cottbus to come to Hamburg to escape the arrest of all males which took place on the 10th of November.</span> <span id="s337">So, they were hiding out in that apartment for a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: But that’s after your father’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: My father was already in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Now, let me ask you something that I forgot to ask you about.</span> <span id="s341">Was yours a religious home in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">It was religious because both my families came from an orthodox home.</span> <span id="s344">All the laws were observed.</span> <span id="s345">There were some rabbis in the family on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s346">My grandmother wore a wig, and I found that very amusing because she would lift it like you lift a cover on a pot of potatoes, and then she’d put it back.</span> <span id="s347">And – but when my parents came to Germany, they somewhat – they became somewhat more liberal.</span> <span id="s348">The congregation they belonged to we would call today “conservative” rather than “orthodox”.</span> <span id="s349">The home had separate dishes.</span> <span id="s350">Kashrut was observed, but I would say looking back probably not a hundred percent, only 80 percent, but as far as school was concerned, it was very orthodox.</span> <span id="s351">So, they tried not to upset me with giving me two sets of values – the more liberal value at home and the orthodox value at school, but yes, it was a religious household.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And that was comfortable for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s354">It was customary.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And were most of your friends orthodox, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay, let’s go back up to ’37-’38.</span> <span id="s358">How is it that your father is taken?</span> <span id="s359">Does he receive a notice?</span> <span id="s360">Does someone come to the door and say, “You’re a Polish national”?</span> <span id="s361">And why aren’t you all sent out, why only your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supplied – was supposed to supply a stamp or a validation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be no non-Jews.</span> <span id="s363">But, for some reason, he refused.</span> <span id="s364">Whether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not, he refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s365">The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, “You’re no longer a valid foreign national living on German ground.”</span> <span id="s366">At five-of-one in the morning, they rounded up – they came to our door.</span> <span id="s367">They rang the bell, and it was local police.</span> <span id="s368">And they said, “You have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you to a schoolyard downtown.”</span> <span id="s369">And my father said, “My wife just had surgery three months ago.</span> <span id="s370">Can she stay with the children?”</span> <span id="s371">And my sister and I stood in the hallway and listened, and since he was a local policeman, he said, “All right.</span> <span id="s372">You come with me, and I let the family stay.”</span> <span id="s373">By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and they had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as much, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my father a suitcase with some clothing.</span> <span id="s374">But they also said for my mother not to go because they would keep her.</span> <span id="s375">She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down.</span> <span id="s376">It was heavy.</span> <span id="s377">I took public transportation.</span> <span id="s378">I took the subway – the underground and the above-ground, and I dragged that suitcase all the way down to the schoolyard.</span> <span id="s379">The gate was open and I started looking for my father, but there were a great many people – men, women and children, and he found me.</span> <span id="s380">I gave him the suitcase, and I remember distinctly saying to him, “Come home with me.</span> <span id="s381">The gate is open.</span> <span id="s382">There is no guard.</span> <span id="s383">There are no people.</span> <span id="s384">Just come home and we’ll hide, or something.”</span> <span id="s385">And my father looked at me and he said, “That wouldn’t be the honorable thing to do.”</span> <span id="s386">I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the rules.</span> <span id="s387">When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to have currency in a foreign country, my father took the money that was in Holland and brought it back to Germany.</span> <span id="s388">So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later that you don’t have to.</span> <span id="s389">He could have just walked out.</span> <span id="s390">Nobody would have said a thing, and some people did, but very few.</span> <span id="s391">He was pushed over the border.</span> <span id="s392">The Poles pushed back, and the Germans pushed him in.</span> <span id="s393">They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen.</span> <span id="s394">He stayed there two months.</span> <span id="s395">He tried to come back to Germany.</span> <span id="s396">He couldn’t get an entry visa, and he went to Sambor, to mother’s family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse me, when he got permission to come back for four weeks.</span> <span id="s397">In the meantime, my mother decided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room apartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s398">She handled the shipping.</span> <span id="s399">She handled the packing.</span> <span id="s400">She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve every single item that went out of the country.</span> <span id="s401">She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we packed fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Who drank?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: The two Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: The two Gestapo, not your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s406">She just talked to the packers, “Hurry up, pack.”</span> <span id="s407">We did not take anything of any particular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry – whatever we normally had in the apartment, but the faster the better.</span> <span id="s408">The two crates were packed.</span> <span id="s409">They were picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste.</span> <span id="s410">We, in the meantime, had to give up under new German laws the apartment and we were assigned to a room on Werder Street Five.</span> <span id="s411">In the meantime, my father was granted permission and he came back.</span> <span id="s412">I think the permission partly was through the intervention of my mother who hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s413">She wrote.</span> <span id="s414">She went in.</span> <span id="s415">She talked to them.</span> <span id="s416">They threatened with arrest.</span> <span id="s417">She didn’t give up.</span> <span id="s418">I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it absolutely amazed me.</span> <span id="s419">When my father came back, we started to work on an affidavit for the United States, and it certificate for Palestine.</span> <span id="s420">The four weeks ran out.</span> <span id="s421">My mother got an extension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September 1st, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with hats and long, black leather coats, and it was September.</span> <span id="s422">It was warm.</span> <span id="s423">And they asked for my father, and they said that Germany is at war with Poland.</span> <span id="s424">We have invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s425">You are an enemy alien, and you have to come with us.</span> <span id="s426">And that was the first day of the Second World War.</span> <span id="s427">He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbüttel, which later became a concentration camp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home a briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all intents and purposes within two weeks.</span> <span id="s428">They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and the moment that became a fact, my father was transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to Sachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming.</span> <span id="s429">It was sort of an aerogram with one sentence: “I’m fine.</span> <span id="s430">I hope you are fine.</span> <span id="s431">Love, Ben.”</span> <span id="s432">These letters became less and less frequent, until one arrived from Dachau.</span> <span id="s433">We had never heard of the place.</span> <span id="s434">My mother made, I would say, twice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying to work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter every week to the head of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s435">The end result was that they brought my father to Gestapo headquarters for an hour’s visit.</span> <span id="s436">He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform and matching cap.</span> <span id="s437">We were sitting on opposite sides of the table, no touching.</span> <span id="s438">We talked but nobody could talk.</span> <span id="s439">My mother assured him she would try.</span> <span id="s440">It was a Catch-22.</span> <span id="s441">To go to Shanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars, but you weren’t allowed to have American currencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us.</span> <span id="s442">Our accounts had been blocked.</span> <span id="s443">Our money had been confiscated.</span> <span id="s444">We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no more.</span> <span id="s445">We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven.</span> <span id="s446">I still went to school.</span> <span id="s447">My sister still went to school.</span> <span id="s448">We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at that time by a Doctor Plaut (ph).</span> <span id="s449">Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s.</span> <span id="s450">He was unmarried.</span> <span id="s451">You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope.</span> <span id="s452">We pleaded for papers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp, and he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very well known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940.</span> <span id="s453">We heard rumors.</span> <span id="s454">He married a very much younger woman with two young children, and he remained, as I’m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty much into the war ’43-’44.</span> <span id="s455">He ended up in Palestine.</span> <span id="s456">My father remained in Dachau and one man was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother and I went to see him one evening after curfew, and we saw this six foot tall man who was a skeleton – no front teeth, shaven head – and when my mother asked him, “How is Benno?”</span> <span id="s457">He said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s458">He managed to leave Germany with his wife and two children, and he promised to help once he would be outside.</span> <span id="s459">Going back to ’39, when my father returned from Poland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my father a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, “And what do I do after the three days?”</span> <span id="s460">And being Italian the man said, “Go, and worry later.”</span> <span id="s461">My father wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s462">He was murdered in Dachau in February 1941.</span> <span id="s463">The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did.</span> <span id="s464">They brought us a cigar boxes with ashes.</span> <span id="s465">Whose ashes?</span> <span id="s466">We will never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Who was at the door when they - ?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I opened the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: You opened the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: And, they said, “Mrs. Landau?”</span> <span id="s471">And I took them to the kitchen, and they threw the box on the table, and they said, “Ashes, Benjamin Landau.”</span> <span id="s472">And my mother screamed, and something on the stove was burning, and they left, and that was February ’41.</span> <span id="s473">I went to school in the daytime.</span> <span id="s474">I did homework, sewing at night because we needed the money desperately, and we had to move to another furnished room.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s476">When these men come in and they throw this cigar box on the table and your mother screams, what do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s478">I stood frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You just stood there.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I just – I couldn’t comprehend.</span> <span id="s481">First of all, I didn’t know what cremation was.</span> <span id="s482">I had never been to a cemetery.</span> <span id="s483">I didn’t know what ashes meant at this point.</span> <span id="s484">It was a concept that was not within the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s485">So, it took minutes or – I don’t know how long it took to really comprehend what it was.</span> <span id="s486">Somebody called the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach, and it was an orthodox burial although it was not in accordance with law.</span> <span id="s487">And we never found out whether those are really his ashes.</span> <span id="s488">The body – the ashes were buried in the Jewish cemetery in Hamburg, and we managed to save some money and give it to a non-Jewish business acquaintance to set a stone, and the stone still stands.</span> <span id="s489">We lived in this apartment until Fall ’41, when we received notification for resettlement, and all it said was “East” nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Okay, I want to come back a little bit.</span> <span id="s491">I’m assuming that the luggage, when you went down the first time, when your father was taken in ’38, was a fairly piece of luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: It was actually a big suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: You, who talk about being so frightened through this period, all of a sudden, you’re going to take this luggage because you know it’s too dangerous for your mother.</span> <span id="s494">Were you frightened when you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I didn’t think.</span> <span id="s496">I knew I had to deliver it, one way or another, and I just – I couldn’t carry it, either.</span> <span id="s497">I dragged it, and luggage didn’t have wheels in those days.</span> <span id="s498">No, I wasn’t – I was probably apprehensive, but not frightened.</span> <span id="s499">I knew I had to take it someplace, and that was all that mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: And when you saw your father, did you hug each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Were you annoyed with him, angered with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, I cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Frustrated with him that he – you cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And he cried?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: No?</span> <span id="s511">And when he wouldn’t come with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Well, he pushed me towards the gate.</span> <span id="s513">He turned me around and said, “Please go.”</span> <span id="s514">And I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And did you cry all the way home?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I tried not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did you walk or did you take the subway?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: It was too much to walk.</span> <span id="s519">I took the subway again.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: You said you were surprised at how your mother behaved.</span> <span id="s521">That she seemed to change from the woman you had known, so that once her husband was gone, she took over as the head of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And fairly easily I gather from what you-</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Well, she felt driven.</span> <span id="s525">She felt if she didn’t do it, who would do it?</span> <span id="s526">And she believed truly that she could get my father released.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Now, when you came home that day, did you want to fall into your mother’s arms crying, or did you go to your room?</span> <span id="s528">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I think that night we – my sister and I – slept in the big bed in my parents’ bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: With your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did your mother cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: So, that must have been very hard on both of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Did you know what to do?</span> <span id="s537">I mean, there’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: There was nothing.</span> <span id="s539">There was nothing to say or nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Did friends come over?</span> <span id="s541">Other women who had also lost their husbands, or who hadn’t but were friends with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: No, because everybody stayed at home by the phone hoping.</span> <span id="s543">So, nobody came over, but the phone lines went back and forth, “Have you heard?”</span> <span id="s544">“What do you know?”</span> <span id="s545">“Will we get the stamp in the passport?”</span> <span id="s546">“Will they let them come back next week?”</span> <span id="s547">It was conjecture, nobody really knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s549">Now, during this period, before your father returns for that month and then another four weeks and another four weeks, the money that you have as far as you know is the same amount that you have had before.</span> <span id="s550">They haven’t confiscated the money yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, they didn’t get around to that yet.</span> <span id="s552">That only happened after the 1st of September when Poland was invaded.</span> <span id="s553">Until that time, we had free access to bank accounts, to anything within Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Right, and your mother didn’t move money some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, it was unthinkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Unthinkable to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: It was unthinkable.</span> <span id="s558">I know sufficient people moved it to Switzerland or to Holland or – no, it just was illegal, and you didn’t do things illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Right, and you’re smiling.</span> <span id="s560">When your father is taken the second time, does this feel more ominous to you?</span> <span id="s561">You’re older now of course and you do-</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, it did not, because he was treated for the first two weeks under the Geneva Conventions as an enemy alien, and believing, or having learned about the Geneva Conventions, I mean, after all it couldn’t be bad.</span> <span id="s563">You could bring laundry once a week, and pick up laundry once a week, and do the same over again.</span> <span id="s564">And I don’t think we even contemplated the end of the war or Poland losing the war.</span> <span id="s565">I think we naively anticipated a settlement, international intervention, or something of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So, when did you start to worry?</span> <span id="s567">When he’s taken out to Oranienburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s569">Once they shipped him to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, and Dachau, then we began to realize that there is a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did you expect him to return in your head or were you pessimistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: My mother did.</span> <span id="s572">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And how do you know she did?</span> <span id="s574">She said it?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: She talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And you never said to her…?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No, because there were other men taken at the same time, I either knew their sons or their daughters, and several of them perished or were murdered, and I did not believe that there was escaping Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And now the money is…?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Blocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Blocked.</span> <span id="s581">And you get a hundred dollars a month from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Out of our account administered by the Deutsche Bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And by the Gestapo, under supervision of the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So, life is getting narrower and tighter and harder for everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: We should take a break now, the tape is running out.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Once your father is taken away and ends up in Dachau, and your mother is now again the head of the household, because I imagine when he returned even for those 12 weeks, he became head of the household again?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So, then it comes back to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: And her spirits keep up because she’s fighting to try to get him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yes, because our neighbor next door had a typewriter, Mr. Berman, and he would write the weekly letters to the Gestapo to release my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And she would dictate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Well, she would tell him what to write, and she would sign them and either deliver them or mail them week after week.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Now, you’re old enough to notice some changes.</span> <span id="s599">When your father comes back, does she change?</span> <span id="s600">Does her personality seem to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: A little bit.</span> <span id="s602">Not entirely to what it was before.</span> <span id="s603">She was very reassuring that the certificate from Palestine would come.</span> <span id="s604">She was very supportive.</span> <span id="s605">But any initiation, any discussion, any plans were made by my father, and she agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: She agreed?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So, he didn’t change very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: That you noticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: When you saw him when he had been taken the second time, you saw him in the prison, and then you saw him later, did he change significantly?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: He lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s614">He was always slim, but not gaunt, and he was gray.</span> <span id="s615">His skin was gray and gaunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Did that frighten you?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So, it must have been tough when you folks left him and you go back with the memory of what he was looking like and where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes, but we still believed there was a chance to get him released.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Would little Karin go with you, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: She was by then eight, nine – nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Right, so you would all go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s626">Yes.</span> <span id="s627">The building where we saw him still stands.</span> <span id="s628">And when I come to the corner, I cross the street.</span> <span id="s629">I just don’t want to walk past it.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: What was the funeral like?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: The funeral was small because there were few people left.</span> <span id="s632">It was like all the orthodox funerals.</span> <span id="s633">It was a plain, pine coffin.</span> <span id="s634">The rabbi cut the lapels of the coat, and I really don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s635">It was an open grave.</span> <span id="s636">There was a seven-day shiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s639">There was really nothing to say because there were so few Jews left or so few Jews willing to come out to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s640">There was a minion.</span> <span id="s641">There were some visitors to the house during the week.</span> <span id="s642">It didn’t seem real.</span> <span id="s643">It seemed like you had seen a film, but it really didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did you notice a change in your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes, she was very withdrawn, very quiet, very disinterested in the daily routine.</span> <span id="s646">We had to shop in special stores, food stores.</span> <span id="s647">The food coupons had a “J” on them.</span> <span id="s648">The rations were, of course, smaller.</span> <span id="s649">And she, in a way, sent me out to do the errands.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So, did you then have to take more responsibility in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Did you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes, I understood it to the extent that I went to the largest department store who, before the 9th of November was Jewish but no longer, and I said I could sew.</span> <span id="s654">Could they give me dresses to sew at night?</span> <span id="s655">And they said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s656">And they gave me the design – a plain shirt top with a pleated skirt.</span> <span id="s657">And I was sewing at night after school.</span> <span id="s658">I was sewing on Saturdays, and my mother didn’t say a word that you don’t sew on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s659">And I got paid once a week in a little brown envelope, and after six weeks the lady in charge said, “The skirts are crooked and the sleeves are backwards and the collar doesn’t close.</span> <span id="s660">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s661">We can’t use you.”</span> <span id="s662">I mean, I was – I had taken a course in school, but I was not a seamstress.</span> <span id="s663">I was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: But, you certainly were trying, weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I was trying.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Were you disappointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, I was heartbroken.</span> <span id="s668">I was later on told by a lady that I should have tried in the infants department.</span> <span id="s669">It would have been so much easier, but that of course had never dawned on me, and by then you couldn’t get jobs for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: And how was Karin during this period?</span> <span id="s671">Did she understand that your father is gone forever?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: She understood, but on a different level.</span> <span id="s673">She also came with Scarlet Fever during that time, and she had to be put into a public hospital behind a fence.</span> <span id="s674">We could talk to her through the fence, but it was highly contagious.</span> <span id="s675">In those days, there was no medication.</span> <span id="s676">And after six weeks she came back home.</span> <span id="s677">She understood that he was gone, but she didn’t understand for how long, or why, or how permanent it would be.</span> <span id="s678">That came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And did she ask you where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: No, she didn’t ask because she was at the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: So, she knew in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: She knew on some level that there was a grave and there was something in the grave.</span> <span id="s683">She did not understand about the ashes.</span> <span id="s684">Why would a human being become ashes?</span> <span id="s685">That did not make sense at all, and I couldn’t explain it.</span> <span id="s686">I just couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: This is a strange question I just thought of, but I’m going to ask it anyway – did they put the cigar box into the coffin?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Just as it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: That’s Hallakik (ph) Law, yes.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, cremation is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s692">You don’t do it.</span> <span id="s693">And they did not know how to handle it because I don’t think the rabbi, who was probably in his 60s, had ever had any experience.</span> <span id="s694">He was a very learned man, and he made the decision and he said he would defend it and _______ if necessary, and the box, the way we received it with a rubber band, was put into the coffin.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So, that was-</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: That was February 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: So, you go from February ’41 until October 21st when you get the notification.</span> <span id="s698">So, you’re not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Your mother’s not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: But I’m going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: But you’re going to school the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And your mother gets more and more reserved and withdrawn.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Withdrawn, quiet, resigned probably is the proper word for it.</span> <span id="s706">She still talked to people.</span> <span id="s707">We still occasionally saw an old family friend, but there was no – no joy.</span> <span id="s708">There was no laughter.</span> <span id="s709">There was no – there was no plan for any kind of a future.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So, when you would eat together whatever the very small amounts of food you had, conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: It was always quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: And did you play with friends still?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes, I still had friends.</span> <span id="s716">There was still a youth organization.</span> <span id="s717">There was still a so-called “House of Culture” for Jews, and there were films; sometimes there were ping- pong games.</span> <span id="s718">I belonged to Bar Kochba.</span> <span id="s719">There were even dance classes.</span> <span id="s720">And I went dancing with the son of Rabbi Callabah (sp) who was a Hassidic Jew in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: But he used to dance, when we were 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: So, do you recall any moments of pleasure during that period.</span> <span id="s724">I mean, were these kinds of things in some sense a relief?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, they were a relief, and there were moments when you just lived that moment.</span> <span id="s726">You did not think about it, but when you went to them, you felt guilty, and yet the following week, you went back again.</span> <span id="s727">You probably – I probably knew that this was not the thing to do, but I did it.</span> <span id="s728">There were light moments.</span> <span id="s729">They were cheering when Bar Kochba won the ping-pong game.</span> <span id="s730">I remember my old fashioned record player the Andrew Sisters.</span> <span id="s731">I remember some American jazz, which was not permitted, but for five dollars you could have a copy made on a wax platter.</span> <span id="s732">So, we learned to dance swing, which was the latest rage.</span> <span id="s733">There were even fashion trends.</span> <span id="s734">The boys would wear trench coats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim.</span> <span id="s735">The girls would wear pleated skirts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles.</span> <span id="s736">That was the style.</span> <span id="s737">Stockings were no longer available so you painted your legs and you put a black line on the back.</span> <span id="s738">Silk stockings were unobtainable.</span> <span id="s739">And if you had a pair, you had them forever repaired.</span> <span id="s740">Clothing coupons Jews did not get.</span> <span id="s741">If there was clothing available in the store, we couldn’t buy it.</span> <span id="s742">The children or the young people did not mind.</span> <span id="s743">It wasn’t that important.</span> <span id="s744">What was important was to be with other young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did your mother not want you to go, or she didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: She didn’t say anything, but they – I had the impression that she felt that it showed disrespect.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: That it would show disrespect to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: To the year of mourning for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I see, but you obviously were not going to respond to that somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: She did not say so.</span> <span id="s751">She did request that we observe the first 30 days, and after that she did not say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: And, when you were with young people, I imagine you talked about what was going on in some way, or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: We talked about those people that had good chances of leaving – how, when, where, by what means.</span> <span id="s754">Do you take a boat to Shanghai or do you take the overland railroad?</span> <span id="s755">We talked about Palestine.</span> <span id="s756">We talked about the small groups that were smuggled into Yugoslavia and that made it as far as the Mediterranean and then swam into Haifa, and they were put in Turkey prison.</span> <span id="s757">We knew of course that England was heavily involved in the war.</span> <span id="s758">We were being bombed during that time.</span> <span id="s759">We had to go into air raid shelters, and Jews had to be in one corner.</span> <span id="s760">Not that there were many.</span> <span id="s761">But I think we were fairly aware of the fact that England couldn’t possibly win the war.</span> <span id="s762">It was too small a country, too far away, and there was no more Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s763">There was no more Austria.</span> <span id="s764">There was no more Poland.</span> <span id="s765">Holland was overrun.</span> <span id="s766">We did not see any hope.</span> <span id="s767">There was talk of Madagascar, of settling us in Madagascar, and then it turned out it was a joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: And how did you hear about Madagascar?</span> <span id="s769">From the other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s771">I remember my mother going to Berlin when Molotov was in Berlin and signed the agreement with Hitler.</span> <span id="s772">The reason for my mother going was that the city of Sombor became Russia.</span> <span id="s773">It was the first town on the Russian border.</span> <span id="s774">And she thought that by going to Berlin maybe she could get a temporary passport, or maybe there would be a possibility to go there – all sorts of unreal schemes, but you tried anything.</span> <span id="s775">And I remember the visit to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: You went with her or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I went along and we had to stay with a girlfriend of an old acquaintance of the family because you couldn’t stay in a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Was that an expensive trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: No, you went by rail.</span> <span id="s780">It took four hours.</span> <span id="s781">We went third class because a) we didn’t have the money, and b) you’re less conspicuous.</span> <span id="s782">I remember when we used to travel to Poland, we traveled first class and the upholstery was red plush and it itched when you sat on it, and at night the porter would make our beds.</span> <span id="s783">So, the Berlin trip was quite different.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Do you still have a radio in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: There was a radio in the apartment and a telephone, and I think the radio and the telephone belonged to Mr. Berman because he had privileges by reason of an intermarriage, and two sons – I think they even were on the Wehrmacht, if I’m not mistaken, later in the war, and so he had the privilege of radio, but it was not a short wave.</span> <span id="s786">It was just local stations.</span> <span id="s787">And I think he had a telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did you ever hear Hitler speaking on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Yes, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: I even saw him once.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Where did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: We went downtown, and that was in the mid ’30s, into the district where all the department stores were like a small Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s794">And all of a sudden, the SS and the SR were pushing the people from the sidewalk facing the street on both sides, and a motorcade appeared, open, and Hitler was standing with his right arm raised, looking right, looking left, and everybody raised their right arm.</span> <span id="s795">And I stood in front of my mother –she was a little bit taller than I – and she put her right arm on my head instead of raising it over me.</span> <span id="s796">She put it on my head.</span> <span id="s797">We were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I just sort of squeezed in between the other young people.</span> <span id="s800">I just, nothing.</span> <span id="s801">I was petrified.</span> <span id="s802">I heard him speak many times, or rave, it was not speaking, but that’s the only time I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: And what did you think or feel when you – I gather you heard him on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Did he make you nervous?</span> <span id="s806">Did you think he was just crazy and this couldn’t last?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: I –I just couldn’t understand this ranting and raving because even to a young person, it made so little sense.</span> <span id="s808">And then when he talked about race and Jews and the international conspiracy, and Jews own all the money and all the banks.</span> <span id="s809">I once asked in school, and the man who taught history was Professor Eunice, and I said, “What is the percentage of the Jews living in Germany?”</span> <span id="s810">And it was less than one percent or something, and I said, “But we can’t own all that they say that we do own.”</span> <span id="s811">It didn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s812">I could not comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: For childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I had neighbor kids, upstairs, downstairs, and we would play before ’33, but that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: But that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: So, you actually never had a conversation…</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: …after ’33…</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: …with someone who wasn’t Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, my mother occasionally with a neighbor.</span> <span id="s827">My father occasionally over the phone with business associate of some sort, but very cautiously, very carefully, and not really detailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And when you would walk on the street, you would see police, soldiers – would people move away from you?</span> <span id="s829">I mean, you didn’t have any -</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: If I went by myself, I could pass.</span> <span id="s831">If the SS walked by – mainly the SR, the brown shirts, I could just sort of blend in, so to speak.</span> <span id="s832">If I was walking with somebody else, I was out of luck.</span> <span id="s833">I mean, it was immediate.</span> <span id="s834">I don’t know how the Poles today can tell that I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s835">When I go today to Poland, they say, “Oh, a Jew from America.”</span> <span id="s836">How they can tell I don’t know, but the Germans could, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: The Germans could?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: How would you hear about restrictions?</span> <span id="s840">Were there curfews, places where you couldn’t go?</span> <span id="s841">Were their notices in Jewish newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: There were notices on the movies, on the park benches.</span> <span id="s843">It was in newspapers, “Jews are no longer permitted on the street after dark.”</span> <span id="s844">There was a newspaper called Der Stuermer, which was the official organ of the Nazi party, with distorted pictures of Jews.</span> <span id="s845">One of them had my uncle in it, the one who had the big business in Cottbus.</span> <span id="s846">No, the restrictions were publicized mainly in newspapers or, for instance, on stores.</span> <span id="s847">Early on, “Don’t Buy Here.</span> <span id="s848">It’s a Jew.”</span> <span id="s849">Later on, when they were taken over by non-Jews, it was no longer an issue because the names were changed.</span> <span id="s850">We went to a park in winter and people would slide down the hill, and that was no longer permitted, “Jews No Entrance.”</span> <span id="s851">In summer, in that park on every bench, “Jews Forbidden.”</span> <span id="s852">I don’t think you could hire a taxi as a Jew.</span> <span id="s853">It was no longer possible.</span> <span id="s854">It was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: And could you ride on the subway or the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: We did during day hours, but towards the last year that we lived in Germany, we did not ride together.</span> <span id="s857">We would take the train, but everybody would take a different compartment or a different train.</span> <span id="s858">Not that two or three people would sit next to each other.</span> <span id="s859">I would take the first train.</span> <span id="s860">My mother would take the second train, and we would know where we get out.</span> <span id="s861">We went out once after curfew, one time only, and we almost got caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Why did you ride separate trains?</span> <span id="s863">Were you already conscious that you could just be picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s865">And later on trains were no longer allowed for Jews, and Jews had to turn in cars, those who had cars.</span> <span id="s866">The Jews who were German nationals had to hand in their gold and silver after the Kristall Night, to pay for the damages.</span> <span id="s867">It was strange going into a store where you had gone all your life to buy some material for a dress, and all of a sudden you felt like everybody was looking at you.</span> <span id="s868">Or you were afraid they would call the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Because you weren’t allowed there or because…?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We were not supposed to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s872">At this period, did you begin to regret that you had not gone to England alone?</span> <span id="s873">Did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: You didn’t think of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I regretted that we did not go when we could have gone to Palestine in ’34.</span> <span id="s877">That I regretted.</span> <span id="s878">But going away alone, I never regretted.</span> <span id="s879">I would have never done it.</span> <span id="s880">And while all of the children – 10,000 of them – that did go from Austria and Germany survived, except my girlfriend who was hit by a bomb in mid-town London, they came out very bitter and very resentful elderly people.</span> <span id="s881">There’s now the organization of Kindertransport and they’re very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: They feel there is compensation due them which they never received.</span> <span id="s884">They feel they were used as maids or taken out of school at age 14, and sent to learn a trade rather than study at a university, and they feel that they suffered unjustly and they never received an apology.</span> <span id="s885">They never received compensation.</span> <span id="s886">It’s a very vocal organization, at least in California.</span> <span id="s887">And I can fully understand where they come from and why they feel this way, but it is now the year 2001.</span> <span id="s888">They left in ’39.</span> <span id="s889">Most of them lost their parents, not all, but a great many.</span> <span id="s890">What are they trying to accomplish with the bitterness and with the publicity?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So, are you glad that you didn’t become one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, the only reason I’m not one of them because I was just fearful of leaving.</span> <span id="s893">It had nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s894">I was in Washington once for the meeting of Hidden Children, and they are very, very angry, and very bitter, and very – I would say almost – for them, it’s almost impossible to cope with these two or three years in which they were hidden in France, or Belgium, Poland, wherever.</span> <span id="s895">So, there is a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s896">It’s a matter of degree.</span> <span id="s897">I think we all sustained some, more or less, but it’s strange that it took 60 years to surface.</span> <span id="s898">There were no social workers.</span> <span id="s899">There was no psychiatric help.</span> <span id="s900">There’s help given now, but what good will it do an 80 year old person?</span> <span id="s901">Too little, too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Your furniture was packed up and went to Trieste in order to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: And did it get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: No.</span> <span id="s907">So, why didn’t it get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: It got stuck in the harbor in Trieste until 1945.</span> <span id="s909">In 1945, my uncle from Haifa paid the storage and had it shipped to Haifa.</span> <span id="s910">One of the crates – well, it was a container, it wasn’t a crate – was broken into, and it was the one container that contained my mother’s silver and jewelry.</span> <span id="s911">While they didn’t empty it out, I don’t have one place setting.</span> <span id="s912">I’ll have one fork and I’ll have two spoons, but I won’t have any knives.</span> <span id="s913">My uncle received it into ’45 or ’46 in Haifa.</span> <span id="s914">He asked me what he should send me – oriental rugs or silverware, whatever.</span> <span id="s915">I said, “I want the pictures that were in the crate.</span> <span id="s916">And if there’s any jewelry of my mother’s, I would like it, and everything else please do whatever you think you want to do with it.</span> <span id="s917">I don’t wish to.”</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: So, your understanding of what’s happening, once your father dies when there’s this period of a number of months before you get the notice, do you expect to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No.</span> <span id="s920">There was no rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: So, when -</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: We assumed they would use us for workers in factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s927">Especially the young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: So, is your fear level gone down some?</span> <span id="s929">Are you getting used to it, or is it very high?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: You get used to fear.</span> <span id="s931">You get used to looking over your shoulder.</span> <span id="s932">You get used to limitations such as rationed food and living in a small room.</span> <span id="s933">You adjust.</span> <span id="s934">You accept whatever is given you, but then there was a war, and there was a glimmer of hope that maybe Germany would lose the war, even in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s936">So, October 21st, 1941, you get a relocation notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes, we each had a suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Well, what happened?</span> <span id="s939">You got something in the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes – no, it didn’t come in the mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: They delivered it?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Some came delivered and some came registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And who delivered it.</span> <span id="s944">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Gestapo delivered it?</span> <span id="s947">And how did it come to you?</span> <span id="s948">Someone delivered it to the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes, I believe somebody delivered it.</span> <span id="s950">I don’t know who took the notice because there were about eight families living in that one apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And we read the notice, and everybody said, “There’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s953">Pack what you can.</span> <span id="s954">Take three suitcases, and the rest just leave.</span> <span id="s955">We’ll give it away or whatever.”</span> <span id="s956">There wasn’t much.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Left anyway.</span> <span id="s958">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: No.</span> <span id="s960">No.</span> <span id="s961">And we reported.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: So, what did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I took a coat.</span> <span id="s964">I took some clothing, but there wasn’t much.</span> <span id="s965">I took what little I had.</span> <span id="s966">And I had a little small briefcase, and I put some stationary into it, and some addresses, and some letters I had received from friends in Palestine, and that I carried with me and everything else was checked.</span> <span id="s967">And after two days or a day and a half, then it was called Lódz, and it still stands and I was inside in September, and I asked the director, “Do you know what this place was?”</span> <span id="s968">in 1941, and he knew.</span> <span id="s969">There were 1,100 of us – men, women and children.</span> <span id="s970">The Jewish Community sent some representatives to tell us that it would be okay and not to worry.</span> <span id="s971">There were some prominent leaders of the community on that particular list.</span> <span id="s972">It was the first transport.</span> <span id="s973">We were put into cars, railroad cars, with wooden benches.</span> <span id="s974">And after two days, two and a half days, we arrived in a very sunny, dusty place – no railroad station, no personnel, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Excuse me, what was the trip like?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: The trip was quiet except for whimpering children.</span> <span id="s977">There was more children on there or young people on that train.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: This wasn’t a cattle car with nothing in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: This had benches?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Benches.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: On the sides of the cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: No, the way – regular wooden benches – the way you have them now in an upholstered train.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And was there a toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did you remember how one…?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s988">I think they had buckets in the hallway, and each compartment had a sliding door.</span> <span id="s989">The windows were locked from the outside.</span> <span id="s990">So were the doors, and on the outside were German soldiers riding along the guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: And did you bring food as well?</span> <span id="s992">Or did they feed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s994">We brought little candy, a few pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s995">It was a custom in Europe anyway, when you went on a train, you packed your own food.</span> <span id="s996">You never went to the dining car.</span> <span id="s997">So, we did take some food, and the lady next to us gave us some candy.</span> <span id="s998">And that’s all I remember – I remember about the ride.</span> <span id="s999">Nobody really spoke because the uncertainty and the bewilderment was still strong that you couldn’t put it into words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Did you meet somebody named Julie and Julius?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yes, they sat next to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: On the train.</span> <span id="s1003">This couple sat next to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Next to us on the train.</span> <span id="s1005">We started to talk, and she asked me, “Do you know the Rosenbergs in Hamburg?”</span> <span id="s1006">I said, “Yes, Latti went to school with me.</span> <span id="s1007">We were good friends.”</span> <span id="s1008">She said, “Did you know her ten year older brother, Howard?”</span> <span id="s1009">I said, “Yes, I’ve met Howard once, but he didn’t talk to little girls ten years younger.”</span> <span id="s1010">She said, “Oh, my husband was a friend of Howard’s.”</span> <span id="s1011">I said, “That’s nice.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Did you like her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yes, she had red hair that was turning gray.</span> <span id="s1016">She was chubby.</span> <span id="s1017">She had a wonderful smile.</span> <span id="s1018">She had teeth that had never been corrected that were spaced too far apart.</span> <span id="s1019">It was said later on that she was called as a young girl “Red Fox” and she supposedly was a beauty.</span> <span id="s1020">And her husband was small, bald, chubby, and a little bit crumpy (ph) and quiet, but nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And was she the age of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No, much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: My mother was born in ’92.</span> <span id="s1025">She must have been born at least six, seven years earlier.</span> <span id="s1026">Maybe ten years earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: I’m going to suggest that we take a break now, and when we come back we will begin with the entrance into Lódz.</span> <span id="s1028">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Okay, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Lucille, there’s one piece of the earlier story that we neglected.</span> <span id="s1031">There may be many pieces, but one piece that I know about that we neglected.</span> <span id="s1032">Namely the putting on of the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s1033">And you do have a story of taking it off and going somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Well, we were ordered to wear the star – left-hand side, not on the back, just in front, and it was 1941.</span> <span id="s1035">I think it was September.</span> <span id="s1036">And you were very conspicuous, more so than ever, which was not a happy situation.</span> <span id="s1037">And we had a neighbor in the apartment in which we lived who was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s1038">She had some privileges that we did not have, but she was kind.</span> <span id="s1039">She was quite elderly probably in her late ’60s, and very plain-looking, almost like a woman from the country, and she didn’t have to wear a star.</span> <span id="s1040">And since I loved opera since I was about 10 years old, she suggested one evening that we go to the Staats Opera in Hamburg, and I told her that I could not with my star.</span> <span id="s1041">I was not permitted.</span> <span id="s1042">And she said, “Just take it off.</span> <span id="s1043">You go with me, and we stand in the last row, standing room only, and nobody will know the difference.”</span> <span id="s1044">It didn’t make a difference.</span> <span id="s1045">We enjoyed the opera, but I really worried a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: And what was the opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: It was a German opera.</span> <span id="s1048">I think it could have been the Freischutz by Karl Maria Von Weber, but I wouldn’t swear to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: You’ve liked opera since you were 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes, my parents took my first to the easy ones – Magic Flute, La Boheme – the French and the Italians.</span> <span id="s1051">And since I played music, it – I was not fond of a concert, but I loved opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yes, and I still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: So do I.</span> <span id="s1055">Why didn’t you like concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Because when I grew up, a lot of the concerts were composers that I was not too fond of, and I preferred chamber music.</span> <span id="s1057">It’s more intimate.</span> <span id="s1058">You get more out of the music.</span> <span id="s1059">I like baroque music.</span> <span id="s1060">I recently listened to Malas (ph) Symphony, and I enjoyed it, but it was – it was hard work to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: It’s interesting because chamber music is often a taste for somebody who’s much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: I grew up with it.</span> <span id="s1063">I grew up with it.</span> <span id="s1064">Both my kids play woodwinds, or used to play woodwinds, baroque flute, piccolo, clarinet.</span> <span id="s1065">So, chamber music was very much taken for granted.</span> <span id="s1066">My husband loved chamber music.</span> <span id="s1067">He loved Telemann, and I never asked why or how come, it just was natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: And did you continue to play violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: No.</span> <span id="s1070">I gave it up with the deportation to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: And I never touched another-</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Another instrument?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Another instrument, no.</span> <span id="s1075">I would never go back to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Why do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Well, first of all, I had to give up the instrument itself, which was not a Stradivarius, but it was a good instrument.</span> <span id="s1078">And something about the orchestra – two of my friends played in it in Auschwitz – made me decide not to go back to it.</span> <span id="s1079">I also would never buy a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s1080">Boots became very fashionable a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1081">I can’t buy a pair of boots, but that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: We’ll come back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: So, now we’re going to enter Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: When you think of the first moment that you got off the train, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I saw the German soldiers lined up.</span> <span id="s1088">The railroad cars were opened.</span> <span id="s1089">We were ordered to come out.</span> <span id="s1090">We were ordered to line up in rows of five, and we saw a whole group of men in black jackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of David, and on their jackets were also yellow stars.</span> <span id="s1091">The Germans handed us over to these men.</span> <span id="s1092">The name given to them was “ghetto police”.</span> <span id="s1093">The ground was sandy.</span> <span id="s1094">It was dirty.</span> <span id="s1095">It was not a railroad station.</span> <span id="s1096">We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were thrown on that wagon.</span> <span id="s1097">The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police explained to us – mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish – that we had to walk into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1098">My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in Polish, “Where are we?</span> <span id="s1099">What is the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1100">What’s going on?”</span> <span id="s1101">And on the hour and a half or two-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to my mother that it was the city of Lódz, which was familiar to her.</span> <span id="s1102">It was the ghetto, which was an area that was totally enclosed.</span> <span id="s1103">And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn’t look at us.</span> <span id="s1104">They looked ragged.</span> <span id="s1105">They looked tired.</span> <span id="s1106">They looked ill-fed and ill-dressed.</span> <span id="s1107">And we saw buildings that were dilapidated.</span> <span id="s1108">Some were – some streets were paved; others were not.</span> <span id="s1109">We saw no vehicles.</span> <span id="s1110">We saw no automobiles.</span> <span id="s1111">We saw no trucks.</span> <span id="s1112">But he explained to my mother, and she translated, that the ghetto was an area that was fenced in and guarded by Germans.</span> <span id="s1113">There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1114">And my mother made a very flippant remark, “Well, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can.”</span> <span id="s1115">And he said, “Hardly.”</span> <span id="s1116">They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street.</span> <span id="s1117">This school evidently had been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what used to be classrooms, lecture rooms.</span> <span id="s1118">We eventually got our suitcases.</span> <span id="s1119">We put our coats or whoever had a blanket on the floor, and that’s how we lived for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1120">The Jewish ghetto administration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup.</span> <span id="s1121">This soup was mainly water, very little else.</span> <span id="s1122">In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was bitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance.</span> <span id="s1123">It had no coffee.</span> <span id="s1124">And at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany.</span> <span id="s1125">Some of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belts, into shoes.</span> <span id="s1126">And those of us who had some money – some more, others less – you could go into the courtyard and the people who had lived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little piece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything edible, and we would buy it with this German money, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money.</span> <span id="s1127">It was special ghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly money, and that we were by far overpaying.</span> <span id="s1128">When we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called “western” belongings – a silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse – whatever any family had brought along and it was deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food.</span> <span id="s1129">These things were not sold for money.</span> <span id="s1130">They were bartered for food.</span> <span id="s1131">I remember seeing my mother in the courtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: How big of a – like a small piece of bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Oh, I would say maybe 200 grams – a small piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1134">The ghetto bread was about – it was a round loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1135">It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight wedges once we got our permanent food rations.</span> <span id="s1136">And I took my mother’s example, and I had a purse.</span> <span id="s1137">And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1138">I traded the purse for some bread.</span> <span id="s1139">It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good-looking gentleman probably ten years older who had a briefcase, and he wanted to give me one piece of bread and I said, “It’s too little.”</span> <span id="s1140">And they laughed.</span> <span id="s1141">They didn’t speak German and I didn’t speak Polish, but we managed.</span> <span id="s1142">And I stood there for two hours and eventually they came back and I got two pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s1143">But even that had limitation because you ran out of tradable goods.</span> <span id="s1144">Nobody had jewelry.</span> <span id="s1145">That had to be left for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1146">And what was left was really the bare essentials, not more than that.</span> <span id="s1147">After six weeks, we were assigned to various rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Stop for a minute.</span> <span id="s1149">What happens to washing and sanitary conditions?</span> <span id="s1150">There’s no bathrooms in the place.</span> <span id="s1151">There’s no showers, bathtubs, nothing.</span> <span id="s1152">So, what happens to you physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: There was a pump in the courtyard, and if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a bucket, you would borrow it.</span> <span id="s1154">In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and then you make do without soap.</span> <span id="s1155">This school had outhouses in the backyard.</span> <span id="s1156">The outhouses were used by 1,100 people.</span> <span id="s1157">They were filthy.</span> <span id="s1158">They were unsanitary.</span> <span id="s1159">People got sick.</span> <span id="s1160">There were accidents.</span> <span id="s1161">You washed and we used to call it a cat’s wash because you really couldn’t wash.</span> <span id="s1162">There was no privacy.</span> <span id="s1163">There was no place.</span> <span id="s1164">There was no room.</span> <span id="s1165">I remember standing in a corner holding up a blanket.</span> <span id="s1166">My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa.</span> <span id="s1167">So, sanitary conditions didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1168">At night, we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1169">In the daytime, we sat on the floor.</span> <span id="s1170">Crowded, one body next to the other.</span> <span id="s1171">And eventually, six weeks later, we were assigned to various rooms throughout the ghetto on both sides of the bridges.</span> <span id="s1172">The older part of the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city.</span> <span id="s1173">It used to house Jews and non-Jews, but had been vacated for Jews only.</span> <span id="s1174">We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little newer section on the front side of the bridge.</span> <span id="s1175">We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with four other people.</span> <span id="s1176">We had two or three wooden cots.</span> <span id="s1177">My mother brought a little wardrobe so we didn’t have to hang the clothing on the damp walls.</span> <span id="s1178">The view out of the window was a barbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down.</span> <span id="s1179">So, we did not go near the window.</span> <span id="s1180">At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could come out because it was wartime.</span> <span id="s1181">And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no lumber.</span> <span id="s1182">We slowly took out of the wooden cots one board at a time, cut it up for heat and for cooking.</span> <span id="s1183">We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1184">The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers.</span> <span id="s1185">When a food ration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and how much, and what items.</span> <span id="s1186">You had to bring your own containers, and during the first week, you stood in line for about three hours until you got your food.</span> <span id="s1187">If you waited beyond that, there were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: And this was hot food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: No, this was-</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: This was a little bit of brown sugar at a time, a little bit of what they called ground coffee, a loaf of bread for a certain period of time, sometimes there was flour.</span> <span id="s1192">Once I got horsemeat, but only once.</span> <span id="s1193">And it was not really enough to sustain a human being.</span> <span id="s1194">And the conversation wherever you went centered around food.</span> <span id="s1195">The houses had no running water.</span> <span id="s1196">You had to carry a bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water.</span> <span id="s1197">There were no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s1198">The toilets were outhouses in the backyard.</span> <span id="s1199">There were no showers.</span> <span id="s1200">There were no bathtubs.</span> <span id="s1201">There was no transportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another.</span> <span id="s1202">There was an internal police force.</span> <span id="s1203">There was a fire brigade.</span> <span id="s1204">I don’t think it was ever used, and aside from the police force there was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult tasks which larger, with larger food allotments, and some of these men were decent, and some were brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Lucille, let’s stop now and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Lucille, I usually don’t do this, but I wanted to give a sense to those people who will watch the interview that, as far as I know, there were over 31,000 departments in the Lódz ghetto, and a little over 700 had running water.</span> <span id="s1209">Just for a people to get a sense of this population of over 200,000 people, what you were living in, in terms of the sheer physical conditions let alone everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: None of my friends or acquaintances had running water.</span> <span id="s1211">I had one friend that I did not know until after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water, but nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1212">There were houses out in Marysin, where Rumkowski lived, they had running water.</span> <span id="s1213">It was the slum of a city.</span> <span id="s1214">Running water was not the customary thing to have.</span> <span id="s1215">The city also didn’t have a sewer system.</span> <span id="s1216">The sewage ran between the street and the sidewalk, raw sewage, and you jumped over it as you crossed the street.</span> <span id="s1217">There was no underground canalization like for instance in Warsaw or in Paris or in Rome.</span> <span id="s1218">It didn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: So, the stench must have been unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: So, was the typhus – the stench, the typhus, the summers, the snow and frost in the winter, and people just dumped their buckets and it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1221">It – you had ceased to care, to observe sanitary conditions or laws.</span> <span id="s1222">There was really no way one could solve this problem.</span> <span id="s1223">It was – it was not solvable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: So, I’m just trying to get a sense of time.</span> <span id="s1225">Those first six weeks, this is the most shocking thing that happens to you – I mean, other than the shock of the death of your father, but that’s a different kind of a shock.</span> <span id="s1226">This is a physical as well as a psychological shock to you to be taken to Lódz and to be living under conditions that you’ve never come – you’ve never lived like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s1228">It was a shock, and yet we believed, in the first six weeks, that once we get housing, once we get a room in a building, be it wood or concrete, conditions would be more normalized.</span> <span id="s1229">It never really occurred to us that most buildings would not have a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1230">I thought there would be maybe a bathroom on each floor or a shower.</span> <span id="s1231">The ghetto did have a bathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get in.</span> <span id="s1232">The ghetto had a laundry.</span> <span id="s1233">Once I had a coupon and I bought some sheets, and it took me six months to get them back.</span> <span id="s1234">They were sort of washed, but six months because the laundry did work for the Germans and for the higher-ups within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1235">So, while some of the civilized amenities were within the ghetto, they were far and in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And, during this, before you moved to Pawia Street, these first four to six weeks, do you see – you’re living with 1,100 people in a very small building.</span> <span id="s1237">Do people change a lot?</span> <span id="s1238">Do people start fighting with each other?</span> <span id="s1239">Do you see things even amongst the three of you where there are changes and it’s difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: It was stressful.</span> <span id="s1241">People did argue.</span> <span id="s1242">“This was my space and why did you take my space?”</span> <span id="s1243">And “take this away and put this there.”</span> <span id="s1244">It was community living at its worst.</span> <span id="s1245">It brought out the very best in very few people.</span> <span id="s1246">It brought out the worst in most of us.</span> <span id="s1247">And I don’t think anybody was really to blame because to come out of the normal life into conditions of deprivation, of inhumanity, dehumanization – it’s indescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: How’d your mother change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: She became very quiet.</span> <span id="s1250">When we first came into the ghetto, she thought, because she spoke Polish, she had lived among Poles, she had lived among Jews in Poland, she was educated in Lwow, she thought it would be manageable.</span> <span id="s1251">It would be possibly a little bit the way her life had been before the first World War.</span> <span id="s1252">But I don’t think she fully expected the hunger, and the filth, and the sickness within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1253">That was something that was incomprehensible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Your sister is 11, and you’re 16.</span> <span id="s1255">So, what is it for her?</span> <span id="s1256">Is it harder for her because she’s so much younger?</span> <span id="s1257">Or is it not harder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: No, it wasn’t harder for her.</span> <span id="s1259">She just took it more or less in stride.</span> <span id="s1260">She didn’t quite understand what this was all about.</span> <span id="s1261">She once asked about the barbed wires or the soldiers with guns.</span> <span id="s1262">She remarked once on the lack of a playground.</span> <span id="s1263">Or she wanted a little roll with butter and there were no rolls in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1264">But she did not – it did not have a full impact on her, not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Did she have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Nobody had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: So, the kids did not play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: There were very few kids.</span> <span id="s1271">There were mainly elderly people.</span> <span id="s1272">There were quite a few teenagers, but kids eight or 10 far in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: What about you?</span> <span id="s1274">What happened to you during those first couple of months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Well, I went throughout the building to see if there was anybody I knew.</span> <span id="s1276">I met a couple of classmates, schoolmates.</span> <span id="s1277">I looked at the young people who brought the soup, and laid out the portions.</span> <span id="s1278">And I was guessing or thinking how does one get a job like that, but I had trouble with the language.</span> <span id="s1279">I could understand some of the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen words, no more.</span> <span id="s1280">So, there was no communication.</span> <span id="s1281">There was no possibility to make any connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: But, there are, I don’t know, at least a few thousand Germans who went into the Lódz ghetto, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Over a period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: But not when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Not when we came.</span> <span id="s1286">Later on, there were transports – several from Berlin, several from Vienna, five from Prague, one from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1287">I think there were in excess of 20,000 people brought in from what was called “Western Europe.”</span> <span id="s1288">At that time, we were told we didn’t read it and we didn’t hear it, of a speech made by Rumkowski that 20,000 Jews had been brought in from the West and there was neither enough housing for them, and the Germans would make no allowances for it, and there was not enough food for them.</span> <span id="s1289">It was considered a tremendous burden on the already existing ghetto population.</span> <span id="s1290">And we were very unwelcome.</span> <span id="s1291">We were made fun of.</span> <span id="s1292">We were the ones from the West, the spoiled ones, the arrogant ones.</span> <span id="s1293">And in a way, it was true.</span> <span id="s1294">The majority of the German Jews especially, not so much the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least if they didn’t come with it, it started within the ghetto, “We will teach them how to do things here, and we will change things in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1295">And we will run the ghetto the way we are used to running things in Germany.”</span> <span id="s1296">And that turned out to be a big mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Because there was a lot of hostility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: There was a lot of hostility, and you can’t walk into somebody else’s house and turn it upside-down.</span> <span id="s1299">And of course, the Polish Jews would not hold still for it, which resulted in the fact that there was no employment for us.</span> <span id="s1300">We were by and large disliked.</span> <span id="s1301">We were called names, not nasty names, but not flattering names either.</span> <span id="s1302">You felt almost like an outcast among your own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: So, you were in – it’s not the same situation you were in Germany with the Nazis or the German non-Jews against you.</span> <span id="s1304">But there’s somewhat of a similarity within the context of this horrible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Yes, but I was used to this situation.</span> <span id="s1306">I went to a German-Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1307">And the school had about ten children who had Polish parents.</span> <span id="s1308">And when this became known, the parents of the – of all those students said, “Don’t play with those Polish Jews.”</span> <span id="s1309">So, it was Jew against Jew on the one side.</span> <span id="s1310">It was the same again now.</span> <span id="s1311">And that, at that very beginning, something told me that you were sitting again between two chairs.</span> <span id="s1312">If you want to live here in any way and get work, you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s1313">And it was hard; there was no school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: So, how did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: By listening and by talking.</span> <span id="s1316">And I made horrible mistakes but people smiled.</span> <span id="s1317">They thought it was very cute that a 16 year old would at least try.</span> <span id="s1318">It took me six months and I spoke Polish grammatically incorrect.</span> <span id="s1319">I didn’t know if two houses were male or female, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1320">People found it amusing, and it helped.</span> <span id="s1321">It gave me a chance at communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: And, your mother could speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: My mother was educated and she spoke Polish, and French, and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Did she try to get a job or was she – or did she not even try?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: She tried at very first, but nobody would hire in 1941.</span> <span id="s1326">There was not enough work within the ghetto to fully employ everybody.</span> <span id="s1327">Work was not mandatory; it was not considered forced labor.</span> <span id="s1328">You worked and you received the noontime soup.</span> <span id="s1329">But you didn’t have to work if you didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1330">It afforded you no other privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Except the noontime soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Right, because money was very little and worthless.</span> <span id="s1333">So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe factory and in the hat factory, but they wouldn’t hire her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: So, the people who are working are getting noontime soup plus the rations that you are all getting.</span> <span id="s1335">And you would cook these rations in your little room – or try to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: If we had enough material to hit the little stove because sometimes you got items that weren’t even combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening.</span> <span id="s1337">And if you shared a room, and you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, it very often happened that by evening something had disappeared.</span> <span id="s1338">Somebody in the room was so hungry, they couldn’t resist.</span> <span id="s1339">That was very, very common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: I think with – within two months, maybe two and a half months.</span> <span id="s1342">We were definitely starving by the end of the year, before Christmastime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: And thirsty, I would imagine, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: We did drink the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Yes, that’s why we got typhus.</span> <span id="s1347">It was really not much else to drink because it was difficult to heat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to make this so-called coffee that we were distributed.</span> <span id="s1348">I remember one ration and it was four pounds of salt.</span> <span id="s1349">I remember a ration of a half a pound of citric acid.</span> <span id="s1350">Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are you going to do with that quantity.</span> <span id="s1351">It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was distributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany.</span> <span id="s1352">There were, we heard, other items, but they were in small supply and they went to the elite of the ghetto administration, not to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: I’m worried about the sound.</span> <span id="s1354">Is that going to be all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">[Break in tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Could you take some of these rations and go to this market – there was an outdoor market, and try to get some food of some kind, or was there very little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Again, during the first six months there was an outside area where you could buy a rotten apple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else would like to sell.</span> <span id="s1358">You could trade.</span> <span id="s1359">You could barter, but it was pretty senseless.</span> <span id="s1360">You didn’t gain much by it.</span> <span id="s1361">And the market eventually just closed down for lack of interest and for lack of supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: So, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1363">So, you’re in Pawia Street, in the end of November, beginning of December?</span> <span id="s1364">Something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Now, your mother’s 50th birthday is January 5th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: And she’s beginning to deteriorate at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: With a disease or by starvation, her body is…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Well, starvation takes a strange form.</span> <span id="s1374">Your body swells.</span> <span id="s1375">Your legs and your feet become double its normal size.</span> <span id="s1376">It is difficult to walk.</span> <span id="s1377">You can’t get into a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1378">Those are the first signs of starvation.</span> <span id="s1379">It does ultimately affect you in other ways, as well.</span> <span id="s1380">It is just that the body responds to lack of nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: And this is what was happening to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: This was happening to her and thousands of others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So, what could you do for her?</span> <span id="s1384">Was there anything that could be done?</span> <span id="s1385">Did you try with some desperation to get food, to get more food, rather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: The only thing that I could try is sell whatever of my clothing I did not need or I did not want.</span> <span id="s1387">And that I gradually sold for food, but I didn’t have much clothing to start out with, and I only had two pair of shoes in not very good condition.</span> <span id="s1388">Shoes would have brought a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1389">The stockings were in such disrepair that the repairs on the back of the heel reached halfway up to the knee.</span> <span id="s1390">We kept repairing it with thread because you couldn’t buy new ones.</span> <span id="s1391">But you could buy a lipstick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half a block from Balutaring.</span> <span id="s1394">And I guess the lady must have had a cosmetic store before the war, and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and on the corner was a hairdresser and you could get a permanent if you had the right currency or enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: And there were enough people to keep open this cosmetic store who would buy things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I do not how much rent they paid.</span> <span id="s1397">I don’t know who owned the building.</span> <span id="s1398">It was a little shack.</span> <span id="s1399">There was demand.</span> <span id="s1400">The ladies or women who were in fact within the ghetto were well-dressed.</span> <span id="s1401">They wore hats.</span> <span id="s1402">They wore decent boots or shoes, and they wore cosmetics.</span> <span id="s1403">The ghetto had several tiny little holes in the wall and you could get a manicure for one Mark.</span> <span id="s1404">But you had to have the Mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: And I gather you never did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: I did it once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1409">I once had a Mark.</span> <span id="s1410">I just wanted to now what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Because you had never had one before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: And what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I think – I thought it was totally superfluous.</span> <span id="s1415">It was ridiculous, but I liked to see people with that bright red nail polish, which I’ve never worn since.</span> <span id="s1416">And it was very fashionable because women, Jewish women in Lódz, were very elegant, emancipated, very Western, very anti-religious customs, and quite different from what I had expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: So, they were more modern in some ways than where you came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: If one wants to use that kind of terminology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: But, then, I also was older than – than I observed the same circumstances as a child.</span> <span id="s1421">So, I was more aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Did you ever buy lipstick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: My mother had a lipstick that she had bought in Paris during the World’s Fair.</span> <span id="s1424">I think it was ’36 or something like that, and I used that lipstick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: So, you did use lipstick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Later on, not right away, later on as I got older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Did your mother make-up herself so you would look better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Before the war, she used lipstick but then she rubbed it off so it wouldn’t be so obvious.</span> <span id="s1429">She had her hair done once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: You’re talking about Germany now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Yes, and she used powder and other cosmetics, but it was of no interest to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: So, when your mother begins to take on the symptoms of what one might call the disease of starvation, the diseases that come with starvation, do you kids sit in the house – the apartment with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door.</span> <span id="s1434">It must have been around January.</span> <span id="s1435">And in walked a short little man by the name of Adolf Goetz, and he had lived around the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street.</span> <span id="s1436">We lived on Braumsen Way (ph).</span> <span id="s1437">We didn’t know him but we’d wave from the back window.</span> <span id="s1438">He had a short little wife with very curly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony.</span> <span id="s1439">And he came in with another man and he used to be a dentist in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1440">I think it was Rosenblum.</span> <span id="s1441">And he had remembered us and he said to my mother, “I have been given permission to open an office.</span> <span id="s1442">Would you allow your daughter to work in that office?”</span> <span id="s1443">My mother said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s1444">“Well, she doesn’t get much money.</span> <span id="s1445">You know how it is, but she’ll get a daily soup.”</span> <span id="s1446">Adolph Goetz had a terrific sense of humor.</span> <span id="s1447">He was probably not even five foot tall.</span> <span id="s1448">He wore glasses, and he had a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face.</span> <span id="s1449">He had been a playwright.</span> <span id="s1450">He had been an engineer.</span> <span id="s1451">He had a son in South America some place, and he convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto needed improvement and beautification.</span> <span id="s1452">And he hired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called Intelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree, among them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich.</span> <span id="s1453">And they were supposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds.</span> <span id="s1454">And I was supposed to do some typing, but I couldn’t type very well, and write the explanations to these blueprints.</span> <span id="s1455">And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to Balutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused.</span> <span id="s1456">And we got the midday soup.</span> <span id="s1457">The office was on Rybn, 8.</span> <span id="s1458">And oh, Adolph must have been in his late ’60s at a guess, and for fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories.</span> <span id="s1459">And he would make little airplanes out of them, and just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk.</span> <span id="s1460">That went on for several months.</span> <span id="s1461">I didn’t know what to make it, but it was sort of funny.</span> <span id="s1462">But he complained bitterly about the lack of food, but the office remained for about six months, and then he was summoned by Rumkowski, and he was told, “I’m terminating the office.</span> <span id="s1463">I’m closing down the office.</span> <span id="s1464">And all of you can look for other jobs.”</span> <span id="s1465">In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of course I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1466">And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well.</span> <span id="s1467">And everybody tried to get a job someplace else.</span> <span id="s1468">Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber department for Goodman.</span> <span id="s1469">Some others found employment some place else, and by then it was July.</span> <span id="s1470">And my mother died on the 30th of July 1942 of hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Were you with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: No, I was not at home.</span> <span id="s1473">It happened in the afternoon, and the next day the black little wagon with the white horse came and picked up the dead bodies throughout the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1474">We did not hear.</span> <span id="s1475">My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk.</span> <span id="s1476">And in the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies.</span> <span id="s1477">And most bodies were between two boards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag.</span> <span id="s1478">We found my mother’s body.</span> <span id="s1479">And we took two shovels.</span> <span id="s1480">And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1481">So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it was deep enough to bury her.</span> <span id="s1482">We put a wooden marker on it.</span> <span id="s1483">We scratched the name with a stone on the marker, and we walked back.</span> <span id="s1484">From that day on, I think, my sister stopped talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Talking.</span> <span id="s1487">I couldn’t get through to her.</span> <span id="s1488">I looked around for a school for her.</span> <span id="s1489">I couldn’t find a school.</span> <span id="s1490">But I heard that one of the factories in the back room employed children, but it actually was a school.</span> <span id="s1491">I tried several.</span> <span id="s1492">And I was asked by the directors of the factories, “If I give you a place for your sister, what will you give me in return?”</span> <span id="s1493">And I explained that I had no jewelry nor did I have money.</span> <span id="s1494">And the answer was laughter.</span> <span id="s1495">I did not comprehend.</span> <span id="s1496">In the end, I did find her a place.</span> <span id="s1497">I asked her if she enjoyed it, if she learned Polish, if there were other children – she wouldn’t answer.</span> <span id="s1498">And, I, in the meantime, looked for work.</span> <span id="s1499">I found some work in the factory sewing ladies’ dresses, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin.</span> <span id="s1500">And I worked at a machine for a while.</span> <span id="s1501">And the interesting part in that factory was that it employed young people my age, a little older, and they were very intent on striking, on asking for more food.</span> <span id="s1502">One young woman named Fajga made us walk, those willing to walk, around the courtyard, “No food.</span> <span id="s1503">No work.”</span> <span id="s1504">It took an hour, and the police – the Jewish ghetto police – came into the courtyard and took her away.</span> <span id="s1505">She returned the next day a little bit black and blue, and she laughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: She laughed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: She laughed.</span> <span id="s1508">She had a boyfriend and she said, “We’re not going to give up.</span> <span id="s1509">We’re going to organize for food.”</span> <span id="s1510">By that time, I got afraid.</span> <span id="s1511">But there were brave souls who still marched, “No Food, no soup, no work.”</span> <span id="s1512">“No food, no work” in Yiddish and Polish, and she was taken away a second time.</span> <span id="s1513">The first time she was warned to cease and desist, not by Rumkowski, but by someone who was sent by him.</span> <span id="s1514">And when she was taken the second time, she didn’t return for a week.</span> <span id="s1515">She came back in very bad shape: black and blue, a missing tooth, and she no longer demonstrated.</span> <span id="s1516">By then it was September, and the announcements were of the ghetto – No, first Rumkowski made a speech that the Germans had demanded that the old and the very young be deported from the ghetto, and he had to comply with German orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Can I - because these are the big deportations – can I go back a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Yes, there was one in May that I had skipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: May of ’42, before your mother died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Yes, and that took out most of the elderly Jews that had come from the West, most of them with very few exceptions.</span> <span id="s1521">We were on the list.</span> <span id="s1522">And I took our three Polish passports.</span> <span id="s1523">And I went from one administration to the other to convince them that we were not German.</span> <span id="s1524">And somebody in the administration who worked for Neftalin, his name was Kaplan, finally, after two days agreed to delete our names and we stayed.</span> <span id="s1525">That was in May before my mother died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: And did you have an instinct that another deportation couldn’t possibly be better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: We had the instinct – here we knew of the misery.</span> <span id="s1528">If you go someplace else, what is going to await us?</span> <span id="s1529">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s1530">And I would say by an old Jewish saying, “What you have you have.</span> <span id="s1531">You know, you know your enemy.</span> <span id="s1532">If you go someplace else, what will you have?”</span> <span id="s1533">We did not know.</span> <span id="s1534">So, the instinct – our instinct was – I don’t know how other people felt because we had very, very little contact with other Jews that had come from the West except for the Eichengreens, who really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1535">They thought it couldn’t be worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: This is Jules and Julius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Right, and – but, we decided, my mother and I, that it would be better to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: And your mother by then is not very well, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: No, she was not well.</span> <span id="s1540">It was my doing that we were permitted to stay, because I ran around with these Polish passports speaking German.</span> <span id="s1541">And people just looked at me.</span> <span id="s1542">They just laughed.</span> <span id="s1543">It was a joke.</span> <span id="s1544">It couldn’t be for real.</span> <span id="s1545">Somebody who has a nationality can speak the language, but in the end, they agreed.</span> <span id="s1546">We could stay.</span> <span id="s1547">After my mother died…</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: I want to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1549">It’s very unusual, I think, for two children to not metaphorically bury their mother but to really bury…</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: …one of their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: You never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: I would imagine.</span> <span id="s1554">It must have been one of the worst days of your life in your memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: I have not been back to a funeral for 50 years.</span> <span id="s1556">And I’ve had friends and relatives die, and I could not go.</span> <span id="s1557">I could not go to my father’s grave.</span> <span id="s1558">I couldn’t go in a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1559">It was not feasible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: How did you do it, the two of you?</span> <span id="s1561">You carried your mother’s body?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Yes, with those two boards.</span> <span id="s1563">How did we do it?</span> <span id="s1564">I really can’t answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: And did you say to each other, “We have to bury her.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: We didn’t speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: You just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: We just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Did you see anyone else doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: No.</span> <span id="s1571">It was a hot July, on the 20th of July, maybe 21st.</span> <span id="s1572">We didn’t see a soul.</span> <span id="s1573">There was no caretaker.</span> <span id="s1574">There were no gravediggers.</span> <span id="s1575">There was nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Were you crying when you were digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: You were just digging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: No tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: And did you say prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: No, no prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: You just finished and left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: And left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: And did you and Karin hold hands walking back to hold on to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: I think we did because it was a long walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: And did you go back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: We went back to the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: And clearly you did not whatever sitting shiva would be, you did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: So, there’s no – you can’t mourn, you just have to-</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: No, there was – whether you shut out the feelings consciously or whether there just were no more feelings left, I will never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: So, you never cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Not then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Not then.</span> <span id="s1597">And Karin simply stops talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: I mean, really physically-</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Really physically stopped talking.</span> <span id="s1601">“Yes” and “no” was about the most I got out of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: And do you know whether she was talking when she went to school, or did she…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: I assume not, but I never went to the school because I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1604">I assumed she didn’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: And of course in that circumstance so many people were suffering, who’s going to take care of this little kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Right, and then there were other little kids.</span> <span id="s1607">She wasn’t the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Now, you tell this story about this person who says, “What will you give in exchange?”</span> <span id="s1609">You did not understand.</span> <span id="s1610">What do you understand now?</span> <span id="s1611">What was he doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Well, I learned in three years in the ghetto, that you pay for sex – you pay with sex for a favor, but I did not understand it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: So, you came to understand that this was not an unusual feature of the ghetto for women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Not within the next – within the following two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: You learned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: That I learned, but not in 1942.</span> <span id="s1617">In ’43 and ’44, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Okay, so September comes…</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: And the first I heard from a young messenger who delivered messages from the administration.</span> <span id="s1620">She was a dwarf – crippled, Jewish, grew up in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: In the old orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Helenowek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Helenowek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: She was very, very poor.</span> <span id="s1627">They lived in one room in a little suburb.</span> <span id="s1628">She had a brother and a sister older, no mother, and a father, and she told me that Rumkowski had made a speech that morning, or would make a speech the next morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Now, this is Branya.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and children, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1633">And the wording of the speech was, and that I think is a matter of record, “Mothers and fathers, give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive.”</span> <span id="s1634">There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were thrown, but police was present.</span> <span id="s1635">He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they wouldn’t take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick.</span> <span id="s1636">He got the number decreased by a thousand and various other justifications.</span> <span id="s1637">Those who heard the speech and those who found about it were appalled.</span> <span id="s1638">It was – the concept was unthinkable.</span> <span id="s1639">During the process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the lists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient.</span> <span id="s1640">They enforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7th.</span> <span id="s1641">We were not supposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights.</span> <span id="s1642">The Germans came into the ghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns.</span> <span id="s1643">They went from street to street and from house to house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large.</span> <span id="s1644">And it went house by house.</span> <span id="s1645">They came to our street.</span> <span id="s1646">We had a neighbor sit on the roof and look out.</span> <span id="s1647">And when they entered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1648">And then they went into the building and found those who had hidden.</span> <span id="s1649">They beat them and put them on the truck.</span> <span id="s1650">And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably 60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit human beings.</span> <span id="s1651">My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken.</span> <span id="s1652">I tried to go onto the truck with her.</span> <span id="s1653">The guns stopped me.</span> <span id="s1654">The truck drove off.</span> <span id="s1655">My neighbor’s mother was taken – many people out of the building.</span> <span id="s1656">He was a policeman.</span> <span id="s1657">He couldn’t get his mother released.</span> <span id="s1658">We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they supposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent.</span> <span id="s1659">But eventually, a few packages of clothing came back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1660">And supposedly – I did not see it – some of the clothing was blood-stained.</span> <span id="s1661">Actual notes or actual letters I don’t believe were found.</span> <span id="s1662">Nobody could give us an answer.</span> <span id="s1663">We hoped that they were alive – someplace, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1664">And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us.</span> <span id="s1665">It was almost as if we had been hypnotized, as if we just – we just went on.</span> <span id="s1666">We went to work.</span> <span id="s1667">We collected the soup.</span> <span id="s1668">We collected the food ration.</span> <span id="s1669">It continued.</span> <span id="s1670">We had been robbed not of our children, but of our feelings, of our compassion.</span> <span id="s1671">Some children were hidden, but very few.</span> <span id="s1672">How he could have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16.</span> <span id="s1673">I don’t understand it now.</span> <span id="s1674">Did he have a choice?</span> <span id="s1675">I would say so.</span> <span id="s1676">Czerniakow had a choice.</span> <span id="s1677">I mean, his life was not so precious that he could not have said no.</span> <span id="s1678">He could have refused to obey the orders.</span> <span id="s1679">He would have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable.</span> <span id="s1680">I was fired from the dress factory.</span> <span id="s1681">I don’t know for what reason, probably incompetence.</span> <span id="s1682">I did not sew very well.</span> <span id="s1683">And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1684">And by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, “I need a job desperately.”</span> <span id="s1685">And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over.</span> <span id="s1686">He started talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, “I’ll give you a job.”</span> <span id="s1687">I said, “Doing what?”</span> <span id="s1688">And he said, “We have received truckloads of forms to be completed for the Germans in Germany for their coal rations.</span> <span id="s1689">And the forms have to be figured and completed.</span> <span id="s1690">And you’ll sit in the office.</span> <span id="s1691">I need 300 people.</span> <span id="s1692">You write down the names.</span> <span id="s1693">People will tell you they’ll work here.</span> <span id="s1694">You just get their addresses, and you just do it.”</span> <span id="s1695">I said, “Okay, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1696">A job is a job.”</span> <span id="s1697">His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s.</span> <span id="s1698">A very fair man.</span> <span id="s1699">A very able man.</span> <span id="s1700">I had met his mother when I was running around with those passports a year earlier.</span> <span id="s1701">And he was much admired.</span> <span id="s1702">The strange thing was that he had Rumkowski’s ear.</span> <span id="s1703">When he would go to Rumkowski, he might take some abuse, but in the end, he would argue.</span> <span id="s1704">And half the time, Rumkowski would listen.</span> <span id="s1705">So, he was much admired.</span> <span id="s1706">His girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices.</span> <span id="s1707">Her name was Klatalka (ph).</span> <span id="s1708">And I worked in that office, I would say, until ’43, end of ’43.</span> <span id="s1709">And one day Bernard Fuchs decided – he was the head of the Department of Labor – that too many people worked in that office, and he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1710">And the commission of several dignitaries came, among them Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s1711">And it was again a selection of who goes and who stays.</span> <span id="s1712">And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had my name on the list.</span> <span id="s1713">And Rumkowski sat on a chair.</span> <span id="s1714">He had taken off his hat and his coat, and he had his cane in his right hand.</span> <span id="s1715">And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale – a king sitting on a throne.</span> <span id="s1716">He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had family, where I had come from, and in the end he said, “Little German, you may stay, and you’ll hear from me.”</span> <span id="s1717">He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1718">Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists.</span> <span id="s1719">I had gone to his office when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in Hannover, Germany, and he spoke German.</span> <span id="s1720">And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and he said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish.</span> <span id="s1721">He opened the door and he yelled like a German, “Raus!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: And when did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Before I got the job-</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: With Goetz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: -with Goetz, and then again after I lost the job with Goetz, twice.</span> <span id="s1726">And then there was a third time when I lost the job in the clothing factory.</span> <span id="s1727">I saw him throughout the ghetto, sometimes in a carriage, sometimes not.</span> <span id="s1728">He knew me because there were not many people who came from Hamburg who had been to Hannover, who could speak German.</span> <span id="s1729">I also went for an interview to Balutaring with his sister Dora Brooks.</span> <span id="s1730">She wouldn’t hire me, no reason given.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: She was the executive secretary to Rumkowski, so she had a very high position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: She was more than that.</span> <span id="s1733">She was his ears and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak to the Germans in any language.</span> <span id="s1734">She could speak.</span> <span id="s1735">She could speak Polish, and by then, with the same accent I had, and she could speak German.</span> <span id="s1736">I went to Walchovna (ph).</span> <span id="s1737">I went to a whole variety of women who were in factories.</span> <span id="s1738">And there were many that were capable, that were intelligent, but they wouldn’t hire a woman.</span> <span id="s1739">That was competition – a man, yes – a woman, no.</span> <span id="s1740">So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his office and he said, “I’m transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny, 4.”</span> <span id="s1741">I didn’t want to leave because I’d become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown.</span> <span id="s1742">But you didn’t argue with Henryk Neftalin.</span> <span id="s1743">He was fair.</span> <span id="s1744">He was decent.</span> <span id="s1745">What his reasons were, I never knew.</span> <span id="s1746">They could have been several.</span> <span id="s1747">It could have been that he wanted me out of Rumkowski’s reach.</span> <span id="s1748">It could have been the fact that I came to work one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody said I had a radio, and I never did have a radio.</span> <span id="s1749">And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody face, my bruised eyes.</span> <span id="s1750">He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the Statistical Department.</span> <span id="s1751">He had the first word and the last word.</span> <span id="s1752">It was a long way to work over the bridge.</span> <span id="s1753">And in winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge.</span> <span id="s1754">You slid back rather than forward.</span> <span id="s1755">Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing.</span> <span id="s1756">That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus.</span> <span id="s1757">The office…</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: I want to stop.</span> <span id="s1759">I don’t like doing this, but I want to go back because you’re now moving much too fast, and I really don’t have much time.</span> <span id="s1760">So, I’ll tell you what we’re going to do.</span> <span id="s1761">We’re going to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s1762">And then, I’m going to come back and we’ll go a little bit more slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Lucille, I want to bring us back because you moved much too quickly for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Don’t be sorry, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s1769">You said when Karin was taken away, you all – and Karin is, well, she’s going with children.</span> <span id="s1770">There’s also 70,000 people, I think who’s in these deportations during this couple of months.</span> <span id="s1771">Am I not right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: No, I don’t think 70.</span> <span id="s1773">I think it was in May around 15 or 20, and then again in September, there were a lot of smaller deportations in between a thousand or 2,000.</span> <span id="s1774">The actual numbers I don’t know, but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: But, it was a few thousand people over the course-</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Over the course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: You said that people went on, and what you lost in some ways was your feelings.</span> <span id="s1778">So, in order to go on, you clearly didn’t forget Karin, but you couldn’t respond to her going, I gather, in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Well, I reached out for her.</span> <span id="s1780">I tried to go with her.</span> <span id="s1781">I was not allowed, but life in the overall ghetto went on.</span> <span id="s1782">People even went so far as to use, at least for a week or two, the ration card of a person who was deported.</span> <span id="s1783">So, there was no – there was no feeling.</span> <span id="s1784">There was no – there was a sadness, but there was not a deep desperation and there should have been, and that, I think two or three years of ghetto life killed that within us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Did you use Karin’s ration card?</span> <span id="s1786">Did she have one even?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Yes, she had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: She had one.</span> <span id="s1789">Did you use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1791">My neighbor asked whether she could pick up the bread on her card, and I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1792">And I handed it into the coupon department and let it go at that.</span> <span id="s1793">I just couldn’t because I had read a story, and supposedly it was fiction of children looking across a barbed wire at the Fehk Etta (ph) bread store and there was one across our street on the other side, and they looked from the attic down into the bakery and they were talking about the bread and how good it smelled, and it went on for quite awhile, and then came the deportations.</span> <span id="s1794">And, just for the deportation, the father was so hungry that he stole a piece of the children’s bread.</span> <span id="s1795">And the father was deported.</span> <span id="s1796">The mother and the two children hid and remained in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1797">The mother kept the card.</span> <span id="s1798">She collected the father’s bread.</span> <span id="s1799">I don’t know for how long.</span> <span id="s1800">She gave it to the children, and she says, “Children, eat your father’s bread.”</span> <span id="s1801">And that’s the end of the story, and the story was written by Spiegel in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1802">It has been translated into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: And you knew this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: He read this story to me when he wrote the first draft.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: And that was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: That was after the – it was 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: So, what was it that made you not use the coupon?</span> <span id="s1808">Was there something immoral about it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: It was like robbing a grave, maybe.</span> <span id="s1810">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1811">I don’t know – it wasn’t mine to use.</span> <span id="s1812">It wasn’t mine to give.</span> <span id="s1813">It was hers.</span> <span id="s1814">I can’t give you the reason.</span> <span id="s1815">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: So, she’s taken away in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: You work for Goetz ends when in October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: No, it ended before deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Before deportation.</span> <span id="s1821">So, you’re four to six weeks without a job before you get the job – before Spiegel meets you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: No, I first go to the clothing factory in between and then I go back to Rybna,8 , and Spiegel gives me a job.</span> <span id="s1823">That was pretty much the end of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: So, you start working there, working on these forms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: You’re filling in forms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: The coal rations for the German population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: And, these coal rations from the Jews-</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: How does this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: This is paperwork.</span> <span id="s1832">It has nothing to do with Jews.</span> <span id="s1833">It’s like an audit at the Internal Revenue.</span> <span id="s1834">He goes over the figures.</span> <span id="s1835">We got forms, let’s say, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smith lives in an apartment with four other people.</span> <span id="s1836">He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and we had to figure that out.</span> <span id="s1837">Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100.</span> <span id="s1838">Then there is Mr. Joe who has eight people living in his apartment.</span> <span id="s1839">Each person gets 25 kilos.</span> <span id="s1840">So, we had to come up with the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the ghetto in containers, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them shipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so they could take the forms, give them to their people, and have them collect the coal.</span> <span id="s1841">All we did was clerical work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1843">So, this had to be a fairly quick turnaround, so people could get there…</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Yes, it had to be a few months, or it was for the following year.</span> <span id="s1845">That I cannot say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: So, who are you actually working for?</span> <span id="s1847">Spiegel works for Neftalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: I work for Spiegel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: And, you work for Spiegel, and are there other people working for Spiegel, or just you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: The office had about three or four people, one of whom was Pushovsky (ph), one was – the other one was Spiegel, I think there was one more man.</span> <span id="s1851">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1852">But there were 300 people in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: In the whole office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: In the whole office doing nothing but these forms.</span> <span id="s1855">And while they did the forms, there were supervisors, but they all directly worked for Spiegel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: So, what did you think of Spiegel when you first met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Well, he wore glasses.</span> <span id="s1858">He had slicked-back black hair.</span> <span id="s1859">He walked very deliberately, very slowly.</span> <span id="s1860">He always carried a briefcase.</span> <span id="s1861">He was very absent-minded, and he was always writing, in Yiddish, because I peeked and I couldn’t read because he wrote very fast.</span> <span id="s1862">He was also quite sure of himself.</span> <span id="s1863">He had published already at the age of 22 in the Yiddish Bletter in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1864">He had taught school for awhile.</span> <span id="s1865">What did I think of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: What did you notice him?</span> <span id="s1867">Did you know that he was a published person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: Yes, but I did not pay much attention.</span> <span id="s1869">He was – you would call him today a little stuffy, and he wore these little black horn-rimmed glasses or wire glasses – medium height, medium built, wore a suit unpressed.</span> <span id="s1870">The shirts were a little rumpled.</span> <span id="s1871">I mean, it wasn’t somebody who would particularly strike you in a crowd, not in a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: So, does he begin when you first start working there, to come over to you and ask you read or he’s going to read to you?</span> <span id="s1873">How – because you begin a relationship together, how does it begin for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: He asked me to stay after work, and work ended at eight or nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Eight-oh-nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Eight or nine at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: And the janitor whose name was Betczak was a little bit retarded but very sweet, would sweep the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: One second that noise is really – close the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">[Break in tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Lucille, I’m really sorry, there was an awful lot of noise outside.</span> <span id="s1882">You won’t be interrupted again.</span> <span id="s1883">So, you were starting to talk about how you began to have a closer relationship with Spiegel and you’re talking about the janitor, Betchak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Betczak like a bed, Betczak.</span> <span id="s1885">And, he would come and sweep around the offices and he would sit there at ten at night or whatever time it was, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which he worked most of the daytime although he wasn’t supposed to, and – in Yiddish – and he told me what to think about them, whether they were good or not so good.</span> <span id="s1886">And I listened, and some of his poetry is very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1887">And the short stories really took me very much by surprised.</span> <span id="s1888">They were fiction, but they were the story of the man who lost his horse to hunger, or the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole bread from the children.</span> <span id="s1889">He wrote a book during the ghetto time that was called “Malches Ghetto” – “Kingdom Ghetto”, and it gives a story of the church on the Platske Chernya (ph), and the people who go in and who go out.</span> <span id="s1890">He had a facility to describe people, and the description ran several pages.</span> <span id="s1891">It reminded me of Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks.</span> <span id="s1892">It gave the background of the story, the smell, the atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky.</span> <span id="s1893">It – to me at age 17, it was very impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Why did he have to tell you what to think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: Because I was very young and really didn’t know very much.</span> <span id="s1896">And we sat until very late in the office and when the janitor finally had to lock up, he walked me back to Pawia, 26, and that became a habit, a custom.</span> <span id="s1897">It was noticed in the office.</span> <span id="s1898">It was talked about in the office.</span> <span id="s1899">Some people made fun of it because the age difference was tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: And how different was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: It was 20 or 22 years, and I found it very awkward.</span> <span id="s1902">I really didn’t know how I felt about him.</span> <span id="s1903">I admired him as a writer, or I liked his stories.</span> <span id="s1904">I did not even know whether you could say a writer.</span> <span id="s1905">I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war, and then he began writing short poems, and I think there are eight or nine of them, and they were written to me.</span> <span id="s1906">They were published after the war, and that’s when he said, “If your mother were alive, I would ask her to marry you.”</span> <span id="s1907">He told me that he had a daughter, Eva, who died in the ghetto at not even a year old, and that’s when I found out that he had a wife.</span> <span id="s1908">He was separated from her.</span> <span id="s1909">I saw once or twice.</span> <span id="s1910">Somebody pointed her out.</span> <span id="s1911">He had a couple of sisters, several brothers, and very, very old parents.</span> <span id="s1912">They probably weren’t as old as they looked old.</span> <span id="s1913">The father could read and write Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1914">The mother took in laundry for people before the war.</span> <span id="s1915">She washed the laundry.</span> <span id="s1916">She hung it up on the roof, and he had to sit on the roof to watch that the laundry wouldn’t be stolen.</span> <span id="s1917">The poverty in which he grew up was incredible.</span> <span id="s1918">I had never heard of such poverty, and I believe that the apartment – and I was there twice – in which his parents lived, and the apartment which he shared during their time was theirs before the war.</span> <span id="s1919">It was tiny.</span> <span id="s1920">It was dark.</span> <span id="s1921">There was hardly any furniture.</span> <span id="s1922">It was the kind of poverty that you read about, but you never see it.</span> <span id="s1923">By Spring or Summer in ’43, I was taken to the common law police, severely beaten, and when I came back to the office, nobody said much, but I found out that I had been denounced for having a radio.</span> <span id="s1924">The Germans who beat me up told me that a woman had denounced me, and eventually being a ghetto and being a very small area, it became known that she had given my name to the common law police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: It was his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: His separated wife.</span> <span id="s1927">We never spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: You never told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: He saw it.</span> <span id="s1930">You couldn’t escape it.</span> <span id="s1931">My left side – the whole left side of my face was for weeks a mess, but we never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s1932">He kept bringing me back to Pawia, 26.</span> <span id="s1933">He read me stories.</span> <span id="s1934">He wrote more stories.</span> <span id="s1935">And the following week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in an orange roll with a ribbon tied around, and the poem started “The eyes are green.”</span> <span id="s1936">The poem has been published in Israel and in Poland, and in one other book is a whole section and it says, “For Cilla.”</span> <span id="s1937">This friendship, I wouldn’t call it a love affair.</span> <span id="s1938">It was in between the two.</span> <span id="s1939">On one hand, he was selfish.</span> <span id="s1940">He got from Neftalin two weeks’ leave to work in the bakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb, but it also meant that his bread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks.</span> <span id="s1941">I’m sure it went to his family, but he never offered me a slice.</span> <span id="s1942">It hurt.</span> <span id="s1943">Then I moved to Lutomierska, and it was then that he told me that he had written a poem “Raisins and Almonds”.</span> <span id="s1944">The poem was set to music by Beigelmann (ph).</span> <span id="s1945">It was performed in the ghetto at night, clandestine in a basement.</span> <span id="s1946">Rumkowski read about it because it says in one of the voices that “We are so hungry we have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1947">What should the poor child do?”</span> <span id="s1948">Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened deportation, and he said, “As long as I am here, you will write no more.”</span> <span id="s1949">Neftalin intervened with the understanding and the promise that there would be no references to Rumkowski in anything and there weren’t from that point forward.</span> <span id="s1950">He hated the man with vengeance, and he always said, “If you ever get to know him, be careful.”</span> <span id="s1951">I don’t know how to translate it, probably the closest would be, “He is a pest,” a parch in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: He spoke to you in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: So, what did he say to you in Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Spiegel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Yes, what did is say about Rumkowski?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: “Rumkowski is a parch,” P-A-R-C-H, I think.</span> <span id="s1958">He would not say anymore.</span> <span id="s1959">He told me the story about the baby’s song.</span> <span id="s1960">It’s a lullaby, so to speak, and around that time, Rumkowski came to the office.</span> <span id="s1961">He did see Spiegel because he sat in the main conference room, and they did not look at each other.</span> <span id="s1962">Neftalin took over, and he took a lot of people out of the office into the factories, straw factory mainly, and he told me that I would hear from him.</span> <span id="s1963">And that evening, Spiegel again warned me, and in a way he was angry because I had done nothing, but somehow he felt it was partly my fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: About the song?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: No, that Rumkowski had said I will hear from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: So, he saw that scene?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: He saw that scene.</span> <span id="s1968">And Fuchs didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1969">He was present, Bernard Fuchs, and then Neftalin transferred me to the Statistical Department, and Spiegel picked me up every evening.</span> <span id="s1970">He went over the bridge, picked me up, went back over the bridge to Lutomierska, went back over to the bridge to his parents’ house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: But, in this period, you’re working there from October ’42 until the end of ’43.</span> <span id="s1972">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: No, I would say the middle of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1975">So, it’s a number of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Yes, six months, seven months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Now, is there – Soon after he starts walking you home, does he take your hand and hold your hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: And, is this…</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: And, there was on Pawia, 26 – and that’s in a book, in a poem – there was a covered well, and the well was covered with a wooden lid, quite large, and we would stand on that lid with our gloves on and our scarves and our hats and we would kiss, and there is a story of “Der Tot Brunnen”, “The Dead Well”, because the well was no longer active.</span> <span id="s1981">My feelings were strange, I could not decide.</span> <span id="s1982">He would say odd things.</span> <span id="s1983">After the war, you would be married to a famous man.</span> <span id="s1984">He was very sure of himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Meaning himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: He was very sure of himself, very much in love, and yet very frightening, and it told me not to worry about the divorce.</span> <span id="s1989">Now, a divorce could only be granted by Rumkowski, and that was not in the picture.</span> <span id="s1990">I know what my mother would have said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: There’s a growl from the world.</span> <span id="s1992">How bad is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">[Break in tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Okay, well, we’re finally back after this long break, and I believe where we ended was you were going to – somebody’s whistling – is this all right?</span> <span id="s1995">– what your mother would have thought had she been alive and you told her that Spiegel wanted to marry you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: I think she would have told me that I had lost my mind, that he had lost his mind, and she probably would have locked me up and thrown the key away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: And why?</span> <span id="s1998">Because of you or because of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: That I even dared to get involved, which was my fault, and because he was in no way suitable, not age-wise, not professionally, not – she would have considered him a man without a conscience, because he wasn’t divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: And were these things you thought about at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: So, you were very-</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: I was brought up very proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: So, if that was the case, what in your mind was going on when you spent evening after evening with him and you knew that he was in some way falling in love with you, I suspect, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Well, it was the loneliness of being alone.</span> <span id="s2006">It was a feeling of having somebody care for you, but on the other hand, I didn’t talk much.</span> <span id="s2007">I listened.</span> <span id="s2008">I didn’t talk because there is a poem and it starts, “Wer Stricts der ausoy forbissen” (ph).</span> <span id="s2009">“Why are you so stubbornly silent?”</span> <span id="s2010">Because I was very insecure.</span> <span id="s2011">I was not comfortable.</span> <span id="s2012">In some way, yes.</span> <span id="s2013">In some ways, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Did he ever ask you a question?</span> <span id="s2015">Or was he always talking at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: He was talking at me – very few questions.</span> <span id="s2017">He wanted to know about the parents.</span> <span id="s2018">He wanted to know about the home.</span> <span id="s2019">But they were almost scientific questions.</span> <span id="s2020">They were not particularly personal or informative or desiring to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Is it the case that at some point he said that he wanted to live with you if you couldn’t get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Yes, he did say that, and I said I would not consider that, especially not in the ghetto, where all these various affairs were public knowledge.</span> <span id="s2023">I was brought up too strict and too proper to have thrown all caution to the wind.</span> <span id="s2024">If I had known then of the duration of the ghetto, of Auschwitz, of Neuengamme, or Bergen-Belsen, I might have said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s2025">But I didn’t know then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Was he your first boyfriend, in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Yes, first love.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: And you do consider him a first love?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Yes, because I cared.</span> <span id="s2030">It was not – it was not like being madly in love.</span> <span id="s2031">It was more like being loved by somebody who cared, but not having to be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: But you were a very innocent young woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Did you nevertheless see that there were a lot of affairs going on – that people were coupling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Did you think of that as being a kind of desperation, that people thought they might die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: No, it wasn’t out of desperation.</span> <span id="s2038">It was – it was like in any society where people live in close proximity that these connections are made.</span> <span id="s2039">The director of the corset factory and another factory, they had a ménage-a-trois, and it was common knowledge in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2040">They lived in one room, in one bed, everybody laughed.</span> <span id="s2041">It wasn’t funny.</span> <span id="s2042">It was actually sad.</span> <span id="s2043">Dora Fuchs was madly in love with the Auday Yakobovitch (ph).</span> <span id="s2044">Yakobovitch was married.</span> <span id="s2045">There are hundreds of these stories.</span> <span id="s2046">Some were true love stories.</span> <span id="s2047">Some survived the war and lasted long beyond the war, and some broke up with the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Were women – if you knew this at the time and maybe you can only know this on reflection – were women in some sense in a more vulnerable position because more men had jobs and more men were in a position to give women things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: No.</span> <span id="s2052">It varied from case to case.</span> <span id="s2053">It depended on the individual.</span> <span id="s2054">If a man was in a powerful position, yes.</span> <span id="s2055">He had the power and the clout to demand, but so did the women in powerful positions.</span> <span id="s2056">It worked both ways.</span> <span id="s2057">They’d pick the man that they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: And there were a lot of women in power, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: As far as I know, in the ghetto for the first time, women were not only nurses or teacher or homemakers, there was a woman a year older than I who ran the mattress factory, and she had her pick of the crop, as you would say.</span> <span id="s2060">There was Dora Fuchs, for instance.</span> <span id="s2061">There was Val Kovner (ph).</span> <span id="s2062">There were many, many, and these women were very capable.</span> <span id="s2063">They were powerful.</span> <span id="s2064">They were very smart, very intelligent, but very tough, very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: And you knew all this when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: I learned all this-</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Slowly, ’42 – ’43 – ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Was this shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Because I had no idea.</span> <span id="s2075">I had a read some translated French literature that was risqué, but I really did not know what to make of it.</span> <span id="s2076">If the director of the evening kitchen had an affair with a police – with a Jewish police, kept in only on the dining table in the kitchen, and it was common knowledge in plain view, it was shocking beyond words.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Did you ever see anything that was shocking to you in that regard?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: So, you saw things – people actually coupling in public places.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Yes, yes, public places.</span> <span id="s2083">There was a woman in charge of the recovery home where you would be sent for two weeks if you were a deserving worker, but you had to be of fairly high rank, and it was out in Marysin, and Spiegel were walking, and she came over.</span> <span id="s2084">She was twice my age, maybe more, and she made an open proposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: Yes, while I stood there like the fool that I was, and he said, “Let us stand here.</span> <span id="s2087">You can come back later,” but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s2088">So, all this was very shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: I could imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: And then towards the end, after the evening kitchen, Spiegel just stopped picking me up.</span> <span id="s2091">I asked him why.</span> <span id="s2092">He didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s2093">He might have gone back to his wife.</span> <span id="s2094">He might have stayed with his parents, but we never spoke again.</span> <span id="s2095">In January ’44, I was on a deportation list, and my friend Elie went to him to get me off the list.</span> <span id="s2096">He went to talk Podlowski (ph), who had influence, and my name was deleted, but I never saw not until 1963, when he picked us up at the airplane.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: You and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: And my two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: And your two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: In Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: So, when Neftalin sends you to Oskar Singer, you still see Spiegel throughout that whole…</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: He picks me up every evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: So, tell me about working – where you glad to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: No, I was heartbroken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: You wanted to stay in that office?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2107">I have no interest in statistics.</span> <span id="s2108">I had no interest – I had no knowledge even that this office was of any importance or prestige.</span> <span id="s2109">I did not particularly wanted to work for a Czech.</span> <span id="s2110">It was a very stuffy office with very few employees and everybody was at least 50 or 45.</span> <span id="s2111">I was miserable, but it was not something that I could question or refuse.</span> <span id="s2112">It would have been dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: And why would you have thought that Neftalin sent you there in order to get you away from Rumkowski, since Rumkowski could go anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: He might have also wanted to get me away from Spiegel.</span> <span id="s2115">He might have.</span> <span id="s2116">I will never know because he was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2117">I would have asked him.</span> <span id="s2118">I don’t know, because he knew his former wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2120">So, that’s quite possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: It is possible.</span> <span id="s2122">I will never know.</span> <span id="s2123">It could be one of two reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: What kind of a person was Singer?</span> <span id="s2125">Did you get to know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2127">Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs.</span> <span id="s2128">I would pick up at the bottom of the bridge in the police station from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics – so many people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported.</span> <span id="s2129">When Singer came back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large ghetto is not all Singer’s.</span> <span id="s2130">I think several hundred pages at least, and that’s a forthcoming book now.</span> <span id="s2131">He was a journalist.</span> <span id="s2132">He had worked as a journalist in Prague.</span> <span id="s2133">He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page – I couldn’t even call it a report.</span> <span id="s2134">It was more like a love letter to Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s2135">If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you.</span> <span id="s2136">It’s available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen.</span> <span id="s2137">It does not fit his personality.</span> <span id="s2138">It does not fit his other reports.</span> <span id="s2139">It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating.</span> <span id="s2140">He followed orders.</span> <span id="s2141">Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn’t have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated.</span> <span id="s2142">So, this last entry to Rumkowski could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever.</span> <span id="s2143">His daughter was my age and I met her through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose father belonged to the police and to other important ghetto institutions.</span> <span id="s2144">He worked in the bakery as an electrician.</span> <span id="s2145">Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his wife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not Germany.</span> <span id="s2146">Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge.</span> <span id="s2147">But both had trades.</span> <span id="s2148">The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician.</span> <span id="s2149">The wife came from a German-speaking family in Prague, a very bright, very nice woman.</span> <span id="s2150">His sister was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2151">Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the electrical component factory.</span> <span id="s2152">And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same household.</span> <span id="s2153">They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street.</span> <span id="s2154">It was very clean and when I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I’d give it to my friend, and she would bring me a portion to work everyday.</span> <span id="s2155">So, I trusted her with my bread.</span> <span id="s2156">What else can I say of the Singer?</span> <span id="s2157">The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near Prague.</span> <span id="s2158">No children, very wealthy.</span> <span id="s2159">I think the husband died or was killed – or he died in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2160">In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr. Singer.</span> <span id="s2161">I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner.</span> <span id="s2162">John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2163">It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt.</span> <span id="s2164">He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2165">So, I told him the story about the will, and he’s now – I mean, the will was lost in Auschwitz – he’s trying to regain the house near park, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in Switzerland, but the name and the numbers have never appeared.</span> <span id="s2166">So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady again is very strange.</span> <span id="s2167">I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will.</span> <span id="s2168">On some level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it?</span> <span id="s2169">His son had, at times, a radio.</span> <span id="s2170">It was in poor shape, it needed constant repair.</span> <span id="s2171">We only got the BBC and the progress of the war – nothing about Warsaw, nothing about our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea.</span> <span id="s2172">No mention was ever made by Dr. Singer of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2173">No mention was made by Neftalin, by Spiegel.</span> <span id="s2174">It just was not mentioned.</span> <span id="s2175">So, it can be assumed that we really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2176">Maybe somebody knew, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: And nobody mentioned Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: No, that you saw from the letter which I got in ’47 where it stated they were killed in Auschwitz, and it turned out they were killed in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s2179">So, that is much later information.</span> <span id="s2180">The work for Dr. Singer was effortless.</span> <span id="s2181">It was boring.</span> <span id="s2182">It was dull.</span> <span id="s2183">I was a clerk.</span> <span id="s2184">It was a large, dark office, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous office had people.</span> <span id="s2185">Until one day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowski, and he told me that I would work in the evening kitchen together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in the women’s police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men.</span> <span id="s2186">They were mostly young women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in ’40, and they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: In 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: I’m looking surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Yes, I’m surprised that you’re surprised.</span> <span id="s2191">I thought it was common knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Well, maybe for some, but has not been for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Well, there are some of these women still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Yeah, and all of these went to work in the Kuechenuhr kueletini (ph) evening kitchen, which was used for a two-week period for deserving workers on a coupon which gave them an evening meal, a little vegetables, sometimes a little starch, and something that looked like a hamburger, but it was round.</span> <span id="s2196">What it contained, I really couldn’t say.</span> <span id="s2197">I ripped mine up and I gave it to Spiegel when he picked me up.</span> <span id="s2198">Rumkowski knew about Spiegel and he threatened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Threatened you or threatened Spiegel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Threatened me for seeing him.</span> <span id="s2201">He told me that he knew.</span> <span id="s2202">Who had carried the information, I don’t know, but it was common in the ghetto to trade information, to talk to the administration about anything or to denounce people, to no particular gain other than maybe you got a little reward for it, but just to carry gossip.</span> <span id="s2203">The young policewomen were all waitresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Let me stop you for a minute.</span> <span id="s2205">Is this the time when Spiegel stops seeing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: No, that was before – after that, he stopped seeing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: After he stopped seeing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: End of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: So, perhaps he stopped because he was frightened, or you didn’t tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: I didn’t tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Is it possible that Rumkowski went to Spiegel and said, “Stop”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: Anything is possible.</span> <span id="s2213">I doubt it, but it is possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: And, how did you – that’s a question you can’t answer.</span> <span id="s2215">All of these women who were in the women’s police who came in and you’re the only one who’s in another – was in another job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: I was in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: If we received 50 kilo of carrots, and we had to serve 400 meals, how much did each person get in terms of weight?</span> <span id="s2219">So many grams, and I had a little trouble with the arithmetic.</span> <span id="s2220">They kitchen was run by a man of the name of Minsk.</span> <span id="s2221">He was sort of grandfatherly and kind, and he ran the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2222">He was the – there were four of them.</span> <span id="s2223">He ran this particular one, and he brought in a young man who helped me with the figuring.</span> <span id="s2224">I couldn’t manage it.</span> <span id="s2225">I could manage it now.</span> <span id="s2226">But in the afternoons, he was ordered to leave because this was done clandestine.</span> <span id="s2227">Rumkowski did not know, or if he knew, he did not let on, but I was a clerk for that kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: All right, I want to go back to being in Singer’s office for a minute.</span> <span id="s2229">Did you learn anything?</span> <span id="s2230">I understand it was boring, but you didn’t have colleagues on a regular basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: But did you learn things about the ghetto from being in that office that you would not have known otherwise or that you did not know before about how things were operating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2234">You found out if a factory changed management.</span> <span id="s2235">You found if somebody was replaced by somebody else.</span> <span id="s2236">You found out if people were in the ghetto yesterday.</span> <span id="s2237">You heard a rumor, true or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs.</span> <span id="s2238">You heard – you heard all sorts of rumors in that office, some of which you didn’t dare put down on paper because there was always the chance of censorship by the Germans, and censorship by the Jews.</span> <span id="s2239">There were sometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa.</span> <span id="s2240">The information was accurate to the extent that you couldn’t substantiate very much.</span> <span id="s2241">I mean, even when I picked up the daily statistics, so many died in the hospital, so many jumped out of a window, of course, no births – there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were kept, but the question arises how accurate where they.</span> <span id="s2242">There were quite a few suicides especially from – committed by people coming from the west – some were doctors, some were lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible.</span> <span id="s2243">There was a rumor that the ghetto had some doctors.</span> <span id="s2244">There was a lady by the name of Kronan Burke (ph).</span> <span id="s2245">There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski’s favorite doctor, but no medication.</span> <span id="s2246">There was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing machine, and you heard about them.</span> <span id="s2247">You heard, for instance, that if you were jaundiced or if you had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine.</span> <span id="s2248">Whether this is true today, I do not know.</span> <span id="s2249">Atropine could be somehow smuggled into the ghetto if you knew a German of the guard.</span> <span id="s2250">These things you heard in the office, but you could never vouch for honesty or credibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: And did Singer write down more than ever went into the Chronicle?</span> <span id="s2252">He had many more – because I’m sure when he went out to talk with the people, he must have taken down notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: He took very brief notes, but then-</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: He would write…</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: Then it got… They’re all typewritten on an old-fashioned manual typewriter.</span> <span id="s2256">They have some errors.</span> <span id="s2257">All of his entries will be out in January in German, and if you’d like it, I’ll get it for you.</span> <span id="s2258">His counterpart was Oskar Rosenfeld, also from Prague, and his – he had not nearly as many entries.</span> <span id="s2259">He was much older.</span> <span id="s2260">He had a very young wife in England and he was very grandfatherly, very sweet, very kind – a totally different style because when I was at the Justice Liebzig University, they gave me a stack of these reportages and they asked me to identify them and said, “Here is Singer’s.”</span> <span id="s2261">And I went through them.</span> <span id="s2262">I said, “No, this is not Singer.</span> <span id="s2263">This is Oskar Rosenfeld.”</span> <span id="s2264">And it was correct – totally different style.</span> <span id="s2265">I didn’t know him as well as Singer because he worked in the office, but I didn’t work for him.</span> <span id="s2266">His book supposedly was just published in English by Hanna Levy, either Frankfurt at the Bauer Institute in Frankfurt, or it came out in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2267">I’m not sure which.</span> <span id="s2268">And Hanna Levy did the editing and it supposedly came out in English.</span> <span id="s2269">I have not seen it.</span> <span id="s2270">And I’m not as familiar with his entries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: So, you didn’t type these reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: Some I did type wherever there was a typewriter available, but there was only one and I was not the only one who had access to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: So, when you say you were clerking, what would that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: I would transcribe some of Singer’s notes in longhand.</span> <span id="s2275">I would file things.</span> <span id="s2276">I would give him the daily statistics.</span> <span id="s2277">I would do very menial work – nothing of any consequence or substance, but I did read what he wrote because it was an interesting style.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: So, you weren’t completely, given the kind of job you were doing, you were not completely unhappy going to the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: No, because it meant an extra meal.</span> <span id="s2280">It was from five to seven in the evening.</span> <span id="s2281">People lined up and had a coupon, and, well, Rumkowski came almost every evening, and the apron of the waitress, if the bow in the back was not straight, he would hit her with a cane.</span> <span id="s2282">He carried a cane.</span> <span id="s2283">He threatened a couple of them with dismissal.</span> <span id="s2284">In the front sat two ladies who clipped the coupon which had to be counted every morning – two ladies?</span> <span id="s2285">Two young women.</span> <span id="s2286">The cooking was done by a couple of lady chefs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Let’s hold here.</span> <span id="s2288">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">End of Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Lucille, we’ll talking about the kitchen, and you were mentioning, before we were talking about the actual cooking, there were people at the – women at the door clipping coupons.</span> <span id="s2292">Where did people get the coupons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: You got them in the factory, you got them in an office, if your boss decided that you deserved a bonus.</span> <span id="s2294">And of course it was – there were never enough coupons to go around the ghetto, but it was an incentive or a gift for some of them.</span> <span id="s2295">There was a lot of favoritism involved as to who got them.</span> <span id="s2296">If you were well connected, you could be sure to get the coupon.</span> <span id="s2297">It was – it was an original idea to reward a worker because it was said the straw shoe factory rewarded 12 workers, not bosses, but 12 workers, or the uniform factory rewarded 10 workers.</span> <span id="s2298">It was supposed to be an incentive to work hard, to try to top the quota, and in the end to please the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: One dinner for one coupon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: Yes, one dinner for one coupon, but you got a week at a time.</span> <span id="s2301">You could come for seven days.</span> <span id="s2302">So, you got seven coupons.</span> <span id="s2303">It was one coupon and you cut off seven strips.</span> <span id="s2304">At one point, they tried to do it for two weeks, and then somebody else got a turn.</span> <span id="s2305">How it was decided, administered, as to who got them, or which factory – that was done behind closed doors, I do not know, but there was a lot of protection involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: And your job was figuring out the mathematics of we have this much food and how much for each person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Well, we had this much food for the week, divide that by seven, and then divide by the number of clients or the number of diners who would come, and how much each person would consume in grams.</span> <span id="s2308">For instance, it would be 50 grams of meat which equals about an ounce.</span> <span id="s2309">It would be so much red beets, but the figuring was complicated.</span> <span id="s2310">There was no adding machine.</span> <span id="s2311">There was no calculator.</span> <span id="s2312">I had to take a pen and pencil and you had to convert the kilos to pounds and the pounds to grams, and in Poland they used the word “deca” which meant ten grams.</span> <span id="s2313">So, it was a little overwhelming for me.</span> <span id="s2314">I mean, I wasn’t bad at math, but I wasn’t that good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: And who decided what the menu would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: That depended – well, the – Mr. Mintzer was in charge of the kitchen, and it depended on the supply.</span> <span id="s2317">They would – they would send – they would come on a horse-drawn truck, sort of like a flatbed truck but horse-drawn, and they would either unload or sack or a crate or sometimes it was flour, sometimes it was carrots or beets or turnips, very rarely potatoes, sometimes meat, and from the looks of it, it was horsemeat because it was very dark red, and it was all served on one plate, in little portions, and the portions were pretty much equal, almost if you would take an ice cream scoop.</span> <span id="s2318">We were entitled the same meal an hour before our guests would appear with the rule that nothing was supposed to be taken out, but we did anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: And how many people per evening usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Well, the so-called dining room was filled up.</span> <span id="s2321">I would say probably 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: That’s a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: 150-200, but not for a ghetto of 160,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Was there a large kitchen, or was it a very makeshift kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: No, it was a large kitchen.</span> <span id="s2326">It had big kettles.</span> <span id="s2327">The cooks were ladies, and they were standing on a platform stirring ferociously at those kettles, and we would come in and look and they didn’t like it, and in the back of the kitchen was a storage room, and the storage room had the supply.</span> <span id="s2328">The young woman who ran the storage room was somewhat older than we were, I guess, close to 30.</span> <span id="s2329">Her name was Meyerowitz, and she carried the key to the storage room around her neck, and you were not allowed to go over the threshold into that storage room.</span> <span id="s2330">She would reach – she would weigh, count, whatever, and she would reach the food out, and I was a little friendly with her, and if I would come near the entrance she would say, “Stop, stand there and talk to me.</span> <span id="s2331">Don’t go further.”</span> <span id="s2332">Because I might touch something or take something.</span> <span id="s2333">She was very meticulous for reasons of her own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: And were you also the youngest person working in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: No, there were two or three people younger than I. Most were older than I, but there was a young woman that – three young women who were younger than I am, but not by much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Rumkowski came in every night – to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Almost every – no.</span> <span id="s2338">No, he had decent food.</span> <span id="s2339">I mean, if you look at his prewar picture – his rumpled shirt, his rumpled pants, his disheveled hair – he was a poor man.</span> <span id="s2340">When he showed up in the ghetto, he was pressed and tailored, immaculate – boots, he wore boots – SS-type boots – shined.</span> <span id="s2341">Lodz had very good tailors.</span> <span id="s2342">I think the best in all of Poland.</span> <span id="s2343">His top coats, his jackets were out of Fifth Avenue – unbelievable, elegant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: So, he comes in and he’s sort of a monster to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Well, he comes in – he was very proud of his achievement, and I guess it was an achievement, but the people – the young people who worked for him were petrified of him because he would beat them and if he was displeased, he would dismiss them, and that was a risk you took.</span> <span id="s2346">A couple of girls I knew were dismissed.</span> <span id="s2347">One of them managed through connections to come back.</span> <span id="s2348">It was a good job, but it was a risky job in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Were you frightened of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s2351">I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Were you frightened based on what you saw or what you had been hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Now, I’m a little confused about timeframe when it comes to the various conversations you had with people about Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s2357">Spiegel says things to you – that he’s a pig or a pest, and that one has to be careful of him.</span> <span id="s2358">You meet other people Shlomo (ph), Branya, Luba.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: Branya I met while I worked for Spiegel.</span> <span id="s2360">She came into the office as a courier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Luba worked in the Statistical Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: When you working with Singer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2365">The woman who worked at the orphanage, the teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Dorka?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Dorka, she lived in our building.</span> <span id="s2368">She was an unmarried woman and she was deported together with my sister to Chelmo.</span> <span id="s2369">Yulik (ph), I met after the war in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: And Shlomo, when did you meet Shlomo – Shlomo Hect (ph), he has the pushcart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: Oh, I met him at the very beginning, when I come into the ghetto in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: So, right in the beginning you hear stories because he tells you-</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: -about Sergei-</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Right, who was his friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: -who was his friend, and was investigating Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Shlomo before the war had a store that sold yarns and fabrics and things like that.</span> <span id="s2378">He had pushcart on corner Rybna and Lutomierska Street and it sold – he sold needles and thread and other small items.</span> <span id="s2379">I think he was an educated man because he spoke German.</span> <span id="s2380">He talked to my mother in the very beginning, and he talked to me – as long as he lived and he died shortly after my mother – he talked to me in bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s2381">On the outside, on the street corner, when the weather permitted.</span> <span id="s2382">When it got very cold and I could spare the time, I would drop in at his room.</span> <span id="s2383">He had a daughter about my age, a year older, and he would talk.</span> <span id="s2384">He lived on, I think, Narutoviska (ph) Street before the war as did Sergei.</span> <span id="s2385">Sergei was a bachelor until quite late, and he worked for the city council in Lodz.</span> <span id="s2386">He was a short man.</span> <span id="s2387">He was heavyset.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: This is Sergei?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2390">I met him only after the war, and he had a brother.</span> <span id="s2391">I never met him.</span> <span id="s2392">He perished.</span> <span id="s2393">And he was a friend of Shlomo’s, and he heard the story about the complaints.</span> <span id="s2394">He tried to investigate.</span> <span id="s2395">The first time the accusations were thrown out for lack of evidence by the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s2396">The second time was just before the start of the war.</span> <span id="s2397">Supposedly, the complaint was filed.</span> <span id="s2398">Rumkowski knew about it.</span> <span id="s2399">Sergei escaped to Russia to – through Russia, I think he went to Yugahama (ph), then to Canada, then to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s2400">I met him in 1975.</span> <span id="s2401">Rumkowski looked for him all through the war.</span> <span id="s2402">He thought he was hiding in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2403">Sergei eventually went back to school and became a social worker, but while he was working on the city council, he worked in the Balut.</span> <span id="s2404">He knew the thieves.</span> <span id="s2405">He knew the thief in charge.</span> <span id="s2406">He knew the underworld, and when his silver watch was stolen, he complained and it reappeared.</span> <span id="s2407">There was a young woman in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2408">She also worked in the kitchen, and she once took me home, and I met her mother – a tall, well-dressed woman, heavyset, and the father is sort of small and shifty-eyed gentleman, and he asked me where I come from and what my father did, and his only answer was, “Feh” I didn’t know what to make of it.</span> <span id="s2409">The apartment in the Balut had all the prewar furniture, rugs, glassware, crystal, and it turned out he had lived there before the war with his family as had my co-worker from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2410">She was very pretty, very blonde.</span> <span id="s2411">I don’t think she could count to five, but she was very popular.</span> <span id="s2412">She had a couple of sisters, a brother-in-law, and when I asked the father, since he had such contempt for my father’s work, what did he do before the war, he said, “A little of this, and a little of that.”</span> <span id="s2413">But the rumor in the ghetto was that he had an older daughter and the daughter was sold to a brothel in South America.</span> <span id="s2414">And it was common knowledge.</span> <span id="s2415">But he had underworld connection before the war; during the war, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2416">His children survived.</span> <span id="s2417">What happened to the daughter in South America, I do not know.</span> <span id="s2418">He and his wife did not survive.</span> <span id="s2419">His daughter is still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: How does it come that Shlomo tells you about Sergei’s investigation of Rumkowski?</span> <span id="s2421">Is it just because Rumkowski is part of a lot of conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Yes, yes, because he used to drive by in this horse-drawn buggy.</span> <span id="s2423">Everything was signed with Rumkowski’s name from the money, to the announcements, to everything else.</span> <span id="s2424">He was envied, envied partly for power, mainly for food.</span> <span id="s2425">I mean, it’s almost like saying, “Why was Kennedy talked about?”</span> <span id="s2426">It was a person who wielded enormous power, and who did not live the life of the average ghetto dweller.</span> <span id="s2427">He lived a different life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: So, Shlomo tells you about four children or three children?</span> <span id="s2429">He tells you about Branya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: He mentions the four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Including Branya and Dorka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: So, you have a sense of what Rumkowski was doing in an orphanage to little children-</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: Well-</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: No, I didn’t have a sense.</span> <span id="s2437">I had never heard of such a thing, and it didn’t – it didn’t really fall into place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: But, he tells you he takes children into a room and undresses them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Yeah, or molests them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Or molests them in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: And – but, to me, I mean I was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: So, it’s just a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: It’s just a story, and I must have found it frightening but I could not – I could not really relate to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: When you meet Branya, who was the first person who actually experiences this and is still experiencing it in the ghetto-</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Right, and she cried and she couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2446">She started a sentence and never finished it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: So, you never found out from her, as much a story as you heard from Shlomo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: No.</span> <span id="s2449">I found out bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s2450">I found out that her food ration was considerably better than mine.</span> <span id="s2451">She was a very - well, she gave the appearance of a very happy person, but she was very, very unhappy because her family used her, and she had a miserable childhood, and she had a miserable ghetto life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: And then Dorka, who tells you about this little child, Manya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: The child with a violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Who he molests-</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: And she runs away fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: She runs away and she hits the barbed wire and gets shot, but it was never publicized.</span> <span id="s2458">It was never spoken about.</span> <span id="s2459">Nobody dared because there were many killings along the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s2460">That was very, very common.</span> <span id="s2461">Luba was much more outspoken.</span> <span id="s2462">She was very worldly, very wise.</span> <span id="s2463">She was an orphan from a very young age.</span> <span id="s2464">The man with whom she lived used to run a food distribution center and he was caught stealing, and he ended in prison, and she had Rumkowski release him under the condition that he would not get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: And then she continues in some way going to Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: Yes, she got-</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: But she was in the orphanage before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: So, she was molested as a child and then as adult woman she agrees to do it in order to protect this-</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: This man and to get food, and she got a beautiful apartment out near Marysin with the promise that she would get married and that Rumkowski would perform the ceremony, and she always postponed it.</span> <span id="s2471">She postponed it three or four times.</span> <span id="s2472">I don’t know why, whether he didn’t want to get married or she didn’t want to get married.</span> <span id="s2473">I never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: Did he know what she was doing?</span> <span id="s2475">Her – the man she was living with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: I never knew him well enough to have a conversation with him.</span> <span id="s2479">We said, “Hello” and “How are you?”</span> <span id="s2480">and small talk but we never talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Now, you meet Luba in ’43-‘44</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: You’re a little older now.</span> <span id="s2484">Do you now begin to understand what he’s doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: No, what I understood is that Luba had to have an abortion.</span> <span id="s2486">That she was living with her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s2487">That I understood.</span> <span id="s2488">I knew that Luba was really wise and very worldly and she played the game by her own rules.</span> <span id="s2489">How much I related to it, or how much I understood, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: You liked her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Yes, because she was very friendly, very boisterous, very outgoing, and very attractive, but not pretty.</span> <span id="s2492">She was short.</span> <span id="s2493">She was plump.</span> <span id="s2494">She managed to buy clothing from recent arrivals because she had the means to purchase.</span> <span id="s2495">I liked her.</span> <span id="s2496">There was – there was a charm about her.</span> <span id="s2497">There was a will to live.</span> <span id="s2498">She could be a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s2499">She could laugh about anything and there was really not much to laugh about.</span> <span id="s2500">But I liked her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: Did she work in the kitchen also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: Yes, she clipped coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2504">So, you and she moved into that position-</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: -from the Singer job, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2509">So, are you – I don’t know if it’s unconsciously nervous about Rumkowski because he in some sense pointed you out to himself, “I will see you again.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2511">It made me nervous.</span> <span id="s2512">On the other hand, I thought maybe I will get more to eat, in an innocent sort of way – maybe somebody will be kind and give me more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: So, you are a still in an innocent way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: The strings – the strings I didn’t attach at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: So, then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Well, he came into the office.</span> <span id="s2517">One of the first proposals were that he would rent – he would rent!</span> <span id="s2518">– he would get a room above the kitchen so he can come anytime, and I started to cry and I said, “I want to stay where I am”, et cetera.</span> <span id="s2519">He got angry and he beat me with his cane.</span> <span id="s2520">He came back in subsequent weeks and months and it was a matter of molestation.</span> <span id="s2521">The man was impotent, but he did not like to know that or hear about it, and to me it was utterly frightening because at one point I wasn’t even quite sure how you become pregnant until Luba told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Did he undress you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: So, he didn’t -</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: It was just a matter of touching.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Touching him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Yes, and it was disgusting.</span> <span id="s2528">The fear was tremendous.</span> <span id="s2529">Not only the fear of the beating, but the fear of his power.</span> <span id="s2530">The fear that he could decide over life and death, that he could deport, that he could denounce to the Germans, that he could do just about anything.</span> <span id="s2531">That fear was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2532">He wanted to know about my family.</span> <span id="s2533">He wanted to know who was living in Palestine.</span> <span id="s2534">He wanted to know if they were well-off.</span> <span id="s2535">He made me promise that after the war I would see to it that they would help him, both to get to Palestine and to give him money because I owed him that.</span> <span id="s2536">And he made one remark that struck me then, it strikes me now.</span> <span id="s2537">“If I can save a hundred human beings, it will have been worthwhile.”</span> <span id="s2538">I tried to figure out the ‘it’ in the sentence.</span> <span id="s2539">He spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2540">What would have been worthwhile?</span> <span id="s2541">The death of so many others, the collaboration, the cooperation with the Germans, a hundred human beings out of 150,000?</span> <span id="s2542">It – it shocked me.</span> <span id="s2543">That and the children, “Give me your children.”</span> <span id="s2544">Those remarks I could neither forget nor forgive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: When he beat you the first time, he never beat you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: No, he beat me several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: He beat you several times?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: With a stick, over the shoulder, over the head.</span> <span id="s2549">He was not as steady on his feet as a normal 65 year old, mainly because he probably wore those crazy boots and it wasn’t easy to walk with boots up to your knees.</span> <span id="s2550">You just know that when he was displeased he would beat people.</span> <span id="s2551">Whether those were the girls in the kitchen or anybody else, it really didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2552">If you were lucky, you flinched and you hoped there were no further consequences.</span> <span id="s2553">But he was every bit as frightening as an SS – I found out later – as an SS man in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: He locked the door-</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q: -to the office when he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: Did you scream when he hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: You didn’t cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: I cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: You cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: I cried.</span> <span id="s2566">You didn’t hear a sound.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Did he beat you more when you cried?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: No, he just – he vented his anger or his frustration, and if I cried, so I cried.</span> <span id="s2569">That didn’t bother him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Did he try to kiss you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: And he kissed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2575">Do you have any idea why, when you refused, he said, “You can’t refuse.”</span> <span id="s2576">He wouldn’t have said, “You can’t refuse me.</span> <span id="s2577">I’m going to move you into an apartment.”</span> <span id="s2578">Because he clearly had the power to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: He had the power to do so.</span> <span id="s2580">My crying probably stalled for time, or gave me time, and the time was the food ran out and the kitchen had to be closed, and everybody in that kitchen was transferred to the leather factory, to the Saddlery.</span> <span id="s2581">So-</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: So, you don’t know what he would have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: No, but there was one woman about ten years older than I who took him up on the offer of a room on the other side of the kitchen, but she didn’t care.</span> <span id="s2584">She was only stupid enough not to cover the windows, and she was dumb enough to talk.</span> <span id="s2585">But she was much older – much, much older, at least ten years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: So, clearly this was happening with a number of women-</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: -in that kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: You were not the only one pointed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: Yes, he also went into the storeroom where the provisions were kept and the door was locked.</span> <span id="s2592">That’s all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: So, how long were you working in this kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: I think it lasted about three months, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: And how often did he try to come and see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: Every other day, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: Yeah, because it was his accomplishment, his pride and joy, his – his child, I mean, this brainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving workers.</span> <span id="s2599">I mean, what else could he give them?</span> <span id="s2600">Money didn’t mean a thing.</span> <span id="s2601">The only thing that meant anything was food.</span> <span id="s2602">So, he came just to make sure that everything was running properly, because there was a lot of theft, there was a lot of corruption, there was a lot of dishonesty, and we all knew.</span> <span id="s2603">It was unavoidable.</span> <span id="s2604">It was understandable.</span> <span id="s2605">So, for at least three months, he came at least every other day.</span> <span id="s2606">You never knew when he would come.</span> <span id="s2607">You could hear the horse’s hooves outside, the clicking, and then, who else had a horse?</span> <span id="s2608">And, then in the hallway, you could hear his footsteps because he walked very unevenly and very noisily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: Approximately how many times did he come to see you in particular?</span> <span id="s2610">Do you remember how many?</span> <span id="s2611">A few times a week, once a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Oh, it would be at least two or three times a week, at least twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Did you talk to Luba about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: No.</span> <span id="s2615">She had an idea because she was much smarter than I was, and I did ask her about pregnancy, and she laughed.</span> <span id="s2616">She laughed so hard, and she said, “Don’t you know how you get pregnant?”</span> <span id="s2617">And I really didn’t know, and – but, that really didn’t change anything.</span> <span id="s2618">I went once to see Dr. Kronenburg, and she looked at me as if I was a little bit out of my mind, but she was kind, and she said, “Go back; don’t worry.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: So, did you explain to the doctor what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: And she said you don’t have to worry about pregnancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Don’t have to worry, she said, “Besides, you’re not menstruating.</span> <span id="s2623">Why are you worrying?”</span> <span id="s2624">And I said, “What does that have to do with it?”</span> <span id="s2625">It was very complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: Did you menstruate at all during the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: Nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q: Nobody did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A: Nobody did, lack of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Had you menstruated before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Of course, and you just stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: It just stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: I don’t think she was shocked.</span> <span id="s2636">She was an older woman who probably had children my age.</span> <span id="s2637">She was well-known.</span> <span id="s2638">She was an MD.</span> <span id="s2639">She was not a felczer, because the ghetto had a lot of doctors that were – like, what should I say – first-aid man, or medical corpsman and they were called a felczer, from falsifying the word comes, but they were called doctors because there was a scarcity of doctors and hospitals otherwise, and she was too smart and too intelligent and probably slightly amused.</span> <span id="s2640">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Amused?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: Yes, that I would be so stupid, and she said, “It’s all right, child, go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: So, she didn’t ask you anything about what this was doing to you or what-</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: - because this was not relevant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: No, it wasn’t relevant.</span> <span id="s2647">You – the ghetto did not have time, compassion, or patience for anyone’s mental well-being.</span> <span id="s2648">That did not exist, and didn’t exist during most of the war.</span> <span id="s2649">It didn’t even exist in 1946 in New York.</span> <span id="s2650">So, this is human nature.</span> <span id="s2651">You just shrug, and you figure it out by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: And, even Luba laughed because of your thinking that you could pregnant from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Did she say anything else to you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: About Rumkowski?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: So, you didn’t talk-</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: She told me that she had known him since childhood, since the orphanage, but their relationship, their talk was so relaxed and so easy, it wasn’t on the basis of “Sir.”</span> <span id="s2660">It was on the basis of “you”, and you don’t call the president “you;” you call him “Mr. President.”</span> <span id="s2661">Even in Polish.</span> <span id="s2662">So, it was fairly obvious that there was a connection, somehow, somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: Did she in some sense after all these years, gain some power, now that she was a woman and not a girl, with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: Well, the power she gained was the additional food, the apartment, those were the obvious gains.</span> <span id="s2665">She managed all sorts of strange things.</span> <span id="s2666">She lived in a small room, a small apartment, and it was cold and you couldn’t heat it, but you could get the element, which is the spiral that fits into a heater, for instance, and she strung it across the room from right to left, but you couldn’t hook it up to meter because the Germans would have known.</span> <span id="s2667">So, she got in an electrician to hook it up above the meter, so it would not show the numbers on the individual room meters.</span> <span id="s2668">I mean, she knew things that nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2669">She knew how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Actually, what I meant was that in some way she had a certain kind of power with Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: She didn’t use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: She didn’t use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: No, on the contrary, she was very relaxed and she was very sweet, very smiley.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: Yeah, very outgoing, jovial, joking, because in the end, she got a reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: So, when this is happening, that he’s forcing you in essence to masturbate him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: Where are you in your head?</span> <span id="s2679">Do you go somewhere?</span> <span id="s2680">Do you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A: Fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: You’re in fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Fear, just fear, cold fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: And it’s the same thing each time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Over and over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: And it only stops because the kitchen is closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: You think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2690">Maybe he would have found another toy, but the kitchen closed on Monday and on Tuesday we were working in the Saddlery, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: Was that hard work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Yes, it was sewing the metal frames that go around a shovel that a soldier carries on his belt to dig a trench, and those were sewn on a goat or a causa (ph), as you say in a Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2693">That means you sit on a bench and in front of you is like a head with a vice, with a wooden vice, and you put the leather into – the two pieces of leather into the wooden vice, you have an awl to punch the whole, and then you have a long string with two needles, one right, one left – and you sew a double stitch like this, and it was piecework.</span> <span id="s2694">I mean, they counted it, and once in a while, there were ten strips to a unit.</span> <span id="s2695">Once in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you had to go to the foreman, who was a young man our age and you had to do a lot of explaining and a lot of excusing, and then you would get another strip, but they were counted out carefully because the Germans had shipped them carefully.</span> <span id="s2696">The reason my strips disappeared is I stole them.</span> <span id="s2697">I stole six strips because my shoes had no soles, and I put them in the top of my boots, and I walked through the inspection; it was like at the airport.</span> <span id="s2698">They would tap you from neck to the bottom.</span> <span id="s2699">Occasionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had all six out.</span> <span id="s2700">Nobody knew, and people thought I must have lost my mind, but I had no soles for the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: And, then you get somebody to fix them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: I got a shoemaker to sole the shoes, and the reason he didn’t talk is because he could keep half of the strips, and he could sell them for bread.</span> <span id="s2703">I think it’s about the only time I stole.</span> <span id="s2704">That’s why I never bought a pair of boots, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: And you didn’t buy a pair of boots because – weren’t these boots something that were made for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: The boots came from an old hatbox that my mother had, and when I had them made, I gave half the hatbox to the shoemaker.</span> <span id="s2707">And in Poland, there are two shoemakers; one who makes the uppers and one who makes the bottom.</span> <span id="s2708">One makes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the bottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it’s two procedures.</span> <span id="s2709">It’s like a designer, designing the upper part, and then putting the sole on it.</span> <span id="s2710">And the reason I got them made was that I left them have the box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a bottom.</span> <span id="s2711">The side were sort of stiff, and – but they only lasted one winter or maybe a winter and a half and I came through the soles, and I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in sort of a nice brown leather, but much too soft for shoes.</span> <span id="s2712">They were for a hatbox, not for shoes.</span> <span id="s2713">But I had enough room below the knee to get a thin item into it like a strip of leather, and those I stole.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: So, why is that you’ve never bought a pair of boots since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: Because I remember those boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: And never wanted another pair of boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: No.</span> <span id="s2718">I couldn’t, because my mother used the box for hats before the war.</span> <span id="s2719">I never bought a pair of boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: It’s good you lived in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: Probably, but in California there were boots.</span> <span id="s2722">It’s fashionable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: That’s true.</span> <span id="s2724">So, did these – when they fixed the boots, it was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: Yes, but the frostbite remained.</span> <span id="s2726">I saved the toes, but barely.</span> <span id="s2727">And once in awhile, they lose all circulation and they turn greenish-blue.</span> <span id="s2728">But I kept them.</span> <span id="s2729">I mean, I didn’t lose any toes.</span> <span id="s2730">They thawed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: And how long were you working in the leather factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Until deportation out of the ghetto in fall of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: And you get there a few months before.</span> <span id="s2734">You worked there a few months or longer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Yes, I worked there a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: And, Rumkowski doesn’t follow you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: No, never – never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: And, do you ever talk to anyone else before you leave the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Does it in some way leave your mind or does it wear on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2742">If you went through the war, nothing leaves your mind.</span> <span id="s2743">It’s filed away under Z or Y.</span> <span id="s2744">You don’t think of it every minute or every day, but once in awhile, something comes back.</span> <span id="s2745">I was at the airport in Munich in September, and it was of course after New York, and there the Germans stood in their uniforms and their black boots, and one of them started yelling, “You can’t use this door.</span> <span id="s2746">Use that door.”</span> <span id="s2747">And normally I don’t understand German, I just understand English, and it brought back, “What are you, Gestapo?”</span> <span id="s2748">I just – it just came back.</span> <span id="s2749">I didn’t do it on purpose.</span> <span id="s2750">There are flashbacks when I’m under stress, but not otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: And when you wrote the first part of your autobiography, From Ashes to Life, there’s a hint of this – what happened with Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Why did it take you a few years more to decide that you would write about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: Because it’s difficult to admit this.</span> <span id="s2755">The times have changed.</span> <span id="s2756">We hear now of abuse of children.</span> <span id="s2757">We hear now of abuse of wives.</span> <span id="s2758">Twenty years ago, we didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2759">It’s very painful to go public with something you’re not proud of.</span> <span id="s2760">What should I have done?</span> <span id="s2761">Maybe I should have run away.</span> <span id="s2762">Maybe I should have slapped him.</span> <span id="s2763">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2764">Maybe I should have done something.</span> <span id="s2765">It’s difficult to say, and that’s why I didn’t write it.</span> <span id="s2766">The other reason I didn’t write it is because my mother used to say, “If you can’t say something good about a human being, don’t say it.”</span> <span id="s2767">And I agonized with that for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: Do you think that in some ways it helps people to understand something about Rumkowski that they couldn’t understand otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: I don’t know whether people now really can understand our past.</span> <span id="s2770">I think you have to have lived through it to understand it emotionally.</span> <span id="s2771">Intellectually, maybe – I can’t expect my children to understand the past or what it was like.</span> <span id="s2772">It’s not possible.</span> <span id="s2773">The Holocaust has become a matter of scholarly research, of history, and it is viewed differently than it is viewed by those who were there.</span> <span id="s2774">It is unavoidable, and it will change more in 20 years when we are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">Q: For me, if I can just say this, in my innocence, I would have thought that someone who took care of children in an orphanage was a different kind of person.</span> <span id="s2776">Even knowing all I know about child abuse, and knowing this makes it much more understandable how he becomes such a dictator within the context of Lodz.</span> <span id="s2777">Because it is a very odd move, it would appear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: Yeah, but look at the people who work as nurses in a hospital and kill people by injection.</span> <span id="s2779">Wouldn’t you expect that their training, the intellect – after all, they went to college – and their medical knowledge, to do just the opposite.</span> <span id="s2780">And what is it in human nature that makes us inhuman?</span> <span id="s2781">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: Maybe being human.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Do people believe you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: People believe me, except for Germany, where I was told, “We are having a problem with the subject of all the Jewish elders.”</span> <span id="s2786">And I cannot understand why.</span> <span id="s2787">As I explained to them, politely at first, “If you had not invaded Poland, if you had not created the ghettos, if you had not kept us prison within the ghettos, we would have had no Jewish elders.</span> <span id="s2788">So, you shouldn’t have a problem because these are facts.”</span> <span id="s2789">If you question the honesty, I can only say, “Were you there?”</span> <span id="s2790">If you were not there, it’s easy to talk.</span> <span id="s2791">So, that’s the only thing I encountered, in Germany, not in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: Not even with scholars?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: They accept what you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: They would like to see evidence.</span> <span id="s2796">They know of other quotes in other books, of other paragraphs.</span> <span id="s2797">They know of the dismissed complaint, which happened in the mid ’30s.</span> <span id="s2798">It is not something that appeared out of nowhere.</span> <span id="s2799">The indications were there.</span> <span id="s2800">The knowledge was there, but in the ’30s, for a Jewish community to admit something like this is overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2801">You couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s2802">The publicity would have been devastating, and it wasn’t done.</span> <span id="s2803">I mean, there were a lot of taboos in the ’30s, and lots of things that were never mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">Q: I’m trying to figure out where to go right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: Because it’s late, and I know that you’re after the deportation from Lodz, you were a couple of weeks in Auschwitz, and then you moved to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">A: Dessauer Ufer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: Right, to do heavy construction?</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Yes, which was a camp, and out-, a sub-camp of Neuengamme, and from there they moved us to Sasel, to build temporary housing for the Germans for the bombed out Germans, and from there to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: And, you were in Bergen-Belsen in ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Yes, March ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: So, you’re there for about a month before the British come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Just about, and I wouldn’t have made it much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: The dead were not buried.</span> <span id="s2816">The dead were lying on the walkways.</span> <span id="s2817">Typhus was rampant.</span> <span id="s2818">The dead were not even thrown into the pits.</span> <span id="s2819">They were decaying.</span> <span id="s2820">People died by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s2821">The Germans did not enter the camp any longer.</span> <span id="s2822">They remained on the other side of the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s2823">The camp was guarded from watchtowers by Hungarian – by soldiers in Hungarian uniforms who were vicious, who shot a great deal, and I think another three to four weeks and Bergen-Belsen would have been empty.</span> <span id="s2824">Nobody would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: And were you ill by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: I had typhus and just before, and my friend who was killed in Sweden at least gave me some water.</span> <span id="s2827">I had jaundice in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2828">I had liver problems in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2829">I had kidney trouble, and a few other little things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: So, did you think that it could worse after leaving Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: No, I didn’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: But it did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: Yes and no, because Lodz lasted three full years and the horror was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2834">Bergen-Belsen was as horrible, maybe more so, but of shorter duration.</span> <span id="s2835">So, the impact for me was the ghetto and not Bergen-Belsen because by Bergen-Belsen, you really didn’t care anymore.</span> <span id="s2836">There was not enough energy left to care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: When you’re deported from Lodz, do you know what’s going on in the war?</span> <span id="s2838">Have you heard any-?</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: So, you know nothing.</span> <span id="s2841">You were so-</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: We were in cattle cars and looking through the slits above.</span> <span id="s2843">You had to stand on somebody’s shoulders.</span> <span id="s2844">You saw troop trains on adjacent tracks.</span> <span id="s2845">You saw other trains with men in striped gray and blue uniforms that were shouting something at us, which you of course could not hear.</span> <span id="s2846">I sat in a corner together with Dr. Singer, his sister, his wife and his two children.</span> <span id="s2847">The last time I saw him was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2848">How he died in Auschwitz, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s2849">Somebody in Germany claimed he was shot.</span> <span id="s2850">I rather doubt it.</span> <span id="s2851">I think he was very gaunt looking and he looked much older than his age.</span> <span id="s2852">I think he just went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2853">I spent the whole rest of the war with his daughter partly with his wife.</span> <span id="s2854">His wife died right after liberation of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2855">His sister survived and died in London.</span> <span id="s2856">It’s really immaterial how he died.</span> <span id="s2857">He didn’t make it out of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: But all during that period, from end of August, September when you arrived in Auschwitz in September of ’44 until April of ’45, you were not sure what was going on – who’s winning, who’s losing, how it’s going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: We heard some distant air raids in and around the city of Hamburg, but it was not the major attack of ’43.</span> <span id="s2860">We heard rumors because adjacent to us were some Italian prisoners of war and in Neuengamme were French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2861">We heard rumors, but we had heard rumors for five years.</span> <span id="s2862">We had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: I know that we can go on for a few more hours, which we will not do now.</span> <span id="s2864">But what I would like to do, and maybe well just take one more tape – maybe we’ll stop now.</span> <span id="s2865">I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s2866">What I think I would like to do because I would like to end this on a very sweet, romantic note.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: Okay, and what I’d like to do is tell about the story about meeting your husband, which makes a really wonderful ending, even though there’s so much more you can cover.</span> <span id="s2869">So, let’s stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s2872">We’re going to go back to your deportation from Lodz.</span> <span id="s2873">I’d like to have some description of that deportation and the train ride as far as you remember.</span> <span id="s2874">Just describe it some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: The deportation was by street.</span> <span id="s2876">The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2877">My street was very early on the list.</span> <span id="s2878">That meant if you did not vacate or if the Jews did not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us.</span> <span id="s2879">I’m not sure which.</span> <span id="s2880">So, you took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could walk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if they would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding.</span> <span id="s2881">I started walking and I knocked on Luba’s door because she was on the other side.</span> <span id="s2882">Her boyfriend answered the door.</span> <span id="s2883">I told him who I was, and he said in Polish and not very politely, “Get lost.”</span> <span id="s2884">He didn’t open the door.</span> <span id="s2885">I knocked on another door.</span> <span id="s2886">A friend – a coworker who was living with her elderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but they shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a child, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, “You either leave or...”.</span> <span id="s2887">So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad siding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles or suitcases.</span> <span id="s2888">I had a little suitcase and my father’s briefcase, and the briefcase held documents – papers, passports, whatever.</span> <span id="s2889">And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his family, and they said, “Come on over.</span> <span id="s2890">We’ll go together.”</span> <span id="s2891">We stood there probably for a couple of hours in the heat.</span> <span id="s2892">The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car.</span> <span id="s2893">We each received a piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received some sort of a sausage, but we did not – nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s2894">We entered the cattle car, and I sat with Oskar’s family in one corner.</span> <span id="s2895">There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two children, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, “Where are we going?”</span> <span id="s2896">He shrugged his shoulders.</span> <span id="s2897">He said, “Probably west for labor.”</span> <span id="s2898">That was the best guess.</span> <span id="s2899">The cattle cars were closed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains on the same siding that were given preference.</span> <span id="s2900">Either they were prisoners from other areas or they were troop movements.</span> <span id="s2901">We were never sure.</span> <span id="s2902">We tried to yell over to a different car, but of course that doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s2903">We sat in these hot cattle cars.</span> <span id="s2904">Some people cried.</span> <span id="s2905">Some people fainted.</span> <span id="s2906">There was a bucket in the corner.</span> <span id="s2907">The bucket soon overflowed.</span> <span id="s2908">You couldn’t lie down.</span> <span id="s2909">You could barely sit.</span> <span id="s2910">And there was really no energy to think, “What next?</span> <span id="s2911">Where next?”</span> <span id="s2912">At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened.</span> <span id="s2913">There was no jumping.</span> <span id="s2914">The next time the door opened was four in the morning two days later with a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands.</span> <span id="s2915">We scrambled out of the car, and we stood.</span> <span id="s2916">They shouted orders, “Men to the left.</span> <span id="s2917">Women to the right.”</span> <span id="s2918">And I stood with the women, with the single women.</span> <span id="s2919">Oskar and his son went to the other side.</span> <span id="s2920">And they were soon marched off into the distance.</span> <span id="s2921">We don’t know where.</span> <span id="s2922">We don’t how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between young and old.</span> <span id="s2923">We lined up, and I held the briefcase.</span> <span id="s2924">I held onto that briefcase with the papers.</span> <span id="s2925">Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important.</span> <span id="s2926">And the command was shouted, “Drop your belongings.”</span> <span id="s2927">Which meant a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I wouldn’t let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer’s daughter, and towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand, and he shouted back, “You saved yourself a beating.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: So, who tore it out of your hand – Singer’s daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: His daughter made me drop it.</span> <span id="s2930">She just tore it and dropped it.</span> <span id="s2931">She probably saved my life.</span> <span id="s2932">A little further down the road, the separated the old from the young.</span> <span id="s2933">In back stood a woman who lived also on Pawia Street, and that’s another story, with a four year old child, a very ugly child and I’ve never really seen an ugly child.</span> <span id="s2934">The child was locked up while the parents went to work in the daytime.</span> <span id="s2935">The child whined.</span> <span id="s2936">The child was hidden behind a chimney during the selection, during the curfew for hours alone, and in Auschwitz, she stood behind us.</span> <span id="s2937">She was ordered to let the child go because she was probably in her ’30s, and she wouldn’t let the child go, and the SS man hit them between the two hands holding onto each other, and they didn’t let go.</span> <span id="s2938">The child screamed terribly, but they wouldn’t let go, and his last remarks were, “You may both go to the gas chamber.”</span> <span id="s2939">And they were marched off with the old people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: You heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: And what went through your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: Nothing, what’s a gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: It didn’t make any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: No, it didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s2946">By evening it did, when I saw the smoke and when the grapevine carried the words forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: But not then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">A: No, and one was so bewildered by this whole scene that one didn’t think.</span> <span id="s2949">We heard that there was a family camp in Auschwitz which we never saw.</span> <span id="s2950">We heard that there were gypsies.</span> <span id="s2951">We never saw them.</span> <span id="s2952">We did see Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s2953">There was a young man in a striped uniform with an armband ___, red, and he spoke Polish to us and he said, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s2954">And we said, “From Lodz.”</span> <span id="s2955">And we asked him, “Where are we?”</span> <span id="s2956">And he said, “Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s2957">And, my friend asked, “What’s Auschwitz?”</span> <span id="s2958">He said, “You mean to say you don’t know?”</span> <span id="s2959">“No, never heard of it.”</span> <span id="s2960">He said, “I’ve been here a year and a half, two years.”</span> <span id="s2961">He didn’t come from Lodz.</span> <span id="s2962">He came from someplace else.</span> <span id="s2963">He couldn’t understand, but he did ask us whether we knew his sister who might have been in our transport.</span> <span id="s2964">And there was a woman who recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that was already the next day.</span> <span id="s2965">From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not elderly or not children anymore, into a barracks.</span> <span id="s2966">We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry, fold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair, and Dr. Singer’s daughter asked, “Couldn’t we rather have a number?”</span> <span id="s2967">and, the answer was, “Here you take what you get.</span> <span id="s2968">You don’t ask for anything.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: Where did she get the idea to ask for a number?</span> <span id="s2970">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: She saw some women kappa with numbers who did the actual shaving under SS orders.</span> <span id="s2972">And as we were walked out of that barracks, the upper half of the door was glass and I saw my head minus hair and two big ears and it looked like an egg and I started to cry.</span> <span id="s2973">It looked so horrible that today I’m asking myself, “How could I have been so stupid and so vain?”</span> <span id="s2974">But I was.</span> <span id="s2975">We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one adjacent to the other – without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said something about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn’t know what a gas chamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and the little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each thrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece, nothing else.</span> <span id="s2976">One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of us were barefoot.</span> <span id="s2977">It was hot in Auschwitz – being called out in the morning, it was freezing cold.</span> <span id="s2978">Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning, my scalp was peeling.</span> <span id="s2979">That’s how hot it was.</span> <span id="s2980">We were given a slice of bread a day and some brown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given no utensils.</span> <span id="s2981">So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her wooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and handed it to the next in line, but we guarded the shoes like you would guard Fort Knox.</span> <span id="s2982">We were afraid somebody would steal them and run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: So, none of you got shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: No, there were close to 500 of us in that barracks, and the barracks – there were no cots.</span> <span id="s2985">The floors were concrete floors and they were divided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and each section had to have five human beings, but there wasn’t room for five.</span> <span id="s2986">So, at night, we would – one would sit against the barracks wall, spread the legs and the next one would move in, until all five of us could sit that way, and in order to sleep, you would lean against the neck or the chest of the person in back of you.</span> <span id="s2987">The corner – the center of the barracks had a raised platform, and the barracks had a couple who had been in Auschwitz quite a while, she had hair.</span> <span id="s2988">She was Jewish by the looks of her.</span> <span id="s2989">I don’t know where she came from originally, not from Poland.</span> <span id="s2990">And she had a cubicle in the corner that was sort of parceled off – it was sort of hidden away with a string that was attached to the right and left of the wall.</span> <span id="s2991">It was a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we’d see an SS man come to visit.</span> <span id="s2992">She screamed a lot.</span> <span id="s2993">She beat us, if we weren’t fast enough.</span> <span id="s2994">I don’t think she killed anybody.</span> <span id="s2995">Her name was Maja.</span> <span id="s2996">She might have been from Romania.</span> <span id="s2997">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2998">She did not come with us, though she told us after a couple of weeks that there would be an inspection, to undress, take off the rag.</span> <span id="s2999">There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area.</span> <span id="s3000">We should put the dress over the right arm, and walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one of them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left.</span> <span id="s3001">We later found out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, which we did not know.</span> <span id="s3002">We had never heard of him, and it had no meaning to us until it was explained probably several years later, or a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: You mean that someone explained to you a year later that it was Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3005">No, they said that one of them was Dr. Mengele, but we did not know who he was or what he was, and we were given another rag and a pair of random shoes.</span> <span id="s3006">I got a size eight shoes; I wear a six.</span> <span id="s3007">And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three days later, I stood on Dr. Singer’s daughter’s shoulders and I looked out through the little slit in the cattle car, and I said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s3008">We’re near Hamburg.”</span> <span id="s3009">And then she went up and she looked and she said, “Nah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here.</span> <span id="s3010">You’ve lost your mind.</span> <span id="s3011">It’s been hot too long.”</span> <span id="s3012">And the cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a warehouse of the outer harbor that housed Czech women on the other side.</span> <span id="s3013">It housed some men from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the Deutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage in and around Hamburg.</span> <span id="s3014">And even Dessauer Ufer was not a concept because it was the address of a harbor area which to me had no meaning.</span> <span id="s3015">It was not residential.</span> <span id="s3016">But when they started us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we had on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the fabric was cut out so you couldn’t run away – no stars, no nothing.</span> <span id="s3017">Some had a purple triangle, but very few.</span> <span id="s3018">That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for a minute I thought, “Since I know the area, I could get away.”</span> <span id="s3019">But how?</span> <span id="s3020">To whom?</span> <span id="s3021">Where?</span> <span id="s3022">Food?</span> <span id="s3023">And then I realized that this was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s3024">So, they then transferred us to another camp and in a now very fashionable area in Wedel where the mayor of the city lives, and there is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS men and women.</span> <span id="s3025">They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s3026">There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and I, we spoke German, who got sent to the office.</span> <span id="s3027">We had the disadvantage that the commander of the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was vicious.</span> <span id="s3028">He would come in and he would kick us with his boots.</span> <span id="s3029">We had bloody legs and bloody arms, but for a while we didn’t go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating.</span> <span id="s3030">The SS women had no compassion, no understanding.</span> <span id="s3031">There was no typewriter.</span> <span id="s3032">Everything was written manually with a pencil, not with ink.</span> <span id="s3033">I do not know why.</span> <span id="s3034">Most of these SS people had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the war.</span> <span id="s3035">For the most part, they were uneducated.</span> <span id="s3036">The women were vicious, some of them.</span> <span id="s3037">The men – some were vicious, some were not so bad.</span> <span id="s3038">They brought in three women from Prague to be in charge of the camp, to be kapos.</span> <span id="s3039">They couldn’t speak Polish, but they managed German, and the story of these three women is another story.</span> <span id="s3040">They brought in one woman who was tiny, it’s also another story.</span> <span id="s3041">We couldn’t tell how old she was.</span> <span id="s3042">She probably was in her late ’30s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an MD by training.</span> <span id="s3043">She came from Romania, and she was in charge of the hospital room, but nobody dared ever use it.</span> <span id="s3044">It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on the worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the latrines where we would talk a few minutes, and then she would go her way and I would go my way.</span> <span id="s3045">She had worked for Mengele in Auschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women could live and the babies died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">Q: And her name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: Gisa Pearl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: Oh, Gisa Pearl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: Yes, she was in the same camp, and there were 500 of us.</span> <span id="s3050">She came to New York, and I saw her one more time after the war.</span> <span id="s3051">I know she went to Israel, and I know she died.</span> <span id="s3052">The camp was not the worst possible place.</span> <span id="s3053">One of the SS women took the young woman who cleaned the SS barracks and me in a truck to Hamburg to pick-up provisions.</span> <span id="s3054">We saw the bombed city, and she stopped at a building in front of the building that used to be upper-middle class neighborhood apartments – wrought iron balconies and a lot of stucco work, very pretty.</span> <span id="s3055">And she told us curtly to get out of the truck, moved us towards the entrance, all the way back and down into the basement, and she knocked on the door and the door opened and it was her mother.</span> <span id="s3056">And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned the barracks would come from Lodz with us.</span> <span id="s3057">She was very small, very tiny, but very friendly and very obliging.</span> <span id="s3058">She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave me a chair to sit on, but not a word was spoken.</span> <span id="s3059">We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke.</span> <span id="s3060">I mean she spoke to her mother, but we didn’t speak and she didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s3061">We went back to camp.</span> <span id="s3062">We didn’t tell, and we couldn’t quite figure out what the story was.</span> <span id="s3063">I think that was the only kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall.</span> <span id="s3064">When they evacuated Sasel and put the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s3065">Except for the overcrowded barracks and the dead bodies, I only remember two mountains of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes – old and new and worn, huge mountains, and what crossed my mind was, “Where are the feet?”</span> <span id="s3066">But it didn’t matter anymore.</span> <span id="s3067">After Bergen-Belsen was taken over by the British, I worked as an interpreter and translator.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: Had you given up in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: It was hopeless.</span> <span id="s3070">I mean, we saw the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s3071">We saw the typhus that was ravaging the – we only saw the women.</span> <span id="s3072">We did not see the men.</span> <span id="s3073">There was no possibility you could live another month in Bergen-Belsen, and food wasn’t important anymore – not the soup, not the bread, nothing.</span> <span id="s3074">And one day we saw the Germans with white bands on their arms sort of tight, white rags.</span> <span id="s3075">We couldn’t figure out why, and another few days passed and then on April 15th, the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the Russians, and they managed, but they found us, as well, and they were not prepared for what they found.</span> <span id="s3076">I worked for them almost from the first day, although I was sick a great deal.</span> <span id="s3077">I had a very good boss.</span> <span id="s3078">He was a major.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">Q: How did they found you with the thousands of women there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">A: In that small group that managed to approach the second tank, somebody asked, “Where are we?</span> <span id="s3081">What is this?</span> <span id="s3082">Who speaks English?”</span> <span id="s3083">And there were very few people who spoke English because, coming from Poland, you speak French, not English.</span> <span id="s3084">So, there were five or six of us that knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: And you were one of the ones approached?</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: I said, “I speak English.”</span> <span id="s3087">And we showed them around the camp.</span> <span id="s3088">In the evening he asked, “What can I give you?”</span> <span id="s3089">I said, “Cigarettes and some biscuits.”</span> <span id="s3090">And the only thing they could find for us to eat were two pound cans of pork and lard, and they handed them out, and we opened up those cans with stones, with metal, whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s3091">We had no can openers.</span> <span id="s3092">Most of us ate that stuff.</span> <span id="s3093">It was half lard and half pork, and probably came from an occupied country.</span> <span id="s3094">By morning, hundreds of people were dead, among them Dr. Singer’s wife.</span> <span id="s3095">His daughter and I ate the biscuits and smoked the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s3096">I continued work and I didn’t know when to come to work.</span> <span id="s3097">I was allowed to pick out a watch from the storehouse in the camp where they had items sorted by watches, rings, pearls, jewelry, teeth – gold teeth, and I picked out a little silver watch.</span> <span id="s3098">The back was rusted.</span> <span id="s3099">It had a black leather band.</span> <span id="s3100">And I wore the watch, and I thought, “If only somebody would say, ‘You wore my watch,’” but nobody ever did.</span> <span id="s3101">And a few days later, my boss asked, “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s3102">And I said, “I would like a shower.”</span> <span id="s3103">And he provided several of us with a Red Cross woman, a little piece of soap and a towel.</span> <span id="s3104">I thought I could wash away the past.</span> <span id="s3105">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s3106">Eventually, we were given clean clothing.</span> <span id="s3107">It took about four weeks.</span> <span id="s3108">The barracks had to be burned down in very short notice.</span> <span id="s3109">They buried the dead with a bulldozer.</span> <span id="s3110">The mass graves are there, 500,000 – 5,000 – I think in all, they buried 10,000 people when I was there in September.</span> <span id="s3111">The terrain is immense, the terrain of Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s3112">I would say probably bigger than Birkenau, but nothing remains standing because of typhus.</span> <span id="s3113">I got one picture of one barracks and I think you have the original in DC.</span> <span id="s3114">And as I worked for the British, my boss asked me, “What did you do during the war?</span> <span id="s3115">And where did you work?</span> <span id="s3116">And with whom did you work?”</span> <span id="s3117">And somehow I mentioned those two months in the office and he said, “What did you do?”</span> <span id="s3118">I said, “Well, I worked on names and addresses and kept a roster of the SS and a roster of food supplies, and how many women went to each work detail,” because the shipyards where we worked had to pay the government for our labor.</span> <span id="s3119">This is what is in dispute now, if you ever see it.</span> <span id="s3120">And he said, “You worked in the office, and you wrote down their names?</span> <span id="s3121">Do you remember any?”</span> <span id="s3122">I said, “All 42 of them.”</span> <span id="s3123">He said, “No, can’t be.”</span> <span id="s3124">And he gave me a pad and pencil, and I wrote them down – first name, last name and address.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">Q: And address?</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">A: And address because it was in and around Hamburg.</span> <span id="s3127">It was very easy.</span> <span id="s3128">I had lived there.</span> <span id="s3129">I knew the place.</span> <span id="s3130">I spoke the language.</span> <span id="s3131">He didn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s3132">It took a few weeks.</span> <span id="s3133">He checked it out, and he found out that it was correct, and they took the truck or lorrie, as they called it, and gradually we picked up one after the other, 40 of them, in and around the city, and they all said, “We never did anything bad unless you deserved it.</span> <span id="s3134">We never beat you.</span> <span id="s3135">We never did anything.”</span> <span id="s3136">Two of them were with the Americans in Southern Germany, and they were brought up, and I rang usually the door bell, and I asked, “Is Mrs. Miller home?”</span> <span id="s3137">And then her father would yell, “Else Miller, somebody here for you.”</span> <span id="s3138">And, she would come to the door, and the British were right behind me.</span> <span id="s3139">I had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s3140">I asked that I could walk passed the prison, Munsevan (ph) Prison.</span> <span id="s3141">I just wanted to see them behind bars, and they all begged for help, and “We’ve never done anything,” and “We’ve always liked you.”</span> <span id="s3142">I don’t know what else they said.</span> <span id="s3143">I didn’t hear a thing.</span> <span id="s3144">I was once taken to the city of Saale (ph) near Bergen-Belsen, and it was some sort of a preliminary deposition.</span> <span id="s3145">I was asked whether I would speak German or English, and I said English, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown skirt and I was driven in a staff car, in an English car.</span> <span id="s3146">I don’t remember the questions.</span> <span id="s3147">I don’t remember the answers.</span> <span id="s3148">I don’t know what I said – probably two hours.</span> <span id="s3149">They thanked me, and they remained in prison, and a few weeks later I received little notes under the dormitory door where we were housed threatening my life.</span> <span id="s3150">The first one was nothing.</span> <span id="s3151">The second one was worrisome, and the third one, I was hysterical.</span> <span id="s3152">Three days later, the British drove me across the Dutch border into Belgium, into Brussels together with three other young women, and from Brussels to Lille, and the captain whose drive drove us.</span> <span id="s3153">We went out for dinner in Lille and there wasn’t much to eat in ’45 in Lille, food was rationed.</span> <span id="s3154">They had survived a war.</span> <span id="s3155">We ate some chicken, but it tasted like leather.</span> <span id="s3156">I forgot.</span> <span id="s3157">He was engaged to a young woman.</span> <span id="s3158">It turned out he was Jewish and he had been born in Berlin, and he put me on the train in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the address of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel, at quatre bis rue des Rosiers.</span> <span id="s3159">The metro opened two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a Polish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, “Which subway do I take?</span> <span id="s3160">How do I get there?”</span> <span id="s3161">I had only been to Paris once as a child.</span> <span id="s3162">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s3163">And he told me and he accompanied me, and I was back in the dormitory youth hostel, but this time it was Paris – no food, the food was rationed.</span> <span id="s3164">The little clothing I had I had to sell because I needed money.</span> <span id="s3165">And I started visiting the American embassy.</span> <span id="s3166">They saw me coming, “There she is again.”</span> <span id="s3167">I made a nuisance of myself.</span> <span id="s3168">I’ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point.</span> <span id="s3169">It was no improvement except it had no Germans, but living was horrible.</span> <span id="s3170">I met a young Hungarian woman there which is again, another story, who had been married in an Orthodox ceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it was a civil ceremony.</span> <span id="s3171">It wasn’t a chupah.</span> <span id="s3172">That was to come later, but in the eyes of the law, she was the legal wife of that man who lived in Williamsburg, New York.</span> <span id="s3173">She eventually married him in Williamsburg, but that’s a totally different story.</span> <span id="s3174">I’ll mail you that story.</span> <span id="s3175">And we lived six of us in that tiny corner on cots with an outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down the corner to the bathhouse.</span> <span id="s3176">It was 1945, ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">Q: And the Brits gave you no money?</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s3179">They gave me food – all starchy, I weighed 140 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: So, you’re dying to get out of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">A: I’m dying to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s3182">I got papers from a former classmate in New York, and I got papers eventually for Palestine from the British because I was showing that letter of commendation wherever I could.</span> <span id="s3183">There were no photocopy machines.</span> <span id="s3184">They wanted to keep it, and I didn’t want to let it go.</span> <span id="s3185">It was a big battle.</span> <span id="s3186">And I got the two papers within two days of each other, and the family decided that my cousin who was in the British brigade in Einhofen was supposed to marry me – marry me for real.</span> <span id="s3187">I said, “No, I’m not coming to Palestine-”</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: This is your family who’s in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: -I’m going to New York.”</span> <span id="s3190">And I paid $500 to get on a merchant marine boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Where did you get $500?</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: My uncle in Palestine sent it to a cousin in Belfort, France and it got to me.</span> <span id="s3193">I repaid it, but a long time later, with a refrigerator because they couldn’t get refrigerators.</span> <span id="s3194">It took 22 days from Bordeaux to New York because it was March, the hold was empty.</span> <span id="s3195">There were ten of us on the boat, and they were all, they were the Polish ambassador’s sister-in-law, there was the fiancé of a lieutenant colonel.</span> <span id="s3196">They were people with considerable clout and we landed in the Fulton Fish Market after 23 days, and I was sick all 23 days.</span> <span id="s3197">And my friend, her parents kept me on their living room couch for a week, and they told me to get a job in a glove factory and get myself a rented room.</span> <span id="s3198">I earned $30 a week piece work, $5 went for taxis.</span> <span id="s3199">I paid $8 for rent, and I was ready to go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s3200">I hated it.</span> <span id="s3201">There was nothing in New York that even remotely appealed to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">A: Really.</span> <span id="s3204">That’s how lonely it was, how isolated – I mean, I spoke the language, but there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s3205">Everything I knew, everything that was familiar was in Europe.</span> <span id="s3206">God did I hate that work in that glove factory.</span> <span id="s3207">I loved leather, but I hoped I’d never see leather again, and I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">Q: Where did you live?</span> <span id="s3209">Where did you get an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: I didn’t get an apartment.</span> <span id="s3211">I got a furnished room on Long Island, on Woodside Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s3213">And you commuted in?</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">A: I commuted in for a nickel on the subway, and for another nickel, I bought sort of a chocolate square, chunky-something.</span> <span id="s3215">That was breakfast.</span> <span id="s3216">For lunch, I went to Chock-Full-o-Nuts, and I bought a cream cheese sandwich and a coke and it cost a quarter, and any money I had left over went for clothing.</span> <span id="s3217">I went absolutely clothing crazy.</span> <span id="s3218">I didn’t care if the dress cost $10 or $15, I just – I just had to buy it.</span> <span id="s3219">So, anytime I’d save some money, I would buy a dress, and I’d buy shoes in the cheapest shoe store, it was a chain in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: Bakers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Bakers – very high heels, and I bought them a half a size smaller instead of buying a six, I bought a five and a half.</span> <span id="s3222">Why?</span> <span id="s3223">I will never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: Didn’t it kill your feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">A: Of course it did.</span> <span id="s3226">I bought several pairs over a period of time, and then my friend who had sent the papers invited me – rather her mother did – for Friday evening Shabbat dinner because my friend’s father was somewhat conservatively religious, old-fashioned – not very, but a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: Could you stop for a moment?</span> <span id="s3228">Can we stop the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">[Break in tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s3231">I’m sorry for that interruption.</span> <span id="s3232">So, you’re going to this house for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: And there was my friend and her husband – she had married early, I think at 17 or 18 – and she was quite disturbed at the time.</span> <span id="s3234">I don’t know what the problems were, and nobody ever asked me, “Where have you come from?</span> <span id="s3235">What had you done?</span> <span id="s3236">Where had you worked?”</span> <span id="s3237">Nothing – the past was a taboo in New York.</span> <span id="s3238">It wasn’t mentioned.</span> <span id="s3239">It wasn’t addressed.</span> <span id="s3240">Nobody wanted to know.</span> <span id="s3241">They saw the newsreel, nobody spoke.</span> <span id="s3242">And at that party was my friend and her husband, her brother and his wife, and her brother’s friend.</span> <span id="s3243">And we had dinner and I guess we were introduced, and at one point his last name was dropped because at first it was only first names, and when I heard “Eichengreen”, the name was familiar.</span> <span id="s3244">I had met the Eichengreens on the way to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: This is Julie?</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: And Julius, and they had spoken of a son who was in Cuba and would go to the States.</span> <span id="s3247">I asked him about his parents and the answer was very evasive.</span> <span id="s3248">He had just come out of the army, and then several weeks later he called – or he called my friend’s mother and he asked where exactly had I come from?</span> <span id="s3249">Or was I in Hamburg?</span> <span id="s3250">Had I heard anything about his parents?</span> <span id="s3251">And I called him back and I said, “Probably.”</span> <span id="s3252">And I met him again for dinner at that house, and after dinner we walked from Sunnyside, Long Island – no, it wasn’t in Sunnyside.</span> <span id="s3253">It was in Rego Park – we walked back to Sunnyside.</span> <span id="s3254">It was about a three-hour walk and I told him the whole story.</span> <span id="s3255">It was, I think, the only time we ever talked about it.</span> <span id="s3256">We started dating, and that must have been April or May.</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">Q: Lucille, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s3258">What’s going through you now – thinking about telling Dan about his parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: The waste – the waste of a family.</span> <span id="s3260">We started dating in May and he made me go to evening school.</span> <span id="s3261">At least I learned to type and take some shorthand.</span> <span id="s3262">In July, we went to see his cousins in Los Angeles, and I liked them, cousins on both sides of the family, on the mother’s side and on the father’s side.</span> <span id="s3263">The mother’s side is partly Dreyfuss and Reinsburg and the father’s Eichengreen.</span> <span id="s3264">And on the train from New York to Los Angeles, he proposed, and I said I had to think it over, and I thought it over and I said yes.</span> <span id="s3265">It took a few days, but his aunt and uncle in New York and his many cousins in New York made one statement which they haven’t lived down yet.</span> <span id="s3266">“We don’t need an Eastern European Jew in the family, and we don’t need somebody from the camps.”</span> <span id="s3267">The irony of that remark was that all the other cousins married Eastern European Jews, but many years later.</span> <span id="s3268">I was just the first one.</span> <span id="s3269">And of course, there was no contact.</span> <span id="s3270">I did not want to see them or visit them.</span> <span id="s3271">There was very little contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">Q: Are these the same people who made dinner for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">A: No, those are strangers in the family.</span> <span id="s3274">The family lived in Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">Q: So, you never saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: And at 69th Street.</span> <span id="s3277">Very rarely, once when they came to California, but not – basically no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">Q: So, you were still Ostjuden?</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">A: Of course, we are still.</span> <span id="s3280">When we go to Berlin today, we are still Ostjuden.</span> <span id="s3281">There’s a decided difference.</span> <span id="s3282">I spoke to people now in Germany whose parents came from Lodz, but they were born after the war like my children.</span> <span id="s3283">They consider themselves German, and I said, “Just scratch the surface.</span> <span id="s3284">You’re a Polish Jew kid.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: So, tell me, there are at least three other men who said they wanted to marry you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">A: No, they didn’t really say it, but they were interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">Q: They were interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">A: They were interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">Q: When did you fall in love with Dan?</span> <span id="s3290">Did you fall in love before than he asked you to marry him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: No, about the same time.</span> <span id="s3292">He was very well read.</span> <span id="s3293">He was very well educated.</span> <span id="s3294">He saw that I read all the right books at the right time, and he brought them.</span> <span id="s3295">He worked for Baker &amp; Taylor in New York, which was the largest book distributor on Fifth Avenue down on 14th Street or something.</span> <span id="s3296">He was an export manager.</span> <span id="s3297">He took me out for dinner.</span> <span id="s3298">I could eat decently rather than makeshift.</span> <span id="s3299">He took me to Carnegie Hall.</span> <span id="s3300">He took me to the theater.</span> <span id="s3301">He took me to the opera.</span> <span id="s3302">And I took him to the Yiddish Theater on Second Avenue.</span> <span id="s3303">I think it was the first time he heard of Saul Tomaszewski.</span> <span id="s3304">His grandson now conducts the San Francisco Symphony – Tilson Thomas – still Tomaszewski.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">Q: So, did Dan also make you like New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">A: Yes, life changed.</span> <span id="s3307">We found an apartment.</span> <span id="s3308">We paid key money or black money because you couldn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s3309">We started out in a room the size-</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: What does that mean ‘key money’?</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: After the war, there were no apartments in New York.</span> <span id="s3312">You – we paid about $75 for a little glass enclosed porch and could use the kitchen and the bath of the landlady, and eventually somebody told us, “There’s an apartment vacant in Sunnyside, and if you give the superintendent $500, he will let you have the apartment.”</span> <span id="s3313">And we did.</span> <span id="s3314">It was a lot of money – it was a lot of army pay.</span> <span id="s3315">We got married in Washington Heights in the rabbi’s house.</span> <span id="s3316">Dan’s family did show up.</span> <span id="s3317">Only an old friend of my mother’s showed because there was nobody else, and my classmate, and we went for three days in a hired car to Goshen, upstate New York, because we had to get married on a Thursday because we had to go back to work on Monday.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: And the date of your marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: November 7, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: And this is November 7, 2001.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">A: We – I changed jobs, and I started to work for Lionel.</span> <span id="s3322">Do you remember those big toy trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: That whistled when you threw a little pill in it, and it smoked?</span> <span id="s3325">And it went around the track?</span> <span id="s3326">I worked for the export department of Lionel.</span> <span id="s3327">I learned to type.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: So, did you type well finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: Not…90 words a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">Q: That’s very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">A: I learned to operate a Dictaphone.</span> <span id="s3332">In those days we had Dictaphones, no computers, and I worked there from ’46 to ’49, and then an old friend colleague of my husband’s came to New York, and he had started a small business in San Francisco, and he said, “Pack up your car and come out.</span> <span id="s3333">You will work for me and I’ll give you $75 to start with a week,” which was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s3334">And we picked up the Plymouth and we drove out.</span> <span id="s3335">First we had a ’39 Plymouth, then we had a ’45, ’46 Plymouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">Q: Moving up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">A: And we drove in three days from New York to San Francisco, day and night.</span> <span id="s3338">We drove straight through.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Q: You didn’t even stop to see the scenery?</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">A: No, we couldn’t afford to, and the whole back was all full of whatever we had in clothing, and I had a little portable sewing machine for some odd reason, and a portable typewriter, which with covered key, I’d learned to type.</span> <span id="s3341">I got a job in San Francisco at Westinghouse, and I needed FBI clearance because they were dealing with turbines and generators and whatever we had to use against the Russians in those days, and it was a very uptight organization.</span> <span id="s3342">There was not another Jew in the whole organization, but it was pleasant and I think I made something like $300 a month which was a lot of money in 1950, and Dan wanted children very much, and I was very undecided, but we had the first child in 1952, and I stopped working for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">Q: Were you on the fence about having children, bringing children into the world, or being a mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">A: I didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: You didn’t want to bring children into the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: No, not into this world, and we bought a lot in Berkeley because Dan’s boss lived in Berkeley, and we build a two-bedroom house – a redwood house with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, and then we decided we ought to have at least two children, and then we add two rooms and a bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">Q: And were you then - it was okay to have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">A: Then it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">A: Because life had meaning.</span> <span id="s3351">Life had normalized.</span> <span id="s3352">I accepted the past.</span> <span id="s3353">I resented the past, but I accepted the past, that it was a part of me, and I asked myself whether I could live without the past, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s3354">So, it was all right.</span> <span id="s3355">The kids grew up in Berkeley, and I went back to school.</span> <span id="s3356">I went first to the college of arts and crafts, and then went to Contra Costa College, and then I went to UC.</span> <span id="s3357">It took a long time.</span> <span id="s3358">And then I went to Golden Gate College, and I finished the business courses, and I got a job as an insurance broker, and I worked there for about 20 years, which made it possible to send the kids through college without having to take out a loan.</span> <span id="s3359">It gave the kids music lessons, tennis lessons, riding lessons – you name it, they had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">Q: And what is Dan doing all this time?</span> <span id="s3361">What’s the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">A: Dan worked for this old friend.</span> <span id="s3363">It was a fairly successful business.</span> <span id="s3364">They made modern fireplace equipment.</span> <span id="s3365">They manufactured it.</span> <span id="s3366">It was a very time consuming job, a demanding job because the man was very difficult, very uneducated, very unschooled, from a very poor family in Germany.</span> <span id="s3367">The father rolled cigars for a living, and he also was an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s3368">The mother was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s3369">But somehow the contrast between these two men made the business work, because Dan was level-handed.</span> <span id="s3370">He was volatile.</span> <span id="s3371">He also became an alcoholic as he became affluent, and Dan had to carry him to bed when they went on a business trip.</span> <span id="s3372">We went a couple of times to New York because there was a show at the – Columbus Circle I think.</span> <span id="s3373">And life turned normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">Q: You found a very good person.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">Q: Why don’t we stop the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">End of Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Tape 7</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">Q: Who is this Lucy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">A: These are my parents –
