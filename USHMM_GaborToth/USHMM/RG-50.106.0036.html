Could you please say for me your name at birth, your birthdate, and your place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: Sure.</span> <span id="s16">My name is Charles Barber.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in Budapest in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Could you tell me some of your earliest memories of childhood growing up in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: The time I was born, my father was running a liquor store and we were living in the back of the store, and when I was about 5 years old my parents sold the store, and they moved into a building which was originally owned by my grandparents.</span> <span id="s20">And they left one third of that building to me and two thirds to two of their sons.</span> <span id="s21">And we lived there when I was 5 years old on.</span> <span id="s22">My earliest memory, I would like to talk about that just before I was going to grade school, one of my friends in the building said, oh, I know someone who will go to the same class as you do, but he will never talk to you.</span> <span id="s23">I said, why not?</span> <span id="s24">Said his father is an officer in the army, and they wouldn't talk to a Jew.</span> <span id="s25">And this came really as a shock to me, you know.</span> <span id="s26">I didn't know that why anybody wouldn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s27">So this is my earliest recollection that it was something wrong to be a Jew in Hungary.</span> <span id="s28">And even when I went to school, I found that person, and he never, ever said a word to me.</span> <span id="s29">And somehow I had the feeling that when somebody is an army officer, it might be a danger to me.</span> <span id="s30">Then I didn't really have too much trouble with my other classmates in school, but when we started to go to different to learn religion, which was everybody had to take religion in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Was this a private school or a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: No.</span> <span id="s33">Public school.</span> <span id="s34">It was a public school, but it everybody had to take religion.</span> <span id="s35">So the Catholic kids went to a Catholic, you know, and we went to learn Judah to learn Judaism and learn the Hebrew alphabet.</span> <span id="s36">And from then on, my relationship with the non Jewish students started to get bad.</span> <span id="s37">They one of one of my classmates said that, you people killed Christ.</span> <span id="s38">I knew I didn't, you know, so ... But that's how it started, really, to be bad in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were there other Jewish students at the school with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: There were several, yes.</span> <span id="s41">But there were not enough to have religious studies just for us, so we were meeting from other class, you know, and -- to make up enough students.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">The only thing I can remember now, when the war broke out, it was 1939, and I remember when the first bomb, which was dropped in Budapest, it was seven odd blocks from our building.</span> <span id="s43">And I later heard that it was really dropped by the Germans, and they said it was the Serbians to bring in Hungary into the war against Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s44">And my father then was called in for labour duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I was born in '32.</span> <span id="s47">I was about 7 or 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: How did that affect your family, your father being called into the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: My mother originally was making was a tailor yeah, a tailor, and she was sewing at home to make a living for us.</span> <span id="s50">But I knew that, you know, my mother my father went in, and I knew that many other people were called in, so it was not discrimination, you know, I felt, although my father wasn't having a weapon, and he had a yellow arm band which showed, you know, that he's a Jewish labour camp, you know, member.</span> <span id="s51">The first bad thing what happened in the family, my father had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s52">He became I don't know a Catholic or Lutheran or something, and he felt that that way he can have it easier.</span> <span id="s53">And he volunteered to the labour camp.</span> <span id="s54">The only difference it was from my father that instead of a yellow arm band, they had a white arm band, but they did the same thing.</span> <span id="s55">And when they marched into Russia, the Hungarian and German troops, they sent him there.</span> <span id="s56">And in about two months we got a note that he died.</span> <span id="s57">So this was the first real shock, you know, what happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And how old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I would say 10.</span> <span id="s60">10 or 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you have any early memories of your father at home, sort of family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: He at that time he came home, you know, for a few days.</span> <span id="s63">And one time he was sick and he was home for a few months, but it was not a normal family life, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Now I am thinking.</span> <span id="s65">In about 1943, it had to be, my mother got a telegram from Gestapo that I don't know the exact time, 24 or 48 hours she must go to the headquarters at Hotel Majestic.</span> <span id="s66">I don't know why they did that.</span> <span id="s67">Maybe somebody in the building reported that maybe we were listening to BBC or I don't know.</span> <span id="s68">But she called up one of her sisters.</span> <span id="s69">She had two sisters living in Hungary.</span> <span id="s70">One married a Gentile, and she became a Gentile herself, you know.</span> <span id="s71">And after she left home to go to the Hotel Majestic, the sister's husband, who was a Gentile, picked me up and took me to a woman who used to do housework for them.</span> <span id="s72">And she left me there.</span> <span id="s73">And I have a feeling he left me there.</span> <span id="s74">I have a feeling that they probably gave her money to keep me.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: No?</span> <span id="s80">So was that the last time you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span> <span id="s82">I will come to it.</span> <span id="s83">Then later on I don't know how many months later, you know the Jews had to wear a star, a Jewish star, and that woman got scared to keep me.</span> <span id="s84">So my uncle by marriage came, picked me up, and took me to another relative who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s85">And by that time the buildings had a Jewish star on it.</span> <span id="s86">Oh, one thing I wanted to mention what happened before I left our house.</span> <span id="s87">One of my friends came to me -- I had a collection of picture cards -- and said, why don't you give it to me?</span> <span id="s88">Whatever will happen to you, you will have no use to have those cards.</span> <span id="s89">You know, and this really got to my mind, you know.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't answer, you know, because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s91">So, anyway, I go back to it, that I -- I was taken to the relative of mine.</span> <span id="s92">And a few weeks later my mother was taken to a Hungarian camp which was called I I say it in the Hungarian pronunciation Kistarcsa.</span> <span id="s93">That was a camp for -- I don't know -- political prisoners or criminals.</span> <span id="s94">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s95">And they let her out after I don't know how many months.</span> <span id="s96">Maybe eight months.</span> <span id="s97">And she came to me, to this building, to live there with that relative.</span> <span id="s98">And I remember one day the leader of Hungary his name is Horthy made a radio speech that Hungary lost the war, so did Germany, and we stop every fighting.</span> <span id="s99">And, oh, we were so happy, you know.</span> <span id="s100">We thought that we will now survive.</span> <span id="s101">By the evening, the biggest Hungarian Nazi took over the government, and several days later my mother told me we are going to move to another house.</span> <span id="s102">We went to another house with a yellow star, which was very near to where her Christian sister lived.</span> <span id="s103">And her other sister was there too.</span> <span id="s104">I don't remember how many days we were there.</span> <span id="s105">One thing I remember which makes me feel very bad, that I told my mother that I am hungry, and she didn't answer, you know.</span> <span id="s106">No food.</span> <span id="s107">Anyway, one morning around 4 o'clock, a bunch of Nazis with arm bands came to the building and they made their gong, what they used when the the air raids came, you know, and they said, every Jew come downstairs to the courthouse.</span> <span id="s108">We went there, and we had to stand in one line, and they made two groups from that line.</span> <span id="s109">Before I was separated from my mother, she handed me whatever money she had, and she couldn't look at me.</span> <span id="s110">They took her away.</span> <span id="s111">That's the last I ever saw her.</span> <span id="s112">She was with her sister.</span> <span id="s113">About two days later, my Christian uncle came into the building, which was locked, and told me he would try to take me somewhere.</span> <span id="s114">At first, you know, we took a streetcar, and he tried to put me how you call it where the Catholic priests are living?</span> <span id="s115">I I</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: A monastery?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Some kind of a monastery.</span> <span id="s118">And they wouldn't take me.</span> <span id="s119">So he took me back to the building.</span> <span id="s120">The next following day he came again, and he took me to a building which was I would say the Hungarian ring, you know, a main thoroughfare.</span> <span id="s121">It had a Swedish flag.</span> <span id="s122">And he deposited me there.</span> <span id="s123">That's where I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: In the building you were living at before you moved to the Swedish building, who were you living there with?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Whom I was living with?</span> <span id="s126">I was in that house alone till after they took my mother away.</span> <span id="s127">I have to acknowledge that one Christian family fed me one evening.</span> <span id="s128">They knew what happened, and they took me and fed me.</span> <span id="s129">But I was alone for about two, three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I was 12.</span> <span id="s132">12 years old.</span> <span id="s133">This is already '44.</span> <span id="s134">It was about in November.</span> <span id="s135">We could hear the Russian artillery in the evening, they were so near.</span> <span id="s136">So later on I heard that that building had something to do with (?</span> <span id="s137">troulvonneberg?)</span> <span id="s138">, and there was a man standing in front with a Nazi arm band, whom I hated, and later I found out he was Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s139">So after I saw the first Russian, I came out, and I was so weak.</span> <span id="s140">We had no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: How long were you in the Swedish house?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: From November, December, for the maybe the second week of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Can you tell me about living in that house?</span> <span id="s144">Who was there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Children.</span> <span id="s146">There was one person who I think was a rabbi, and I remember he tried to teach some children Judaism.</span> <span id="s147">But they were so hungry that the only thing was in their mind to eat.</span> <span id="s148">And we got a slice of bread every day, and sometimes we got a little beans.</span> <span id="s149">That's all.</span> <span id="s150">So by the time the Russians came in, I was really starved.</span> <span id="s151">And after I saw the first Russian, I went oh, one thing I forgot.</span> <span id="s152">I was very, very hungry, and one day I sneaked out from that building, and I had seen on the wall a warning: Any Jew found on the street outside the ghetto will be killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s153">And I am reading it, and I tried to sneak back to that house to find some food.</span> <span id="s154">And I went back.</span> <span id="s155">And, you know, it was so near to my aunt who was a Christian, you know, and her husband, and I wouldn't go there because I knew that I would bring danger to them.</span> <span id="s156">So I went back to that apartment, and I found one jar of marmalade, which I took.</span> <span id="s157">And I went back to the building, you know.</span> <span id="s158">And on the way back, another kid about my age stops me, looks at me and says, aren't you a Jew?</span> <span id="s159">How can you be on the street?</span> <span id="s160">My I thought my heart will jump out.</span> <span id="s161">I just kept walking without looking back.</span> <span id="s162">Nothing happened, you know, but</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: How old was this other person?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Could have been the same age as me.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: About.</span> <span id="s167">11, 12.</span> <span id="s168">And the at that time there were so many caricatures of Jewish profiles that I guess he just recognized my nose, that I must be Jewish.</span> <span id="s169">And I was lucky he didn't scream too, he is a Jew, because I don't know what you know, they would have killed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Were there a lot of other people on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Not too many, because by that time Russian mortars were coming down, you know, on the city.</span> <span id="s172">But there were people.</span> <span id="s173">There were people.</span> <span id="s174">Not too many.</span> <span id="s175">And you could see bombed out buildings, and you could see into homes, that people didn't go down to the basement and they were dead, you know.</span> <span id="s176">But that happened to everybody that time.</span> <span id="s177">Not only to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Besides the rabbi in the Swedish house, do you remember any specific people?</span> <span id="s179">Did you talk to other people in the Swedish house?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I can't recall by name.</span> <span id="s181">There was, you know, two or three boys that I got, you know, talking to, but I really don't remember their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What did you talk to them about?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: About our parents, our family, about food.</span> <span id="s184">You know that after the war, for years when I saw people eating, I was drooling like I don't know you heard of Pavlov dog, you know?</span> <span id="s185">I just looked at somebody eating, and I was drooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">So after the war, I went back to my aunt, who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: The Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s189">They were not that good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Can you tell me before you tell me about going back to your aunt, can you tell me about actually seeing the Russian troops come and liberate?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s192">Sure.</span> <span id="s193">I not only the Russian troops.</span> <span id="s194">At one day, we were in the basement, and buildings, you know, were connected to each other; so if one collapsed, it can go to the next building.</span> <span id="s195">And a group of Nazi soldiers went through that building, and they were regular soldiers.</span> <span id="s196">And would you believe that one of them gave two or three candies out to Jewish children?</span> <span id="s197">I wasn't lucky to get one, but I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Were these Russian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: These were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: They were Germans.</span> <span id="s202">But you asked me about the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Hold on one moment.</span> <span id="s204">[Tape turned over] This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Charles Barber.</span> <span id="s205">This is tape 1, side B.</span> <span id="s206">You were going to say about seeing the Russian troops for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s208">Sure.</span> <span id="s209">The first wave of Russian troops were not Europeans.</span> <span id="s210">They were, most of them, Asiatic.</span> <span id="s211">It looked like that although they talked about equality, the first wave, which were in the biggest danger, they didn't send the Europeans, you know.</span> <span id="s212">But I loved them, you know.</span> <span id="s213">They they were really stealing, robbing, raping, but at least they didn't discriminate against us, you know.</span> <span id="s214">So they did that to everybody.</span> <span id="s215">But the second wave which came in, they were Europeans.</span> <span id="s216">And when I went over to my aunt, about three of them came into the apartment, and one of them was Jewish, and believe it or not, my Christian aunt could speak a little Yiddish and was talking to the Jewish soldier.</span> <span id="s217">And he said, I don't care what happens, I am here now, I will not stop till I get to Berlin.</span> <span id="s218">You know?</span> <span id="s219">And I remember they set up antiaircraft batteries every corner because then the Germans started to come and bomb.</span> <span id="s220">But as I told you, no matter what they did, as far as I was concerned, they couldn't do anything bad.</span> <span id="s221">I don't know what else can I tell you.</span> <span id="s222">After the war, you know, my aunt first gave me out to the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Your Christian aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s225">I was there for about three months.</span> <span id="s226">They sent me back.</span> <span id="s227">A few months later she sent me to an orphanage which was run by a Zionist organization in another city.</span> <span id="s228">And I remember in that city that I my mother had some cousins living, and would you believe it, I found them?</span> <span id="s229">They just came back from Theresienstadt, and about a month later they took me out from the orphanage, and about two months yeah, they took me out from the orphanage, and then I finished high school there.</span> <span id="s230">And then they decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s231">And I returned to Budapest, and I went to work in a big factory, which was in the news recently because General Motors bought that factory that I worked, Tungsram, and</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So where was it that you were when you were in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: It was called the town of Szeged.</span> <span id="s234">It's famous for paprika.</span> <span id="s235">Yes, that's where I was there maybe a year and a half, and then I went back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s236">And it looked like they thought I had too much more ability than to work in the factory, and they sent me back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Who sent you?</span> <span id="s238">The supervisors of the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: The factory.</span> <span id="s240">And then I went to law school.</span> <span id="s241">And came 1956, the revolution.</span> <span id="s242">I had guns, you know?</span> <span id="s243">We all had guns.</span> <span id="s244">And then a man comes in, an older man, and they said, boys, I think you need some pointers what we should do.</span> <span id="s245">He said, you know that who brought about the communists?</span> <span id="s246">The Jews.</span> <span id="s247">I had a gun in my pocket, and I had the urge, the shooting.</span> <span id="s248">I didn't.</span> <span id="s249">But I decided the first chance I get, I get out from there.</span> <span id="s250">And then I came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: So did this happen while you were in law school or had you finished law school?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I was in law school.</span> <span id="s253">I was in my third year of law school when it happened.</span> <span id="s254">And I never finished that.</span> <span id="s255">Came the revolution, and the I took a train near to the border, and I just walked to Austria.</span> <span id="s256">And I had an uncle, my father's brother, who wanted to be a doctor back in Hungary.</span> <span id="s257">But because they had a law, which is called “numerus clausus,” they would take only a certain amount of Jews.</span> <span id="s258">He couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s259">So he could go to Vienna, but he had to sign that after he becomes a doctor he cannot practice in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">So he couldn't practice in Austria, couldn't practice in Hungary.</span> <span id="s261">He came to America.</span> <span id="s262">So I went to him when I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So was he here for a while before you were here, before you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: He came to out in '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: In 1938, just before the war.</span> <span id="s267">And</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So how did you go about leaving Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Believe it or not, I just walked through the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Into Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And then how did you get from Austria to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: In Austria they already set up the Red Cross, you know, camps for fleeing Hungarians, and they allowed me to send a telegram anywhere in the world, and I sent it to my uncle.</span> <span id="s274">And he told me, come.</span> <span id="s275">And I came out in a it didn't cost me money, you know.</span> <span id="s276">America took in, I think, 20,000 Hungarians, and we came in a World War II not World War II Korean war troop carrier, ship.</span> <span id="s277">And we came to Camp Kilmer, and my uncle picked me up at Camp Kilmer.</span> <span id="s278">And</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: What did you do when you got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: I went to work.</span> <span id="s281">And later on I went back to school, and I became an accountant.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So you decided not to finish law school?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: You see, there are two different type of law systems.</span> <span id="s284">In Europe, they use Napoleonic Code.</span> <span id="s285">In America, they have the British common law.</span> <span id="s286">So I couldn't get no credit for anything.</span> <span id="s287">So I -- it was easier to became [sic] an accountant.</span> <span id="s288">And I was working during the day and went to college at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Where did you work during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I worked at a transportation company, which since went out of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I went to first Queensborough Community College; then I went to Bernard Baruch in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And you studied accounting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Once you graduated from there, where -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I worked at the same company as an accountant.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: At what company?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: It was called ABC Transnational Transport.</span> <span id="s299">We had a terminal out in Washington, D.C., too.</span> <span id="s300">And I worked about 30 years there, the same company.</span> <span id="s301">I the first time I got married was about seven years ago.</span> <span id="s302">I never got married before.</span> <span id="s303">You know, I never quite got over, you know, what happened.</span> <span id="s304">There were some people who could pick up their life, you know, like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s305">It was not the same with me.</span> <span id="s306">As of today, you know, I wake up at night and have nightmares.</span> <span id="s307">So I think I was about -- functioning about sometimes 70 percent, 80 percent, and I still made it, you know?</span> <span id="s308">But I don't think I ever was 100 percent, you know, my adult life.</span> <span id="s309">But I guess even the 70 percent I was able to finish my education and work.</span> <span id="s310">If they kept me for 30 years, I must have done something right.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I knew one of her relatives who got very sick, and I offered to take her radiation treatment, an old lady, and she knew that sometimes I liked to go out to the races.</span> <span id="s313">And my wife just lost about a year ago her first husband.</span> <span id="s314">And she introduced me to her.</span> <span id="s315">And I took her out to the racetrack, you know, and she had a somewhat similar background.</span> <span id="s316">She was born in Vienna, which is not too far from Budapest.</span> <span id="s317">And when the Germans, the Anschluss came, she escaped with her parents to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s318">And that's where she survived.</span> <span id="s319">So we had a lot a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Can I ask you a few questions about back during the war now?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Were you raised in a religious household?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: My parents were not very religious.</span> <span id="s324">My father was somewhat religious.</span> <span id="s325">His family were kosher, but he wasn't.</span> <span id="s326">And my mother wasn't very religious, but, you know, I studied religion in school, and I remember lighting candles Friday night, and I prayed every night when I was a child till age 14.</span> <span id="s327">And when I lost my parents, I lost my faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Were you bar mitzvah'd?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: You know where I was when I was bar mitzvah'd?</span> <span id="s330">I mentioned before -- when I should have had my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s331">I told you that my aunt send to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s332">They gave me out to peasants, and the day I would have had my bar mitzvah I was herding pigs in a field.</span> <span id="s333">How could I have had a bar mitzvah?</span> <span id="s334">Those people didn't even know what it is.</span> <span id="s335">And my aunt certainly didn't care at that point.</span> <span id="s336">And I liked her husband much better, who was Christian.</span> <span id="s337">He was a good man, but unfortunately my aunt wore the pants and not him.</span> <span id="s338">I don't think he would have given me away.</span> <span id="s339">But she did.</span> <span id="s340">I have a feeling that there was a certain rivalry, sibling rivalry, between my mother and her, you know.</span> <span id="s341">But the only thing that my mother didn't go by herself.</span> <span id="s342">She had her youngest sister with her.</span> <span id="s343">And as of today, I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s344">I knew what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s345">I was still at my aunt when someone came to the apartment and my aunt sent me out, and later she told me that this man is a survivor and was there when my father died in northern Hungary northwestern Hungary, and he brought a picture to prove it.</span> <span id="s346">And then my aunt told me that if I go to the Jewish cemetery, they brought back all the remains of the people who died in that camp, and they put up a memorial.</span> <span id="s347">And I went there, and I saw my father's name in the memorial.</span> <span id="s348">And she also claimed that someone saw my mother and her sister the day before Bergen Belsen was liberated.</span> <span id="s349">But she never came home.</span> <span id="s350">But I know that many people died even after the liberation.</span> <span id="s351">So that's my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Have you been back to Europe at all since you left in the '50s?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: One time.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: We went first to Vienna, and we went to see my wife's old building where she used to live.</span> <span id="s356">Then we went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s357">And I went to see the building which I owned one third, you know, and they took away from me.</span> <span id="s358">They can keep it, you know.</span> <span id="s359">Then I went to see my Christian aunt's daughter, who is my first cousin, and when I knocked on the door, she acted like she didn't know me.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Had you known her when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s362">I lived with her for quite a while.</span> <span id="s363">I guess she they expected that when I came to America, the country of gold, I will make them rich.</span> <span id="s364">{Laughs} And she just didn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s365">In fact, her husband said, you don't know them?</span> <span id="s366">And she said, oh, we met before.</span> <span id="s367">So I looked at her.</span> <span id="s368">I said, God bless you.</span> <span id="s369">And I walked away.</span> <span id="s370">So</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did you go to see the -- where -- the site of the Swedish safe house that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: We walked by it, yes.</span> <span id="s373">And I pointed out, my wife, that that's where I survived.</span> <span id="s374">And I showed all the places where I used to live in Budapest, yes.</span> <span id="s375">And we went to the building, and there was a store in the building, a tobacco store, and I went inside and I talked to the present owner, and I told her, the person who owned this store before you wasn't a very nice person.</span> <span id="s376">And I showed, right here she kept a big, big picture of Rommel till he was winning in Africa.</span> <span id="s377">Then when he started to lose, she took it off, the picture {laughs}.</span> <span id="s378">And, you know, I she was a member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s379">And I am not sure if she didn't cause my mother's arrest, you know, because she was a big Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So where else did you go when you were in Europe visiting again?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Really, I don't know anybody.</span> <span id="s382">I had a friend in law school, and I couldn't locate him.</span> <span id="s383">I had his name in the phone book, but when I called up, it was a lawyer's office, and he wasn't working there anymore.</span> <span id="s384">And my wife wanted to leave fast.</span> <span id="s385">So we just went for another week to Lake Balaton.</span> <span id="s386">We just took a week vacation at Lake Balaton, and we came back.</span> <span id="s387">We drove back to the Munich, where we rented the car originally, and came back.</span> <span id="s388">And we both decided after a while that that's all for us for Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Are you glad you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Somehow I am, that before I die, you know, I went back to that building where they took my mother, with a camera to take a picture of that spot.</span> <span id="s391">And somebody walks by, and they says, that's not a tourist place to take a picture.</span> <span id="s392">And I said, but this place means something to me to make a picture, you know?</span> <span id="s393">It was an old building, and somebody sees obviously an American.</span> <span id="s394">To take a picture, it sounded you know?</span> <span id="s395">And oh, and I took my wife to a place.</span> <span id="s396">I said I want to go to a little place where they have excellent cake, because my mother took me there once, you know.</span> <span id="s397">It was still in business, and we went there.</span> <span id="s398">So for this little remembrance, I was glad I went back.</span> <span id="s399">But I wouldn't want to go back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You said that your first cousin was not happy to see you.</span> <span id="s401">Did you get the feeling that there was a lot of anti Semitism still in Budapest and in Hungary in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s403">I have no question about it.</span> <span id="s404">In fact, it came to my mind that she married a man whose name sounded very aristocratic, and I wouldn't be surprised that she didn't want she doesn't -- he doesn't know that she's half Jewish, and, you know, it came to my mind that this is why she didn't want to acknowledge me, that she was afraid that her aristocratic husband will find out that she is half Jewish and will divorce her.</span> <span id="s405">And when I took a cab to the cemetery -- you know, the only cemetery I can go to to my grandparents, and so I went to see my grandparents.</span> <span id="s406">And when I told the cab driver that I want to go to the Jewish cemetery, he looked at me, you know you know what it is having an antenna?</span> <span id="s407">My antenna said that's an anti Semite too, you know.</span> <span id="s408">And one other thing I wanted to tell you, you know, this is with all those things happening to me, that being Jewish, you know, felt like being I don't know what.</span> <span id="s409">Do you know that for a long time, when somebody asked me, are you a Jew, the blood rushed up to my face like I was caught in -- my hand in, you know, the cookie jar, or being a criminal, you know?</span> <span id="s410">It took me a long time, you know, to look somebody in the eye and say, yes, I am.</span> <span id="s411">It took me a long time.</span> <span id="s412">And it's so stupid.</span> <span id="s413">Even the God whom they pray was born a Jew.</span> <span id="s414">And I had to be ashamed, you know.</span> <span id="s415">It's ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Have you ever gone back to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I never been in Israel.</span> <span id="s418">And maybe I will try to talk into my wife.</span> <span id="s419">You know, she she's so much afraid of violence, you know.</span> <span id="s420">She's just the opposite of me.</span> <span id="s421">You know, with me, after what I went through, you know, I am not afraid of anything, you know.</span> <span id="s422">The bombing.</span> <span id="s423">Every moment, you know, you could be killed.</span> <span id="s424">If not by the bombs, but by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s425">But she's afraid, you know.</span> <span id="s426">But I I will try to talk her into it one of these days.</span> <span id="s427">I would like to go there to see Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: How aware of you how aware were you of the creation of Israel around the time -- you were already in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: No?</span> <span id="s431">You were in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s433">What was it?</span> <span id="s434">In '52.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Yeah, in the early '50s.</span> <span id="s436">So -- and you came to the United States in the mid to late '50s.</span> <span id="s437">So how</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: -- how aware were you of what was going on in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Very well.</span> <span id="s441">In fact, I was praying for Israel, and in the beginning the newspapers were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s442">But later on they were very anti Zionist, you know.</span> <span id="s443">But, you know, in the beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">[Recording ends] End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Charles Barber.</span> <span id="s447">This is tape two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: You know, I wanted to believe them because they saved my life.</span> <span id="s449">But anybody who had any intelligence and was reading later on, you know, it was not a very logical ideology, and it didn't work, and it was cruel.</span> <span id="s450">In fact, would you believe that later, you know, in the '50s, I was afraid to go back to the building where we originally were living because I owned one third of it, and they would have called me a capitalist, you know?</span> <span id="s451">So I was actually afraid to go near to that building.</span> <span id="s452">And then they asked what my father was.</span> <span id="s453">I I had to lie.</span> <span id="s454">I said he was employed in a liquor store as a bartender, because if I would have said he owned that liquor store, oh, forget it.</span> <span id="s455">So in order to be able to go to law school, I had to peddle what they wanted me to say, but I really wanted to get out of from there as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s456">And in '56, I could.</span> <span id="s457">I left my education and and came out.</span> <span id="s458">And now I think I even though I cannot forget, but my life is very much normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: You were showing me the picture that you have of your father.</span> <span id="s460">Do you have any pictures of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I do.</span> <span id="s462">And in fact, I mentioned that my mother was take the Gestapo arrested her and put her in a gave her to a Hungarian camp.</span> <span id="s463">I have a letter that she somehow was able to give to somebody and sent it to her sister, and I have that letter in my packet.</span> <span id="s464">It is written in toilet paper.</span> <span id="s465">I I can show it to you.</span> <span id="s466">Oh, you asked me about -- this was my mother and father, when they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: This is their wedding picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: That's their wedding picture.</span> <span id="s469">And look at this letter.</span> <span id="s470">This was sent from that -- Kistarcsa to her sister, and she writes about me, to take care of me.</span> <span id="s471">When I read, I -- it's in Hungarian, you know -- my heart is breaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Do you still speak Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s474">Sure.</span> <span id="s475">I was 23 when I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What does the letter say?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: She's thanking her sister a package, what she was sending to her, and she says that she feels very, very lonely without me and she's the one who gives me the strength to survive, and please take care of him and please take care of my me too.</span> <span id="s478">And sends her kisses to everybody, and again, in the next little piece of paper, again asked them to take care of me -- her sisters.</span> <span id="s479">And in one corner, she writes, please pray for this, her sister the same sister with whom she was taken away.</span> <span id="s480">And they died together.</span> <span id="s481">I don't know what to do with these, you know.</span> <span id="s482">I don't think that they could use these letter.</span> <span id="s483">What's when I die, what will happen to it, you know.</span> <span id="s484">I I would have given it to them, because how long will I live?</span> <span id="s485">Nobody has any use for it.</span> <span id="s486">I even have this is a picture of the sister with whom she was killed -- this is the Christian sister -- and this is her daughter who didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s487">And you remember I mentioned the first casualty?</span> <span id="s488">That was him, my father's youngest brother, with the other brother who came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: The one who helped you when you</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, when I came out.</span> <span id="s491">Yes.</span> <span id="s492">He died about ten years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Well, I'd like to thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Oh, if anybody, 10 years from now or 50 years from now, learn learns something, then
