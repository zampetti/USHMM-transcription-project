only who left Poland in 1933 for Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Tell me the circumstances of all that, will you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A (Adam): Alright.</span> <span id="s39">My brother was always dreaming about Palestine.</span> <span id="s40">He was really a Zionist, you know...very ardent Zionist and being that the British wouldn't give them...he wanted to immigrate to Palestine but the British, you know, government at that time wouldn't give them any entry visas, so they organized...the Warsaw ______...he was commander (ph) of the Warsaw ______...they ordered....organized a trip, a motorcycle trip which they called Tel Aviv...uh Warsaw...I'm sorry...Warsaw, Tel Aviv, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s41">In other words, every one of them supposed to come back, but they all remained in Palestine that time...those days, went underground and they remained until the day when of course Israel was born.</span> <span id="s42">He...the trip took them about three months, so I had one brother.</span> <span id="s43">He died in 1965.</span> <span id="s44">He got a heart attack....supposed to come and visit us and unfortunately had a heart attack, died in Tel Aviv in 1965.</span> <span id="s45">And my parents...the same thing.</span> <span id="s46">We we had a wonderful family and uh quite a large family as far as...including uncles and aunts and cousins and so on.</span> <span id="s47">Unfortunately everyone of them was perished...perished in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s48">My mother especially was kind of a Jewish...we say that our daughter has her character, not even mine and Pela's.</span> <span id="s49">My mother was like a walking angel, walking, and she really had a wonderful character and unfortunately she died during the bombing of Warsaw and this is another story which probably Pela can describe because she died in her arms, and I was that time away because I had to leave Poland, uh Warsaw for the eastern part of Poland to be get, to be mobilized when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Let's, let's hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s51">Uh you two have a have a love story that goes from before the war.</span> <span id="s52">Uh how did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A (Adam): OK.</span> <span id="s54">(Laughter) I was thirteen years old and she was twelve, and I walked down the street because we lived in the same neighborhood, and I walked down the street with a friend of mine and in our schools, in private schools, we used to have not uniforms in our school but these caps, you know, the same, you know, hats and school...each school had different hats and I saw her very often on the street with her briefcase with books and when I was a thirteen years old boy...can you imagine I said to my friend...do you see this blond girl across the street.</span> <span id="s55">He said yes.</span> <span id="s56">I'm going someday to marry her.</span> <span id="s57">(Laughter) That's at the age of thirteen…And then one day she was...I saw her uh on one of the streets in front of a library, and I walk over to her and I said, excuse me, could I keep you company?</span> <span id="s58">She said not now.</span> <span id="s59">I'm waiting for my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s60">She said we have to send some books in the library.</span> <span id="s61">Anyway, to make the story short, we became acquainted and from then on, we used to go out steady and we uh...it seems to me that that's, that's was our destiny (Laughter) and, you know, we just tied (ph) to each other, and Pela and I..</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">and we decided that in 1936 we were married, three years before the war.</span> <span id="s64">This May 31st will be fifty-four years we are together, and we are just like one, and during the war I think we proved to each other that one for the other would be...you know...it's life in order to spare and save the other one.</span> <span id="s65">She would give her life to save me.</span> <span id="s66">I would give my life to save her, and both of us would give our lives to save the child.</span> <span id="s67">And that's the...we were fighting for it very, very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Pela, tell me about the first few years of marriage, in the late '30's and from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A (Pela): We...we had our apartment but I was going to school, so I didn't do any cooking.</span> <span id="s70">We ate with our parents, but in 1938, his mother became very lonely.</span> <span id="s71">She was very lonesome for her son, but she couldn't go to Palestine for a visit because we had...he had a grandfather who had an amputated leg uh many years before and he needed attention.</span> <span id="s72">We had a maid in the house, but she couldn't leave the father...she wouldn't leave the house because his father traveled a lot, so somebody had to stay in the house, live in the house when she was away, so we decided to give up our apartment, put our furniture in storage, and move in with his uh his parents in 1938.</span> <span id="s73">And in 1939 she came back and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s74">So we were all together during the beginning of the war, bombing of Warsaw and all this.</span> <span id="s75">I loved her very much.</span> <span id="s76">I loved her.</span> <span id="s77">She was...my mother sometimes said I think you love uh Mother Starkopf more than me.</span> <span id="s78">I said Mother, no.</span> <span id="s79">You I..</span> <span id="s80">.</span> <span id="s81">you know that I love you.</span> <span id="s82">Her...I just really adored her.</span> <span id="s83">She was just...just...I never met a human being...she...and this comes from a daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s84">When I hear that some people say oh my mother-in-law...that that's not fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Tell me about those first few years that...the first year or so and the bombing?</span> <span id="s86">What happened when the bombs began to fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A (Pela): The war broke out...broke out uh September the 1st.</span> <span id="s88">The bombing in the beginning wasn't as bad.</span> <span id="s89">Uh we...a couple of times he was going to...he was called into to, to dig some ditches but the last couple days after the 6th of September started so that was absolutely no day and no night.</span> <span id="s90">We were in the cellar where we used to keep potatoes or, or uh coal for, for uh heating the stove, and there we...the whole building...everybody was there with their cots and their pillows and blankets so the children who stayed there, because it was absolutely impossible to be in the apartment.</span> <span id="s91">And this was uh time of our holidays...September 16th...and his mother was uh...it, it started very heavy bombing but was around four o'clock and the bombing let off a little bit, so she said let's go upstairs and we will eat something.</span> <span id="s92">So we went upstairs.</span> <span id="s93">She started to prepare a little supper for my hus...my father-in-law, me...Adam was already away...and my parents were with us because their apartment was bombed completely.</span> <span id="s94">They couldn't live there any more, and she was serving that.</span> <span id="s95">She said I don't feel good and my mother was helping.</span> <span id="s96">She said I don't know...Adam...Pela...and that's it and she fainted.</span> <span id="s97">My mother...we couldn't...in that time on the street in Warsaw you couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s98">There was a curfew.</span> <span id="s99">After seven o'clock was no way.</span> <span id="s100">You couldn't be on the street.</span> <span id="s101">When a German would...will see you on the street, you could be shot.</span> <span id="s102">But we had to have a doctor in our building.</span> <span id="s103">Was no doctor, so she went out and two houses away she knew a physician.</span> <span id="s104">She uh run to him and begged him to come and to see what he can help my mother-in-law, and he he didn't want to come.</span> <span id="s105">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s106">She kissed his hands.</span> <span id="s107">She begged him at his knees...please come.</span> <span id="s108">And he came.</span> <span id="s109">And he looked out...was quiet on the street.</span> <span id="s110">Our door, our gate was open uh from our building.</span> <span id="s111">He run in.</span> <span id="s112">He came upstairs.</span> <span id="s113">Her blood pressure was 320.</span> <span id="s114">She was gone.</span> <span id="s115">Nothing could be done.</span> <span id="s116">So she really died with the with the name of her son...what I found out later that some man, young man, who went out the same time Adam went out, on the way the bombing was so bad that some of them came back.</span> <span id="s117">When they came back one of them said that everybody who walked out, who came out, is probably dead, and I think that Adam is dead...dead too.</span> <span id="s118">And she overheard it and that was why I think this was...because she said Adam, and she talked to my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s119">Adam...if Adam...if something happened to Adam, I don't want to live.</span> <span id="s120">And that's what, what happened.</span> <span id="s121">He was _____ away.</span> <span id="s122">He didn't know nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Tell us about...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A (Adam): This was a stroke.</span> <span id="s125">Now, you see, when they announced that all able-bodied, you know, military-aged uh men should uh proceed into their recruiting stations for mobilization, I went several times but the Polish government...it was...the war...you know, Germany at that point, you know....it was a tremendous surprise.</span> <span id="s126">They were not prepared for it.</span> <span id="s127">So they didn't even have enough uniforms and arms for the people for ____, you know, so they couldn't even...they couldn't mobilize anybody.</span> <span id="s128">But later on came on the 6th of September of 1939, the mayor of the city of Warsaw announced at night over the radio that all young people should leave Warsaw and proceed into uh towards the eastern part of Poland where they would be mobilized.</span> <span id="s129">And the city to which we had to go was about hundred and twenty miles away from Warsaw, _____.</span> <span id="s130">You know, just to walk ____, so we, without anything...without any transportation.</span> <span id="s131">We had meetings with our neighbors and uh with other friends in the building and finally we decided that I..</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">that all the young people should go and I together with a few other young men left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s134">My father I remember now took me to his bedroom just to give me a few words of advice and he broke down and sobbed...sobbing and then I left.</span> <span id="s135">She, Pela, and my mother, in her house...in their house _____ robes...it was five o'clock in the morning...walked with me towards the bridge over the _____ River.</span> <span id="s136">This was a suburb in Prague...a suburb of Warsaw where we parted.</span> <span id="s137">At that time uh they left...Pela...I..</span> <span id="s138">.</span> <span id="s139">Pela was sobbing.</span> <span id="s140">Pela was crying.</span> <span id="s141">My mother forced herself not to cry and even gave me a smile, and I looked back at them.</span> <span id="s142">My mother was very, you know, slowly leading Pela away and I was running away from them and this was the last time I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s143">Anyway, then I, together with another group...some of them came back because there was constant bombing as we walked, you know, towards that particular city.</span> <span id="s144">I was wounded.</span> <span id="s145">I was operated in the meantime, you know...but to make the story very short, that on the 16th of September I was in one of the border cities in eastern Poland, and over there was very quiet.</span> <span id="s146">We didn't hear any German planes.</span> <span id="s147">In fact people don't seem like they would know that the war was going on, and uh we were all...you can imagine after hundred and twenty miles of uh walking, we were all...my, my shoes my shoes were torn, my clothes and I was filthy and dirty and somebody put us up in a barn overnight to sleep and in the morning at five o'clock we heard some sound of tanks.</span> <span id="s148">We ran out in front of the barn and those were Russian tanks that were rolling into that particular town.</span> <span id="s149">We just that time found out that Germany and Soviet Russia signed a non-aggression pact and they divided Poland.</span> <span id="s150">There were at that time as allies, both of Russia and Po...and Germany and they divided Poland.</span> <span id="s151">The Ger...Germany occupied the western part of Poland, Soviet Russia the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s152">So I found myself in the eastern part of Poland under Russian occupation and my dream then was only one dream...to go back to Warsaw, go back to my family to be with them.</span> <span id="s153">And I smuggle...I wrote about the ____ in book that I told you about, but I somehow smuggled myself through toward...I met a peasant, a Polish peasant.</span> <span id="s154">I gave him my wristwatch that I still had with me and he smuggled me through in a rowboat to the, the river that was dividing the, the, the, you know, the Russian zone and German zone, and I went back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s155">I came back and that time I found out about the death of my mother.</span> <span id="s156">And uh then, of course, in 19...we, we somehow...the, the war was still on.</span> <span id="s157">Warsaw was already...on the western front...Warsaw already was surrounded...was under German occupation and in 1940 in October they began to uh work on the Warsaw ghetto, build the walls...about between eight and ten foot walls with barbed wires on top of the walls in Warsaw...broken glass, uh pieces of glass cemented on top of the brick walls.</span> <span id="s158">And during...in, in ghetto of course, to describe it it's a long story about it...if you want me to...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How...what was it like inside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s160">How did you, the two of you, get into the ghetto and what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A (Adam): We, we happened...we were lucky that our apartment was still in the in the section of Warsaw that the...that was in the ghetto because they extended the, the...when they take over the neighborhood for Jewish, you know, mixed neighborhoods and then they brought in people from different streets, different areas, and even different, different cities into the Warsaw ghetto which they built.</span> <span id="s162">The Warsaw ghetto approximately they estimate was built into on an area of about one...one thou...I think uh one thousand, you know...that's not important to you the size.</span> <span id="s163">The fact is that we had gates which were uh guarded by the Gestapo with Polish police, you know, assisting them.</span> <span id="s164">We found ourself in our apartment, which was as I told you, in Warsaw ghetto and we were living from selling our own possession to some people because, you know, there were no way...we couldn't support ourselves, so whatever those of us...there's a black market.</span> <span id="s165">There were some people operating, were buying certain things and selling on the other side of the ghetto, and I myself being that I looked very Ary...typically Aryan...I was blond and slim and when I was young...and I..</span> <span id="s166">.</span> <span id="s167">we had an ordinance incidentally in the Warsaw ghetto that everyone of us had to wear white armbands with a blue Star of David.</span> <span id="s168">What I was doing, I was getting out of the Warsaw ghetto though some special places in the wall that we had all to walk through the cemetery which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s169">I would smuggle out myself and I took, used to take off the uh white, the armband, and as a Po...as Pole, I had some connections on the other side.</span> <span id="s170">I used to get a little bit of butter, a little bit of, you know, milk...I used to smuggle in into uh back into Warsaw into the Warsaw ghetto to help the family and then in 1941, in 1941, January 14th, our child was born.</span> <span id="s171">Our daughter was born.</span> <span id="s172">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Tell me __________.</span> <span id="s174">Tell us tell us the story leading up to the birth of that child, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A (Pela): Now I..</span> <span id="s176">.</span> <span id="s177">when I became ill, the doctor told that I..</span> <span id="s178">.</span> <span id="s179">I thought that I..</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">I was running fever, something is wrong with me.</span> <span id="s182">He tells me to go take an x-ray and asked me to ______.</span> <span id="s183">I don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s184">I cannot have any children.</span> <span id="s185">I was told that I cannot have any children, but when I went to the doctor she surprised me and she tells me I'm pregnant.</span> <span id="s186">Of course, I..</span> <span id="s187">.</span> <span id="s188">I was bewildered and I thought that maybe to do away with this child, but my mother was with me and she said, don't darling do to it.</span> <span id="s189">Every human life has their destiny and you never know.</span> <span id="s190">Please don't.</span> <span id="s191">I listened to her, and the child was born in terrible conditions because I didn't enough money to have a doctor so a midwife delivered the baby.</span> <span id="s192">The next day she had to sew me up.</span> <span id="s193">It was in terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s194">But we were very happy.</span> <span id="s195">It was a beautiful little girl, healthy little girl.</span> <span id="s196">One day my father uh was supposed to come around ten o'clock.</span> <span id="s197">He didn't come.</span> <span id="s198">You know, maybe an hour and a half later, holding his hand with handkerchief near his mouth.</span> <span id="s199">I said, Daddy, what's happened?</span> <span id="s200">He went to the dentist.</span> <span id="s201">He had a couple gold teeth, so he let him pull his gold teeth and to sell it to buy milk for the baby.</span> <span id="s202">Where my daughter was born uh you know, we put her in a pillowcase and we had a we had a belt and we crossed it that way it was.</span> <span id="s203">But the child was growing.</span> <span id="s204">She was a very healthy little girl.</span> <span id="s205">We were selling our…what we had, our belongings, our, our...what, what was left yet, and uh when he was arrested, my daughter was that time almost a year old.</span> <span id="s206">When he went out and tried to get a little more, you know food for us and we waited for him.</span> <span id="s207">He didn't come, and we were sure that he was killed, that something happened.</span> <span id="s208">We were all, all crying and it was around eleven o'clock at night...we heard we heard steps.</span> <span id="s209">We were living on the tenth floor.</span> <span id="s210">We had steps and I recognized his steps.</span> <span id="s211">I told my grand...my father-n-law, Dad, look...there is...Adam is coming.</span> <span id="s212">We opened the door.</span> <span id="s213">He came in and behind him was a policeman and he will tell you the story how...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Answer (Adam): Now, you see, again on one of my trips when I was going over, you know, on the other side of Warsaw ghetto...I was caught without my...without the armband near the wall, near the wall by a Gestapo, by SS man.</span> <span id="s215">They arrested me, of course, and took me to the headquarters of the Gestapo in Warsaw which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto, in the Polish sectioned area...in the Polish section.</span> <span id="s216">And uh they were very rude and uh, of course, after interrogation they took me to a room which was about eight by eight and the walls were full of fresh blood, red walls, and then they have uh wooden benches on the floor and into on top was broken pieces of glass cemented into these benches and they, they used to force you to undress and beat you to death on those pieces of broken glass.</span> <span id="s217">He said to me, you're going to undress and lay down on this.</span> <span id="s218">I said oh no.</span> <span id="s219">I knew...why should I..</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">I have no chance...you know I didn't have any chance.</span> <span id="s222">I had no ar...no guns.</span> <span id="s223">I couldn't help myself, but I said no, I will not undress.</span> <span id="s224">If you want you try.</span> <span id="s225">I felt that if he would try to undress me, I would start, you know, hit him and then he will just kill me at once and that's it, but uh I didn't and he said to me, OK.</span> <span id="s226">We just wanted to scare you.</span> <span id="s227">Tomorrow we finish you.</span> <span id="s228">They took me to the...again to another man, to Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s229">Finally they decided that they are taking me to the Polish police.</span> <span id="s230">The Polish police station was in ghetto, and that's how, you know, when they were...the, the gen..</span> <span id="s231">.</span> <span id="s232">the Gestapo man that was taking me to get into ghetto to the Pol...Polish police station, he was more...he seemed to me like a human being, you know, normal human being.</span> <span id="s233">And he said I know what you are thinking of, he said to me.</span> <span id="s234">You would like to escape now.</span> <span id="s235">And I would let you but if I will let you, I will be in jail and my family will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s236">He said I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s237">So he took me to the police station and that time I asked the policeman that he should do me a favor before he leads me to the prison in ghetto.</span> <span id="s238">He should stop to see my family, and that's what Pela told you that I stopped and from there, so he let me kiss my Pela, let kiss the, the baby and my father and we went and they took me to uh prison, uh military prison in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">In those days, of course, in prison there were no criminals.</span> <span id="s240">Anyone that was a Jew...doctors, professors, and uh professional people, business people, you know...anyone that was a Jew was in prison at that time, and I was in prison about eight, eight weeks that time and thanks to Pela's intervention, they released me because Pela made...she met through some one and told this policeman that one of the policemen from the station gave her a name of a police officer who was of German descent, so called ____ deutcsh (ph) that she could, you know, somehow get me out.</span> <span id="s241">And we had a very beautiful bedroom set that was stored by some people uh you know, away like Polish people, and Pela made a deal with him and she gave him the bedroom set and he got me out from jail.</span> <span id="s242">But it didn't last too long because they realized that he just, you know, uh put the...what he did actually he took the papers, you know, with my name and put them somewhere else in a different place I think underneath files or in a file and they finally...you know, they came to it and noticed that I am that I was missing.</span> <span id="s243">They came at night and took me away again.</span> <span id="s244">They took me away and this was already the second time when I was in prison and again it's a very long story to tell about the interrogations, what they're doing, were doing in the prisons, but I can tell you only that it was terrible.</span> <span id="s245">They were, for example, in some of the cells they were opening at five o'clock in the morning the door and the German uh SS men with the trained German Shepherds would point at you, for example, or at this man and on a certain word, Juda (ph), which means Jew in German, he would jump at you and tore you apart, the German Shepherd.</span> <span id="s246">And they were just going from every second cell, not every one cell.</span> <span id="s247">In our cell was twenty-six people.</span> <span id="s248">Four of them were destroyed this way.</span> <span id="s249">It's a miracle I survived.</span> <span id="s250">They didn't...and when they taking out four people to kill, then they supplement another four they brought in, so there's always twenty-six men in a cell, and then, of course, I learned over there about the liquida...about the beginning and the _____ I found out what they decided, you know that they liquidate the, the, the Jewish people and about the liquidation of Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A (Adam): The work...I found out through some...in, in...you know...they, they came to us, to some people in the prison, that Warsaw ghetto is going to be liquidated and the beginning was...of the liquidation would be July 22nd, 1942.</span> <span id="s253">And how the Germans...you know, they always do everything with tremendous precision, so how how could they liquidate the easiest way.</span> <span id="s254">They surrounded first...in the beginning of July, they surrounded the orphanages, old age homes, hospitals, and prisons, because this was the the best, the easiest access to get the people for the unschlagplatz (ph) which the railroad tracks where they were prepared the cattle cars for Treblinka, so let's say they surrounded the pri...the hospitals.</span> <span id="s255">From the hospital anyone that was in relatively in good health was taken to the...was taken to Treblinka concentration camp or as I call it destruction camp.</span> <span id="s256">Anyone in in, you know, that was either weak or, or old, they were taken to the Jewish cemetery and at the edge of the mass grave, were executed then.</span> <span id="s257">The same thing was in orphanages.</span> <span id="s258">They took all the children to the Jewish cemetery and front of the mass grave and executed them.</span> <span id="s259">People in less than good health and older people, everybody to the Jewish cemetery and that's where they executed them.</span> <span id="s260">I somehow knew one thing only.</span> <span id="s261">I was dreaming all the time when I was in prison that something I had to do...something has to be done to save my family and during...when they surrounded the prison and tremendous chaos was created at that time.</span> <span id="s262">There were trucks, you know.</span> <span id="s263">So many trucks and so many people.</span> <span id="s264">The gates were opened.</span> <span id="s265">They were taking hundreds and hundreds of prisoners into Treblinka.</span> <span id="s266">I was able to escape with a few other men.</span> <span id="s267">Escape through the gate, and I came home, ran home.</span> <span id="s268">Of course, you can imagine how Pela and my father and my in-laws were surprised and shocked when they saw me, and I came and I went out...I already had this in advance in mind, to work out a plan how to save our child.</span> <span id="s269">This was our main object, how to save the child and being that the Jewish cemetery was outside of the Warsaw ghetto, we worked out a plan together with Pela that we would put the child to sleep with that friend of ours who put her to sleep, gave her an injection, and we arrange a funeral for this child in order to get her out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s270">In the meantime, through some underground connections that I had, I worked out false documents for us, and that under assumed names, like my name was Adam Bludosky (ph) instead of Starkoph.</span> <span id="s271">Pela was ____ Bludosky and Joanne was Yasha Bludosky and worked out there was, you know, the forged papers and we uh on this funeral, men were not allowed to follow it.</span> <span id="s272">Pela would follow this, this funeral.</span> <span id="s273">In fact when the German book which I showed to you before, you know, showed the picture of the entrance to the funeral and the casket in which she was carried out, and the register shows Pela...when Pela will take over, and she will tell you, she...how she came out with the child through the cemetery and then in the evening how I met them.</span> <span id="s274">Pela, I think maybe you...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Answer (Pela): Adam didn't mention that when he came from jail, from this prison when he escaped, he didn't sleep home anymore because he was afraid that maybe they would catch him, so he slept by, by neighbors, by friends and uh got in touch with these friends of ours who were on the other side and got the false papers.</span> <span id="s276">My family was very bewildered.</span> <span id="s277">My mother and father couldn't believe that we are going to take this child...we didn't have to watch...what are you going to do.</span> <span id="s278">This is insane.</span> <span id="s279">But I said Mother, I have to...I have to do it.</span> <span id="s280">We'll come to, to take you someday back.</span> <span id="s281">We also find a place for you, but I have to save the child.</span> <span id="s282">Being in ghetto, remaining in ghetto, Yasha will be murdered, so I have to take a chance.</span> <span id="s283">We'll not go over that all three of us, but I have to take a chance, so when the uh everything was arranged to pick her up, uh one, one thirty, because we knew that we have to be at the at the cemetery gate a quarter to two.</span> <span id="s284">Every two hours another SS man had a post near the gate.</span> <span id="s285">We gave some money to a Polish policeman whom I knew, and he gave something to the German to let me go through and see my child buried and he said OK, but she will right away come back.</span> <span id="s286">He said of course she will right away come back.</span> <span id="s287">So at a quarter of two I went through the gate.</span> <span id="s288">But he stopped me.</span> <span id="s289">He said let me see what is that and he wanted to take his hand open the white ____ what I had over there covered my daughter.</span> <span id="s290">I said she died of typhoid.</span> <span id="s291">When he heard those words he turned away.</span> <span id="s292">He said alright, but you are going to be fifteen minutes back.</span> <span id="s293">I said of course I will be.</span> <span id="s294">But I knew that in fifteen minutes he is getting off his post and somebody else...he would not tell anybody else that he let in somebody to the cemetery and I..</span> <span id="s295">.</span> <span id="s296">when the, the when they came the hearse came to the cemetery, the workers wanted to pick up the baby and throw her in the mass grave.</span> <span id="s297">I started to scream.</span> <span id="s298">I said don't touch her.</span> <span id="s299">She's alive.</span> <span id="s300">They couldn't believe...their eyes were open...their mouth open.</span> <span id="s301">And I took her out.</span> <span id="s302">I had with me under my arm I had a bottle with milk and I took her to the place where they used to wash the bodies before the war.</span> <span id="s303">In there I kept her.</span> <span id="s304">She was a little bit yet sleepy and a little bit...she woke up a little bit so I gave her the bottle, but she was very, very quiet and this was July 21st, 1942.</span> <span id="s305">And uh around eight thirty, nine o'clock was dark...started to be dark and I met up with Adam that through a hole in the wall in the Warsaw ghetto there they took some uh the uh bricks away and he would come, and he came.</span> <span id="s306">It was around nine o'clock, knew where I was waiting, and he uh met up with somebody next to the Jewish cemetery, were two cemeteries.</span> <span id="s307">One was a Catholic cemetery and one was a potter's (ph) cemetery what was almost not in use, but there was a caretaker and he was working with the with the Jewish boys, sometimes let through a little smuggle and he was he was...if you paid him off a little bit he was very cooperative with us, and without the smuggling into the Warsaw ghetto, people would die like flies because that what the German gave us was not enough.</span> <span id="s308">People had to live on the rations, you will found them were on the street in the morning with swollen stomachs and swollen eyes...it was, was not enough, so when he, Adam took a a big stone and knocked at the wall to the potter's cemetery and the man came...with with another stone that he heard us and he put down on our side a step ladder and I with the baby and Adam went on the step ladder, went on the other side and later he took the step ladder away and we were...we went out from his apartment and _______________.</span> <span id="s309">We took our armbands, we throw away our armbands.</span> <span id="s310">We were as a Polish family.</span> <span id="s311">It was arranged for us to sleep the first night not far from the rail station in ______ and we...there was used to live a..</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">uh this apartment belonged to the underground, but the man who owned the apartment for that night wasn't sleeping in the house.</span> <span id="s314">He let us have it, but he didn't know that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s315">He thought we were the underground, and in the same building was the railroad Gestapo was in the first couple floors was the railroad Gestapo, so we felt very safe when we went upstairs.</span> <span id="s316">The next day we had to stay very quiet.</span> <span id="s317">She prepared...the lady of the house left some food for us, and when it got a little dark around eight o'clock our plane was leaving to the city of ______, around eighty miles from Chicago, and there, there was arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Eighty miles from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A (Pela): From ...(Laughter)...from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: And you were on a plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A (Pela): Yes, a plane.</span> <span id="s322">We took a plane.</span> <span id="s323">We went a train.</span> <span id="s324">We took a train eighty miles from Chicago.</span> <span id="s325">There the Jews lived here completely in peace.</span> <span id="s326">The German who was in uh in charge of this town was somehow a very nice person and he was taking...the Jews were buying nice gifts and he told them you, you can stay in your homes.</span> <span id="s327">When I will get an order that we have to bring you in, I give you enough time to escape.</span> <span id="s328">So from there Adam will tell you what...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Answer (Adam): There were exceptions, you know.</span> <span id="s330">But I like to get back Warsaw to mention to you what we had to go through even in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s331">Now when we decided to pre...you know, to get...we had the plan to..._________...when we, if when we how to plan to escape from ghetto, I was running very often after I escape already from Warsaw from prison fever, and one of our friends, a physician in Warsaw ghetto, uh diagnosed that I have inflamed tonsils.</span> <span id="s332">He said if you don't get rid of these tonsils, you you you'll not be able to get out of ghetto because you'll be sick all the time.</span> <span id="s333">Where will you go then?</span> <span id="s334">He said we have to remove your tonsils, but he had no anesthetic.</span> <span id="s335">He had nothing.</span> <span id="s336">He hardly had even the right tools, so he decided to cut out the tonsils alive in my father's apartment in ghetto.</span> <span id="s337">I was sitting in the chair.</span> <span id="s338">My father was holding my hands in the back.</span> <span id="s339">Pela with the baby ran downstairs in the, into the courtyard because she couldn't look at it.</span> <span id="s340">She couldn't watch it, and he was cutting alive my tonsils, you know.</span> <span id="s341">Can you believe it?</span> <span id="s342">And and uh I I took anyway and it helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s343">Now as Pela mentioned, from that little town, you see, we went to a place where I prepared in advance.</span> <span id="s344">I settled down Pela and the baby and I went back to Warsaw ghetto, the same way…through the cemetery.</span> <span id="s345">Not to a funeral but through the cemetery.</span> <span id="s346">I again smuggled myself into the ghetto to get my...our parents, my father and her parents.</span> <span id="s347">What we wanted to do...we picked out a bunker for them.</span> <span id="s348">You see, we could be uh we could be, you know, visible because we looked typically Poles and Pela and I so we could be, you know, really on the outside, but they had to be in the bunker because the especially everybody the, the Polish people would recognize my father and my in-laws that they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s349">So we prepared a special bunker for them, and when I came unfortunately when I was already on the cemetery, on my way back...it was only three days later...I uh some of the people told me don't, don't try even to get in because you you'll be in spot because the ghetto is already on fire.</span> <span id="s350">They are...they are burning some of the buildings.</span> <span id="s351">I took on...I put on some clothes on the cemetery...you know, one of the...see on the Jewish cemeteries in Poland were only working Jewish grave diggers.</span> <span id="s352">That's why we could trust them.</span> <span id="s353">Here is different.</span> <span id="s354">Over there only Jewish grave diggers, so one of them gave me his clothes.</span> <span id="s355">I put away mine and I put on his and together with him on a wag...you know, on a special wagon that they were picking up the dead, dead bodies, I went into the ghetto and when I came to our building, it was on fire and our parents were taken away already to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s356">I came just about a day too late.</span> <span id="s357">So our both parents and my father was already taken away.</span> <span id="s358">Of course, you can imagine how I could break this kind of news to Pela and it was very difficult but she said again we had now from then on the three of uh the two of us had only one aim and one purpose...to save the child.</span> <span id="s359">And we did everything in our in our, you know, power to save her.</span> <span id="s360">We lived as Polish people, as Roman Catholics.</span> <span id="s361">Pela used to go every Sunday to church and she learned how to pray and how to act and uh then in the meantime of course our daughter developed from those wonderful things that she had around and the food she had, she developed tuberculosis and uh Pela took her to the hospital in Warsaw because uh men were afraid to, to travel.</span> <span id="s362">I was in the lumber...I was working, incidentally, in the lumber yard as a laborer, and she took her to the hospital and now would you like to take....</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Answer (Pela): ...came to...I heard of a of a doctor ____ even before the war Doctor ____, so I came to him with the baby and I, I told him she's running such a fever.</span> <span id="s364">He examined her.</span> <span id="s365">He said she has tuberculosis and we have to have to hospitalize her.</span> <span id="s366">I said but I have no money.</span> <span id="s367">My husband is a Polish...said who's in hiding.</span> <span id="s368">We have no money.</span> <span id="s369">He said don't worry.</span> <span id="s370">I will take care of it.</span> <span id="s371">And he took the child but later he told me that to, to be able to save the child, I need gold injections.</span> <span id="s372">He said we Poles don't have...we cannot get it.</span> <span id="s373">You can get only in the German uh...but the German can get it or the Italians.</span> <span id="s374">I had a very close friend, _____ ______.</span> <span id="s375">He was a Greek who was a very close friend of ours and I went to him and I told him about Yasha.</span> <span id="s376">He said don't worry.</span> <span id="s377">I have some friends in the Italian Embassy and I will see what...if you can get the prescription, I will see what I can do.</span> <span id="s378">And he gave me five milligrams of gold injections for five injections, and I brought it to the hospital.</span> <span id="s379">He was...Doctor could not believe it.</span> <span id="s380">He said I don't know if we need all three of them...maybe three of them...all five of them...maybe three will be enough.</span> <span id="s381">I said no Doctor.</span> <span id="s382">Take all five of them.</span> <span id="s383">If you save my daughter, use it for another child, but she also needed good food and nourishment, so the maid of the friend, _____ _____, every day came to the hospital with cooked some soup for her.</span> <span id="s384">Even she had orange, apple and she ___ too, you know, ____.</span> <span id="s385">You see there are good people.</span> <span id="s386">There are still some good people in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Answer (Adam) This particular friend of ours is Greek, uh was arrested several times by the Gestapo for helping Jews.</span> <span id="s388">He was a wonderful person, a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s389">An elderly man...was much older than we, was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s390">Anyway, then later on...so we leave...I worked on...you know, in the lumber yard as a laborer first, later in the office and we struggled a lot.</span> <span id="s391">We had to hide a lot because, you know, there were...we always were afraid somebody...it, it was...let's put it this way if I think I mentioned to you...very often we envied the people that were in concentration camps because we felt that at least they are thousands and hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s392">They know, they have sinned (ph).</span> <span id="s393">They know they are going to be killed, murdered, but they are together.</span> <span id="s394">We feel ___.</span> <span id="s395">We are all alone.</span> <span id="s396">We are still young people in their twenties, uh two of us in their twenties and with a baby, and uh nobody to talk to and we were afraid because, you see, mentally, mentally it was a tremendous ordeal.</span> <span id="s397">Mentally, for us.</span> <span id="s398">But the main thing was to save the child and with the...and then luckily, ironically, Pela had to have emergency operation.</span> <span id="s399">She became ill.</span> <span id="s400">And I took her to a Catholic hospital in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s401">She was there six weeks.</span> <span id="s402">I gave the child, in the meantime, into a sanatorium where they were run by nuns and not far from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s403">She was there.</span> <span id="s404">It's like an orphanage, sanatorium, an orphanage, and children were there.</span> <span id="s405">I told them that I am a _____.</span> <span id="s406">I am ____.</span> <span id="s407">I can't take the child with me, and the child was deaf (ph).</span> <span id="s408">It wasn't easy to leave the child.</span> <span id="s409">You can imagine how she was crying when we were leaving her, but anyway I left her there and I traveled for six weeks, back and forth from that particular town where there was the lumber yard...I didn't work there in the lumber yard already...I was afraid to be caught and what would she do in the hospital and the child in sanatorium.</span> <span id="s410">So I was living on the trains for eight weeks...six weeks it was, right.</span> <span id="s411">Six weeks you were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s412">On the train...I shaved on the in the railroad stations and I living and sleeping on the train, back and forth every day seeing her in the hospital, and uh then finally when she was released from the hospital I got another job on the railroad tracks with through somebody that I met, and in August of 1944 we were liberated by the Russian army in a town...because already at that time as you know, Russia and Germany were in at war, so liberated by the Russian army, and then uh in 1946...in 1945,'45 we escaped from Poland into the German zo...into the American zone in Germany in a Russian ambulance.</span> <span id="s413">In a Russian ambulance we escaped from Poland, and rode through the border Czecho...into Czechoslovakia, later to Germany and then in...we were in the DP camp in Feldafing where I worked also for a while in the at the with the Joint Distribution Committee and UNRA and a friend of ours, a friend...she befriended us.</span> <span id="s414">She was my superior uh you know, she was actually the manager of the office where I was working.</span> <span id="s415">And she made an affidavit for us and she came to us one day and said would you like to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s416">This was Thursday.</span> <span id="s417">If you want to leave, you can leave Sunday.</span> <span id="s418">We had not much packing to do, you know (laughter), so we decided to uh leave and that's how this was...this was May, this was a long story....</span> <span id="s419">And happened for a couple weeks that in 1946 on May 23rd or 24th or 23rd, we arrived in United States, and I can only end with that you know, when we arrived, when we came here, this was the second transport ship.</span> <span id="s420">It was a Navy transport ship.</span> <span id="s421">We came as refugees on a Navy transport ship with three dollars in our pocket, and at night when we arrived, we were waiting for the customs to clear to clear us, and there were all kinds of sounds and sirens and the, the baby was scared.</span> <span id="s422">She was holding hands because scared and she said Mom, Daddy, are they killing people here?</span> <span id="s423">Are we safe here?</span> <span id="s424">And Pela took her around...darling, don't worry.</span> <span id="s425">You are in safety.</span> <span id="s426">You are in a free country, and then she turned to me and said Adam, I just can't believe it.</span> <span id="s427">We are alive and we're in the United States.</span> <span id="s428">Isn't this a miracle, and I turned to them.</span> <span id="s429">They were both crying and Pela was crying and I turned to them, embraced them and I said look, Pela very often wanted already to give up, you know, and I said didn't I tell you always never give up...there is always time to die.</span> <span id="s430">That's what gave me the idea to for the title of my book, that it's called...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Answer (Pela): Can I add something...that on this lumber yard where my husband worked, there were two more families.</span> <span id="s432">One was a family Leiberbaur (ph), who was like a manager, the right arm of this German ____ who was in charge of this lumber yard, and another was a young boy, maybe nineteen years old, who was managing the outside.</span> <span id="s433">He was like an outside...and Adam said to me, you know, there is something about this boy uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Answer (Adam): I always said...his name was Wally (ph)...you know, Wallish in Polish, and I always said he's so dedicate, he's so nice.</span> <span id="s435">He never...because I was older...he never...if I wanted to pick up a piece of lumber, he would say Mr. Bludosky, let me help you.</span> <span id="s436">I said there is something about this boy.</span> <span id="s437">He is not the regular Polish boy.</span> <span id="s438">There is something about him that he is...and one day I decided to try him out.</span> <span id="s439">I said Wallish, how about this Sunday you go with me to church, and the church was about three kilometers away from the lumber yard where we worked and where we lived on, and you had to walk to the highway and and on both sides of the highway there were forests.</span> <span id="s440">So I..</span> <span id="s441">.</span> <span id="s442">he said OK, let's go.</span> <span id="s443">So we were walking down the highway and I said to him, Wallish, what would you do if some Jewish people that are hiding in the forest would jump, would attack us now.</span> <span id="s444">He said Mr. Bludosky, he said, called me Mr. Bludosky.</span> <span id="s445">They wouldn't, they, they have...they lie away...they live there...people leave them alone.</span> <span id="s446">They wouldn't hurt

Jesus...Jesus like a figure and which looked like a little church or a house.</span> <span id="s473">She had a little boy by the name ____.</span> <span id="s474">He was maybe a year and a half, two years older than my Yasha, and they became very friendly.</span> <span id="s475">And uh one day they came to us and they said that they had to talk to us.</span> <span id="s476">What happened?</span> <span id="s477">Somebody sent them a letter and said, Mr. Liberbauer, where you come from, ____...he came from ______.</span> <span id="s478">In this place where you used to work came Gestapo and asked for you, and if even if you are converted, you better run away, because they are after you.</span> <span id="s479">He came to us and said what to do.</span> <span id="s480">So we said go.</span> <span id="s481">____ that night and take the train to Warsaw and from there he went, they went to a little like a resort place, _____.</span> <span id="s482">Be there for a while and if you want to send any messages, sent to Mr. _____.</span> <span id="s483">I see him a couple of times a week.</span> <span id="s484">You can say go to Warsaw, and I will let you know if everybody...if somebody came to ask for you or just a hoax.</span> <span id="s485">So came a couple of weeks, three or four weeks came by and he was writing little notes to Mr. _____ saying I cannot stay any longer.</span> <span id="s486">People start to look at me.</span> <span id="s487">Maybe this was a hoax.</span> <span id="s488">Maybe I should come home.</span> <span id="s489">Adam wrote to him, please, wait yet I am not sure yet, but he didn't listen to us and he came back.</span> <span id="s490">One afternoon Adam was in the office and he will tell how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A (Adam): When this, this Liberbaur was Jewish but converted because he married a Catholic uh woman and when they discovered that he's Jewish...you know, of Jewish origin and I was at that time already they promoted me from...you know, I was a laborer and then I work in the office a little bit, and I was in the office in the morning and Liberbauer was there and all of a sudden the door opens and the Gestapo walks in.</span> <span id="s492">They point at ...who is Liberbauer.</span> <span id="s493">He says I am Liberbauer.</span> <span id="s494">They took him away and took him out and uh to make the story short, they killed him.</span> <span id="s495">In the meantime his wife run away with the baby, so as you can see, two of them, this little boy from...this young boy from Lodz and he was killed by the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Answer (Pela): Why why it was so dangerous for us to remain in this lumber yard, because we were the only strangers from this town, who were not born in this town and people started to talk and one night we were sitting...we were home and one of our workers from the lumber yard, with a bottle of whiskey...he said, Mr. Bludosky, I had to drink...or I have to take a good drink before I have the guts to come to you and to ask you...look, there is enough bloodshed on this lumber yard.</span> <span id="s497">If you have anything to hide, please, leave the lumber yard.</span> <span id="s498">Enough, please.</span> <span id="s499">So Adam looked at me and I crossed myself.</span> <span id="s500">I said you see Adam, that's what you're you have for being a good Pole.</span> <span id="s501">I left my family.</span> <span id="s502">I left everything...everybody, because you were afraid because you want to work for the underground and now your own people for whom you are working so hard are calling you to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s503">And now this is this is the thanks you have.</span> <span id="s504">So he looked at us.</span> <span id="s505">He said, oh Mr. Bludosky, no.</span> <span id="s506">Oh I am...oh we should have more men like you.</span> <span id="s507">I am so glad and because I had no other choice.</span> <span id="s508">I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s509">Joanne...my Yasha was after...she after tuberculosis I couldn't take her to the woods, so I pray for ___ and that's _____ but one one day, maybe a couple of months later, Adam was called to the office.</span> <span id="s510">Adam was called to the office.....</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: We need to stop the tape...we'll change tapes and then we'll go on...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">END OF TAPE 1 A (Pela): ...see there is a way.</span> <span id="s513">Adam had, he told you that for a while he had to live on the train because one afternoon the German who was in charge of the, of the lumber yard called in Adam.</span> <span id="s514">He was a little high.</span> <span id="s515">He was a little drunk.</span> <span id="s516">He said, Mr. Bludosky, what I hear...such an _____.</span> <span id="s517">They say that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s518">If somebody else will come and say it, I'm going to give it to them.</span> <span id="s519">Adam, Adam was bewildered but somehow composed himself.</span> <span id="s520">He said I'm not Jewish, Mr. ____.</span> <span id="s521">I'm not Jewish.</span> <span id="s522">But since then he felt that it was very dangerous for us to remain there.</span> <span id="s523">This is why when I was still in the hospital, he was...tried not to be too much home, but after the hospital...uh during the ho...really, I didn't have to stay five weeks, but I really didn't have no place to go.</span> <span id="s524">So I think that Professor _____, the one who operated on me maybe during the operation and maybe because I later found out that he was a very good Pole, that because he saved in his own house, he saved a Professor ___ who was his assistant.</span> <span id="s525">He saved him in his own house, so I don't know...maybe he he probably knew that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s526">But one day, was maybe the fourth week...his assistant came over to me.</span> <span id="s527">What in the hell, he said, are you doing here yet.</span> <span id="s528">It's time for you to go home.</span> <span id="s529">I didn't answer him, but I started to cry and I turned my head and at that moment,a couple of minutes later Professor ____ , all his assistants came every day to make the rounds, and my...I was in a in a four-bed uh ward and my bed was just right...as you came in my bed was first, so he looks at me and I turned my...normally I was smiling to him, greeting him with a smile.</span> <span id="s530">This time I turned my head because I was crying and I didn't want to see him, so he came to the bed, sit down.</span> <span id="s531">He said what's going on?</span> <span id="s532">Why are you crying?</span> <span id="s533">I said oh nothing.</span> <span id="s534">He said somebody did something to you?</span> <span id="s535">Please tell me.</span> <span id="s536">I am in charge of this hospital.</span> <span id="s537">I want to know.</span> <span id="s538">I said no, because the man who told this to me was just behind you.</span> <span id="s539">So I didn't say one word.</span> <span id="s540">Next to me was a, another lady, a Polish lady, who became very friendly.</span> <span id="s541">She liked me very much.</span> <span id="s542">She said to me she never had a sister but I am like a sister to her, and she said you know, when she heard that uh I told him that my husband travels and I have to wait till he will come to pick me up...she said if you want you can come and stay with me.</span> <span id="s543">And later in the conversation she said, you know, I know it's terrible that the Germans occupied our country, but one thing we have to be grateful to them...they got rid of the Jews, got us rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s544">So that was the wonderful friend of mine.</span> <span id="s545">So it was very hard and it...when he came to see...to visit me and I knew that I had to leave the hospital, I said Adam, we have no other choice.</span> <span id="s546">Let me go someplace.</span> <span id="s547">I will throw myself down from the...and kill myself and you will stay with the baby.</span> <span id="s548">But of course he didn't and through another friend who got this job in another part of Poland and during the night we packed our little belongings and went to this little town.</span> <span id="s549">This was ______, not far from ____ and there was…there the Russians uh liberated us, but it wasn't easy because the town was going back and forth for maybe five days.</span> <span id="s550">Once the Germans got it.</span> <span id="s551">Once the Russians.</span> <span id="s552">And we were hidden.</span> <span id="s553">A couple of people, maybe seven or eight grown-ups and children, were in a cell in a, a like a bunker made where used to keep the potatoes, but this was not connected to the house.</span> <span id="s554">It was outside.</span> <span id="s555">We were there, and we heard the bombing and and the scream...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Answer (Adam): ...called a cellar, cellar...</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A (Pela):...and we were screaming and, and, and heard Russian voices and when German voices we were very quiet.</span> <span id="s558">We had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s559">Was very little water and one night it became very quiet and the same day, the next day, was very quiet.</span> <span id="s560">___ the man said, we had to take a chance.</span> <span id="s561">We'll open a little the lid and we'll look out and when they opened the lid, the, the house was burned completely.</span> <span id="s562">This...the place where the, the all the cows and the, the horses were dead.</span> <span id="s563">Everything was killed.</span> <span id="s564">And they...when they looked out, they saw Russian tanks and uh you know, they greeted them and Adam walked over to one of the officers there.</span> <span id="s565">He looked to him like he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s566">He looked very, very warm.</span> <span id="s567">So he said to him, ________.</span> <span id="s568">____ during the war...during the war it was like one Jew wanted that, so he answered him, and Adam asked him what should I do.</span> <span id="s569">Should I say who I am?</span> <span id="s570">He said don't say nothing yet, because we now have the town.</span> <span id="s571">In a couple of days we can loose the town.</span> <span id="s572">Just play the way it was, but he helped us.</span> <span id="s573">He gave us some milk.</span> <span id="s574">He gave us some butter and uh something for the baby, so that's as it was.</span> <span id="s575">It wasn't easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: When did you...how did you get the baby...no longer a baby actually...out of the sanitarium uh or out of the place where she was and what was she like...was she happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: OK.</span> <span id="s578">When we...when I came back from the hospital and Adam changed the jobs, and we saw already...this was not far from a railroad station _____.</span> <span id="s579">We saw the trains coming from the Russian border and there was a lot of trains with soldiers and some of them wounded soldiers or German soldiers, so we realized that the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s580">And Adam said to me, I have to...you have to go to ____ and pick up Yasha because it will not be good separated.</span> <span id="s581">And I went there and I told them that I'm feeling better.</span> <span id="s582">I thanked them for taking care of her and I brought her home.</span> <span id="s583">My Yasha, during the all the years she didn't know she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s584">She like anybody else.</span> <span id="s585">Uh one day she came with the ___ friend of hers, with a little branch and, and like, like a gun on her shoulder said Mommy, we are going to the woods to hunt for Jews.</span> <span id="s586">And uh she, she knew she was like anybody else.</span> <span id="s587">She...I don't think she suffered.</span> <span id="s588">She didn't know nothing what we were going through.</span> <span id="s589">But uh when we decided that it's time to...after the liberation we went...later was liberated...Warsaw was liberated.</span> <span id="s590">We went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s591">Of course we had no...was no transportation but the trucks of soldiers always picked up people on the way and we came to Warsaw and uh there was a Jewish community and we registered that we are looking for anybody who survived, and of course nobody survived.</span> <span id="s592">And uh from there we decided it's time to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s593">There was already...they establish already a DP camp in Germany and the...in West uh in West Germany and uh the war almost to an end.</span> <span id="s594">It was uh...the war ended in May and when we decided to leave was around August, so we went to a friend of ours who we knew that she lives in Lodz.</span> <span id="s595">We went there and uh we lived there for a couple of days and we tried to make connection...we knew that Russian ambulances going to Czechoslovakia are taking...for money are taking people who want to escape from Poland, so we made the connection, but before we, we were able to leave, the friend of mine asked me...Sophie I have to do something.</span> <span id="s596">Will you come and help me?</span> <span id="s597">I said OK.</span> <span id="s598">She said let Adam go with us.</span> <span id="s599">So we went out for an hour, and we left our daughter with a woman who was her like housekeeper.</span> <span id="s600">She also came from concentration camp and she didn't have with whom to live, so for helping her uh be a housekeeper she had her room and board.</span> <span id="s601">So we left and we came after an hour...the woman was crying, so my friend asked her why are you crying.</span> <span id="s602">She said please, don't ever leave me with this child uh alone.</span> <span id="s603">So I said why?</span> <span id="s604">What did she do?</span> <span id="s605">She said she wanted to go on a step ladder and I was afraid that she would get hurt.</span> <span id="s606">I told her not to do it.</span> <span id="s607">She said you dirty Jewess.</span> <span id="s608">You have no right to tell me what to do or not to do.</span> <span id="s609">So my friend says to me, now.</span> <span id="s610">I said maybe not now yet.</span> <span id="s611">She said now.</span> <span id="s612">She called in my daughter.</span> <span id="s613">She said Yasha, why did you call her dirty Jewess.</span> <span id="s614">Because she is.</span> <span id="s615">She said what would you say if I would tell you that your mother and father is Jewish and you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s616">Oh no.</span> <span id="s617">That's not true.</span> <span id="s618">My mother is not dark with a long nose and my father...no, it's not true.</span> <span id="s619">No.</span> <span id="s620">Mommy...Daddy...tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s621">Aunt Eva (ph) is just pretending.</span> <span id="s622">It's not true.</span> <span id="s623">So Adam said to her, yes darling, we had to pretend that we're not Jew...not Jewish because we wanted to save you, but we are Jewish and you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s624">She started to cry and she ran to her bedroom, closed herself on a key (ph) and was sobbing and I was standing and begging her to open the door.</span> <span id="s625">She didn't for maybe an hour and then she opened the door.</span> <span id="s626">She came out, swollen eyes.</span> <span id="s627">She had...in her hand she had a little string where she had the cross on it.</span> <span id="s628">She said if this is not my God, you show me my new God.</span> <span id="s629">I said we don't have a picture of God, but when we will come to Germany I will buy you...I will have ten commandments...I will buy you the ten commandments and this will your....so when we came to Germany, Adam got the ten commandments for her.</span> <span id="s630">We didn't have uh a chain so with a, a safety pin we put it on her sweater and every night she asked us to put the sweater under her pillow because she wanted to sleep with it, her new God.</span> <span id="s631">But it was very hard for her.</span> <span id="s632">She...when we came to the United States, she had a lot of nightmares.</span> <span id="s633">She wan...didn't want to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s634">She had...when I took her to a psychiatrist they said that she became what she hated.</span> <span id="s635">She hated the Jews like everybody else there, and she became a Jew.</span> <span id="s636">It was hard for her to, to become what she hated, but with years passed by and uh she somehow got some friends.</span> <span id="s637">In the beginning she had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s638">She spoke only German and Polish and she wanted to be outside with the children to play.</span> <span id="s639">She asked them something in Ger...German or something in Polish.</span> <span id="s640">They first make faces at her and, and made fun of her.</span> <span id="s641">They said they didn't understand her, so she cried and I told her darling, they didn't understand you.</span> <span id="s642">You will learn English and you will be able to play with them.</span> <span id="s643">So she had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s644">But when we were approached by the _____ University to make Voices, the story of three of three families and she heard our story and she wanted to get in touch with my daughter.</span> <span id="s645">I told him that she probably will not agree because she was...when she saw a German uniform she could not even talk about what happened.</span> <span id="s646">So he said please give me her number.</span> <span id="s647">I will talk to her.</span> <span id="s648">He called her.</span> <span id="s649">In the beginning she said no, but after a while she said OK.</span> <span id="s650">I will let you come, but when I will start crying, please stop filming.</span> <span id="s651">He said I promise you.</span> <span id="s652">And when I saw the Voices...and I I wasn't present when he interviewed her...I found out when she was going to grammar school, she was already in the first grade, not in kindergarten, first grade, when I took her to school and we had to cross some streets...I crossed with her...and when she had no more streets to cross she said Mommy, you go home.</span> <span id="s653">I already have...now you know, I am already OK and I am right away going to school.</span> <span id="s654">And when I left and she turned around...she saw me leaving...she run three blocks to the nearest church and she said I knew when I will cross myself I will have a good day.</span> <span id="s655">(Laughter) And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Pela....</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A (Pela): And one....when we were already here...this was...she was at that time also around uh six and a half years old...she was...we lived in another apartment.</span> <span id="s658">We lived in another apartment...not in the same school, another apartment we had.</span> <span id="s659">We moved.</span> <span id="s660">In the United States, in Chicago.</span> <span id="s661">This is where we lived on Madison...hear ____ hotel...I don't know if you know Chicago...near _____hotel.</span> <span id="s662">So, uh there was a store, a grocery store and the people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s663">In the beginning I had sometimes to use a Jewish word if I wanted something what I..</span> <span id="s664">.</span> <span id="s665">my English was very bad, so she knew that they are Jewish and it came before Christmas time...she wanted a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s666">I said darling, Jewish people don't have Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s667">We have Hanukkah and Hanukkah man comes and brings eight presents, so I bought some presents and Adam used to knock at the door outside and oh the Hanukkah man came and she got some presents.</span> <span id="s668">One day just before Christmas and we went...I went with her to the store and she looked in the store.</span> <span id="s669">In the window was a very big Christmas tree and she went into the store with me and she said Mommy, look.</span> <span id="s670">You are a liar.</span> <span id="s671">You told me that Jewish people don't have Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s672">They are Jewish people and they have a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s673">So you see it was very hard for her to...the change was very hard for her, but somehow now she's a very adjusted young lady, adjusted.</span> <span id="s674">She's going through a trauma but I hope she's...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Answer (Adam): The main thing is that we were able to save her because this was our dream.</span> <span id="s676">This was our aim.</span> <span id="s677">This was our purpose, you know.</span> <span id="s678">We did everything really just for this child to, to save her and, you know, after we were starving with nothing to eat, three times a day in the lumber yard we had for the morning she would cook a few potatoes, for lunch few potatoes and for dinner few potatoes if she was lucky to get them.</span> <span id="s679">If you were lucky to get an apple, let's say, maybe lucky ones to get an apple, I peeled the apple and we gave it first to our child, and we were fighting with each other.</span> <span id="s680">I wanted her to eat the peels...she wanted me to eat the peels, you know, and in order we should get something, and I I was the winner always, you know.</span> <span id="s681">I mean, she had to eat it, but the child was always the main thing in our...and we really truly we lived only for her.</span> <span id="s682">That I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Answer (Pela): Tell her about the first time we came ____, that you stole some.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Answer (Adam): Yeah.</span> <span id="s685">You see, my father had a friend of...business associated, used to deal with him before the war, and he was from a different part, a worser part of Poland that they were settled later into Warsaw during the war and uh he lived in of course outside of the wall in the Polish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s686">When we were already on the Polish papers living in the lumber yard, you know, I used to once in a while come to Warsaw by train and I asked him to let me sleep in his apartment so I used to sleep on the floor in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s687">Of course, I realized that he was risking his and his family's life once he, you know, let a Jewish man be in his place and in the morning, one morning, I got up and in his kitchen on a string were hanging Polish sausages, you know.</span> <span id="s688">I stole one Polish sausage.</span> <span id="s689">I put it into my, you know, coat and I traveled the eighty miles by train.</span> <span id="s690">I was hungry like a dog but I wouldn't touch it.</span> <span id="s691">I brought it to them and tried that they should have it.</span> <span id="s692">I I don't think that I was a hero over this, you know.</span> <span id="s693">I think that that's that was a natural thing for me to do.</span> <span id="s694">I didn't know another way, you know...just for them.</span> <span id="s695">And that's, that's how we survived.</span> <span id="s696">We came to the United States with three dollars in our pocket that ____ gave us on the Navy transport ship and when the uh social service came, they wanted to wanted to give me some...maybe you need some money.</span> <span id="s697">I said no, I have ten fingers and I I am an accountant but as I have ten fingers...get me any kind of work and I was working as a laborer in the stock yard in the beginning, you know, and uh I wouldn't take any handouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Answer (Pela): You know, it was not only stock yards.</span> <span id="s699">He had five, five jobs.</span> <span id="s700">He was in a mirror (ph) factory, a ___....</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A (Adam): Oh many, many, many.</span> <span id="s702">I worked like, you know, from one __ to

went to her funeral with a friend, ____, somebody who I knew in Germany and she came also to Chicago and we went to the uh to the temple.</span> <span id="s708">As we were sitting, a man passed by and he started to scream rouse, rouse (ph)...that you...this was somebody who with who he was in, in Auschwitz and we started to talk to each other and I invited them already...I had one bedroom apartment
