born to Russian Jewish parents who had moved to Lublin, Poland around 1921.</span> <span id="s5">He was reared in a contemporary religious family, and attended Polish public school and a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s6">He graduated from business school at 16 just before war broke out in 1939.</span> <span id="s7">That year, the Russians took over his town, which protected them for a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">After the Germans invaded Poland, they shot about 99 percent, some 150 of Lublin’s best- educated, professional Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Abe asserts that no Jews in Lublin tried to escape.</span> <span id="s10">Lublin’s two ghettos were established on April 1, 1942, and the Morgensterns were moved into one of them that month.</span> <span id="s11">Food became very scarce.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Abe’ father and sister perished during the first of four actions.</span> <span id="s13">Abe says that no Jews from his area were taken to concentration camps; they were shot in the woods and put into mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Abe does not provide many details about how he and his mother survived, except to say that she bribed some people.</span> <span id="s15">He refers the interviewer to an unnamed book he wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Abe mentions labor camps, one in Kamionka.</span> <span id="s17">One was burned down, killing the camp inmates.</span> <span id="s18">Abe reported a few times to the Judenrat, which took him to work temporarily at a factory and then at a camp.</span> <span id="s19">But eventually, he says, “I just stayed home.”</span> <span id="s20">Toward the end of the war, Abe and eight others dug a hole where they hid until Russian troops found them; about two weeks after the Russians had liberated the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">After the war, he and his mother immigrated to Italy.</span> <span id="s22">They had planned to go to Palestine where they had relatives, but did not go because they did not know the relatives’ names or addresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Abe says that of Lublin’s estimated 10,000 Jews, only about 200 survived -- 50 or 60 in the city, and about 150 who had escaped to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Interview with Abraham Morgenstern Transcript</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: The minute they came to that city going to Poland already in 1921, I think that’s where they smuggled the border from Russia to Poland and my father met quite a few people that he knew from before that already came ahead of him to that city, and he found some cousins and whatever.</span> <span id="s26">He also, I guess, was offered a position, a good position.</span> <span id="s27">He managed a flourmill, and my mother got pregnant and so there was an excuse not to go.</span> <span id="s28">Then when I came already, my father didn’t feel like leaving.</span> <span id="s29">He was a little established already and he felt good there.</span> <span id="s30">He had a lot of people that he knew and it was a nice town, a religious town and that’s how we stuck there.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Was your family observant, religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: 99% of the Jewish people were orthodox.</span> <span id="s33">There was no other section that didn’t, only orthodox.</span> <span id="s34">Some were modern, some were old-time religious but my father had no beard and he was --.</span> <span id="s35">In that mill, as I say, later when I was growing up, he was traveling to villages and little towns buying grains from the peasants.</span> <span id="s36">Then he was giving them to the casino and that’s how he made his living at that time.</span> <span id="s37">I went to public school and in the afternoon I went to cheder which was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s38">Then later on when I was like 11, 12, 13, I went to Hebrew School in the afternoon for two, three years.</span> <span id="s39">We learned other subjects too beside Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: You went to that school solely, you didn’t go to the public school any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s42">I said I went to the public school till I was 13 and finished.</span> <span id="s43">Up there you go seven years public school.</span> <span id="s44">I finished public school in 1936.</span> <span id="s45">There were two higher schools after that.</span> <span id="s46">One was the gymnasium they called it which was run by the state, and the other one was business school.</span> <span id="s47">It was also -- it wasn’t run by the state, it was private but they were on the same level.</span> <span id="s48">You had to wear uniforms and you had to get exams before being admitted.</span> <span id="s49">I went three years there and I graduated in 1939.</span> <span id="s50">There, besides all the other subjects, you learned -- they also taught me German.</span> <span id="s51">I took German language.</span> <span id="s52">You could take French or German.</span> <span id="s53">I choose German so I’m familiar with the German language too.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What did you speak in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">I didn’t learn Yiddish till almost the wartime.</span> <span id="s59">I knew it from the people speaking all around but I never spoke it and all my friends, we always spoke Polish with all my friends.</span> <span id="s60">In the cheder, what we went when I was small yet, I could speak to the teacher in Yiddish that time but we never spoke --.</span> <span id="s61">As a matter of fact my parents in the beginning, even later, they spoke Russian between themselves too because they were from Russia.</span> <span id="s62">But my mother wanted me to know the Polish language so she spoke Polish to me and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You had just one sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes, one sister, two years younger, yes.</span> <span id="s65">As I said, you asked me about religious; my father traveled most of the week, he was in other towns but he make sure he comes back Friday afternoon to make Shabbos home and he went to the shul Saturday.</span> <span id="s66">He took me most of the time to shul, I remember, and holidays no question about it.</span> <span id="s67">On a Saturday most of the business people were Jews in the city.</span> <span id="s68">Very few gentiles had businesses, some had but the majority was Jewish.</span> <span id="s69">Come Saturday, the stores were closed up.</span> <span id="s70">It may be singles, Jewish stores, they were open like candy stores, or a drugstore or something like that.</span> <span id="s71">The rest was shut up completely.</span> <span id="s72">Some were open Sundays; they allowed some stores to be opened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays everybody closed.</span> <span id="s73">Even the people that only went to the synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, they still observed the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you live right in the city, right in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We lived in quite a few places.</span> <span id="s76">Me and my family didn’t own a house so we had -- we’re renters.</span> <span id="s77">I guess we rented wherever was convenient, wherever the job was.</span> <span id="s78">Then when I guess they wanted more money or whatever, the family wanted a bigger place, we had to move.</span> <span id="s79">I remember moving like three or four times, different places.</span> <span id="s80">From one end of the city to the middle city, to the outskirts, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s82">Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span> <span id="s84">Women didn’t work before.</span> <span id="s85">My mother always stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you ever work with your father at all?</span> <span id="s87">Did you ever --?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: He used to take me sometimes on a trip.</span> <span id="s89">My father used to own one of these horse and carriages like you see in Central Park or something like that for pleasure.</span> <span id="s90">He used to keep it at somebody’s stable but when he went out of town he used to go with -- he used to rent a drive of it with a horse and carriage that you could bring the grain back on that.</span> <span id="s91">It was like a commercial type horse and buggy, not a pleasure.</span> <span id="s92">As far as taking me, he’d take me -- most of the time he would take me -- he went to a place where we had some kind of relations, distant, whatever, my father knew.</span> <span id="s93">He would leave me there for the day, with his business and I would be there with other youngsters for me.</span> <span id="s94">Distant, distant relatives or acquaintances whatever.</span> <span id="s95">As far as working, I did not work but upon the graduation of the business school in 1939, my father took me to that flourmill where he used to manage before Even though he was out already, maybe ten years out of that place, no not ten years, maybe seven or so, he took me to the office there.</span> <span id="s96">He knew the people, the accountants in the office and the managers and they interviewed me and they gave me a test and they hired me as of the first of September.</span> <span id="s97">I had a position in the bookkeeper’s office there.</span> <span id="s98">I was very happy, I didn’t have to -- in other words I got it through my father.</span> <span id="s99">I didn’t get it on my own because I was green at that time, 16 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Was this a Jewish firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s102">It was a big mill, a very large mill, exported flour all over the world.</span> <span id="s103">There were two mills in the city, both Jewish, different ends of the town.</span> <span id="s104">The mills are there today, they’re there today, the mills are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah, of course, sure.</span> <span id="s107">They employed a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: At this point, your father was more of an independent?</span> <span id="s109">He was more of a merchant, a grain merchant?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: He was self-employed.</span> <span id="s111">When he left -- the reason he left the mill there, it was sold.</span> <span id="s112">The people that they sold the mill, the owners came from Lvov, you’re familiar with this city, probably you’ve read about it, it was a big city in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s113">So the new owners came and I don’t know whether they let him go or it was -- I don’t know the details, I never asked.</span> <span id="s114">But since then he didn’t work there but he was very friendly with the people, even with the new owners.</span> <span id="s115">The people, they sold the mill, opened up a new one at the other end of the town, somehow.</span> <span id="s116">They built a new one or they built and then they sold it, whatever it was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s117">He knew the people there and that’s how he got me the job.</span> <span id="s118">Of course, I never got the chance to put in one day’s work because the first of September I had to report, that’s when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s120">What happened on that day in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: In our town, what it happened they -- the day before they proclaimed a general mobilization.</span> <span id="s122">It was very touch-and-go for the last few weeks there before that date.</span> <span id="s123">It was the German propaganda and Hitler’s speeches, you know, was broadcast all over.</span> <span id="s124">They demanded Danzig, it’s a port city there.</span> <span id="s125">They gave in to this and he demanded something else after that.</span> <span id="s126">They knew that they cannot get out of it, he’s going to attack sooner or later.</span> <span id="s127">The minute that they declared the mobilization, it was a Friday night or something, the next day or so they declared war.</span> <span id="s128">Germany declared, they attacked first and then they declared.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: During the mobilization, what did they expect from everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: The people had to report to their points.</span> <span id="s131">Whoever was 21 years old had to report, mobilize.</span> <span id="s132">There was a general mobilization and all doctors, dentists were mobilized and put into uniform right away and sent to different parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s133">They did it quick but our city was not -- was at the other end -- was at the eastern end of Poland.</span> <span id="s134">So it was not attacked, was not attacked by the Germans, they concentrated a little bit the other way, the western part, that’s where they attacked from, the western part.</span> <span id="s135">It dragged on like this for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s136">People started to evacuate from Warsaw and Lodz (?)</span> <span id="s137">and different cities.</span> <span id="s138">We used to see a lot of cars coming through with people in it.</span> <span id="s139">On ______ top of the Romanian border.</span> <span id="s140">We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border, was like 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border, or 35, just nothing.</span> <span id="s141">They all had cars, most of them with cars, people, not only Polish people, Jewish people too, they had means and they didn’t want to be caught.</span> <span id="s142">They figured they’ll go to Romania and Romania was independent and from there they would --.</span> <span id="s143">Actually, they did and people that went to Romania, they wound up in England.</span> <span id="s144">All the Polish escapees wound up in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: It was the way to go, even to Palestine, that route.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: To Palestine, you couldn’t go because the British wouldn’t let them go.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: The mandate had --?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: They wouldn’t let go but the English government would let the Polish people come into England.</span> <span id="s149">They went -- it’s a long way around but that’s how they managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did your father ever think about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, at that time, why?</span> <span id="s152">Where would we go?</span> <span id="s153">First of all, we had no means of transportation, where you going to go.</span> <span id="s154">It was a city of nine to ten thousand Jews and nobody tried to escape, actually nobody.</span> <span id="s155">Some Polish people did, officers evacuated some families and police, almost to the last day, the police, the firemen, they stayed will the last day.</span> <span id="s156">Almost the last day, they evacuated.</span> <span id="s157">What happened between those two weeks, it took about two weeks till the 17th of September; it was a Sunday morning and Germany was successful in occupying already quite a bit of -- most of -- about two-thirds of Poland.</span> <span id="s158">I think the only place that still was not occupied was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s159">They lasted almost a month.</span> <span id="s160">Somebody, I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already, they said within a few hours the Russian army is going to be here.</span> <span id="s161">It didn’t take long, an hour or two and we heard shelling or something.</span> <span id="s162">They were going, the Russian army was advancing and just shooting so that the people don’t attack them.</span> <span id="s163">They didn’t know who the Polish army is still there or the police, they had no idea.</span> <span id="s164">They were just like shelling like over the cities to announce that they are here.</span> <span id="s165">Whoever didn’t escape yet from the government tried to get out.</span> <span id="s166">But there was no fighting, there was no damage.</span> <span id="s167">It was very festive when they actually showed up.</span> <span id="s168">Their tanks and the artillery, the cavalry; actually the whole town went out to greet them in the streets, special there was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but some Poles too that they were socialists or communists or whatever.</span> <span id="s169">There was no communist Party, it was illegal but there were people that believe in socialism and they were the first ones to greet the soldiers and run the city right from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I’m sure your father and mother weren’t among them?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s172">My father never mixed in politics.</span> <span id="s173">That’s how it started.</span> <span id="s174">Once the Russians went by -- they went by and the next day they send in people to run the city.</span> <span id="s175">The mayor became one of the -- our own people sitting in jail in the other part of Poland, in the north somewhere belonging to the communist party.</span> <span id="s176">They came back, they let out the prisons from there.</span> <span id="s177">They came back to the city, one of them became a mayor.</span> <span id="s178">He rode a horse and became a mayor.</span> <span id="s179">They figured he was a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in jail.</span> <span id="s180">So they gave him the honor of being a mayor but not for long, a week or two, then they appointed their own; they brought in their own people to manage the city.</span> <span id="s181">A little bit later, they brought their families and they took over the buildings where the Polish officers used to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled there.</span> <span id="s182">Later on they even took over Jewish apartments and they settled the Russians and things like that.</span> <span id="s183">They nationalized the buildings and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What was the first effect on your family or yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well the effect was positive.</span> <span id="s186">First of all, my parents come from Russia and with the Russian army, they could communicate and then they started to organize different businesses, everything under the government control.</span> <span id="s187">They were looking for anybody with managerial experience and my father was pulled in right away in a good position.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: He had experience and he could speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Experience and he went into a grain concern that the Ukrainians had established.</span> <span id="s190">A grain concern and they knew about him and they took him in to manage a certain thing.</span> <span id="s191">Then he took me into the office and that’s how I got a job.</span> <span id="s192">I worked there almost two years in the bookkeeping department.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Was that also a positive experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes, very positive because they treated the Jews very nicely.</span> <span id="s195">You know the Russian authorities at that time, most of the occupiers.</span> <span id="s196">The officers, the big and even the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people from Russia.</span> <span id="s197">It was a very positive thing for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s198">It was very positive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles.</span> <span id="s199">Poles were looked a little bit down because the Russians said that they came to liberate us from the Polish yoke or whatever.</span> <span id="s200">So the Poles had a difficulty of getting a good position.</span> <span id="s201">Also then a couple of months later, they established everybody from 16 years and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures.</span> <span id="s202">We had to go to register.</span> <span id="s203">People went to register according to their professions, whatever they did.</span> <span id="s204">If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the passport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would be marked son of a businessman.</span> <span id="s205">With that passport you couldn’t land a good position already because you were considered a capitalist.</span> <span id="s206">That’s how they marked the passports.</span> <span id="s207">Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or Ukrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today.</span> <span id="s208">All my friends that their parents were in business and they had problems getting jobs.</span> <span id="s209">Being that my father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him I was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Do you remember anything about being indoctrinated about communism?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Oh yes, sure, of course.</span> <span id="s212">They had lectures, public lecture forums that you go.</span> <span id="s213">At that time already it was a few months after they established already their rule.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact, they have it in the book.</span> <span id="s215">One of the lectures that I remember, we worked in the grain concern.</span> <span id="s216">Most of the grains were being shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s217">At that time already, Germany took two-thirds of Poland and they took one-third.</span> <span id="s218">They divided between themselves.</span> <span id="s219">But at that time already there was a little friction between both of them somehow.</span> <span id="s220">There were not such good relations and yet they were shipping all the grains out to them.</span> <span id="s221">I remember asking that question to one of the officers that was giving the lecture.</span> <span id="s222">They had special propaganda men that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures.</span> <span id="s223">I asked him, how could we ship to them the grains that being they’re already trying to tell us that they’re not friends, they’re like enemies.</span> <span id="s224">They’re trying to build up their thing against us or whatever.</span> <span id="s225">He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts that we give them are negligible but from our concern most of them went there.</span> <span id="s226">He says we have to buy time to be prepared.</span> <span id="s227">They were preparing the building airfield outside the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: The Russians were?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s230">The Russians were.</span> <span id="s231">I was roped in to go to that airfield on my vacation to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What was the feeling in the town at that time?</span> <span id="s233">Was it that things are stable or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was a stable feeling, it was stable.</span> <span id="s235">They opened up a Jewish gymnasium what it wasn’t before.</span> <span id="s236">Before it was like a public; they opened up a separate Jewish gymnasium with Jewish language, Hebrew, Jewish and most of the Jewish kids that want to go to a gymnasium would go into that gymnasium.</span> <span id="s237">The Poles already had no gymnasium no more.</span> <span id="s238">The Ukrainians did have their Ukrainian gymnasium, the Poles had no gymnasium.</span> <span id="s239">That’s how they were treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Really lost those --?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes, they were really mad at the Poles.</span> <span id="s242">Didn’t let us forget; they thought that because the Jews were more favored than them, they thought that they had to pay us back later.</span> <span id="s243">It’s one of the reasons they claimed that we were patsies with the Russians and most we are communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What about when you had to go build the airfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, it happened already very close to the June ’41 when Russia was attacked.</span> <span id="s246">I had my vacation in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: You thought, you had your vacation!</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I thought, right.</span> <span id="s249">I had a vacation in 1940, I had one vacation for two weeks.</span> <span id="s250">But in 1941, I was scheduled to go to a --.</span> <span id="s251">They had special places where they sent people that worked nice in the offices, they worked good and they deserved a little break, they would send them paid vacations to a place where it’s like a resort area.</span> <span id="s252">I was scheduled to go on my two weeks to that resort area.</span> <span id="s253">Here like a week before it, a week before my vacation, I was called into the office of the director and he said, he says, I know that you must realize that how we are trying up an army and we have to get prepared because the Germans keep saying they’re going to attack us and they built up a very big might against us.</span> <span id="s254">Everybody has to sacrifice and being I’m a good citizen or whatever, each office has to concentrate to the building of the airfield.</span> <span id="s255">Being that they cannot spare nobody from the office because it’s a busy concern when my vacation comes up, that I should volunteer to g to that airfield.</span> <span id="s256">He says you’re going to get paid for your vacation, you’re going to get paid for there.</span> <span id="s257">But this was like six or seven kilometers out of the city with no transportation but I had no choice.</span> <span id="s258">You couldn’t say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: No choice but to volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Right, no choice but to volunteer.</span> <span id="s261">Otherwise I’d be fired or whatever and I went there to the airfield place.</span> <span id="s262">They interviewed me and they said okay, whatever that day was.</span> <span id="s263">Next Monday you’re starting, have to be there six o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s264">It was, I don’t remember how I got there the first day, I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s265">My father had somebody drive me most of the time.</span> <span id="s266">I know I walked one time.</span> <span id="s267">I walked.</span> <span id="s268">They took me up there and they had mobilized all the peasants from the vicinity, all around from that area, mobilized under duress.</span> <span id="s269">Otherwise they didn’t get even paid.</span> <span id="s270">Whoever had a horse and buggy was mobilized and they had to transport all kinds of materials from the warehouses and back to that place where they’re building the airport.</span> <span id="s271">They had engineers, they had a lot of Russians and they were walking on the ground and it was just a big, big field, a tremendous field.</span> <span id="s272">From scratch they had to stop and build that airport.</span> <span id="s273">I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day, I got acquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s274">He was something, a demolition expert or whatever and he was working underground something.</span> <span id="s275">He had a truck, he was driving a truck, they run the little trucks or something We got acquainted and he says; I said I would like --.</span> <span id="s276">I walked home, that’s what it was, the first day I walked home.</span> <span id="s277">Quite a bit to walk, an hour and a half or whatever I don’t remember, an hour or more.</span> <span id="s278">He said -- I invited him.</span> <span id="s279">If you want to come to the house, you can have supper with us, figured he’ll give me a ride which he did.</span> <span id="s280">I says you come to the house and you can even stay there overnight.</span> <span id="s281">In the morning you’ll come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You’re still living with your parents and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s284">Unannounced he brought me home.</span> <span id="s285">I introduced him and he was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s286">He had supper with us and he slept one night and in the morning, he went back with the truck.</span> <span id="s287">That’s how we were going every day.</span> <span id="s288">So it turned out to be not bad for me; you know I had transportation.</span> <span id="s289">Otherwise, I probably wouldn’t be coming home every day, I’d probably sleep there somewhere.</span> <span id="s290">The two weeks went by, two weeks went up.</span> <span id="s291">I went back and somebody else’s vacation came up and they sent him.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What did you do at the airfield?</span> <span id="s293">Was it labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s295">It was office work.</span> <span id="s296">What I actually did, the peasants were hauling sand.</span> <span id="s297">From wherever they were bringing the sand here somehow and I had to give them receipts for how much sand they had to bring a full load of sand and I gave them the receipts for the loads.</span> <span id="s298">I had to go check if they didn’t lose on the way half or whatever.</span> <span id="s299">I gave them receipts.</span> <span id="s300">They were lined up for stretches and stretches of those things from morning until the night.</span> <span id="s301">They were working around the clock; they had two shifts from six to six.</span> <span id="s302">My shift was from six in the morning until six at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: The receipts were just to show that they had done this?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: They had done this and with those receipts they were promised they would get paid eventually.</span> <span id="s305">They never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q&gt; I see.</span> <span id="s307">Because it was too late?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Even so, they never had intentions of honoring them.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And then what?</span> <span id="s310">After you went back to the __?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: I went back to the --.</span> <span id="s312">Then June 21, Germany attacked.</span> <span id="s313">They attacked the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you know, did you have the feeling that this was going to occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No way, no way.</span> <span id="s316">As a matter of fact I went to the beach that Sunday.</span> <span id="s317">The beach was empty and I couldn’t understand why there was almost nobody there.</span> <span id="s318">Very few -- I usually meet my friends there; we play cards, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: This was on the lake?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No, it was on a river, river.</span> <span id="s321">We had beaches by the river.</span> <span id="s322">It’s a nice story; I go into detail actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I look forward to it.</span> <span id="s324">What was the first clue that there was an invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: The first clue was that I usually meet my friends like I got up in the morning.</span> <span id="s326">We had no radio in the house.</span> <span id="s327">Very few people had radios; telephones, only doctors and professionals would have a telephone.</span> <span id="s328">Got up at eight o’clock, it was a nice sunny day and I went to the beach, a 15 or 20 minutes walk and I went to the beach.</span> <span id="s329">Close to nine o’clock usually my friends would show up already and nobody’s there.</span> <span id="s330">Here and there, there’s somebody there, you know.</span> <span id="s331">Go for a swim by yourself, how much can you be in the water by yourself.</span> <span id="s332">I go out just waiting for people to show up so we usually play cards.</span> <span id="s333">Then somebody around ten o’clock, somebody shows up.</span> <span id="s334">He says what are you people doing here?</span> <span id="s335">Don’t you know there’s a war?</span> <span id="s336">That’s how I found out.</span> <span id="s337">Actually they bombed already cities at four o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s338">Four o’clock in the morning, Kiev was bombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a few cities were bombed.</span> <span id="s339">Our city was bombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our city.</span> <span id="s340">That’s how I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Were you mobilized or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Well, in 1941 people one year older than me were mobilized in 1941.</span> <span id="s343">Their year was called.</span> <span id="s344">Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized like in March and April already, they went to be inducted.</span> <span id="s345">At that time when the war broke out, they didn’t mobilize any more except whoever was still around who was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them right away.</span> <span id="s346">Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to evacuate.</span> <span id="s347">The first week was normal.</span> <span id="s348">They attacked but they were holding their ground for the first four or five days or something.</span> <span id="s349">But then they broke through the lines and it was disaster.</span> <span id="s350">The first week we were still going into the office and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already, mobilizing some cars or trucks if they had.</span> <span id="s351">In our concern too, the director was taking trucks and horse and buggies, putting furniture and stuff and sending family back to Russia.</span> <span id="s352">We were just standing there.</span> <span id="s353">The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was communist or something, they didn’t want to take chances.</span> <span id="s354">I think the second week already, it was like _______ they were running.</span> <span id="s355">Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in trucks full with soldiers.</span> <span id="s356">People tried to get rides with them; some did, some couldn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s357">Again my family wouldn’t think of running; not only mine, the majority didn’t think of anything.</span> <span id="s358">Even though we knew that the Germans, they’re against the Jews but nobody thought of something happening whatever happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Had you heard any stories about Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Of course we heard.</span> <span id="s361">We heard stories from the other parts of Poland what they were two years already there.</span> <span id="s362">That they mobilized some people to camps, labor camps.</span> <span id="s363">They worked them for nothing; some guys, sometimes they cut somebody’s beard off and things like that.</span> <span id="s364">There was no concentration camps, there was no -- at that time there was no extermination, nobody even thought about it in 1941.</span> <span id="s365">After they attacked Russia, they started there too, they started to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Were there refugees coming through your city?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s368">We had German refugees; they were coming in 1938 yet.</span> <span id="s369">Germany threw out Jewish people that their ancestry was from Poland.</span> <span id="s370">They brought them up to a Polish border station and left them there.</span> <span id="s371">Then different communities tried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of Poland, some wound up by us.</span> <span id="s372">Most of them had some family or some relations, they came here but some didn’t.</span> <span id="s373">Some were trying to actually work their way to get into Russia.</span> <span id="s374">They figure they go to the eastern part of Poland, maybe they’ll be able to get across the border to Russia.</span> <span id="s375">We had quite a few refugees here.</span> <span id="s376">Again, that was the worst thing that happened to them.</span> <span id="s377">They threw them out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s379">You see trucks with Russian soldiers going through and kind of fleeing --?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Civilian Russians, civilians too evacuating.</span> <span id="s381">It was the second week all civilians, Russians with their families were evacuating --?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Then your city was bombed, soon after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: The city was bombed right at the end of the evacuation when the German planes and the Russian planes were still fighting each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Do you remember seeing planes flying overhead?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Well, I didn’t stick my nose out.</span> <span id="s386">We were sitting in the basements because they were shelling.</span> <span id="s387">Before the Germans came there were a few nights, there was tremendous shelling.</span> <span id="s388">There were -- opposite sides -- shells were flying all through the night.</span> <span id="s389">The whole house shook every time.</span> <span id="s390">Nobody put their head out.</span> <span id="s391">As a matter of fact, wherever we lived at the time, there was a lot of gentile people lived there in that section.</span> <span id="s392">In that cellar, there was mostly gentile people there.</span> <span id="s393">But nobody would stick their head out.</span> <span id="s394">I had a chance to go there --= I’ll just make it short.</span> <span id="s395">The fellow that I acquainted at the airfield, the second week of the evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of our house.</span> <span id="s396">Everybody got scared in the neighborhood, a tank, what’s a tank doing here?</span> <span id="s397">A Russian tank pulled up.</span> <span id="s398">A guy comes out and goes up to our house.</span> <span id="s399">That’s the fellow, he came with a tank.</span> <span id="s400">He came to take me with us.</span> <span id="s401">He says we are evacuating, the Germans are going to be here any day and come with me, I’ll take you back to Russia.</span> <span id="s402">You might be in trouble here, you know, the Jewish people won’t have it so good.</span> <span id="s403">There was a discussion between my father and my mother, should they go, should they not go.</span> <span id="s404">I was like, I had nothing to say probably but I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s405">I know I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s406">I wasn’t ready yet to be on my own.</span> <span id="s407">They decided not to let me go, my mother especially, they don’t want to let me go.</span> <span id="s408">He left and also at the same time, maybe a day different, quite a few youngsters a little bit older than me, maybe a year or two older from the neighborhood, walked out from their homes.</span> <span id="s409">Said goodbyes and they all wear these knapsacks on them and they said whoever wants to join them, they’re going.</span> <span id="s410">They’re going to try to reach Russia.</span> <span id="s411">They went out, on the outskirts and that’s all we saw of them.</span> <span id="s412">But about two or three days later, they came back.</span> <span id="s413">They came back, they couldn’t get rides with nobody and they couldn’t go by foot.</span> <span id="s414">They all came back.</span> <span id="s415">Then this fellow came with the tank, he didn’t go to Russia either.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: He didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, I met him later, that’s a story besides.</span> <span id="s418">They didn’t -- they told him to stay back and he posed as a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s419">Just met him by chance on the street.</span> <span id="s420">I was in a march for labor, something during the German occupation, and I met him on the street.</span> <span id="s421">He wouldn’t look at me, we just looked at each other and then he put his head down.</span> <span id="s422">He didn’t want to -- I was marching in a group so of course, I couldn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s423">Then when we were marched back, he was waiting there in a corner and he came over to me.</span> <span id="s424">He said something, you know I’m here and nobody knows, nobody is supposed to know who I am.</span> <span id="s425">He says I was on my way, they send me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: When did the first German forces enter your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I think it was like July 7 or 6.</span> <span id="s428">I have the date in the book exactly.</span> <span id="s429">From the 21st of June till July 6 or 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: What was the first appearance of the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well, first of all, again, it was a Sunday, the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s432">We were not in the street; we were in the basement all night.</span> <span id="s433">In the morning we went back to the rooms and then one of the neighbors came in.</span> <span id="s434">She says the Germans are in town already and you better don’t dare to go out on the street.</span> <span id="s435">They’re catching Jews or whatever.</span> <span id="s436">Of course we didn’t.</span> <span id="s437">A little bit later, there was a knock on the door, the same day, and it was in the afternoon, early in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s438">Two Ukrainian policemen were there; there were no Ukrainian police before, all of a sudden, there’s Ukrainian police, uniforms and rifles.</span> <span id="s439">We didn’t know at the time but that day also they proclaimed independent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov.</span> <span id="s440">The Germans let them have an independent Ukraine.</span> <span id="s441">They had prepared already, evidently they were prepared for that.</span> <span id="s442">They had uniforms already.</span> <span id="s443">So they came and they came into the house and they took my father out.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did they give a reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, they need him for work.</span> <span id="s446">My mother was pleading and crying and pleading.</span> <span id="s447">We didn’t live in the city, we lived outside.</span> <span id="s448">It wasn’t a Jewish section at all.</span> <span id="s449">They had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they came here, they had to cross a bridge --.</span> <span id="s450">The minute they knocked on the door, me and my sister, we were hiding under the bed or somewheres in the bedroom and they took my father.</span> <span id="s451">My mother was crying and of course we thought he’ll never come back.</span> <span id="s452">He didn’t show up till late in the evening, he came back which it was like a miracle too.</span> <span id="s453">He says they did take him to work something by the river, whatever he had to do.</span> <span id="s454">Him and whoever else they caught.</span> <span id="s455">He says they didn’t beat him and when they finished whatever they were doing; they let him go.</span> <span id="s456">It was the first experience.</span> <span id="s457">Second experience with the Germans, the next day already.</span> <span id="s458">.</span> <span id="s459">We didn’t go any more in the basement because there was no more shelling already so we stayed in the room.</span> <span id="s460">We still didn’t dare to go in the street.</span> <span id="s461">Now I don’t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of German cars, motorcycles pulled up in our street.</span> <span id="s462">They stopped on the street and some of them came into the -- we had like a yard in the front and they put in their motorcycles in the yard.</span> <span id="s463">They were knocking on the doors; evidently they were shown where Jews lived.</span> <span id="s464">They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly guys and they were from the army.</span> <span id="s465">Evidently they were asking where Jews are living not because -- we didn’t know, the minute we saw these things we tried to run down the basement over there by that time.</span> <span id="s466">But my mother stayed out and what they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to communicate.</span> <span id="s467">Because they couldn’t communicate with the other people and most of the Jews knew German somehow because the Yiddish and German is very similar.</span> <span id="s468">They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with them and they want us to cook.</span> <span id="s469">They want the women to cook for them the stuff and they should have their break and eat and then they go further.</span> <span id="s470">That’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Who cooked for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: My mother and then there was another family there, you know.</span> <span id="s473">So that’s what they came for.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: They didn’t ask any questions of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s476">They just ate.</span> <span id="s477">She cooked the meal; they gave some to us.</span> <span id="s478">I think they gave my mother some stuff what they had and then they went on their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Let’s flip the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">END OF SIDE A (ONLY ONE TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: It was the first time we saw the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s482">Otherwise, we didn’t stick our head out.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Again your father hadn’t been harassed again, just that once?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No.</span> <span id="s485">Well, then the holidays came in and we -- of course we couldn’t go anywhere to pray.</span> <span id="s486">We started from the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s487">We gathered some people and we made like a little gathering in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: This was like Rosh Hashanah?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: This was already Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s490">Rosh Hashanah we didn’t pray because it was that time when it happened that they --.</span> <span id="s491">We prayed there, people prayed there.</span> <span id="s492">All of a sudden somebody came in the neighborhood and said that Ukrainian police is coming.</span> <span id="s493">They see Ukrainian police coming up the street.</span> <span id="s494">Everybody ran, you know, they took off the prayer shawl and went to their homes.</span> <span id="s495">Some from a little further away, they had to stay, disperse a little bit.</span> <span id="s496">That’s what they were coming, to check if Jewish people praying.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Had there been some decree that Jews weren’t allowed to pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: There were a lot of decrees but this was right -- was only a day or two away or three from where they -- we didn’t even go out nothing.</span> <span id="s499">Then there were decrees, a lot of decrees.</span> <span id="s500">I think within the first week they started decrees.</span> <span id="s501">First the Jews had to register.</span> <span id="s502">They imposed the Jewish community leadership.</span> <span id="s503">Otherwise they came to the -- there was a Jewish vice-mayor.</span> <span id="s504">The vice-mayor was Jewish, he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s505">They came to him and they said you better organize a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: The Ukrainian police?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, no, the Germans, already the Germans came.</span> <span id="s508">There was a building from the Jewish community and they found out who was the vice-mayor.</span> <span id="s509">They came to the leader’s house and they says we want in 24 hours we want a Jewish community leadership so we can communicate and give directions, whatever.</span> <span id="s510">They had a problem to organize it because people didn’t want to serve on it voluntarily.</span> <span id="s511">They don’t want to be involved with the Germans at all.</span> <span id="s512">Because you expose yourself once you did.</span> <span id="s513">This vice-mayor tried to get some of his friends and acquaintances and little by little they organized a community leadership.</span> <span id="s514">Then the Germans had proclaimed announcements all over the town that --.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Posters, yes, that we had no announcing on the radio.</span> <span id="s517">There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s518">They had special places with their posters and that’s how you announced everything.</span> <span id="s519">Every street had different places where they announced what’s going on and that the Jewish people have to register at the community center in order to receive food stamps, rations, food rations; otherwise you have to be registered.</span> <span id="s520">There was no kind of register, you would not receive rations.</span> <span id="s521">They didn’t say you would be punished or something just have to register.</span> <span id="s522">The same thing, the gentile population had an announcement.</span> <span id="s523">They have to register in their places wherever so most of the people went to register.</span> <span id="s524">When you registered, I didn’t go, my father went and he registered.</span> <span id="s525">They asked him his profession from before and address and everything and he registered.</span> <span id="s526">Then I think a week or two later you had to go and pick up the rations.</span> <span id="s527">It was very small rations that they gave you.</span> <span id="s528">Whatever they gave, the Jews got half of it.</span> <span id="s529">Then every day different posters.</span> <span id="s530">If anyone has a radio, he has to turn it in.</span> <span id="s531">Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it in.</span> <span id="s532">You cannot walk on the sidewalk, any Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s533">Every Jew must have an armband with the Star of David, a white armband with a blue Star of David.</span> <span id="s534">It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to be worn on the left arm.</span> <span id="s535">Again, different -- no Jew can have a business.</span> <span id="s536">If he has a business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians took the businesses away and there wasn’t that many.</span> <span id="s537">They still had businesses, there were some their stores were nationalized so they were talking about these stores; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from before.</span> <span id="s538">They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the beginning.</span> <span id="s539">Then the Ukrainian took it right over.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Over how many weeks did these decrees pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: It was maybe the second week the Germans were already here.</span> <span id="s542">Right after the second week or so or the end of the first week, something like that.</span> <span id="s543">It was very fast, very fast.</span> <span id="s544">You could not own a bicycle.</span> <span id="s545">Jews cannot own a bicycle.</span> <span id="s546">Then again you could not be found in a gentile’s house.</span> <span id="s547">You cannot marry a gentile.</span> <span id="s548">All kinds of laws; every day a few different things like that.</span> <span id="s549">It was very restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Do you remember your family turning in anything in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Oh, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s552">It was later, we had to turn in fur.</span> <span id="s553">That was November, December, they announce on posters that every Jewish family has to turn in all their fur.</span> <span id="s554">They have to bring it into the Jewish community so they can collect it for the German army.</span> <span id="s555">They were fighting already in Russia, they got stuck for the winter.</span> <span id="s556">They needed that and of course, in those days you could see a lot of smoke going through the chimneys.</span> <span id="s557">We were burning fur but everybody had to turn something in because they knew every family has fur.</span> <span id="s558">We buried some in the yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Some furs?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: My father buried some fur, yes.</span> <span id="s561">Because he didn’t want to give it away -- probably still there today.</span> <span id="s562">Whatever we turned in, my mother had a nice fur coat, I think it’s in that book, in the picture but she had given it away already a little bit before that to one of the Ukrainians that worked with my father before.</span> <span id="s563">He took me in for like two or three nights to stay over his house because I had to report to go to a camp for labor already.</span> <span id="s564">My mother wouldn’t let me go and my father took me there.</span> <span id="s565">They kept me like two, three days and she promised them a fur coat so my father brought her fur coat there.</span> <span id="s566">That was before we knew that we had to give away fur coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Was there a marked change in the Ukrainians themselves?</span> <span id="s568">Before when the Russians were occupying the area, the Jews and the Ukrainians were getting along?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: But at another part, the police, the collaborators --?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: At that time, even the Poles which were also not favorites by the Germans, the Ukrainians were.</span> <span id="s572">The Poles were not favored.</span> <span id="s573">Not only the Ukrainians didn’t want to look at us, or anything to do with us, but even the Poles didn’t want anything to do with us.</span> <span id="s574">They wouldn’t help us, just the opposite.</span> <span id="s575">They were glad that you’re getting paid back what the Russians did to us.</span> <span id="s576">I had friends from school, that we were very friendly used to go to each other’s house, saw him on the street, he looked the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Did you get your armband from the Jewish community center?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s579">Everybody made their own.</span> <span id="s580">Some tailors made extra money on it for a dollar or two, whatever.</span> <span id="s581">They used to make it, to buy, most people made their own.</span> <span id="s582">It had to be uniform.</span> <span id="s583">It had to be a certain standard, white and blue that was the color.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: At what point was there a ghetto established?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: The ghetto was established April 1, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Was there anything else significant that happened between that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Oh, yes, a lot of things happened.</span> <span id="s588">You know again it’s with our registration.</span> <span id="s589">When we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list of everybody.</span> <span id="s590">There were some people they didn’t register.</span> <span id="s591">The only people they did not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn’t make it to Russia.</span> <span id="s592">They came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere.</span> <span id="s593">One guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn’t want to be exposed at all.</span> <span id="s594">They were in hiding like and they didn’t register.</span> <span id="s595">Because they didn’t want anybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing they would call to them.</span> <span id="s596">They were part of the Russian establishment.</span> <span id="s597">So with those names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in October, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we found out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people.</span> <span id="s598">I think it was in August, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s599">In the book I have it exactly, it might have been August.</span> <span id="s600">I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150 ______ from different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants.</span> <span id="s601">They told the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us they took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot.</span> <span id="s602">This took away the leadership, the intelligentsia; it was the people that they could be a potential leadership or something, that knocked out 99%.</span> <span id="s603">They left a few single doctors, surgeons, they left a few.</span> <span id="s604">Like lawyers, it was only the vice-mayor that he was the chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time.</span> <span id="s605">I don’t think there was any other lawyers left that I recall.</span> <span id="s606">With one shot they knocked out the cream of the population.</span> <span id="s607">They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of people to go from the city to a labor camp, somewhere 80 kilometers away or whatever.</span> <span id="s608">We didn’t know at that time where.</span> <span id="s609">Of course, they came and brought -- no, they got our name too.</span> <span id="s610">We had a notice that I had to report next day to the Judenrat to go to that camp.</span> <span id="s611">Again, you know, was in the house between my mother and father.</span> <span id="s612">My mother didn’t want me to let me go; my father said well I’ll have to go.</span> <span id="s613">In the meantime they are preparing a knapsack for me with food and clothing whatever.</span> <span id="s614">They didn’t know for how long; I think they said for three months.</span> <span id="s615">Then you’ll come back and other people will take your place.</span> <span id="s616">The decision was finally that no, I should not go.</span> <span id="s617">That’s when I went to that Ukrainian’s house where I stayed two or three nights.</span> <span id="s618">It was my mother’s idea.</span> <span id="s619">My father was -- he didn’t, he couldn’t decide one way or the other.</span> <span id="s620">It was just a plain labor camp, they didn’t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there; a lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard.</span> <span id="s621">The work they were doing had nothing to do with labor.</span> <span id="s622">They were moving tremendous sizes blocks or stones or whatever from one place to another, up a mountain, down a mountain.</span> <span id="s623">It was in the winter, people came back frozen.</span> <span id="s624">They were lucky they came back frozen because they were bought from the families.</span> <span id="s625">They went and paid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount back.</span> <span id="s626">Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people.</span> <span id="s627">They didn’t want to go, they came to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they took them.</span> <span id="s628">There was no question, there was no place where to run.</span> <span id="s629">These people they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes frozen up completely, more than one.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did your father ever get called for labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: No, my father -- they called a certain amount of age groups.</span> <span id="s632">Like from 18 to 30 or something like that -- my father at that time was already fifty --, was born in 1890, so he was already 52 years old, 51.</span> <span id="s633">They wouldn’t call him; they first called the people that could do labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So the ghetto was formed -- so up to that point you managed to avoid having to go to any camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Up to that point, yes.</span> <span id="s636">That camp was eventually liquidated, burned with people in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: What was the name of that camp, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes, there were two.</span> <span id="s639">One was in Kamunka and the other was Boogerkey.</span> <span id="s640">It was in the same state like but it was a good couple hours traveling by horse and buggy if not more.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: So a typical day for you was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: My day?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I didn’t go no place.</span> <span id="s645">I had to report to the Judenrat once a week for labor there.</span> <span id="s646">They took me wherever they assigned me to go, to a factory or something.</span> <span id="s647">Very few times that I reported but I had no choice because otherwise they would take me.</span> <span id="s648">From there they would take me to the camp but once they were taken October to camp already, I didn’t report after that, I just stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s650">What was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: They also took women.</span> <span id="s652">They took my sister a few times to work.</span> <span id="s653">There was quite a -- this city was like a county seat.</span> <span id="s654">All the main offices from the German authorities were in that city, not in the other cities, was in that state like in that part of the county.</span> <span id="s655">They had police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they had all kinds of different civilian authorities.</span> <span id="s656">All these people needed labor for nothing.</span> <span id="s657">They were taking some to clean homes, offices for the Germans; they were taking women, young girls or women.</span> <span id="s658">To do heavier labor, they would take men.</span> <span id="s659">If some factory was short of some kind of labor, they’d tell the Judenrat, I need 50 people today, I need 30 people today and they would have to supply.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q Was there any violence at that time against Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, there was, but again it was on a very small scale.</span> <span id="s662">The Germans used to come at night even though there was no ghetto yet but they used to come in the Jewish section.</span> <span id="s663">They would come to a certain house and take away the silverware and other things.</span> <span id="s664">They would just come and take it.</span> <span id="s665">Some would walk in dogs and they would see a Jew with a beard, they would let the dog go and sic him or they’d catch one, they’d cut his beard off in the street.</span> <span id="s666">They wanted to beat somebody, there were cases where some people were beaten up.</span> <span id="s667">That’s why I tried not to be on the street at all, not to show myself.</span> <span id="s668">Being we lived outside, we didn’t live in the middle of the town, I could do it.</span> <span id="s669">People that live in the town had no choice because the police were there, the others were there and that’s where they were walking, day and night.</span> <span id="s670">They also had the -- it was something like nobody could have a radio.</span> <span id="s671">They went into one house and they spotted a radio.</span> <span id="s672">So they took the whole family.</span> <span id="s673">First the man that had the radio went away, they found a radio, he went out, he went away.</span> <span id="s674">They said if they don’t find him, the Jewish community would not find that man, they would kill the people from the house, this family.</span> <span id="s675">I don’t recall already what happened, did they shot the whole family or did they got the man back because word came to him about how they’re going to kill the family.</span> <span id="s676">Also later, with the fur, they caught some fur in somebody’s house and they killed the family, the whole family.</span> <span id="s677">But on a scale like, a big scale, no, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: The ghetto was formed in April?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A The ghetto was formed in April, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well they hung out posters a few weeks before that, I think it was the first week of March or something, that by April 1st all the Jews from surrounding streets which are not on the map and they included the map where the ghetto would be, have to be out.</span> <span id="s682">If they wouldn’t be out, they would be shot.</span> <span id="s683">Everything was under the threat of being shot.</span> <span id="s684">The same thing to the gentiles.</span> <span id="s685">If they lived in the parts where there’s going to be the ghetto on those streets and if they’re found there after the 1st, they would be shot.</span> <span id="s686">The majority of movement was from the outskirts in, not from the ghetto out because very few gentiles lived in the middle of the town; the majority was Jewish.</span> <span id="s687">But some of them did leave there to go out, find a place or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: So you had to leave your home, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: We had to leave our home, yes.</span> <span id="s690">We left our home and my father had an acquaintance that lived in the part that was going to be the ghetto.</span> <span id="s691">He let us have one room.</span> <span id="s692">He says we could use the kitchen together with his wife or whatever, something like that.</span> <span id="s693">Of course we had so much belongings and furniture that we couldn’t put it there.</span> <span id="s694">We had to put it in his basement, everything went in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: You were able to take most of your things?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah, you could take anything you wanted if you had where to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: You, your mother, father and sister shared a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: We shared a room, one room.</span> <span id="s699">It was like about three or four families in that building or something like that.</span> <span id="s700">Was a one-story building and a family in the basement living too.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Was this ghetto barricaded in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No, actually they had two ghettos.</span> <span id="s703">Our ghetto was on the small part, it was a very small section of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s704">It was maybe, maybe a fourth of the size of the main ghetto.</span> <span id="s705">What I say main ghetto is, there were separated by one of the main streets of the city.</span> <span id="s706">That side was separated and there was a main street running through the town from one end to the other, to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s707">The majority was on the right side of that thing and we were on the left side.</span> <span id="s708">Of course, we could not go from one to the other except during the day, certain hours.</span> <span id="s709">We were not allowed to be from six o’clock on or five, I think from six o’clock on, we were not allowed to be on the street at all.</span> <span id="s710">It was a curfew like for the Jewish people, you could not be on the street.</span> <span id="s711">If they caught you on the street you could be shot.</span> <span id="s712">In order to cross from one ghetto to the other, also you expose yourself because there was the main street.</span> <span id="s713">There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian police traffic and very seldom did I venture from here to there except on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s714">On a Sunday, the Germans did their thing home and it was like a -- there was no business going on like that.</span> <span id="s715">I ventured on a Sunday to the main ghetto and I had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: You would still report to the Judenrat office to get rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s718">Well rations were given till the ghetto.</span> <span id="s719">Like in the beginning there were rations going on.</span> <span id="s720">When the ghetto was established there was no rations for Jews, they did away with rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So food became relatively scarce?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Oh, food became a very difficult thing for some people, yes.</span> <span id="s723">People had to trade whatever they had, their belongings; would go to the edge of the ghetto and trade with the gentiles and all that.</span> <span id="s724">They would come to the fence and barter this for that but most of the people still had something.</span> <span id="s725">But then after April 1st, they started to bring into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little villages, not little villages where the Jews were killed already, from little towns.</span> <span id="s726">They didn’t want little ghettos in each town.</span> <span id="s727">Their plan was to concentrate in biggest cities so they can get to them better.</span> <span id="s728">They brought in more people and that made it worse.</span> <span id="s729">Not only just with food, there’s no place where to stay.</span> <span id="s730">People slept in hallways; it was a pity for those people that they came from outside.</span> <span id="s731">We were in already there with people, more or less established.</span> <span id="s732">But it didn’t last that long.</span> <span id="s733">It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions, they started actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: What do you remember about the actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Well, again it’s -- if I have to tell you details, it would take a long time and you’re probably going to pick something what you want from the book.</span> <span id="s736">I have it detailed exactly and it’s a fast reading book, no matter what and it’s also not so pleasant.</span> <span id="s737">I also have an account that I copied from the Memorial Book from one girl that she lives in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s738">She was actually caught on the train the same day when my sister and father, we were all taken out together from the house.</span> <span id="s739">But it’s a long story and I don’t know if you want to -- specially if you’re going to have there exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s741">You eventually were deported, the ghetto was liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: No, no, I wasn’t deported.</span> <span id="s743">From our territories they did not take any to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s744">If they would have taken maybe some people would have remained, people that could have lasted or were strong enough to survive.</span> <span id="s745">But they did not take to any concentration camps.</span> <span id="s746">They killed them right there on the spot and they had special woods, on the airfield where the airfield was built, they made mass graves there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: How did you manage to avoid the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Again, it’s a detailed story.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s750">I’ll get that from the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Mostly it’s my mother had a big part in it too.</span> <span id="s752">Probably if not for her, I don’t think I would be able to manage.</span> <span id="s753">She got into a few different situations where she knew some people and we bought our way out or something like that.</span> <span id="s754">Otherwise I’d probably be there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Had you heard about the Anslagrupen?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Of course, of course we heard about it.</span> <span id="s757">They were doing it; there were rumors just before our actions.</span> <span id="s758">There were rumors that they were doing it in the Russian territory.</span> <span id="s759">Right over the border was Russia where they’re going with those trucks and they put the exhaust systems and they take the people.</span> <span id="s760">By the time they come to where they tell them they take them, they’re half dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: What about liberation for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Well, that’s -- I was liberated by the Russian soldiers but actually taken out of a grave.</span> <span id="s763">Not just me, about eight people, we dug a grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: It’s incredible.</span> <span id="s765">You dug a grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: No, we dug a place to hide.</span> <span id="s767">We had a place to hide before for a couple weeks and then we had to come out toward the end when the Germans were retreating.</span> <span id="s768">We knew it’s a matter of days, we were in the open all the time.</span> <span id="s769">I was in the open most of the time, on a farm.</span> <span id="s770">We tried to find a place to hide between when the fronts are going to go through.</span> <span id="s771">We were discovered in one place; we didn’t want to be there.</span> <span id="s772">We dug a place where we thought nobody would be looking; then went in there.</span> <span id="s773">The next day after we went in there, the Russians came through and we did not know for two weeks.</span> <span id="s774">We did not know.</span> <span id="s775">The city was liberated already for ten days or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: You were still --?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: We were still there.</span> <span id="s778">We had prepared food and water.</span> <span id="s779">Then we had to go for water more.</span> <span id="s780">It’s a --.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Very compelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Finally we came out of the hole and the soldiers were crying.</span> <span id="s783">Was a Jewish officer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying.</span> <span id="s784">Somebody came with them that knew that we are there but they didn’t know exactly where.</span> <span id="s785">He came and he was a few hours there trying to find us in which spot.</span> <span id="s786">It was dangerous for them to be there because again, the place where I was on that farm in the village, it was the center of the Ukrainian nationalists.</span> <span id="s787">They were fighting the Russians and the Germans because the independent Ukraine lasted only three months.</span> <span id="s788">After that, the Germans annulled it.</span> <span id="s789">They were already against the Germans and special for the Russians, they were against the Russians.</span> <span id="s790">It’s a story, the liberation itself.</span> <span id="s791">It’s a separate chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: How long did you remain in your town after _________?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Not too long.</span> <span id="s794">First of all whoever we knew, the gentile people didn’t -- they were not so happy we even came, to see anybody survive.</span> <span id="s795">We had like I say about ten thousand Jewish people in this city before and there was about 50 or 60 survived from the German occupation.</span> <span id="s796">Some survived that they went to Russia; they managed to get there.</span> <span id="s797">Some survived, maybe 150 or so.</span> <span id="s798">But the few that survived, we didn’t want to be there because everything was against us.</span> <span id="s799">I managed to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the concern opened up and I met somebody that worked from before, just one person.</span> <span id="s800">She was happy to see me, it was a Russian woman, very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s801">But then again it was a problem with the army and I didn’t want to leave my mother alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Your mother survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: My father and my sister went in the first action.</span> <span id="s806">They had four.</span> <span id="s807">We went through two actions, in August and October.</span> <span id="s808">December 1st we were already out of the city.</span> <span id="s809">We went to a small village, a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: You were in labor there?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well, it was wintertime, there was no work.</span> <span id="s812">But in the spring, they kept us to work on that farm.</span> <span id="s813">From that farm I went to another farm.</span> <span id="s814">Right after I left the farm, people were killed on that farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: This is where you were carrying your sacks with pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: I remember from some of the photographs in the book where in Italy --?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I’ll show you some.</span> <span id="s819">As I say, very few pictures that I was able to save but they were in my pocket.</span> <span id="s820">Some of the pictures, this is my father, this is my sister.</span> <span id="s821">See this picture was in my wallet.</span> <span id="s822">This picture I got -- this was also in the wallet.</span> <span id="s823">This is from Italy.</span> <span id="s824">Let’s see, these I made copies of them.</span> <span id="s825">This is my father.</span> <span id="s826">This is a picture of my -- I played in a band, a school band.</span></p> <p><span
