mystery about my father, enraged me.</span> <span id="s65">I believed that God chose us to survive and we felt guilt for surviving.</span> <span id="s66">I felt I had not suffered as much as other survivers and other children of survivors and that gave guilt.</span> <span id="s67">I went to a meeting of children of survivors where I felt very comfortable and talked about some of the issues of being a child of a survivor.</span> <span id="s68">I went to a support group for 8 weeks.</span> <span id="s69">Its like finding a connection.</span> <span id="s70">It is not a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I hope my children when they are older will go to this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Survivors were allowed to survive to be witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">(very poor sound and couldnt hear one question or answer) If we discuss our sufferings then it waters down the suffering of the real survivors of camps.</span> <span id="s74">There are children who do not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s75">They want to think of themselves as Americans only.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">I never discussed my background until I hwas in my 20s and then to</span></p>
