Pomerania.</span> <span id="s8">That's near Stettin.</span> <span id="s9">Today it is Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">JF: At that time it was Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">WS:

What was the nature of his synagogue?</span> <span id="s17">Was it a very religious synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">WS: Yes.</span> <span id="s19">It was what you call here Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">JF: It was a Conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s21">And, can you tell me a little bit about the nature of the Jewish community then, when your father was the rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WS: It was a very old community.</span> <span id="s23">I don't know how long, old, but maybe at least at that time 150 to 200 years.</span> <span id="s24">I mean as a community.</span> <span id="s25">A lot of Jewish people were living in Pomerania for maybe a longer time, but they were not organized as a Gemeinde, as a congregation.</span> <span id="s26">There were many Jews in the countryside who were there for some generations already because they were settled there by mostly Frederick the Great.</span> <span id="s27">You know?</span> <span id="s28">He gave them privileges, and these were all really well rooted families there.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">JF: And the center of the religious life was the synagogue that your father was the rabbi of?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">JF: Was it the only synagogue in this town, or were there others?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">WS: In the town, yes, no, we had only about 400 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JF: 400 Jews in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WS: In the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">JF: About how large was the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">WS: And there was a big district for my father.</span> <span id="s37">He had other small towns, two thousand...</span></p> <p><span id="s38">JF: Did he visit...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WS: The towns, small towns were maybe left 10, 20 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">JF: Did he visit those towns...</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JF: Or did those people come...</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s44">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JF: He visited them.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WS: Two or three times a year he visits them and he performed all the weddings, funerals, and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: Did they also come into your town for holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s49">Sometimes they came, at least the children.</span> <span id="s50">The children, when they grow up they came to town and went to the school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JF: There was a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WS: No, only religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JF: The religious school.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">JF: You're talking about a cheder or a different kind of religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WS: We had a cantor, too.</span> <span id="s57">He gave also lessons in Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s58">You have not to forget the whole situation in Germany was different from here.</span> <span id="s59">The schools weren't religious.</span> <span id="s60">I mean the general schools, not as here.</span> <span id="s61">And so the religious lessons were given in that school, wherever it was, say grammar school.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">JF: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WS: And Religion performances came under yearly, wie sagt man, Zeugnis [report], also; here they get tests, eh?</span> <span id="s64">Also in the examination, on the end of the term.</span> <span id="s65">This was also state controlled, and my father got paid for that by the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: So your father was teaching in the German public system.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WS: Not in the public schools.</span> <span id="s68">In the public schools, you know, as it happened, were very few.</span> <span id="s69">This was different from here, too, because you have to pay fees.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JF: So you're not...</span></p> <p><span id="s71">WS: The higher schools were not free.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">JF: You're, you're...</span></p> <p><span id="s73">WS: And since you didn't have, we had maybe ten children who didn't go in the higher schools, and they were in the public schools, hmm?</span> <span id="s74">The other people were well off and they sent, they sent their children to the higher class schools.</span> <span id="s75">There's also a difference from here.</span> <span id="s76">You cannot understand that.</span> <span id="s77">I don't know if that has changed today.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">JF: In other words...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WS: Then you would go in the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s80">This was for the boys, and the Lyzeum was for the girls.</span> <span id="s81">Was also completely separate for boys and girls.</span> <span id="s82">We didn't go together.</span> <span id="s83">And the parents had to pay fees for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JF: They did not have to pay fees for the lower schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WS: No, the lower schools were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">JF: And was the religion taught also in the lower schools or not until the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WS: Yeah, but not the Jews.</span> <span id="s88">The Jewish religion there were not enough.</span> <span id="s89">They came on Sunday to the synagogue and got the lessons there.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JF: Was religion taught at all in the lower schools?</span> <span id="s91">Was Christiani-, eh, Christian religion taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WS: Yeah, Christian was taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">JF: And what happened to the Jewish children during those lessons?</span> <span id="s94">Did they have to attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WS: They had off.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JF: They had off?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">JF: They were not to...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WS: We, too, when the class had a Christian religion, we were off.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">JF: And, then, once the years of the Gymnasium and the Lyzeum started, then the Jewish children also had religious instruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WS: Yeah, in the same school, but, say, in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s103">So your father was involved in teaching through the synagogue and also in the Gymnasium and Lyzeum.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s106">What was the Jewish community in your town like?</span> <span id="s107">Did they live in the same area...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">JF: Or were they scattered throughout the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WS: Throughout the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JF: Living among the non-Jewish population.</span> <span id="s112">What kind of experience did you have with the non-Jewish population in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WS: Everybody came along very well with everybody.</span> <span id="s114">The whole thing, I mean, of course, there were sometimes, one might say, "Dirty Jew," or something.</span> <span id="s115">It happened, but nothing else.</span> <span id="s116">You see, I grew up with, this is also very difficult to explain here [unclear] because you don't know this whole kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JF: Explain to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WS: You know, in Pomerania or what we called Ostelbien.</span> <span id="s119">You heard this word?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JF: Say it again, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WS: You know the river Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WS: This was a remarkable boundary, I would say, and in a way it was a kind of Schimpfwort, as a kind of curse when I say Ostelbien.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">JF: Ost.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">WS: East.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JF: East of the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WS: East of the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">WS: That was a word you could read every day in the paper when the commentaries were, the reports about the Reichstag.</span> <span id="s130">You know the Reichstag?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">WS: This was the parliament.</span> <span id="s133">And the Oste the so-called Ostelbien, they were the people who ruled in a way.</span> <span id="s134">What I would say that really did, Germany, under the Wilhelmdem Zweiten, fine, the last emperor.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WS: There were the so-called Junker [titled landowners in Prussian territories].</span> <span id="s137">Did you hear that word?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WS: That word is not to explain to nobody.</span> <span id="s140">Also there is no in German explanation for that.</span> <span id="s141">This was the Adel [peerage], the nobles, the barons and counts.</span> <span id="s142">And there they mostly lived, they had their big estates.</span> <span id="s143">Big, big estates.</span> <span id="s144">Mostly in Pomerania, in Brandenburg; that is a province, Brandenburg.</span> <span id="s145">This was Berlin included, and East Prussia, East and West Prussia.</span> <span id="s146">And these kind of people was completely conservative.</span> <span id="s147">And in a way, in a way, I say that, they were a little antisemitic.</span> <span id="s148">But they didn't hate any Jew.</span> <span id="s149">They were friendly with the Jews; they had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">JF: They were antisemitic, but they were friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">WS: The only thing was, in the politics.</span> <span id="s152">But, when you come back to the whole roots, and later they confessed it, it was their fault, going back hundred and hundred-fifty years.</span> <span id="s153">And they only said, the Jews, they needed a scapegoat for something when it happened.</span> <span id="s154">And they tried to stop the influence of Jewish in politics.</span> <span id="s155">That was their reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: Did you have any contacts with any of the people in the Junker group?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: What was that contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WS: They were in my classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: The children of these people were in your classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s162">We grew up, and we have this conscience already when we grow up.</span> <span id="s163">You see, and then, also, now, of course, comes something else.</span> <span id="s164">The Jew is always, always, in the roots, in his roots, religious roots, with the underdog.</span> <span id="s165">So the Jewish, when a Jew came in politics, he was either a Social-Democrat or a Democrat.</span> <span id="s166">And that what was what they didn't like.</span> <span id="s167">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">JF: They didn't like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WS: They didn't like that, and they always said the Jews are, always on the Left Side.</span> <span id="s170">But wasn't right.</span> <span id="s171">There was a lot of Jews that were Right.</span> <span id="s172">Mmm?</span> <span id="s173">Like the big bankers and so they were on the right side.</span> <span id="s174">You have not to forget that the founder of the Conservative Party, eh, about 100 years ago, was a Jew.</span> <span id="s175">Stahl, huh?</span> <span id="s176">You heard the name Stahl.</span> <span id="s177">I forgot his first name.</span> <span id="s178">He was the founder, with their people.</span> <span id="s179">But they used us in politics; that was the only thing.</span> <span id="s180">They didn't have anything against the Jews, and I was very, very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s181">And there is another thing, but that is notorious.</span> <span id="s182">I mean, famous in all the books.</span> <span id="s183">They were mixed by marriage with Jews.</span> <span id="s184">Mostly the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">JF: They would marry Jewish women?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">WS: They marry Jewish women mostly because they were rich, or they had a connection, or were the daughter of a big banker.</span> <span id="s187">And, you know, that is in all the historical books that Bismarck already said a mixture between, how you say it, between a Jewish steed with a, no, I forgot, I cannot, the mixture between, a Prussian Hengst.</span> <span id="s188">Hengst is a, is a, a horse, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">JF: A horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WS: With a Jewish steed.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: A mare?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JF: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">WS: That is a good mixture.</span> <span id="s195">He said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JF: Bismarck said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WS: Yeah, Bismarck said that.</span> <span id="s198">And so they were never Nazis; this was one of the reasons.</span> <span id="s199">Because they were all, as we called it, verjudet, hum [full of Jewish blood].</span> <span id="s200">They didn't have real pure Aryan blood.</span> <span id="s201">And they knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">JF: The Junker class.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">WS: Yeah, the Junker class.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">JF: In particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">WS: And I would say 40% at least were mixed blood.</span> <span id="s206">So all these people were never Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">JF: These people were never Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">WS: Never.</span> <span id="s209">Of course, there were some, and then was another reason.</span> <span id="s210">You know, under the Kaiser, a Jew couldn't become officer in the army.</span> <span id="s211">There were countries in Germany, I think in Bavaria or Würtemburg, or so, where the Jews could become Reserve Leutnant [second lieutenant].</span> <span id="s212">As a Lieutenant of the Reserve forces.</span> <span id="s213">But there was another reason, and there, this also was something what them offended.</span> <span id="s214">The Jews shouldn't go in the army, huh?</span> <span id="s215">This was only reserved for their class.</span> <span id="s216">But, there was another reason that it never came through, also in the Republik, under that, after the Revolution of 1918.</span> <span id="s217">Jews, in the whole, in the whole army, I didn't even know, there were so much, were eleven Jews in the whole Reichswehr, under the Republik, were eleven Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JF: Eleven Jews totally?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">WS: Four hundred thousand men; four hundred thousand men.</span> <span id="s220">This was in all papers, and one I knew myself.</span> <span id="s221">There were only eleven Jews in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JF: You're talking about during the Weimar Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s224">And now I come to the reason why.</span> <span id="s225">The Jews didn't want that job.</span> <span id="s226">The Jews were not going for officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">WS: You see...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">WS: Now, the Jew isn't mostly–are not militant.</span> <span id="s231">And then comes something else.</span> <span id="s232">Most Jews, I would say most, not all, go out for money.</span> <span id="s233">They want, and they come in life as an officer, they didn't have a chance.</span> <span id="s234">The same thing was with the judges.</span> <span id="s235">There were very, very few judges.</span> <span id="s236">I would say during, during the Monarchy, I don't know the exact number, but I would say no more than twenty Jewish judges.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">JF: Was this due to the German law, or was this...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">WS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">JF: Due to German law, or Jewish decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">WS: They couldn't become law.</span> <span id="s241">And the reason is not, or at least not alone, is that they didn't want the Jews.</span> <span id="s242">They just didn't want the job.</span> <span id="s243">You see, when there was a good lawyer, or a man who had good credits [or good marks] after his examination, he didn't go for a judge.</span> <span id="s244">Because when he was good, he settled down as a lawyer.</span> <span id="s245">He could make five, four, four, five times more money than as a judge.</span> <span id="s246">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s247">Also in the, after the Monarchy, very very few.</span> <span id="s248">This was not the reason that they were not accepted.</span> <span id="s249">But they didn't come for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JF: Let me back up for a minute.</span> <span id="s251">When you were talking about the intermarriage that took place among the Junker class, was there any sense in these homes of Jewish connection?</span> <span id="s252">Where the mother was Jewish and the father was German Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">WS: Uh, I couldn't tell you that exactly.</span> <span id="s254">But mostly it was that they got baptized anyway, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JF: So, that the Jewish mate would convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">WS: And it may be, or I would say, in cases where I know, that is that the family of that, say the family, the parents or so of that woman or girl were already baptized or left the Jewish religion in some way, huh?</span> <span id="s257">I wouldn't know one single case where, I mean, I know, I would actually say I don't know any case where the family of that people still were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">JF: What was your father's feeling about these intermarriages?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">WS: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">JF: What was your father's feeling about the rate of intermarriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">WS: I would say that no one from the congregation or the circle of my father got that way.</span> <span id="s262">They came from other.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JF: So this was outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">WS: And this was already a generation before, I would say.</span> <span id="s265">That happened in the end of the last century when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">JF: What about the degree of assimilation in your town among the Jewish people?</span> <span id="s267">Was this an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">WS: What you mean by assimilation?</span> <span id="s269">This is also a word I would say that I hate.</span> <span id="s270">Because it is always twisted around.</span> <span id="s271">Now what is assimilation?</span> <span id="s272">Assimilation is to get, to get assimilated to your environment.</span> <span id="s273">You have to do that everywhere.</span> <span id="s274">You see we had to do that when we came to China?</span> <span id="s275">You have to settle down for the climate, for the food, for everything, hmm?</span> <span id="s276">And you have to go used to the custom of the people where you’re living.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">WS: Where, in this assimilation, in the way it is used mostly by Jews starts, is that you give up your Jewish things for this, or beside of it, that you can stay as a Jew.</span> <span id="s279">No?</span> <span id="s280">Of course, when people come and say, we have certain cases, we had lawyers, Jewish lawyers, they were partly prominent in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s281">But on the outside, they are negating their Jewish things.</span> <span id="s282">For instance, there came up a court session on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s283">And they were afraid to tell the judge.</span> <span id="s284">The judge would do it.</span> <span id="s285">And they did it.</span> <span id="s286">Then you said that day, "I cannot.</span> <span id="s287">Can you postpone it on another day?</span> <span id="s288">Because it is Yom Kippur."</span> <span id="s289">They are afraid.</span> <span id="s290">They are ashamed.</span> <span id="s291">They thought the judge would know they are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">JF: Was that a common example?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">WS: Yes.</span> <span id="s294">This is what I call assimilation in the worst way.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">JF: Was this a common example of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">WS: It was not a common, but, I would say, I know two or three people who did that.</span> <span id="s297">Mostly they came in the synagogue, and they came after or before that in the synagogue, but they wouldn't tell the judge, "Postpone that."</span> <span id="s298">We had in the last, last couple of years a one, this was a lawyer, he did that, and he had a son.</span> <span id="s299">The son still lives here, and he's much younger than I am.</span> <span id="s300">He's a professor here somewhere in America.</span> <span id="s301">First of all, I think, it was the only case I remember.</span> <span id="s302">He did not have him circumcised.</span> <span id="s303">It was the first.</span> <span id="s304">And that boy, this was the only boy I remember.</span> <span id="s305">He went on with, to school on the holidays.</span> <span id="s306">But this was the only case I can remember.</span> <span id="s307">And as far as I know, he is, he is still not a Jew.</span> <span id="s308">I hear sometimes from other people about him.</span> <span id="s309">Maybe he is, he is married, I think, but I don't know, to a Jewish girl or not.</span> <span id="s310">But mostly this kind of assimilation we didn't have.</span> <span id="s311">And this was very seldom.</span> <span id="s312">There also when Jewish men got married to non-Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s313">There we had two or three cases in our community in the congregation.</span> <span id="s314">They became Jewish, the girls.</span> <span id="s315">And I know one case

id="s370">And they found out, oder [or] they thought they found out, that the Jewish soldiers were not all on the, on the front, on the fighting line, but were sitting in offices and some–and they made a so-called Juden Zählung [account of Jews].</span> <span id="s371">That means they counted the Jews.</span> <span id="s372">This was official.</span> <span id="s373">They counted the Jews who were working or had jobs in the Army, not on the, they say in, in offices, in hospitals and so.</span> <span id="s374">And this was the first spark they put in the population.</span> <span

something with the German, I, I always was thinking what makes the German people so different from all other peoples?</span> <span id="s379">I would say only in German-, in Europe, hmm?</span> <span id="s380">The German people is especially, I would say, separate in their thinking, in thinking that they always look when something happens that the other, that it’s the other’s fault.</span> <span id="s381">They, and see, that is, I mean, this is a little aside maybe from what you're talking.</span> <span id="s382">That is also the different position between Christianity and Judaism.</span> <span id="s383">You see, every Jew when was happened always said, "My God, what did I do?"</span> <span id="s384">The German will never say that.</span> <span id="s385">Or the Christian.</span> <span id="s386">They, they are put the fault on somebody else.</span> <span id="s387">Whatever happens, the Jew will always say, "Was my fault what happened?</span> <span id="s388">I get punished from God."</span> <span id="s389">The Ger-, so this is, and the roots, I would say that this is a part of the explanation for the whole thing happened.</span> <span id="s390">They're always looking around who did it.</span> <span id="s391">And under themselves, under themselves the German always looks for somebody who is to blame for.</span> <span id="s392">And that is the whole thing with, I would say, that was the possibility that Hitler had the chance to come to power.</span> <span id="s393">He had the whole people, and he knew that.</span> <span id="s394">That everybody would, there is a whole thing with the Jews, in my opinion, was not exactly antisemitic.</span> <span id="s395">It is clear, and maybe you think it's ridiculous when I say such a thing.</span> <span id="s396">He would

say, was your last two years of school.</span> <span id="s422">You're talking about what years now?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WS: Mmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">JF: What years are we talking about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">WS: Now we, I would say we are talking about the period, or about the difference between two periods.</span> <span id="s426">You see, during the Monarchy, and this I know all, too, from experience, the Jewish religion and the Jewish community was recognized by the State.</span> <span id="s427">This is also very difficult to understand here, because you have here, the separation of church and state.</span> <span id="s428">There, synagogue was a stately-by-law-recognized institution.</span> <span id="s429">For instance, every rabbi must be confirmed by the government.</span> <span id="s430">In the community they could choose him from so many rabbis, but when they have chosen him, before they gave him the office, the government had to give its seal, to seal it.</span> <span id="s431">This was only one thing.</span> <span id="s432">The Jewish, the lessons, everything, the school, Jewish school, it was supervised the same way as the other schools.</span> <span id="s433">And when anything happened, the Jews were represented as from the community, was through the rabbi.</span> <span id="s434">For instance, and I remember this so very well; I was a child at that time.</span> <span id="s435">I can remember that.</span> <span id="s436">The Kaiser, I mean, William II, came to our town for some reason.</span> <span id="s437">There was a church, yeah, a big church was really consecrated.</span> <span id="s438">This was for some years renovation or so.</span> <span id="s439">And the Emperor came.</span> <span id="s440">My father was invited.</span> <span id="s441">He was in the church.</span> <span id="s442">And he got a card, a ticket for my mother.</span> <span id="s443">They sit in the first row!</span> <span id="s444">In the first row the Kaiser came in.</span> <span id="s445">This was only for the dignitaries of the town.</span> <span id="s446">And my father was invited to the dinner.</span> <span id="s447">There was a state dinner for the Emperor.</span> <span id="s448">The Emperor didn't attend in the last minute because he had other things to do, but it was in his honor, and remarkable.</span> <span id="s449">With the invitation, he was the only Jew who attended.</span> <span id="s450">With the invitation, he got a small notice that says, “We have provided for you a kosher meal!”</span> <span id="s451">But this was impossible in the Republik.</span> <span id="s452">After the Kaiser was gone, nobody cared for the Jews.</span> <span id="s453">And there were big scandals.</span> <span id="s454">I remember in Brannschweig, where also standing was Hindenburg for a state visit.</span> <span id="s455">And the rabbi, who was the so-called Landesrabbiner [regional rabbi] was not invited.</span> <span id="s456">And there was a church of the Socialists.</span> <span id="s457">And now I come to something else.</span> <span id="s458">The Socialists were more antisemitic than the Junkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">WS: You know, the Socialists were more or less atheists.</span> <span id="s461">They were against the Church, but they said, eh, this is very difficult to explain, and this is also, I would say, I have talked to many people about that.</span> <span id="s462">I only read here recently a book from a Socialist.</span> <span id="s463">He tried to blame his own party.</span> <span id="s464">He was a big man.</span> <span id="s465">He was in Bavaria, Minister-president, and he was in the Reichstag before the Nazis.</span> <span id="s466">Is a very interesting book.</span> <span id="s467">He doesn't come to that point.</span> <span id="s468">But he says, where the Socialist Party did, eh, not function.</span> <span id="s469">And he is right.</span> <span id="s470">But he doesn't come to all of it.</span> <span id="s471">This was one point where the Socialists were thinking, not, "The Jews?</span> <span id="s472">O.K. They're more dangerous than the other one, huh?"</span> <span id="s473">They can't even understand it.</span> <span id="s474">I have to give you a whole lecture about this, because I have talked to so many Socialists in my life.</span> <span id="s475">And I tried to get down to it, to the deeps of their soul.</span> <span id="s476">They were thinking of the Christians.</span> <span id="s477">This was a, I think that's, this, yeah, they couldn't do anything about, but they were feeling the Jews as a spiritual sect.</span> <span id="s478">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s479">It's very difficult to understand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">JF: They were seeing the Jews as a spiritual?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s482">The Jewish religion.</span>

church.</span> <span id="s494">Not only, maybe not so much, O.K., but as their, they had their weddings, huh?</span> <span id="s495">When the daughters were married they went to church.</span> <span id="s496">They didn't talk about, huh, I think, the Party shouldn’t know that, huh?</span> <span id="s497">Or they had them baptized, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">JF: Do you mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s499">WS: The Party said you shouldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">JF: They saw the Jewish religion as more spiritual than the Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">WS: In a spiritual way, dangerous for the Socialist thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">JF: Why?</span> <span id="s503">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">WS: Yeah, in a way they are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">WS: They are, then I have to go back to [laughs] to the word “Jewish-religious thinking.”</span></p> <p><span id="s507">JF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">WS: They were not quite wrong.</span> <span id="s509">They were not really wrong.</span> <span id="s510">This is, you see, the, there is as much, I mean for the thinking.</span> <span id="s511">You always have this when a very real intellectual Jew comes to thinking, and has conflicts in his thinking.</span> <span id="s512">He has all the choice.</span> <span id="s513">Especially I know a lot of children, both, male and female, from rabbis, very Orthodox rabbis, who got Communist all of a sudden, because they’re fanatics.</span> <span id="s514">Their fathers were real Orthodox.</span> <span id="s515">So when they couldn't do that, because their thinking wouldn't go with that, they became Communists, in the contrary.</span> <span id="s516">They went to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">JF: But it was still with a great deal of fanaticism.</span> <span id="s518">Is what you are saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">JF: But what I'm not clear on what you're saying about the Socialists, why did they see the Jews as more dangerous than the Christians?</span></p> <p><span

cautious about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">JF: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">WS: But I can only tell you because I have talked to many, many, I would say, leading at that time.</span> <span id="s527">Socialists.</span> <span id="s528">And they didn't speak up right away, but I saw them hiding something.</span> <span id="s529">And on the roots of the deep of their thinking there was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">WS: They were feeling, the religious Jew, not exactly Orthodox, they were keeping away other thinking people from their party.</span> <span id="s532">But they were not so afraid from their, about their, the teaching of the Christian counterpart.</span> <span id="s533">You can see something of what I mean.</span> <span id="s534">It is very difficult in a few words to explain.</span> <span id="s535">And there were other reasons.</span> <span id="s536">There were other reasons.</span> <span id="s537">They had Jews in the party, very few, but I would say five or six, and this, this is maybe also very remarkable, because nobody in my recollection has brought that point up.</span> <span id="s538">These Jews were atheists.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">JF: These Jews were atheists.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">WS: Completely atheists, eh?</span> <span id="s541">Intellectual Jews.</span> <span

There, there, I mean really, you know, the State and the Church were not separated.</span> <span id="s548">And they got always, but only the Christians, under the Monarchy, state subsidiaries from the tax money.</span> <span id="s549">By a kind of a key they got so much and so much.</span> <span id="s550">Not the Jews.</span> <span id="s551">The Jews didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s552">They had only to live by their own taxing, but this taxing was collected by the state.</span> <span id="s553">This was collected by the state.</span> <span id="s554">Was the also the money.</span> <span

now we will also have our money."</span> <span id="s557">They didn't give them it.</span> <span id="s558">There was no equality.</span> <span id="s559">They, the same status was left over from the Monarchy.</span> <span id="s560">They didn't give the Jews something from the State, with some exceptions that came later.</span> <span id="s561">And this was, there never came a law, was never made

from my house.</span> <span id="s899">This was a corner house, and there was a station, and a shop, Jewish store.</span> <span id="s900">And first of all, I heard the crash.</span> <span id="s901">I didn't go out.</span> <span id="s902">But after two minutes I heard another crash a street down.</span> <span id="s903">And there was another.</span> <span id="s904">And there was a grocery store, a

the crying, there something.</span> <span id="s911">And the next morning I knew then, the next morning, that all the synagogues were burning, but not all.</span> <span id="s912">Some they left.</span> <span id="s913">This was all done by a fixed plan.</span> <span id="s914">Synagogues that were under historical protection, they didn't burn.</span> <span id="s915">They didn't burn the oldest synagogue in Berlin in the Heidereutergasse–they didn't burn it, and they didn't another one, and one they were, they were, I don't know how that happened.</span> <span id="s916">This were in the [unclear].</span> <span id="s917">They started the fire and by some mistake the fire brigade was right there.</span> <span id="s918">And they were afraid and ran away.</span> <span id="s919">So that synagogue also was untouched.</span> <span id="s920">And then somebody called us from our friends, and said, "We are going to go out.</span> <span id="s921">The Gestapo is rounding up all the men."</span> <span id="s922">But my father and I, we said, "No, where we should go?"</span> <span id="s923">And they [unclear].</span> <span id="s924">And they didn't get us.</span> <span id="s925">And the reason was, first they got only the rich people.</span> <span id="s926">The rich.</span> <span id="s927">We were not rich.</span> <span id="s928">And this was all by a special purpose.</span> <span id="s929">When the people, they put them in the concentration camp, but in these camps, where they rounded up on that day the people, they were not so harsh and rough with the people they had taken before.</span> <span id="s930">Because they wanted something from them.</span> <span id="s931">Mostly they put some papers before them and said, "Sign here."</span> <span id="s932">The paper said they'd give them their house, or their business, and so on.</span> <span id="s933">And I would say on average was nobody longer there as a week or so.</span> <span id="s934">In some ways they got out because they had to pay.</span> <span id="s935">They had to pay, how they say, through the nose.</span> <span id="s936">Some people lost everything.</span> <span id="s937">And this was the reason.</span> <span id="s938">That was the whole reason.</span> <span id="s939">And, but also it's not so very well known here is that the most and biggest money they got from the insurance.</span> <span id="s940">You know that?</span> <span id="s941">The, all the insurance companies had to pay.</span> <span id="s942">You know that the insurance companies in that week were nearly for the bankrupt.</span> <span id="s943">I forgot how many they have to pay.</span> <span id="s944">These were I forgot– Especially today because the figures are so different from 40 years ago, or 50.</span> <span id="s945">I think 40 or 60 million dollars.</span> <span id="s946">The insurance company had to pay on the state, to the state.</span> <span id="s947">They were forbidden to pay it to the Jew.</span> <span id="s948">But they had to pay it to the government.</span> <span id="s949">And that was the thing they wanted.</span> <span id="s950">They were at that time really at the end, on the end of all their wits.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">JF: They were on the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">WS: Of their wits.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">JF: Of their wits.</span> <span id="s954">Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">WS: They didn't have any money, because they had all put the money in, so they needed all the money.</span> <span id="s956">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s957">And that is also in connection with that, with that optimistic people.</span> <span id="s958">You know, I knew a lot of non-Jews before, higher ranking people in the government and so, and when I sometimes met them, we were talking.</span> <span id="s959">They always says, "Wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s960">I know exactly, three more months and that's over.</span> <span id="s961">They are finished."</span> <span id="s962">And they were talking and talking, then I met some after four months.</span> <span id="s963">I said, "I, I, I, yah, it isn't

class.</span> <span id="s1356">The only thing what they did, this was as it was on all German ships at that time, they had an officer of the Nazi Party on there.</span> <span id="s1357">He was some steward.</span> <span id="s1358">He was the head of the Party, head of the Party, from, Ship "Gneisenau" was his title.</span> <span id="s1359">And he, the only thing what he made, the first officer told me that, he, in the swimming pool were different times for the Jews, different times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">JF: This was because of this Nazi officer?</span> <span id="s1361">He...</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">WS: This Nazi guy.</span> <span id="s1363">And he wanted many other things and the captain had told him when he doesn't keep shut his mouth, he will bring him for a trial, because he is the commander of the ship, and he has not to take orders from an underling.</span> <span id="s1364">The first officer told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">JF: So the only thing that was accomplished were the different swimming times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">WS: Yeah because there were just 50-50.</span> <span id="s1367">Fifty percent were Jews, fifty.</span> <span id="s1368">So we had some people.</span> <span id="s1369">We had the admiral on the ship, was a German admiral from the German Navy.</span> <span id="s1370">He was a rear admiral or something.</span> <span id="s1371">And he mingled always with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1372">And that guy came always, to shout his disgust, to swim with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span

pool, he was a Communist.</span> <span id="s1376">He told me.</span> <span id="s1377">And he told me, this was so.</span> <span id="s1378">The Jews had the first time, and then came the Aryani.</span> <span id="s1379">And he told me, "You think I let out the water after the Jews; I can’t bathe in that water!"</span> <span id="s1380">[laughs] But we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1381">There was only one guy under the passengers, but he didn't mingle with anybody.</span> <span id="s1382">This was a Nazi taking orders.</span> <span id="s1383">He was from Sudetendeutschland.</span> <span id="s1384">And he won this trip from Hitler.</span> <span id="s1385">He was a big member, and you know the Sudetendeutschland what it is, what it means, Sudetan Deutschland, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1386">He was a kind of a leader and he won this.</span> <span id="s1387">He was a very low class guy.</span> <span id="s1388">This was the only one.</span> <span id="s1389">Nobody cared about him.</span> <span id="s1390">He didn't even sit on the captain's table.</span> <span id="s1391">Some people told me he was very angry about it that they didn't put him on the table.</span> <span id="s1392">And the only thing what I regretted on that ship was that it made it so fast.</span> <span id="s1393">This was the fastest ship at that time.</span> <span id="s1394">We made it in 23 days.</span> <span id="s1395">We had very few stops.</span> <span id="s1396">We stopped only in, the first stop was in, now what, eh, Port Said, and we were only the night.</span> <span id="s1397">We didn't go down.</span> <span id="s1398">This was a..</span> <span id="s1399">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Tape two, side two</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">JF: You were telling me where the ship stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1403">After Port Said we sailed to non-stop to Ceylon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">JF: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">WS: No, we didn't even stop in India.</span> <span id="s1406">After Ceylon, then we stopped, Singapore...</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">JF: You went...</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">WS: No, first we stopped in, yeah, Singapore, and then in Manila and Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1409">And the only thing what happened on the way was we could always go from the ship.</span> <span id="s1410">But when we came to Hong Kong, they didn't let us go, and I heard this already, overheard it in the night; it was so hot.</span> <span id="s1411">And we came in the night, in the middle of the night we came to Hong Kong, by the way, one of the most beautiful places in the world.</span> <span id="s1412">And I was going on, I was the only one, I went up on the deck and was sleeping there, on a deck chair, and I saw the sunrise.</span> <span id="s1413">It was out of the world.</span> <span id="s1414">When you haven't seen it, you haven't seen nothing, and that's where, the sun comes out over Hong Kong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">JF: Why didn't they let you get off in Hong Kong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">WS: Yeah, and then when the sun was out, I heard when the British came and brought the British commission, and they were talking to the first officer.</span> <span id="s1417">I stood up on the deck, and they were talking down.</span> <span id="s1418">And I heard something, which I knew already, and he told them the story, and that a family had left the ship illegally in Manila.</span> <span id="s1419">And he told him that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">JF: Ano-, from another ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">WS: From mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">JF: Oh, from your ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">WS: From our ship.</span> <span id="s1424">I knew the people.</span> <span id="s1425">And when we sailed off Manila they were missing.</span> <span id="s1426">These were four people.</span> <span id="s1427">Two couples of a, they were related.</span> <span id="s1428">One was the brother from the other lady or so some.</span> <span id="s1429">And they had their nephew there.</span> <span id="s1430">And he said he can stay here with me.</span> <span id="s1431">And they stayed, but they found out, and they were illegal.</span> <span id="s1432">And they came one day after we came, they were already back in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1433">But the company has to pay for that.</span> <span id="s1434">It's the rule.</span> <span id="s1435">That's the rule of the sea.</span> <span id="s1436">When people like that skip the ship, the company has to pay for their transportation because they are responsible.</span> <span id="s1437">So when they Norddeutsche Lloyd had to pay their transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">JF: So that's why the company wouldn't let you disembark in Hong Kong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1440">So they told the British officer what happened.</span> <span id="s1441">So they decided that everybody with a "J", you know we had the "J" in the passport, cannot leave the ship.</span> <span id="s1442">So, but we didn't stay so long and this wouldn't be worthwhile to leave the ship because we were in a rush.</span> <span id="s1443">You see, we sailed during monsoon time.</span> <span id="s1444">You know monsoon time?</span> <span id="s1445">There is a straight wind that comes from Africa across the Pacific, and that makes the ships going about two days quicker than normal.</span> <span id="s1446">And they had to keep up their schedule.</span> <span id="s1447">We were only, na, ja, also, we came in the night.</span> <span id="s1448">We came about twelve hours.</span> <span id="s1449">We were twelve hours there, but during the day we wouldn't really have much time to go out from the ship.</span> <span id="s1450">So they didn't let us go.</span> <span id="s1451">This was the only thing what happened.</span> <span id="s1452">But when we then came to Shanghai, you see, I'm, maybe I am exceptional, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1453">And most people was already on the ship moaning, "Ohhh, it was terrible, now it's over and we come to Shanghai."</span> <span id="s1454">And I say, "The, what, what what is it?</span> <span id="s1455">What can happen?</span> <span id="s1456">Let's see."</span> <span id="s1457">And the change from the looks of the liner to Shanghai, that is an experience, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">JF: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1460">I will.</span> <span id="s1461">It was very difficult to explain this to somebody who didn't see.</span> <span id="s1462">You see, I came from the ship.</span> <span id="s1463">I had already a cousin there.</span> <span id="s1464">That was, by the way, one of the reasons why I went.</span> <span id="s1465">He went about six weeks before me, and he wrote back and said, "It is not so bad, and people say come here."</span> <span id="s1466">So I went.</span> <span id="s1467">And he, he came with all his family to the ship to greet me.</span> <span id="s1468">And we went down.</span> <span id="s1469">And you see as it is when you're three weeks on a ship, we were three weeks on a ship, I, I like it.</span> <span id="s1470">I would like three months on a ship.</span> <span id="s1471">But you will go a little bit, hmm?</span> <span id="s1472">You will exercise your legs.</span> <span id="s1473">So we went.</span> <span id="s1474">And as always, in all cities of the world, wherever it is, the part, the district on the harbor is always a dirty district.</span> <span id="s1475">You know that.</span> <span id="s1476">So it was very dirty there, and the people were begging.</span> <span id="s1477">But after about five or ten minutes, I stumbled about something.</span> <span id="s1478">This was wrapped in straw.</span> <span id="s1479">And my cousin said, "Eh, don't look at that."</span> <span id="s1480">I, I knew already what it was.</span> <span id="s1481">It was a dead body.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">JF: Wrapped in straw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">WS: Mmm.</span> <span id="s1484">Was a dead body.</span> <span id="s1485">I, but I didn't get afraid because I, I was awaiting something like that.</span> <span id="s1486">You, but after all I had read about Shanghai and the Far East.</span> <span id="s1487">So, I would say I came in the home, huh?</span> <span id="s1488">In a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s1489">First we, all, everybody came there, so I said, "Form a school."</span> <span id="s1490">And now you have also to keep in mind that that was [phone rings], you have to keep in mind, that that was just two years, or not quite two years after the Japanese invasion.</span> <span id="s1491">You remember that after the incident on the Marco Polo Bridge and everything?</span> <span id="s1492">And they had occupied Hong Kew [also spelled Hong Kyu or Hung-K’ou], this part of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1493">And there was much, much destroyed.</span> <span id="s1494">I would say one third of all the houses were burned down.</span> <span id="s1495">This was a terrible situation when you're coming right from the first class of this luxury liner.</span> <span id="s1496">And on the way from the ship, this was maybe to walk twenty, twenty-five minutes, I stumbled at least over five, six, kind of bodies.</span> <span id="s1497">And the, the Chinese are so, they are real poor, the Chinese.</span> <span id="s1498">They cannot bury their dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">JF: So they wrap...</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">WS: So they wrap them up and put them on the street.</span> <span id="s1501">They wrap...</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">JF: They are wrapped in straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">JF: And they just lie on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">WS: Street.</span> <span id="s1506">And they pick them up, like, they have special cars for that, a special department, sanitary, where they come and pick them up.</span> <span id="s1507">And as far as I know, they also make for every, mostly they put also name on when they know who it is, from the family, they put on a label with a name.</span> <span id="s1508">But everybody they find will be a, will have an autopsy.</span> <span id="s1509">They make out of the cannot be a crime, hmm?</span> <span id="s1510">So they make that.</span> <span id="s1511">So we were walking.</span> <span id="s1512">And my cousin was so afraid.</span> <span id="s1513">He was always looking at me.</span> <span id="s1514">I say, "You can't look at me like that.</span> <span id="s1515">I am not afraid.</span> <span id="s1516">I will tell you something.</span> <span id="s1517">I'm convinced that half of them died already of cholera."</span> <span id="s1518">It was the worst months in Shanghai, July.</span> <span id="s1519">This was the worst month with cholera.</span> <span id="s1520">There were about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">JF: Cholera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1523">There were about, in that month were about, Shanghai alone, two to three thousand cases of cholera.</span> <span id="s1524">When you imagine that here in America somebody says, "There is in San Francisco a case of cholera," everybody would tremble here, hmm?</span> <span id="s1525">And there, I got used to that in five minutes.</span> <span id="s1526">And there were people who never, never, never who could overcome this, never.</span> <span id="s1527">I, I knew a lot of people, I would say maybe five percent of the immigrants, who never left their district.</span> <span id="s1528">The nearest [unclear] they never left.</span> <span id="s1529">They were so afraid in all the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">JF: The cholera was in this, primarily in Hong Kew, in this section?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1532">These kind of things happened mostly in the poorer regions of the city, but on the other hand, they had very, very fine districts there.</span> <span id="s1533">Shanghai you have, when you read that book, you will mostly I think I can always.</span> <span id="s1534">I give you that book.</span> <span id="s1535">You can have it, hmm?</span> <span id="s1536">You can have it as long as you want.</span> <span id="s1537">Here you find about these

is wrong, I would say.</span> <span id="s1544">He writes for instance about my father, that he was fighting against the Zionists.</span> <span id="s1545">This is not right.</span> <span id="s1546">My father was not a Zionist, but he was not fighting against them.</span> <span id="s1547">And also my father was not Reform.</span> <span id="s1548">The only thing what he did, was, what he connected him with the Reform was that the rabbi in Berlin from the Reform synagogue was a friend of his, from his studying years.</span> <span id="s1549">And he invited him once to speak in the synagogue, on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1550">So he says my father want change the Shabbos on the Sunday.</span> <span id="s1551">So far as my father not didn't go so far in his reform or liberal opinions.</span>

Europe, and they brought them back.</span> <span id="s2793">So on the same day, on the same day, when the capitulation was I, would say in the same minute, they scuttled the ship that the Japanese shouldn't take it.</span> <span id="s2794">So it sank, but only half, and it was laying there til the end of the war, in the middle of the harbor, the half of the ship.</span></p> <p><span

id="s3119">And this was, this was a very bad experience.</span> <span id="s3120">This was only small bombers, the 25, and small bombs, but there were about 30, 30 airplanes.</span> <span id="s3121">The whole thing is, they later, they called it the carpet, you know?</span> <span id="s3122">In the language, the military language.</span> <span id="s3123">They rushed over a special strip, and one after another, and let the bombs fall.</span> <span id="s3124">They call it "they lay a carpet."</span> <span id="s3125">And you could see it later.</span> <span id="s3126">This was all covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">JF: Did this go through Hong Kew?</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3129">This was through Hong Kew; really through Hong Kew because it was against the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">JF: This was American?</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">WS: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">JF: This was American?</span> <span id="s3133">These were American planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3135">And this brings me to another thought.</span> <span id="s3136">We had discussed that, also, I remember, with a few people in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s3137">The Japanese used the Jews in the ghetto, or in the district, as a kind of defense.</span> <span id="s3138">They thought the American, everybody knew they are the immigrants, so they will not bomb us.</span> <span id="s3139">Because the Japanese, all Japanese installations were there Admiralty, the cadet school for their sea cadets.</span> <span id="s3140">And everything was there.</span> <span id="s3141">The big antennas for the sea radio, oversea radio.</span> <span id="s3142">Everything Japanese was in that, and that was their aim, they aimed on that, and I would say to 60% they hit them.</span> <span id="s3143">They hit all these installations because what was on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">JF: Where were you during that bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">WS: I just, I, didn't I tell you that?</span> <span id="s3146">I went to a friend with books.</span> <span id="s3147">He would sell me some books, and I had an appointment with him at 1:00 o’clock.</span> <span id="s3148">It were a very hot day.</span> <span id="s3149">And I was there about 12, and I thought, "Maybe he is home."</span> <span id="s3150">But he wasn't home.</span> <span id="s3151">And then I thought, "What I do now?</span> <span id="s3152">It is so hot and other business I don't have in a moment.</span> <span id="s3153">I will go home.</span> <span id="s3154">Maybe I can tomorrow or another."</span> <span id="s3155">And just 1:00 on the dot was that bombing, and his house went up.</span> <span id="s3156">And I went there.</span> <span id="s3157">I was just, I just came home and was ready.</span> <span id="s3158">My mother prepared the lunch, and then I heard this coming.</span> <span id="s3159">It was so that all the doors and everything was trembling.</span> <span id="s3160">The whole thing took about five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">JF: Mmm.</span> <span id="s3162">What about the other bombings that you referred to?</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">WS: Now the other bombings were in other parts of the town, but, uh, we heard them.</span> <span id="s3164">We tried to get some shelter what we could.</span> <span id="s3165">This one, all four, but this was the worst, because, I think, on that day were 15,000 deaths.</span> <span id="s3166">Alone, there were over 40 of the immigrants, over 40.</span> <span id="s3167">The president of the Jewish Community was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">JF: Was one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">WS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s3170">He was a lawyer from Vienna, Kardegg–He was one of the victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">JF: How were the victims and the wounded helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3173">This is something also I will tell you.</span> <span id="s3174">That was a very, very good example there how the Japanese recognized the Jewish help.</span> <span id="s3175">We were all helping.</span> <span id="s3176">The deads, the wounded, all were in the streets, and all the doctors they came from the other part of the city from all over to help.</span> <span id="s3177">And the Japanese gave a big, big declaration how helpful the Jews were in cleaning up this whole mess and in helping the wounded.</span> <span id="s3178">And they brought them all in hospitals and in the Jewish schools and in the synagogues and everywhere.</span> <span id="s3179">This was a very good example of cooperation.</span> <span id="s3180">And then when the war was over, there was also something remarkable.</span> <span id="s3181">This was, I remember, the night.</span> <span id="s3182">The people were running around there, "Japan surrendered!</span> <span id="s3183">Japan has surrendered!"</span> <span id="s3184">And then our [unclear] there was a boy that was a redhead.</span> <span id="s3185">He was a brustig boy.</span> <span id="s3186">[show-off].</span> <span id="s3187">And he ran around and saying, almost was crying, "Back with you on the trees!</span> <span id="s3188">Back with you on the trees, you apes!"</span> <span id="s3189">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">JF: He said this to the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">WS: Yeah, they, the Japanese didn't understand it really.</span> <span id="s3192">They didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s3193">Very, very few spoke English.</span> <span id="s3194">"Back with you on the trees, you apes," he was telling.</span> <span id="s3195">And now, we were afraid the Japanese would do something, hmm?</span> <span id="s3196">Or the Chinese, but this was a condition of the, of this capitulation.</span> <span id="s3197">They had to keep the order till the last minute.</span> <span id="s3198">And they did it.</span> <span id="s3199">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s3200">Nothing.</span> <span id="s3201">We were afraid also the Chinese would do something, because this was on August the 15th, I think.</span> <span id="s3202">And the American troops came to Shanghai on September the 6th.</span> <span id="s3203">I remember it was the day before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s3204">And there came and, and now when the Americans came in, they didn't take the, the, their weapons from them.</span> <span id="s3205">They let them do their duty.</span> <span id="s3206">They made together duty, the Americans and the Japanese, up to the last minute when the last Japanese had left Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Tape five, side one</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">JF: This is tape five, side one, of an interview with Mr. Walter Silberstein on November 17, 1981.</span> <span id="s3209">You were talking about the, when the Americans entered Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">WS: Yeah, this was the end of the whole affair, when we were waiting to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">JF: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3213">We all knew that this wouldn't be in one year or in two years.</span> <span id="s3214">You see the war was over '45, and, I would say, the first immigrants really left in '47.</span> <span id="s3215">I would say before this one maybe a handful, but I wouldn't say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">JF: What was the reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">WS: Mmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">JF: What was the reason for that delay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">WS: Na.</span> <span id="s3220">Na, first all the big countries must get settled after the war.</span> <span id="s3221">There were no ships.</span> <span id="s3222">This was the worst problem, the ships.</span> <span id="s3223">And the processing, they didn't have a consulate.</span> <span id="s3224">This took all the time, bis [until] every official was again established.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">JF: The consulates had to be reestablished after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">WS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">JF: During that period of time, what were living conditions like for you?</span> <span id="s3228">Did they change at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">WS: No; of course, they were better, in the same minute when the war was over.</span> <span id="s3230">Also before the Americans came in and the British, everybody, they sent us food, food stuffs.</span> <span id="s3231">And we had so plenty that in two or three weeks we really didn't know what to do with this.</span> <span id="s3232">You see, that's the American way, this wasting.</span> <span id="s3233">The soldiers told us they had on two islands in the Pacific stapled up for years so many food stuff that the American Army could have lived from that for three or four years.</span> <span id="s3234">And the first thing they did was that they put it over in the camps, for their own civilian prisoners.</span> <span id="s3235">That we could see this was over the Bund [Shanghai harbor highway] because they came about every fifty minutes came an airplane and threw down with parachutes.</span> <span id="s3236">The parachutes were all in red, and white, and green and every.</span> <span id="s3237">It was beautiful to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">JF: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">WS: And big crates they put down with food stuffs.</span> <span id="s3240">So, at that time, I will tell you, in about three or four weeks the Chinese couldn't buy it, I mean.</span> <span id="s3241">We got so much that we, we couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s3242">We were selling that.</span> <span id="s3243">And this was excellent.</span> <span id="s3244">And I tell you also something.</span> <span id="s3245">You cannot get it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">JF: You can't get what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">WS: Here.</span> <span id="s3248">You cannot buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">JF: You can't buy the kind of food that they were giving out?</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">WS: Mmm.</span> <span id="s3251">And they still have it now.</span> <span id="s3252">This was, everything was so excellent.</span> <span id="s3253">When we came here, I've been here now thirteen years, and I asked for that.</span> <span id="s3254">They didn't have it.</span> <span id="s3255">Only in the surplus.</span> <span id="s3256">But I think they don't have that anymore.</span> <span id="s3257">They still have the army surplus store?</span> <span id="s3258">There you could buy it, but this was old, of course.</span> <span id="s3259">And everything was, was every, this was so excellent.</span> <span id="s3260">And they told us that, they make it only for the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">JF: Now at this time, once the ghetto was reopened, was there any moving out of the ghetto into the other areas or did they stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">WS: Very few.</span> <span id="s3263">Because the people all had the mind to leave Shanghai.</span> <span id="s3264">I mean why?</span> <span id="s3265">Very few changed back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">JF: Let me ask you something before we end the discussion of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s3267">Was there much help that the Jewish community outside the ghetto could give you inside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s3268">Was there much interchange during that ghetto period?</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">WS: Very few instance where personal contacts were made, but not in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">JF: What was the attitude of the people in the ghetto towards the other community?</span> <span id="s3271">What was the feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">WS: I would say most of them, because I told you then how I left the ghetto, or in Hong Kew before already, after, they didn't have any contact with them.</span> <span id="s3273">This was the most reason.</span> <span id="s3274">This was not a special attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">JF: It was no special attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">WS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">JF: There was no resentment towards them being independent of the ghetto restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">WS: I wouldn't say that.</span> <span id="s3279">Not as a general expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">JF: And were the Jews on the outside of the ghetto able to, as a group, get any help to the Jewish community in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3282">The problem, he brings that up in the book.</span> <span id="s3283">They gave something, but really, compared to that amount that came from abroad, especially from America, it was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">WS: I mean it was not any load on their part.</span> <span id="s3286">They gave, but very few.</span> <span id="s3287">I would say not two to three percent.</span> <span id="s3288">Compared, there were some rich people, of course, the big men like the Sassoon and Kadoorie.</span> <span id="s3289">They gave some more.</span> <span id="s3290">But not in a general.</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">JF: Now you said that most of the people could not leave at least until 1947.</span> <span id="s3292">When were you and your parents able to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">WS: Ya.</span> <span id="s3294">I could have left there, I would say, '48.</span> <span id="s3295">But it was so, my father died '46.</span> <span id="s3296">And when my father died, my mother came under the Polish quota.</span> <span id="s3297">And the Polish quota was very bad.</span> <span id="s3298">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">JF: This was where her family had been born?</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">WS: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">WS: She came on the, before she was on the German quota.</span> <span id="s3303">And then she came under the Polish quota and there were for them long time no chance.</span> <span id="s3304">And on the second hand, I had, at that time, a very good job with the American Jewish Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">JF: With the American Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">WS: Jewish Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">JF: Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">WS: Joint.</span> <span id="s3309">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s3311">Joint.</span> <span id="s3312">Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">WS: And the Joint had taken over the whole administration after the war.</span> <span id="s3314">And I was there as a librarian.</span> <span id="s3315">And, I mean, it was not a position I could make much money, but I had a good living at that time, and, I would say, that at that time we really didn't think of leaving Shanghai, and this was only because when the Communists came in.</span> <span id="s3316">The Communists came in, I don't know yet in the moment exactly, '49, I think they came in, yeah, '49.</span> <span id="s3317">But the struggle was going on already for one year.</span> <span id="s3318">We saw it coming that there were Communists.</span> <span id="s3319">And then, of course, we tried to get out, and in the end I decided and my mother also decided, that I should go out anyway, and she would leave later and maybe over Germany.</span> <span id="s3320">So I got in '49, I think, I got my visa for America.</span> <span id="s3321">This was, to me, was not a big problem.</span> <span id="s3322">But then I got, then the Communists came, and the ships didn't come in, and I got sick.</span> <span id="s3323">And I had to undergo some operation, and my visa expired before I got a new one.</span> <span id="s3324">And then it was no chance anyway to get out because no ships came in.</span> <span id="s3325">The ships didn't come because the nation of China had located the harbor from Taiwan.</span> <span id="s3326">And that was the worst time when they came and were throwing bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">JF: The, who was throwing bombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">WS: The Nation, Nation of China.</span> <span id="s3329">They were throwing bombs.</span> <span id="s3330">They came every day.</span> <span id="s3331">And this was at random, you know?</span> <span id="s3332">You never, first they didn't have a warning.</span> <span id="s3333">The Communists had not a warning.</span> <span id="s3334">And they came at random.</span> <span id="s3335">One flier, one airplane, you saw it, like a mosquito.</span> <span id="s3336">And he threw some bombs, and went.</span> <span id="s3337">When you had bad luck, you got it, hmm?</span> <span id="s3338">This was a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">JF: This was from 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">WS: Yeah, this was going on till we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">JF: Until you left...</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">WS: And then, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">JF: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">WS: And then when the American consulate closed, all the consul–no, not all, only the American closed, and that was that.</span> <span id="s3345">And then we, the, IRO, you heard the name; IRO, International Refugee Organization.</span> <span id="s3346">That is a part of the United Nations.</span> <span id="s3347">They brought us out, with, there were, I think, two or three mass transports.</span> <span id="s3348">And mostly, the first two went only to Israel.</span> <span id="s3349">And they couldn't go through the Suez Canal at that time, the King Farouk was there.</span> <span id="s3350">So they had to go around the Cape, the Cape, eh, Cape, what is it, Cape of Good Hope, hmm?</span> <span id="s3351">South Africa.</span> <span id="s3352">And we were the first and the only ship that went through Panama, the only ship.</span> <span id="s3353">You also cannot remember that, that this was 1950.</span> <span id="s3354">So we left...</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">JF: This was in 1950?</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">WS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">JF: And you, at this time your mother was able to go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3359">They took everybody.</span> <span id="s3360">They took us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">JF: How many Jews do you think were left in Shanghai after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">WS: I tell you, when we left 1950, I say there were maybe left, after us, about twelve to fourteen hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">JF: Twelve to fourteen hundred Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">WS: Jews, people of all denominations, I would say, or origins.</span> <span id="s3365">And I would say half of the people at that time said they would stay there.</span> <span id="s3366">They were married to Chinese, or they had some business, there were some doctors.</span> <span id="s3367">There were some Russian doctors there, they had no big chance to go, or they were too old.</span> <span id="s3368">I don't know how many still lives there.</span> <span id="s3369">The figures vary very much, but maybe two or three hundred, but I think this is the highest are still there.</span> <span id="s3370">After our ship another transport...</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">JF: Are still, are still there, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3372">WS: Still.</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">JF: Are still there, two to three hundred are still in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">WS: Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">JF: Jewish people.</span> <span id="s3376">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">WS: But not all immigrants from our time, I mean all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">JF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">WS: Who lived there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">WS: Or who came after the war to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">WS: I would say no more.</span> <span id="s3384">And then, then we left.</span> <span id="s3385">It was so, the Chinese were so afraid when we got out.</span> <span id="s3386">It happened to me many times that when I was riding in the bus, or in the streetcar, in the trolley, a Chinese went out and with tears in his eyes he came, "Don't leave Shanghai," he said.</span> <span id="s3387">They were so afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">JF: They were afraid of the Communist controls?</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">WS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3390">They were afraid not only from the Communist, but you see it was so, at first nearly not a white man left in the city.</span> <span id="s3391">And that made you so uneasy.</span> <span id="s3392">It was so you went on the street and some white man whom you didn't know him, English or Russian, you said hello.</span> <span id="s3393">Everybody was happy that somebody is still there.</span> <span id="s3394">And that makes you so unhappy, on the millions and millions of not only yellow people, Communist people.</span> <span id="s3395">So we had no other choice as to leave.</span> <span id="s3396">And they took us around the world.</span> <span id="s3397">We went first by train to Tientsin because the ship didn't come.</span> <span id="s3398">And when we left the Korean war broke out.</span> <span id="s3399">This also was an experience.</span> <span id="s3400">We had a delay from at least six weeks, because that ship, that should take us from the IRO, should come from Australia, that had brought refugees from Europe to Australia.</span> <span id="s3401">And they should take, this was empty, and the ship should take troops or something to Korea.</span> <span id="s3402">And the crew refused to take them.</span> <span id="s3403">They said, "We are hired not for war purpose."</span> <span id="s3404">So they had to go at least empty.</span> <span id="s3405">The only thing was they brought over to the army in Korea food stuffs and medical equipment and so on.</span> <span id="s3406">And then they came over and then the traject [train ferry] broke down in Nanking.</span> <span id="s3407">You know what the traject is?</span> <span id="s3408">Oh yeah, they have it here, too, where they bring the whole train on the ship and bring them over the Yangtze, over the Yangtze.</span> <span id="s3409">There are two railway stations on both sides of the Yangtze.</span> <span id="s3410">And that traject broke down, and they had nobody to repair it because all the British and English and American and French, they were all gone.</span> <span id="s3411">And they didn't have the knowledge at that time, so they called in the Russian.</span> <span id="s3412">And the Russian took over, and then they repaired it, and I tell you, at least it took six weeks.</span> <span id="s3413">And we still didn't go over the traject because they hadn’t, it was
