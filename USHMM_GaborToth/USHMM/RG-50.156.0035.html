not great-grandparents.</span> <span id="s22">My mother’s father I never knew, but I am named after him.</span> <span id="s23">His name was Moshe Melech Rochenschwalb.</span> <span id="s24">Never did we come across another person with this name.</span> <span id="s25">My grandmother on my mother’s side, her name was Sarah Leah Rochenschwalb.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Now where had they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: They were from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Had they emigrated there from somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, they were to the best of my knowledge, born in Poland.</span> <span id="s30">My grandparents on my father’s side, I knew ‘em both.</span> <span id="s31">Their name was Isaac Mandelbaum and Zlata Mandelbaum.</span> <span id="s32">My grandfather died in 1935.</span> <span id="s33">And my grandmother was in ghetto Warsaw, and she was taken to the Treblinka death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Do you know at what point your grandmother went to Treblinka?</span> <span id="s35">Were you all deported together?</span> <span id="s36">Or did she go first?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s38">She and my aunts, my sisters of my father, went together, around June in ‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: I suppose as you tell the story of what happened to your family you will come to this at any rate.</span> <span id="s40">What did your parents do and what did your grandparents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I haven’t got no knowledge what my grandparents on my mother’s side did.</span> <span id="s42">However, I know my grandmother, she was selling milk.</span> <span id="s43">Delivering milk.</span> <span id="s44">My grandfather on my father’s side was a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So your grandmother had a wagon.</span> <span id="s46">She handled this by herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s48">Carrying, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: She transported the milk on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yeah, delivering the milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: She must have been quite a hardy and energetic person.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Evidently.</span> <span id="s53">She raised five children.</span> <span id="s54">But obviously, at the time when I had the knowledge, she didn’t work anymore, but when she was a young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What about the languages that were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: The language spoken at home, strictly Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Do you recall that your family was deeply religious at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Deeply religious as I know it now, they were not.</span> <span id="s59">However, at the time when I was a child and growing up, we were considered very religious.</span> <span id="s60">My father didn’t wear a hat; however, when he sat down to eat, he put on a hat.</span> <span id="s61">He did not work on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s62">We had, obviously, kosher homes.</span> <span id="s63">We didn’t know nothing else.</span> <span id="s64">It was common, everybody was observant.</span> <span id="s65">There were more observant Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Were they scholars in any sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: They were not scholars.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was there any involvement with the Zionism movement at any time that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s70">But my memory of my parents, my father particularly, is that he was a self-taught person.</span> <span id="s71">Was very much involved in politics.</span> <span id="s72">When I say politics, I mean on current events.</span> <span id="s73">I remember people gathering around him, discussing events of the time.</span> <span id="s74">And I did not comprehend, but my sister - my older sister - is telling me now, that at that time, when the civil war in Spain was going on, there he was discussing it.</span> <span id="s75">But Zionist things we did not hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Or any affiliation with the Socialist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, but he was a member of the organization equivalent to the Histadrut in Israel.</span> <span id="s78">A labor movement.</span> <span id="s79">My father was self-employed.</span> <span id="s80">He was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s81">He was working at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And he was able to make enough as a shoemaker to support the family?</span> <span id="s83">There were quite a few of you, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: There were, yeah.</span> <span id="s85">Maybe at this time we can say how many there were.</span> <span id="s86">I had six sisters.</span> <span id="s87">I was the only boy.</span> <span id="s88">So there were actually nine people that he had to feed.</span> <span id="s89">We knew hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q; Well now, what did you do during the bad times when your father was not able to make enough for the family?</span> <span id="s91">Did you work as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s93">I didn’t have a chance to work, because you’ve got to understand that when the war broke out, I was only nine years old.</span> <span id="s94">So therefore I did not work; however, my older sister - we are five to six years apart - she did work and bring in and helped out in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What kind of work did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: She worked as a tailor, as a seamstress, I guess you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I guess, at that time, one almost had to work within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes, as a matter of fact she did work for another Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s99">And speaking of Zionism, this particular lady that my sister worked for, she was very Zionistic inclined.</span> <span id="s100">I know it now.</span> <span id="s101">My other sister worked in a store as a clerk.</span> <span id="s102">All in the same Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Do you recall the feeling of being excluded from the rest of the community?</span> <span id="s104">That you were in a separate world?</span> <span id="s105">Were you conscious of that?</span> <span id="s106">You say you were quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Conscious of the fact, yes, we were conscious of the fact.</span> <span id="s108">The neighborhood that we lived, was literally a gentile - as we call it now - a gentile area in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s109">And yes, we feared always the gentile boys.</span> <span id="s110">They always used to attack us.</span> <span id="s111">And when one bully used to be on one side, we had to go on the other side.</span> <span id="s112">We felt inferiority - I did, even at the age of eight and nine and ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Can you recall the first time that you had that sense that you were in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don’t know about being in danger, but really being bullied, and scared to in any way provoke them.</span> <span id="s115">At the age, I would say, of eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And perhaps that was something that your parents instilled in you from early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s118">It came on the streets.</span> <span id="s119">Just from the street, from the experience living in the street, in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Wasn’t that pretty unusual for Jews to live in a gentile neighborhood in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: It was.</span> <span id="s122">Yes, it’s true, it was very unusual.</span> <span id="s123">Obviously my father could not have afforded any better quarters, or been selective, so therefore he had to take whatever was available.</span> <span id="s124">And as far as this particular building that we lived in, it was one building on a relatively short street, maybe twice as long as this one.</span> <span id="s125">But within walking distance, there was a relatively Jewish population area.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s127">Of course, at that time, when your father moved to that district, he must have had a sense that Jews were not liked, but there was probably no awareness of the kind of threat, the kind of danger that was to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: He grew up with it.</span> <span id="s129">He knew, you know.</span> <span id="s130">And the reason, probably, that he took this particular apartment - it was a store front, there was a front room the size of this room - he probably took it because he was a shoemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And perhaps hoped for some trade from the gentile community.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh, I’m sure he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s134">And were there experiences where the clientele treated him as an inferior?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, but I tell you one experience.</span> <span id="s136">This is a really interesting experience that we had, that we witnessed, and that I recall, at the age of seven.</span> <span id="s137">Whenever there was a gentile Polish wedding, you could bet on it, there were going to be fights.</span> <span id="s138">They’d get drunk and get fights.</span> <span id="s139">And one time, we witnessed a fight among Polacks - gentle people - right in front of our door!</span> <span id="s140">They were beating each other up, and stepping on their faces, and we were so scared that we closed our shutters, we locked ourselves in, and we peeked through a little opening to see what was going on there.</span> <span id="s141">They didn’t harm us, but just among themselves, it was very brutal.</span> <span id="s142">Until this very day, this very moment, my memory, that incident, how they were fighting among themselves - at that wedding, mind you.</span> <span id="s143">It was a wedding!</span> <span id="s144">Really!</span> <span id="s145">But didn’t harm us, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: But what an education for a young boy as to the cruelty of the people around you, the people in your community.</span> <span id="s147">Did you attend a heder?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s149">Sure.</span> <span id="s150">I attended heder from three till age seven.</span> <span id="s151">I attended heder in a small town where my parents come from, Deblin, at age three.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: They were born in Deblin, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Deblin, yes.</span> <span id="s154">And we lived there for a while, also.</span> <span id="s155">They moved back and forth, from Warsaw to Deblin.</span> <span id="s156">So I attended school, public school in Poland.</span> <span id="s157">When I started going to public school, I was taken out from heder and I didn’t go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: So you did attend the public school then for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: At age seven.</span> <span id="s160">Three years.</span> <span id="s161">I went three grades only, it was the first, second and third.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you know the Polish language?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s164">I spoke Polish, you know.</span> <span id="s165">At home we spoke Yiddish, but with the gentile friends we spoke Polish, and in school we spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And what was the treatment like in the school?</span> <span id="s167">Were you the only Jewish boy in your class or were there others?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, there were others, and I did not feel - as a matter of fact, the first class of school that I went to was a brand new school built within walking distance, five, six blocks or more - no, I did not feel any discrimination or harm.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Now let me just pin down the time frame here.</span> <span id="s170">In what year was there the first information that Nazism was rising and that Jews were under siege?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I didn’t have no knowledge at all until the war, September 2, 1939.</span> <span id="s172">The war broke out and there was an air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So you were in school from 1937 to ‘39 and at that time things were quiet.</span> <span id="s174">No heightened persecution of Jews to your knowledge in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: To my knowledge, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s176">In school or anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: And what happened when the outbreak of the war was announced?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Announced!</span> <span id="s179">Was obvious!</span> <span id="s180">When I found out the outbreak of the war, is when we had the air raid!</span> <span id="s181">There was an air raid in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s182">They bombed Warsaw.</span> <span id="s183">That street that we lived on in Warsaw, we lived by a lot of railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s184">A lot of ‘em.</span> <span id="s185">Matter of fact they had a junction.</span> <span id="s186">So my father felt that this is going to be bombed first, which it turned out to be true.</span> <span id="s187">So we moved in with my aunt, more-or-less in the Jewish ghetto, although there was not a ghetto there, but it’s where most of the Jewish people congregated.</span> <span id="s188">So we stayed with my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">It was a big complex, an apartment building, that we lived in.</span> <span id="s190">So we moved away from there to stay with my aunt, my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s191">The first raid, we moved out right away.</span> <span id="s192">So for about a week it was quiet.</span> <span id="s193">And my father and my mother decided, that we should go back home, that it was too crowded with my aunt and uncle to stay there.</span> <span id="s194">So he sent my older sister with her boyfriend and I. Went back to our house to clean it up to get it ready so the whole family can move back.</span> <span id="s195">This was in the morning.</span> <span id="s196">Around afternoon, there was an air raid again, and my father looked out from the window from my aunt’s apartment building, looked in the direction where we lived, and he saw some smoke billowing.</span> <span id="s197">So he said to my mother, “Our house, it was bombed there.”</span> <span id="s198">There were the police guard and everything, but he broke out anyhow, and he ran to the direction to our house to save us, my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s199">Mind you, I was only nine years old and my sister at that time was fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s200">My father never came back.</span> <span id="s201">My father got killed in the air raid.</span> <span id="s202">And of course to me and my sister, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s203">So at the age of nine I became an orphan.</span> <span id="s204">We lost our father on September 14, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Was the body brought back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, there’s a story about this thing, too.</span> <span id="s207">He went out, you know, and he didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s208">so they looked all over for him.</span> <span id="s209">Everybody was looking for him.</span> <span id="s210">On the second or third day, my grandmother, my father’s mother, came to my mother, asked that maybe we should go on the cemetery looking, ‘cause the air raid was over.</span> <span id="s211">Of course, my mother couldn’t come to think that she gonna look for her husband on the cemetery, because this was admitting that he’s dead.</span> <span id="s212">So my grandmother and his sister went on their own to the Jewish cemetery, and lo and behold, they found him there.</span> <span id="s213">We have no idea where he got killed and how he got killed, what he died of, but his body was clean and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: They had a mass grave, you mean?</span> <span id="s215">They had not yet buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: They did not bury him yet, there he was, laying out, waiting for people to come to identify him.</span> <span id="s217">So as I said, my grandmother and my aunt, his sister, went to the cemetery, and as I said, they found him in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s218">Then they came to my mother and informed her that they found my father.</span> <span id="s219">So my mother brought his tallis, and I think two of my sisters, because at the same time, I and my other sister were still looking for him.</span> <span id="s220">Hoping.</span> <span id="s221">Not knowing.</span> <span id="s222">Meanwhile, he was buried in a grave, a mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Was there any synagogue involvement for the family at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No.</span> <span id="s225">We went to synagogue on the Holidays.</span> <span id="s226">And this was very traumatic for me, because I was nine years old, only, and I heard yelling and crying and screaming, and I couldn’t comprehend that I can live without a father.</span> <span id="s227">I remember there was another air raid that night, and I can see it right now.</span> <span id="s228">And we survived!</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: How did your mother handle it?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: (Sigh) I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Do you remember a lot of outward expression of emotion or was she very silent?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: There was a lot of crying.</span> <span id="s233">But the same year, January 20, 1939 - we had six girls and one boy, seven of us - but on January 20, 1939, our youngest sister, she was five years old at the time, died of kidney infection.</span> <span id="s234">So in one year, my mother buried a child of five years old and a husband, from January to September, within one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Now was your mother continuing to work at this point?</span> <span id="s236">Somebody had to support that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: My mother did not work.</span> <span id="s238">My mother never worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: After your father died, who was supporting the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: You’re looking at him!</span> <span id="s241">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: You were nine!</span> <span id="s243">Quite a responsibility for a nine-year-old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, I had sisters.</span> <span id="s245">We were all capable people.</span> <span id="s246">We all went out - we recognized the world - so at nine years old, all of a sudden I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: What did you do to put bread on the table?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I was stealing and begging and dealing and “hondeling” and we managed.</span> <span id="s249">We really were very resourceful children, very aggressive.</span> <span id="s250">We moved back after the war, when the Germans entered Warsaw.</span> <span id="s251">The war only lasted two weeks.</span> <span id="s252">The Polacks, they lost right away.</span> <span id="s253">The Germans, in the beginning when they came in, obviously they wanted to put up a good front - that they were good people - and they were passing out bread and soup.</span> <span id="s254">And whereas somebody had only one bread, my sister got two, three breads.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Well, there were a lot of mouths to feed!</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s257">As I said, we were very resourceful.</span> <span id="s258">We literally took in a live bomb in our one room apartment, took a live bomb.</span> <span id="s259">We lived next to a railroad station, and they bombed that thing, this is after the Germans came in, already.</span> <span id="s260">So there were some railroad cars, tankers.</span> <span id="s261">There was gas spilling out - gasoline!</span> <span id="s262">And we took home gallons and they were put in a big tub.</span> <span id="s263">We didn’t have no cars, but we sold the thing.</span> <span id="s264">But meanwhile, we had it in the room - open gas!</span> <span id="s265">Imagine what would’[‘ve happened?</span> <span id="s266">Imagine now people bringing in an open tub, and filling it up with gasoline, and keep it in the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: I suppose it was the desperation of having to have a source of income.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: So we did this thing.</span> <span id="s269">This is all during ‘39, when the Germans came in there, September, October, November.</span> <span id="s270">The railroad tracks were loaded with coal.</span> <span id="s271">My sister - Mindel Guttman - jumped on a railroad as it was moving, stealing coal - taking coal off, throwing it on the tracks, and my sisters and I went over and picked it up, and then she jumped off.</span> <span id="s272">We got coal to heat, and to sell.</span> <span id="s273">All of a sudden, we become very resourceful!</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So during times of adversity, one develops qualities one didn’t know you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s276">And this is what I learned later on in my life in kibbutz.</span> <span id="s277">That conditions form people.</span> <span id="s278">All of a sudden - the same young sister again - everything was heftler; heftler means “free-for-all.”</span> <span id="s279">It’s a Hebrew word, really.</span> <span id="s280">So one guy was carrying a big sack of 100 pounds of peanuts, in shells.</span> <span id="s281">My sister went over to this guy, she grabbed it away form him and said, “Why should you have that thing?</span> <span id="s282">Me and my sister don’t have anything!”</span> <span id="s283">She took it away!</span> <span id="s284">She dragged it home and we had this thing for a long time, sharing.</span> <span id="s285">So, yes, we became very resourceful.</span> <span id="s286">Then later on, I was dealing with the German there, and we...started being peddlers.</span> <span id="s287">The thing I remember selling, I was selling, I was selling cigarettes on the street.</span> <span id="s288">Then I was selling candles.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And now these were things that you just picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: So we bought the cigarettes wholesale and went out and we’re sitting on the street and we’d sell ‘em, my sisters and I. We’re selling cigarettes and we’re selling candles.</span> <span id="s291">And we’re selling soap.</span> <span id="s292">See, my sisters and I, we looked what you call like Aryan, like the Poles.</span> <span id="s293">A lot of people could not identify us as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s294">This was really probably where we survived, because we had advantage over a lot of other people that they looked obvious Jewish.</span> <span id="s295">My sisters and I did not.</span> <span id="s296">And of course we spoke the language and a lot of people didn’t recognize us.</span> <span id="s297">So we’d pretend we were gentiles.</span> <span id="s298">We led a double life.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Had you thought of leaving that neighborhood at that point, once the occupation started and life was so tough?</span> <span id="s300">Or was that impossible?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Thought?</span> <span id="s302">We were forced to leave that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s303">One day, it’s early 1940, there was a directive from the Germans that all Jews living in this and this area must leave, just vacate.</span> <span id="s304">This was the start, the beginning of forming the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: This was the first time that you had direct awareness of what the German occupation meant to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s307">This was in early ‘40s.</span> <span id="s308">As I said, there was a directive issued - published - that all Jews living in a certain area must leave.</span> <span id="s309">So we left.</span> <span id="s310">We packed up our belongings, and we found an apartment in a Jewish area where mostly Jewish concentrated.</span> <span id="s311">And there we were.</span> <span id="s312">At that time they only had barbed wires, where Jews could live and where Jews could not live.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Now how much were you aware of at that point?</span> <span id="s314">In terms of what was happening in the outside world.</span> <span id="s315">Were you listening to the radio?</span> <span id="s316">Were you getting reports of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: We did not have a radio.</span> <span id="s318">Intellectually I didn’t have no idea.</span> <span id="s319">Mind you, I’m talking about a boy of ten years old.</span> <span id="s320">I was not aware of the world, what the world is, what the politics are, nothing.</span> <span id="s321">All we knew is that we are Jews and we are treated inferior compared to the gentile people where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Were you aware of the formation of any underground movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: What happened after that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: In 1940, things were getting progressively worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s326">The Jewish people were deprived more and more of things, materials things, food.</span> <span id="s327">And we were rationed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Your food was rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah, food.</span> <span id="s330">But, as I said, we were very resourceful.</span> <span id="s331">Right away we started “smuggling,” you know, “dealing.”</span> <span id="s332">We looked like Aryans, so even though there were some various wire barriers, immediately we started going over on the gentile side - the Christian, the Aryan side, as we would call it - and buying stuff there, bringing it back in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Weren’t those borders patrolled?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: They were patrolled, but you’d be surprised what I used to do.</span> <span id="s335">Later on I’ll tell you some stories that, to this day I don’t believe the things that I did!</span> <span id="s336">This man sitting now, he is so composed, at the age of ten, eleven...</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I’ll tell you when we get there.</span> <span id="s339">We’ve gotta cover ‘40, ‘41 and ‘42, and all this stuff there.</span> <span id="s340">There’s a lot of things to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">It was getting worse, progressively worse.</span> <span id="s342">Even though we were so successful and productive and things, we still were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s343">It came to a point that we had to burn the furniture - in late ‘40 - in order to keep warm.</span> <span id="s344">We moved in in a really large apartment.</span> <span id="s345">It was on a roof, a large room under the roof, little windows, attic type.</span> <span id="s346">A large room we lived in, my sisters and my mother, and another woman lived there, too.</span> <span id="s347">There were a lot people burned their furniture in order to keep warm.</span> <span id="s348">Little by little, you know, taking it out of the crates.</span> <span id="s349">But at the same time there, all of my sisters, one by one, came down with typhoid.</span> <span id="s350">My mother was the only person, she didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s351">And she cared for us.</span> <span id="s352">And we all came out okay.</span> <span id="s353">But each one of us had typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And I don’t suppose there was any medication available.</span> <span id="s355">The body heals itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I haven’t got no knowledge or recollection of ever going to a doctor.</span> <span id="s357">But all my five sisters and myself, we all came down with typhoid.</span> <span id="s358">And again, the ghetto was progressively worse and worse.</span> <span id="s359">Then we abandoned this apartment.</span> <span id="s360">In 1941, things were getting worse.</span> <span id="s361">Then they started already building the wall.</span> <span id="s362">They built a wall.</span> <span id="s363">And they built a bridge.</span> <span id="s364">They did not have any transportation in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s365">What I mean, transportation by trains.</span> <span id="s366">In Warsaw, a beautiful city, and all their trains, but in the Jewish area, they did not.</span> <span id="s367">So they created some horse drawn trams, built special for the Jews.</span> <span id="s368">And they were resourceful, the Jewish people, too.</span> <span id="s369">They had rickshaws.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: They built their own rickshaws?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: They built their own rickshaws, and that’s how their transportation was.</span> <span id="s372">So, really surprising, life went on, the police and the people.</span> <span id="s373">And as I said, we were going back and forth.</span> <span id="s374">We were smuggling.</span> <span id="s375">Oh, I have many experiences there.</span> <span id="s376">If this should come to a book, should know that they built a wall right in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s377">Evidently the Germans somehow decided, “This is going to be the Jews,” and they built a wall right in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s378">On one street that I lived on when I was a young child, Pawa, one half side the street was Christian, and the other side were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">One night I got caught, I could not get through across the border.</span> <span id="s380">The border was watched by a Jewish policeman, Polish police, and German soldiers.</span> <span id="s381">The German soldiers had weapons.</span> <span id="s382">The Polish police had a weapon, too.</span> <span id="s383">The Jewish did not have no weapon, only a stick.</span> <span id="s384">I used to manage to go through with merchandise, and come back and forth, but this one evening, no way.</span> <span id="s385">All the guards were so tough, I just couldn’t go through, and I got stuck on the Christian side.</span> <span id="s386">And there I didn’t have nowhere to stay and no home to sleep with.</span> <span id="s387">That night I was smuggling candies - caramel candies - to be sold in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s388">And I had those pump pants, like the old time golfers used to wear.</span> <span id="s389">And I had ‘em full of candies there.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Like knickers?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Knickers, yeah.</span> <span id="s392">“Pump pants,” they used to call it.</span> <span id="s393">It was easy to run across when there was a lot of traffic, but the later it got, the traffic slowed down, and it was harder to sneak through.</span> <span id="s394">So that one night, I spent in a burned, bombed-out building.</span> <span id="s395">A whole night.</span> <span id="s396">Stood up in a corner a whole night.</span> <span id="s397">At the age of eleven.</span> <span id="s398">And none of my sisters were there.</span> <span id="s399">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s400">Imagine what went through my mother’s heart.</span> <span id="s401">But next morning I forgot about everything, and I got through.</span> <span id="s402">Everything was okay.</span> <span id="s403">And we were starting all over again.</span> <span id="s404">This went on most of ‘41.</span> <span id="s405">And systematically, the German, without known to us, kept on taking Jews out to Treblinka, to those death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did you say, “unknown to us?”</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Unknown to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: You didn’t see it happening to your neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I see it happen, but they had some tricks, and it’s known how they did.</span> <span id="s410">They promised people, ‘cause they were hungry, the promised people they’re going to give ‘em a pound of jam and a bread, if they’re going to come to the station.</span> <span id="s411">They’re going to relocate ‘em.</span> <span id="s412">We never fell for it, you know.</span> <span id="s413">But at that time, I think, my grandmother died of hunger, in the ghetto, my grandmother on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s414">And we moved in with my mother’s sister, in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s415">Her husband left her to go to Russia, but never came back.</span> <span id="s416">Evidently he was murdered on the way to Russia by the Poles.</span> <span id="s417">And she was left with one little girl, four, five years old.</span> <span id="s418">So two families lived in one apartment.</span> <span id="s419">But my aunt did volunteer to go to that train where they pass out the jam and bread, and she was never seen since.</span> <span id="s420">She was taken away to Treblinka with the child, and my other aunts and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s421">So we were left alone, my mother and my five sisters.</span> <span id="s422">But during late ‘41, early ‘42, two of my sisters went away.</span> <span id="s423">They worked on a Polish farm, really a ranch.</span> <span id="s424">For a few months they worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: These were Poles who wanted labor, so they were willing to take Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No, they didn’t go there as Jews, they went there as gentiles.</span> <span id="s427">And they worked on that farm, which we would call a ranch.</span> <span id="s428">Then, sometime early in ‘42, they came back, to Warsaw ghetto, to see my mother.</span> <span id="s429">My mother always stayed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s430">But we kept on going back and forth, dealing.</span> <span id="s431">I want you to know here an experience that I had - how I used to smuggle across.</span> <span id="s432">See, the ghetto was divided.</span> <span id="s433">There was what’s known as the “Large Ghetto” and the “Little Ghetto.”</span> <span id="s434">In order to go from the Large Ghetto to the Little Ghetto, for the Christians, they used a train, a streetcar.</span> <span id="s435">So the Polish streetcar went by maybe two blocks in the Jewish ghetto in order to go back for them.</span> <span id="s436">So I used to go in, on the Christian side, with merchandise.</span> <span id="s437">As the streetcar was going through the two blocks in the Jewish ghetto, I went down that step and I jumped off!</span> <span id="s438">And many times my sister - we had some signal - my sister was riding the streetcar, she had a suitcase of merchandise, and as the car went by, I jumped on the streetcar, she handed me a suitcase of merchandise - flour, sugar, different things - and I jumped off.</span> <span id="s439">And one time police were chasing me and I disappeared!</span> <span id="s440">This is the kind of experiences that we had.</span> <span id="s441">Again, you have to realize that I was only 11, 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: That helped you carry it off, I suppose.</span> <span id="s443">A child could get away with things that an older person couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: As a matter of fact, one experience I had at the same time, I got caught by a Polish policeman, smuggling - by the way, we called it “smuggling in order to survive” - as a Christian, as a gentile.</span> <span id="s445">And they threw me in a prison, in a jail with a bunch of drunks, at maybe 12 years old.</span> <span id="s446">And I was only afraid they’re going to ask me my address, where I live.</span> <span id="s447">Fortunately, after I spent a whole night in the jail, the next morning they let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: You didn’t have a Jewish accent that gave you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, see in Poland, there isn’t such a thing as an accent.</span> <span id="s450">No, because I was raised among gentile people.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: You were bilingual from early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s453">Just like a lot of American - well, I shouldn’t say a lot.</span> <span id="s454">Like my kids don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s455">No, we spoke Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s456">I can tell you that my mother never spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s457">My mother did not know how to speak Polish.</span> <span id="s458">My mother never went to school.</span> <span id="s459">Neither did my father go to school, because when they grew up, school wasn’t compulsory.</span> <span id="s460">So they did not speak Polish, but we didn’t have no problem with the Polish language.</span> <span id="s461">And I had a Polish name, all of us.</span> <span id="s462">Anyhow, towards early ‘42, things were getting much worse in ghetto.</span> <span id="s463">There was less and less and less.</span> <span id="s464">And less people.</span> <span id="s465">The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s466">One experience that I had, this was when my sisters came back from that ranch.</span> <span id="s467">We had some gentile friends of the same age.</span> <span id="s468">When I say, “we,” I mean my sister Etta and I.</span> <span id="s469">So one day we were over on the Christian side, and went into the ghetto to buy some stuff.</span> <span id="s470">This was early ‘42.</span> <span id="s471">The Germans happened to block off our area to take all these Jews and send ‘em away, so we got caught in this area.</span> <span id="s472">When I saw “we,” I mean my sister and I and those two gentile friends, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s473">These two gentile friends knew that we were Jewish!</span> <span id="s474">But we’d helped them, we were friends with them, and they didn’t harm us.</span> <span id="s475">So when the Germans caught us, my sister and I and these two kids, they’re going to shoot us!</span> <span id="s476">With a gun like this!</span> <span id="s477">So the kids start yelling in Polish.</span> <span id="s478">They said, “Sir,” he said, “We’re not Jews!</span> <span id="s479">We are not Jews, We’re not Jews, we’re Christian.</span> <span id="s480">We’re Christian, we’re Poles!”</span> <span id="s481">So the soldier said, “Okay, show me!”</span> <span id="s482">Meaning to show ‘em the genital.</span> <span id="s483">So he let down his pants, you know, and he showed ‘em.</span> <span id="s484">So my sister, she was going to say, “Okay, I’m Christian, too.”</span> <span id="s485">As I said, I’m not a great believe in the Almighty, especially now I’m less so, from the experience I went through.</span> <span id="s486">But at that time, when he came over to me and held the gun and said, “Okay, show me,” I showed ‘em.</span> <span id="s487">Knowing at 12 years old that I’m circumcised, and knowing that the difference that the gentile people are not circumcised and the Jewish people are circumcised, with my finger, I pulled over the skin, I showed it, and he said, “Okay, get the hell out of here!”</span> <span id="s488">Evidently it did not show.</span> <span id="s489">And we ran so fast!</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Well how do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I’m telling you!</span> <span id="s492">He got blind!</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: He was blind or he chose to let you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No, he did not choose to let me go.</span> <span id="s495">If I would be “Jewish,” I would not be sitting here with you and telling this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You really feel it that strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh, 100%!</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: It has nothing to do with humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Absolutely nothing to do with humanity.</span> <span id="s500">Blind!</span> <span id="s501">Nothing to do with humanity, because their purpose at that time, they were there to kill those Jews that had come up, and to empty that whole block and send them away!</span> <span id="s502">No humanity!</span> <span id="s503">Absolutely not!</span> <span id="s504">He was blind, due to what I did.</span> <span id="s505">And this is God’s honest truth!</span> <span id="s506">At 12 years old I did it.</span> <span id="s507">And we just ran so fast!</span> <span id="s508">But we were so aggressive, we didn’t go on the Polish side, we stayed over and we bought some merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: You never missed a chance!</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Never missed a chance.</span> <span id="s511">But as I said, the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s512">We kept squeezing.</span> <span id="s513">So one day, we decided to take my mother and my two other sisters.</span> <span id="s514">One of my sisters, Masha, was not as aggressive as we were.</span> <span id="s515">She looked more Jewish than we did, at least a physical appearance, more Jewish than my other sisters.</span> <span id="s516">So therefore she always stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s517">And she was a little handicapped.</span> <span id="s518">She had one short foot, she was born like this, so she stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s519">And at that time I had another young sister, Riva - Riva Kabort, she’s in this country now - she was at that time maybe nine years old.</span> <span id="s520">She, too, stayed.</span> <span id="s521">Only two of my sisters and I were really doing all these things.</span> <span id="s522">It was only Etta, Mindel and myself that did all the dealing and all the smuggling and all the working.</span> <span id="s523">The other ones didn’t.</span> <span id="s524">Ann didn’t, either.</span> <span id="s525">And on the last day we decided we’re going to leave the ghetto and go to the town where my parents come from, Deblin.</span> <span id="s526">So one day earlier, I smuggled my older sister, Ann Ptaszek - that’s her married name - I took my older sister over into the gentile side, and I must say it at this time, the place we put her up, with Polish Christians, they knew that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s527">There were some good ones.</span> <span id="s528">They knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s529">Her husband was a policeman, very nervous.</span> <span id="s530">He, too, knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s531">We didn’t spend much time, because he got nervous and he told us to leave.</span> <span id="s532">I went over the following day, we were going to bring my mother and my other two sisters, Marcia and Riva, over and take a train and go to Deblin, not knowing that this town already was Judenrein.</span> <span id="s533">They took all the Jews.</span> <span id="s534">Judenrein means “Clear of all the Jews.”</span> <span id="s535">As I said, our intention was to go to this town where my parents come from, ‘cause my parents had their brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s536">Not known to us, there were no Jews, no more.</span> <span id="s537">There, too, they were sent away to the death camps.</span> <span id="s538">Nevertheless, this morning, we got up, and my mother told us, “Okay, kids, you go ahead.”</span> <span id="s539">- we knew where we’re going, where we’re gonna go through to the Aryan side, to the Polish side - “and I’ll come along.”</span> <span id="s540">This was the first time that we took our little sister, Riva, with us.</span> <span id="s541">Etta and I and Riva went over, and we were fortunate enough that we just happened to go right through without ever anybody noticing us, or any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">I want to digress a minute, because I’m thinking of that place where we went through, which was Leshinal - the spelling is not real important - in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s543">Probably late ‘41, early ‘42, a German guard that was guarding the gate, from the gentile side to the ghetto, one Jew was walking by, innocent, nothing, no bothering anybody.</span> <span id="s544">He called the guy over and said, “Come here.”</span> <span id="s545">I don’t know what he asked him.</span> <span id="s546">And he said, “Okay, go.”</span> <span id="s547">And he went over.</span> <span id="s548">Shot ‘em just like this.</span> <span id="s549">Then I noticed he went over again to make sure that this guy is dead!</span> <span id="s550">Went over, shot him in his head!</span> <span id="s551">For absolutely no provoke!</span> <span id="s552">No reason!</span> <span id="s553">And then a cart went by.</span> <span id="s554">They threw ‘im on the thing, just like merchandise.</span> <span id="s555">Something like that.</span> <span id="s556">That’s what I witnessed from the German, and now they’re gonna tell us that this thing didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s557">They treated them just like mud.</span> <span id="s558">A Jewish person walked on the street.</span> <span id="s559">Called ‘im over.</span> <span id="s560">Shot ‘im.</span> <span id="s561">Shot ‘im once.</span> <span id="s562">He fell.</span> <span id="s563">Went over again.</span> <span id="s564">Shot ‘im straight in the head.</span> <span id="s565">Then they picked ‘im up.</span> <span id="s566">Threw him.</span> <span id="s567">Discarded.</span> <span id="s568">And also, I witnessed a scene.</span> <span id="s569">When the German picked up, as I told you earlier, in the Warsaw ghetto, they l oaded up a whole bunch of old people, sick people and inform people from probably old-age homes, put ‘em on a cart, went in the cemetery, in the same cemetery, by the way, that my father is buried.</span> <span id="s570">I looked out through our window.</span> <span id="s571">I saw they lined them all up by this grave with machine guns, and they cut ‘em down.</span> <span id="s572">They shot ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And you witnessed that, yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I witnessed that myself, with mine own eyes, at age eleven.</span> <span id="s575">I looked up from the house, I could see it, it was right across from the cemetery.</span> <span id="s576">That’s a fact.</span> <span id="s577">But anyhow, going back to the day when my mother said, “Okay, kids, go ahead.</span> <span id="s578">I’ll come, I’ll follow you.”</span> <span id="s579">Well she’s following to this day.</span> <span id="s580">You don’t understand that?</span> <span id="s581">I’m still waiting for my mother, here in 1984, to follow me.</span> <span id="s582">What happened, evidently, we missed by literally minutes, because if we would’ve been minutes late, if we would’ve stayed and insisted to go out at the same time as my mother, I wouldn’t be sitting here and telling this story.</span> <span id="s583">Because evidently, as soon as my sisters and I left the street, Germans came over and blocked the whole street.</span> <span id="s584">That’s how they did it!</span> <span id="s585">They came over, they blocked.</span> <span id="s586">They come here, and they come here, and they block off the whole street.</span> <span id="s587">Barricades.</span> <span id="s588">And they evacuate all the people.</span> <span id="s589">Put ‘em on trucks.</span> <span id="s590">And they brought ‘em to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: But you didn’t know at that point that this was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I did not know about it.</span> <span id="s593">We were not aware.</span> <span id="s594">I did not know about Treblinka or anything else.</span> <span id="s595">It’s, sure, just after the fact.</span> <span id="s596">But literally minutes, maybe seconds, maybe half an hour, but our luck, the reason I’m sitting here and able to tell you that story, is the fact that my sister and I went over earlier.</span> <span id="s597">And we’re still waiting till this day for her to come, to follow.</span> <span id="s598">So this is a story.</span> <span id="s599">Just at that time, we lost my mother and one sister.</span> <span id="s600">To the best of our knowledge, they were taken to Treblinka - to the death camp.</span> <span id="s601">Treblinka is a very well-known Polish place where all the Jews were.</span> <span id="s602">At that time, we were left alone.</span> <span id="s603">So there were four of my sisters and myself.</span> <span id="s604">And we were staying with gentile friends.</span> <span id="s605">But it was getting more and more uncomfortable there.</span> <span id="s606">Less and less people.</span> <span id="s607">Some people already knew that we were Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s608">We had some gentile friends that knew we were Jewish and they were blackmailing us.</span> <span id="s609">And it was getting a little harder and harder.</span> <span id="s610">And was no reason anymore to stay in the ghetto, because they were liquidating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s611">I’m speaking already summer of 1942.</span> <span id="s612">So we decided to go on our own to this town, Deblin, where my parents come from - where we had relatives - not knowing there’s no one there.</span> <span id="s613">But I have to qualify that.</span> <span id="s614">So we bought tickets - railroad tickets - and we went on a train and we went to Deblin.</span> <span id="s615">When we came to Deblin, my sisters and I - I think it was about 50 miles southwest of Warsaw, 50 kilometer miles - then we found out that most of my relatives and cousins - I had many, many cousins - were already sent away to the death camps.</span> <span id="s616">There was only left three uncles, really.</span> <span id="s617">Two uncles were my mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s618">One uncle was a brother-in-law to my mother.</span> <span id="s619">A week before we came, one of my uncles, my mother’s brother, was hot in the same fashion as I’ve just described that person.</span> <span id="s620">They had put the Jews in one corner of the little town.</span> <span id="s621">The town was as big as a few streets.</span> <span id="s622">He happened to sit outside after the hour - maybe at five o’clock.</span> <span id="s623">So a German went by.</span> <span id="s624">And whenever somebody’s name is Pederson, automatically, I refer to that incident - the name Pederson is, how should I say it - that name brings right away a flash point.</span> <span id="s625">As a matter of fact, I just played golf with a fellow named Pederson.</span> <span id="s626">The name Pederson is very, very unique to me.</span> <span id="s627">Because it flashes back to that incident, although I didn’t witness it, but my uncle knew the German’s name.</span> <span id="s628">He was a Volksdeutch.</span> <span id="s629">He was Polish and German.</span> <span id="s630">Volksdeutchen.</span> <span id="s631">They were just like an American would go to Israel and be an Israeli citizen and also be an American.</span> <span id="s632">See, they were always going to be Germans, okay?</span> <span id="s633">But they were Poles, also.</span> <span id="s634">Volksdeutchen.</span> <span id="s635">Poles that claim their ancestors were German.</span> <span id="s636">And as soon as the Germans came in, they claimed, “We’re German,” and they collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s637">Anyhow, his name was Pederson.</span> <span id="s638">So we were told by my uncle that this Pederson, the German, went by and my uncle was sitting on this step of his house.</span> <span id="s639">He came and he just shot ‘im.</span> <span id="s640">No reason.</span> <span id="s641">Of course, we didn’t see ‘im.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">So we were in Deblin.</span> <span id="s643">As I said, there were hardly any Jews left.</span> <span id="s644">Two of my uncles.</span> <span id="s645">There was a large military airport there, which was German.</span> <span id="s646">Later on, they formed a camp, a Jewish labor camp, where we were for two years.</span> <span id="s647">So they decided to eliminate most of the Jews.</span> <span id="s648">Only enough to keep in that camp.</span> <span id="s649">So within a week or two, when we came to Deblin, they closed off the town again and chased everybody out.</span> <span id="s650">And I got caught in the march, with the whole bunch of Jews, to the train to be sent away to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s651">There were Germans marching us, like cattle.</span> <span id="s652">My sister Etta, she was walking on the sidewalk as a Christian.</span> <span id="s653">In Poland I was named Manjek.</span> <span id="s654">I told the Germans there that, “Im not Jewish!</span> <span id="s655">What am I doing here!</span> <span id="s656">What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s657">I’m gentile!</span> <span id="s658">I’m gentile!”</span> <span id="s659">I said, “I’m not Jewish.</span> <span id="s660">What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s661">Please let me go!</span> <span id="s662">Please let me go!”</span> <span id="s663">Again, this is God’s truth, I don’t know whoever watches over us - he let me go, and I left with my sister.</span> <span id="s664">And those Jews was sent over to that railroad track.</span> <span id="s665">And my uncle was working there, too, and he was taken away.</span> <span id="s666">That night, I spent the night in a cement mixer.</span> <span id="s667">And I sat in that cement mixer a whole night just thinking what’s going to happen to me the following morning - that the people were going to come to work, turn on that mixer, and there’s gonna be soup out of me.</span> <span id="s668">This was at the age of 12.</span> <span id="s669">Obviously I didn’t give ‘em a chance to do that.</span> <span id="s670">Early in the morning, as soon as the sun came out, I climbed out of that mixer, went back in that town.</span> <span id="s671">See what the Germans also did, when they cleared out the Jews from Hungary or from other cities, they brought ‘em to Deblin, also.</span> <span id="s672">The following morning, I saw at least 500 Jewish people dead - Hungarian, primarily.</span> <span id="s673">I jumped over their corpses, laying out.</span> <span id="s674">They were all shot.</span> <span id="s675">A minimum of 500 Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s676">And at that time, Deblin is completely Judenrein.</span> <span id="s677">They completely cleared out the city!</span> <span id="s678">And whatever Jews were there, they sent ‘em to that labor camp in Deblin.</span> <span id="s679">This labor camp was next to a railroad station, on the outskirts of Deblin.</span> <span id="s680">Not walking distance, because we marched everyday to work from the airport.</span> <span id="s681">There was a military airport.</span> <span id="s682">So that night, we smuggled in, forced ourselves in.</span> <span id="s683">We bring ourselves to be in this camp.</span> <span id="s684">And the reason we were in this camp, my uncle, my mother’s younger brother, was there, and one of my cousins.</span> <span id="s685">They were already in the camp working there.</span> <span id="s686">So this same night, when they liquidated the city of Deblin, they also came to the camp and weeded out some people.</span> <span id="s687">At that time I separated myself from my four sisters.</span> <span id="s688">I somehow smuggled myself into the camp, before my sister had a chance.</span> <span id="s689">The camp was fenced over - barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s690">And barracks, there.</span> <span id="s691">Ran into a toilet.</span> <span id="s692">There was a public toilet, a long barrack, a toilet.</span> <span id="s693">This was daylight yet.</span> <span id="s694">And I sat in the toilet while all the people were taken out, weeded out.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">And I stood in the toilet and seen a German, marching back and forth, because they had surrounded the camp.</span> <span id="s696">Thinking, at all times, ach!</span> <span id="s697">If the German would have to go in and relieve himself, and he sees me there?</span> <span id="s698">Would have shot me on the spot.</span> <span id="s699">So the whole night, all I was seeing is the German coming in and shooting me in the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: But it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Obviously, I’m sitting here and I’m telling you this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Another stroke of luck!</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Literally, you know.</span> <span id="s704">I’m a believe in shiksal.</span> <span id="s705">Don’t ask me to spell again.</span> <span id="s706">Shiksal in German means “destiny.”</span> <span id="s707">I firmly believe in destiny.</span> <span id="s708">At the same time while I was sitting in that toilet there, waiting till that thing gets over, my sisters - all four of my sisters - were laying in a dumpster, one on top of the other, outside of the camp!</span> <span id="s709">And this lasted for quite a few hours till sometime at midnight.</span> <span id="s710">After that thing was done, over, I came out to see if the Germans left.</span> <span id="s711">I came in the camp.</span> <span id="s712">My uncle wasn’t there no more.</span> <span id="s713">He was taken away.</span> <span id="s714">My cousin was taken away.</span> <span id="s715">And my sisters climb out of that dumpster and come into the camp.</span> <span id="s716">Nobody there!</span> <span id="s717">The only person we knew there is my uncle’s brother.</span> <span id="s718">The brother was not an uncle to me, because there was my mother’s brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s719">But there was a brother and he really took care of us.</span> <span id="s720">And we had my aunt, at that time my aunt.</span> <span id="s721">Her husband was taken away and she was let alone there in this camp.</span> <span id="s722">Maybe I should clarify how I happened to get in and why we got into the camp!</span></p> <p><span id="s723">As I said, earlier, that we came back to Deblin hoping that our family is still there, hoping that town is still there.</span> <span id="s724">But when we came back, the facts were that Deblin was made judenrein, meaning they took all the Jews.</span> <span id="s725">They cleared out the town of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: And then you explained that there was a work camp on the outskirts of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: There was a camp on the outskirt of town, while the town was still in effect.</span> <span id="s728">There was some labor camp!</span> <span id="s729">We knew that my uncle - my mother’s younger brother - was in this camp with his wife.</span> <span id="s730">When there was no more town, no more houses, no more Jews, we didn’t have no place to go but either go to the camp or go someplace else.</span> <span id="s731">So we chose, on our own, to go to this labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: My question is, you were quite successful as passing for Aryan.</span> <span id="s733">Why did you not choose to mingle in the gentile population?</span> <span id="s734">To go to another town?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I cannot tell you “why.”</span> <span id="s736">We didn’t sit and figure out, “What should we do now?</span> <span id="s737">What should we do then?</span> <span id="s738">What will our course of action be?”</span> <span id="s739">The most natural thing it was to come - at that time, my uncle was considerable older than us - hoping that he’d be the leader of the family.</span> <span id="s740">So it was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s741">We didn’t give it any thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And yet you had full knowledge of what happened to Jews who were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: We did not have full knowledge, no.</span> <span id="s744">We did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: But you had seen so many slaughters of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I wouldn’t say actually slaughters.</span> <span id="s747">We saw a lot of people going away.</span> <span id="s748">Actually killing, I saw two incidents, plus taking the old people.</span> <span id="s749">But, no, we did not know.</span> <span id="s750">You’ve gotta bear in mind that I was at that time 12 years old.</span> <span id="s751">You’ve got the mentality of a 12-year-old child.</span> <span id="s752">And my oldest sister was at that time maybe 17 years old.</span> <span id="s753">So therefore we did not sit and plan strategy.</span> <span id="s754">Everything was according to our destiny.</span> <span id="s755">This happened to be the destiny.</span> <span id="s756">And we did not dwell on it.</span> <span id="s757">The most natural thing is to go to unite with my uncle.</span> <span id="s758">We went to this camp on our own.</span> <span id="s759">And that’s how we got in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">So after the Germans left, they took along with ‘em a whole bunch of Jews and loaded ‘em on trains.</span> <span id="s761">My uncle, he had a chance to jump.</span> <span id="s762">Some people jumped off the train.</span> <span id="s763">They knew where they were gonna be taken.</span> <span id="s764">He did not want to jump off the train.</span> <span id="s765">We heard that from other people that he said, “I have to go see what happened to our families.”</span> <span id="s766">He was a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Your uncle was taken from the camp by train, so that was a deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: How did he get out?</span> <span id="s770">Just jumped?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: He did not get out!</span> <span id="s772">He didn’t come back!</span> <span id="s773">He was taken away to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s774">We heard that thing from other people, that he had a chance to jump off from the train.</span> <span id="s775">He didn’t!</span> <span id="s776">Because he wanted to know what happened to our sisters and mothers and everybody else.</span> <span id="s777">He did not wanna do it!</span> <span id="s778">Deportation!</span> <span id="s779">The Jews were deported.</span> <span id="s780">That’s exactly the word I was looking for before.</span> <span id="s781">So we went out, more or less, on our own, voluntarily we went to this camp.</span> <span id="s782">Later on we became laborers.</span> <span id="s783">I happened to be assigned to what we called a bunker.</span> <span id="s784">In order to preserve potatoes for the German army, they dug out some huge holes, with bulldozers.</span> <span id="s785">And they put the potatoes in there, layered it with potatoes.</span> <span id="s786">Then we put straw and then dirt and then straw and dirt.</span> <span id="s787">Then later on, during the winter time, we pulled them out.</span> <span id="s788">We sorted them out.</span> <span id="s789">The potatoes went for the Germans.</span> <span id="s790">This was my assignment.</span> <span id="s791">Two of my sisters worked in the greenhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">But I want to tell you an incident what I did!</span> <span id="s793">What a tough little kid I was in camp!</span> <span id="s794">As I said, there was a German military airport.</span> <span id="s795">Obviously, the war went on.</span> <span id="s796">I don’t know whether these planes were shot down or disabled or crashed, but there was a lot of aluminum.</span> <span id="s797">Planes were made out of aluminum.</span> <span id="s798">And during my free time, while I was in the camp on the airport, I jumped in a plane, stole a big huge pipe, gave the pipe to a sheet metal man, gave him enough material so he can make two or three pots.</span> <span id="s799">I got one for free, and the rest of ‘em he fixed and sold.</span> <span id="s800">That’s how resourceful I was.</span> <span id="s801">And I also went around picking up cigarette butts, where the Germans were.</span> <span id="s802">Selling this tobacco to the people that smoked, we got money and we bought bread.</span> <span id="s803">During my breaks, while we were working there, I went to the Germans.</span> <span id="s804">Cleaned their houses.</span> <span id="s805">Fixed their homes.</span> <span id="s806">Polished their shoes.</span> <span id="s807">I spoke German, you know.</span> <span id="s808">And we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: You learned German through these years of traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s811">And we were resourceful.</span> <span id="s812">There were no problems, really.</span> <span id="s813">We were not hungry as others, as we found out later on.</span> <span id="s814">We had bread and water and soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And you knew how to take orders when you had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s817">And my little sister in that camp, Riva, she did not work.</span> <span id="s818">She stayed in the camp.</span> <span id="s819">A little girl.</span> <span id="s820">And we brought home the potatoes, we smuggled potatoes and stuff.</span> <span id="s821">And she was cooking for us when we came home.</span> <span id="s822">We had supper.</span> <span id="s823">It was a labor camp - truly a labor camp - but one day, one guy was stealing something and the Germans came to punish.</span> <span id="s824">So they called everybody out at night, and they hung two people - right in the middle of the camp.</span> <span id="s825">Two young guys were hung.</span> <span id="s826">And one incident, also, that happened in the camp, a guy smuggled something in, so they shot him right at the gate!</span> <span id="s827">And all those people that came in - from work - to the camp, had to walk over this guy as an example.</span> <span id="s828">Shot a man.</span> <span id="s829">In this camp we were till June, ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Before we leave this camp, I’d like to ask you what were the physical circumstances of this camp - the physical setting.</span> <span id="s831">You mentioned that your sister cooked!</span> <span id="s832">Did you have a separate area?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No.</span> <span id="s834">This camp consisted of four barracks.</span> <span id="s835">One barrack was just women.</span> <span id="s836">The other three barracks were for men.</span> <span id="s837">There were bunks.</span> <span id="s838">Long bunks, you know.</span> <span id="s839">There was no privacy.</span> <span id="s840">But, as a child - a child of 12 years old - I spent most of the time in the barracks with the ladies.</span> <span id="s841">I slept with the women.</span> <span id="s842">Towards the end - I would say sometime late ‘43, early ‘44 - I was asked to leave the barracks with the women and I was sent in to sleep with the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Were there any non-Jews in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Only Jews.</span> <span id="s845">As a matter of fact, this camp, believe it or not, I did not know at the time, but I know now, there were even some children born.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Were there any medical facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No, not that I know.</span> <span id="s848">There was a public kitchen there, a huge kitchen.</span> <span id="s849">And a stove.</span> <span id="s850">With everybody who had something to do, they could go and cook, and that’s how my sister was.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: In some camps, when a woman became pregnant, she was immediately killed.</span> <span id="s852">Did that happen there?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: At the time, I did not know, but afterwards we found out that a Jewish girl was pregnant - fathered by a German soldier.</span> <span id="s854">And they had twins!</span> <span id="s855">Believe it or not.</span> <span id="s856">And he took care of her.</span> <span id="s857">We didn’t know it at the time.</span> <span id="s858">There were some children there, to the age of five, four, three.</span> <span id="s859">And as we go on, I’ll tell you an incident what happened as we came to the new camp.</span> <span id="s860">So there were some children in this camp.</span> <span id="s861">It was really truly a labor camp, you know.</span> <span id="s862">And, as I said, it was relatively isolated.</span> <span id="s863">We didn’t have no contact with the world at all.</span> <span id="s864">Certainly I didn’t.</span> <span id="s865">Maybe other people had some access to other things, but as far as I was concerned , we were the only Jews left in this world.</span> <span id="s866">So, we worked, every day.</span> <span id="s867">We were going to work in the morning, come back at night, and sitting around.</span> <span id="s868">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s869">There was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s870">And this was till ‘44.</span> <span id="s871">As the Russians started the second front, and they started advancing, the Germans decided to liquidate, to keep moving on.</span> <span id="s872">Maybe there were about 600 people in this camp all together.</span> <span id="s873">There weren’t many.</span> <span id="s874">It was a relatively small camp.</span> <span id="s875">And they loaded us on the railroad cars with open doors.</span> <span id="s876">We were not cooped up, but nevertheless, we were just like cattle.</span> <span id="s877">With guards sitting there.</span> <span id="s878">And we stopped on the way.</span> <span id="s879">The next camp was the town Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s880">This was a holy town.</span> <span id="s881">Matter of fact, the Pope - Pope John the II?</span> <span id="s882">- he was just there.</span> <span id="s883">So we were brought to this camp.</span> <span id="s884">We found out also, in this particular town, there were three other camps.</span> <span id="s885">As we were unloaded, they took everything away from us!</span> <span id="s886">And as I told you earlier, in the Deblin camp, the labor camp, there were some children the age of three and four.</span> <span id="s887">So there were a total of 15 children among the 600 people.</span> <span id="s888">When we came to this camp in Czestochowa, we were lined up.</span> <span id="s889">I was lucky, you know.</span> <span id="s890">I was sent right into the camp, among the laborers.</span> <span id="s891">Whether I was big enough or small enough, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s892">I was fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">My sister, Riva, at that time she was 11 or 12 years old.</span> <span id="s894">She happened to hold a baby - somebody else’s child - in her hand.</span> <span id="s895">Wasn’t hers.</span> <span id="s896">She was ordered to drop this child!</span> <span id="s897">To give it away!</span> <span id="s898">She was sent into the camp with the laborers - even though children children of her age were taken away the same day and killed.</span> <span id="s899">So 15 children that survived Deblin, when we came to Czestochowa, were all killed.</span> <span id="s900">My sister Riva’s luck was the fact that she held the child, somebody else’s child, that’s why she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">In this camp we worked.</span> <span id="s902">Again, there was a converted stable, a barn.</span> <span id="s903">Bunks, four stories high, and there were 600 of us in there where we slept.</span> <span id="s904">We lived there in this camp for six months.</span> <span id="s905">I happened to work nights.</span> <span id="s906">We produced in this camp bullets for the German army.</span> <span id="s907">Not the shell, but the bullet part, the thing that kills.</span> <span id="s908">The department that I worked, we were washing the bullets.</span> <span id="s909">And my sisters working in a different department.</span> <span id="s910">And my younger sister, Riva, that she never worked in the other camp, in this camp she was walking around the floors and picking up all the scrap and all the metals.</span> <span id="s911">The reason we stayed there for six months, ‘cause the Russians decided to stay at the Vissla River in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">When they opened up the front, January of 1945, the Russians kept on advancing.</span> <span id="s913">But before I say this thing, I should tell you a week earlier, before January 17, 1945, what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s914">They called everybody out in the big yard, and they said, “You, you, you, you, you, you...” Loaded ‘em up.</span> <span id="s915">Took ‘em farther away to Germany.</span> <span id="s916">I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s917">They didn’t take me.</span> <span id="s918">On Tuesday, January 16, they called us out again, another group.</span> <span id="s919">They said, “You, you, you, you, you...you’re going!”</span> <span id="s920">And they marched us into a huge warehouse waiting to be loaded on the train.</span> <span id="s921">This was Tuesday, January - and I tell you why I remember it - January 16.</span> <span id="s922">They put us in a huge warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">I did not know what happened to my sisters then.</span> <span id="s924">We were very fortunate, all the time I spent with my sisters, but I didn’t know whether they were taken out or not, because they took the men separate and the women separate.</span> <span id="s925">At this time I want to tell you what heroic sister that I had, my sister Ann.</span> <span id="s926">If they were going to be publicized, she should get the credit for it.</span> <span id="s927">Now remember, I had four sisters.</span> <span id="s928">My younger sister at that time was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s929">My oldest sister at that time was already 20.</span> <span id="s930">So when they lined up the girls to be taken away to Germany further - because the Germans kept on taking Jews further into Germany, for laborers - so when they called out my little sister’s name, my oldest sister stepped forward - because she know that the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s931">She stepped forward, her and my other sister, and we all were in this barrack.</span> <span id="s932">And my younger sister, which she should have been there, was left in the camp.</span> <span id="s933">If the Germans would be lucky, if their luck wouldn’t’ve run out, chances are we would be more in Germany, and my little sister would’ve survived because my older sister stepped forward instead of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">The warehouse was cement.</span> <span id="s935">I said, “Kids, we not going.</span> <span id="s936">We’re going to be liberated here.</span> <span id="s937">Here we’re going to be liberated.”</span> <span id="s938">All of a sudden I became political, already!</span> <span id="s939">Saw airplanes flying and bombarding and everything, so I was going to dig out a huge hole there from this cement and hide ourselves, so we’d survive.</span> <span id="s940">We knew the liberation was coming at that time.</span> <span id="s941">But as it turned out, I didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s942">A few hours went by and the Germans didn’t come in, didn’t come into this warehouse and scare us like they did all the time.</span> <span id="s943">The railroad car was already waiting for us to be loaded.</span> <span id="s944">“Cause there was a factory, they had some tracks.</span> <span id="s945">So hours went by.</span> <span id="s946">No soldier.</span> <span id="s947">No nothing.</span> <span id="s948">Then later on towards the evening, was getting dark already, one German, what the called the master - the foreman - came in and said, “Okay, go back in camp.”</span> <span id="s949">They still stood with guns, but, “You can go back in the camp.”</span> <span id="s950">And within an hour or two, they ran away, the Germans.</span> <span id="s951">Because they did not have time to take us away, on 17th, Wednesday, we were liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Now, we start a whole new “meisse.”</span> <span id="s953">The night that we were liberated.</span> <span id="s954">Out of anger, we went into the headquarters of the German leader and we burned his house.</span> <span id="s955">I got his hat, but later on somebody took it away from me, too.</span> <span id="s956">We raided a warehouse.</span> <span id="s957">I brought two cans of honey, and I saw somebody carrying two bread, and I went and I told ‘em, “Why should you have two breads and my sisters don’t have nothing!”</span> <span id="s958">I stole away from him.</span> <span id="s959">This was in the night of the camp.</span> <span id="s960">This was Wednesday the 17th.</span> <span id="s961">There was a very stupid part, on our part, to do what we did, but as it turned out, it turned out to be okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Early in the morning we saw the Germans were in there.</span> <span id="s963">My sister and I and her boyfriend, we took a bike - he had a bike - we loaded up with some food or something.</span> <span id="s964">I gave a can of honey to my other sisters.</span> <span id="s965">And I left three sisters behind in camp after the liberation.</span> <span id="s966">Started marching again, further to Poland, back to that town Deblin.</span> <span id="s967">By foot!</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: You wanted to know if there was anybody left!</span> <span id="s969">Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Instinct.</span> <span id="s971">Going back.</span> <span id="s972">Run away from the front farther into Poland.</span> <span id="s973">Maybe he knew more that the Poland is liberated already.</span> <span id="s974">Of course, I did not know.</span> <span id="s975">I was 14 years old at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Well, what about the Russians who liberated you?</span> <span id="s977">Did they give you nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: I did not see a Russian when they liberated us.</span> <span id="s979">When dawn broke we ran out - I ran out - from the camp.</span> <span id="s980">I did not see a Russian liberator actually in the camp.</span> <span id="s981">But later on we saw Russian, as we were going deeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: So you really weren’t certain of what Russian rule would be like at any rate.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Whether or not you wanted to be associated with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">AP: No, we did not know.</span> <span id="s986">I stayed with the Russians only for six months in Poland.</span> <span id="s987">Maybe should be enough now.</span> <span id="s988">We start with, from this point, we continue some other time because now is a new chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Just the experience, the experience of my sister and I and her boyfriend when we left the camp.</span> <span id="s990">As I said, our first impulse was to run away from the camp, run deep into Poland.</span> <span id="s991">Why, don’t ask me, I have no knowledge.</span> <span id="s992">But I should go back one minute further, the resourcefulness on my part.</span> <span id="s993">(Laughs) What I did prior to liberation.</span> <span id="s994">We had again, a public toilet.</span> <span id="s995">For the public in the camp while the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s996">And I felt, you know, that the Russians were coming and the Russians going to liberate us, and it’s the end of the Germans.</span> <span id="s997">So the way the toilet was built, there was a big huge boxes.</span> <span id="s998">I was going to go into the toilet - not in the toilet, in the building.</span> <span id="s999">In the toilet where, actually, the toilet goes down.</span> <span id="s1000">Hide myself inside.</span> <span id="s1001">And I was gonna take another guy into it to do the same thing, too.</span> <span id="s1002">I felt that we were going to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">But now going back that morning when we left the camp with the bike.</span> <span id="s1004">As we were walking, walking, deeper and deeper, we saw an awful lot of Germans already killed.</span> <span id="s1005">We walked through a forest where we saw a German burned.</span> <span id="s1006">Tanks were running over them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Germans were burned, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: They were burning.</span> <span id="s1009">Evidently there was a front there.</span> <span id="s1010">The German soldiers were burning.</span> <span id="s1011">Probably from the tanks or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: They were burning?</span> <span id="s1013">Or they were burning the countryside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Burning.</span> <span id="s1015">They were burning.</span> <span id="s1016">They were burnt bodies - burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So they had been attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: They had been attacked.</span> <span id="s1019">Soldiers, soldiers.</span> <span id="s1020">And we saw some German soldiers fleeing out with a tank.</span> <span id="s1021">But I have to tell you, at this time I experienced, maybe the second or third day as we were walking - we were walking all the time towards the town of Deblin - we had an experience that my sister almost got killed by a Russian.</span> <span id="s1022">Not because of Jewish, because of the drunken Russian thinking that she was a young lady - a very attractive girl.</span> <span id="s1023">And he cased her with a gun in his hand.</span> <span id="s1024">Maybe he was drunk.</span> <span id="s1025">Fortunately, she ran into a farm, and she hid, and survived.</span> <span id="s1026">She could’ve got killed, not because we were Jews, because of some drunken soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">You know, all the experiences we were going through is as though somebody was watching over us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A Russian truck gave us a ride.</span> <span id="s1029">We hitchhiked, so he picked us up, my sister, her boyfriend, and myself.</span> <span id="s1030">It was an enclosed truck, and there was a big, huge oven in there, too.</span> <span id="s1031">So with the bike we sit in this truck and we were going.</span> <span id="s1032">There were some antitank holes, ditches.</span> <span id="s1033">You’ve got any idea what they are?</span> <span id="s1034">They’re real big, huge holes where the tank falls in.</span> <span id="s1035">Would you believe it that our truck fell into this ditch?</span> <span id="s1036">And we climbed out.</span> <span id="s1037">Nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s1038">That oven that was in there could’ve crushed us to pieces!</span> <span id="s1039">So we climbed out and we continued going on foot.</span> <span id="s1040">And we slept in the Polish farms.</span> <span id="s1041">One night my sister had a terrible scare.</span> <span id="s1042">I happen to have a tendency to speak in my sleep and dream a lot.</span> <span id="s1043">So we spent the night there in a Polish people’s farm and we were very careful not to tell them that we’re Jews.</span> <span id="s1044">We still were afraid.</span> <span id="s1045">Sure enough, I spoke at night Jewish!</span> <span id="s1046">And evidently that Polish farmer heard me speak a foreign language.</span> <span id="s1047">So in the morning the gentile woman says to my sister, “What did your brother speak?</span> <span id="s1048">We heard him speak something, but it wasn’t Polish.”</span> <span id="s1049">So we said, “It wasn’t - he spoke German, because you know we were in German concentration camps and he learned the language and he spoke German.”</span> <span id="s1050">And they served breakfast, and we were on our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">We came in a town - a larger town in Poland - at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1052">And there we congregated among Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1053">We kind of had a feeling of intuition that the other person might be Jewish, also.</span> <span id="s1054">So we had a signal among ourselves, among Jewish people, how to identify whether another person is also Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1055">The signal - the password, I should say - was “am cho.”</span> <span id="s1056">Every Jewish person knew what “am cho” means.</span> <span id="s1057">“Am cho” is a Hebrew word, which means “our nation.”</span> <span id="s1058">So we’d ask “am cho?”</span> <span id="s1059">and if he said, “yes,” we knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1060">So sure enough, in that railroad station, we came across some people, and we said, “Am cho?”</span> <span id="s1061">They said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1062">And then we got to talking and we found that they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1063">But they were liberated six months prior to us.</span> <span id="s1064">And as it turned out, they knew my mother’s cousin.</span> <span id="s1065">We found out that my mother’s cousin lives in Lublin, and we took the train there, my sister, her boyfriend and myself, to the city of Lublin.</span> <span id="s1066">Lublin was liberated six months prior to us.</span> <span id="s1067">When we came there, I went up to my cousin’s house.</span> <span id="s1068">His wife’s nephew was in an orphanage home in Lublin, and he suggested to me that I should be admitted to that orphanage home.</span> <span id="s1069">And sure enough, I went out with that other boy - this was in January of 1945, in Poland - and I was admitted to that orphanage home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">My sister found an apartment.</span> <span id="s1071">There was a house there, refugees, the people that just came out from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1072">Not known to us, my other three sisters left on their own also, with the same intention, coming back to the city of Deblin, where my parents come from.</span> <span id="s1073">They also walked.</span> <span id="s1074">On the way there was an air raid by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1075">They were not quite sure whether we were liberated or not.</span> <span id="s1076">And bombs fell and my sister, my older sister, was wounded.</span> <span id="s1077">Shrapnel hit her in the head and on the back, and one young lady was killed right next to her.</span> <span id="s1078">And of course they went on and they ended up going to the town of Deblin without them knowing that we were already in the town of Lublin.</span> <span id="s1079">But after a while we all got together again, all my three sisters came to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1080">Two of my sisters came also and joined me in that orphanage home.</span> <span id="s1081">My older sister went to the building where they housed all the Jewish adults.</span> <span id="s1082">In the orphanage home we were there for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">At the time I did not know but the woman in charge of the orphanage home which she was a Jewish person but it turned out she was a Communist.</span> <span id="s1084">So the intention of the home was maybe obviously to make us Communist Jewish youth.</span> <span id="s1085">The Russian scouts, you see some of them with the red shirts and ties.</span> <span id="s1086">Anyhow, while we were there we were fed, we got new clothes and we start to learn, but we really didn’t spend too much time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">There were some other children that are survivors.</span> <span id="s1088">I think there were at least 30 or 40 children at that orphanage home.</span> <span id="s1089">I found out that some children of the orphanage home meeting secretly someplace, some older children.</span> <span id="s1090">And I was curious to know where.</span> <span id="s1091">As I said they were meeting secretly in somebody’s house.</span> <span id="s1092">So one day a friend of mine and myself followed these two people from the orphanage home where they’re going and we followed them through streets back and forth.</span> <span id="s1093">Finally we confronted them and found out they were meeting secretly through a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1094">The Zionist organization tried to recruit children to come, recruit them to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1095">We confronted them and they didn’t have no choice but to take us in.</span> <span id="s1096">We were very happy they took us in.</span> <span id="s1097">At that time they inspired us, indoctrinated us.</span> <span id="s1098">Our goal - as a matter of fact, I would venture to say that at this time even I didn’t know then 99.9 percent of all the survivors that survived the concentration camps, their goal was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1099">And when I found this thing out, that there was a secret organization, that they organized children and wanted to bring them to Israel, I joined the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">After a while they organized us and took a group of people, and from there we went to Germany but it was a really long process.</span> <span id="s1101">It took a really long time.</span> <span id="s1102">We went from one town to a city, to another city, to another city.</span> <span id="s1103">As a matter of fact we got all a whole bunch of youths and adults also from Poland, survivors from concentration camps, and they put us up in railroad cars - not passenger cars - but regular railroad cars that were open.</span> <span id="s1104">We were supposed to cross the Polish border going into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1105">From Czechoslovakia we went into Germany but on the border of Poland and Czechoslovakia our train was stopped.</span> <span id="s1106">They told us to say, if the Russians would come in and ask us to say who we were, we were supposed to say that we were Greek Jews, liberated from concentration camps and going back to Greece.</span> <span id="s1107">At that time I didn’t know how to speak Hebrew so we spoke some words from the prayers to confuse them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">But we had a very, very dramatic experience ... when I say we, I mean my sisters and I ... two of my sisters who were in the orphanage home and myself, Etta and Riva, so when we were stopped we always feared when the Germans, we didn’t know what they were going to do with us.</span> <span id="s1109">So we ran away from the train.</span> <span id="s1110">And they chased us, and they caught us.</span> <span id="s1111">Again they put us in police station and they questioned us.</span> <span id="s1112">It was a really very very dramatic experience - one of the experiences I’ll always remember the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">They asked us in Czech, “vodkady,” which means where are you from.</span> <span id="s1114">In Polish, vodka which is a drink so I said at that time, everytime I have the opportunity I say this joke about it, I said, “Sir, we don’t have any vodka!”</span> <span id="s1115">He wanted to know where we are from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">We were let go and we went back to Prague, the main city in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1117">From there we got organized again, we were regrouped again, ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Do you know the name of the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: It was a Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Was it one of the international Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: It was a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1122">I think we spent about two, three days in Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1123">We were regrouped again, and this time with trains we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1124">In Germany we came into a camp, Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1125">We spent in this camp only about, maybe two, three days.</span> <span id="s1126">Out of the whole groups they took about 20 children age 12 to 18.</span> <span id="s1127">And they sent us to a sanatorium in Germany to get well.</span> <span id="s1128">In that sanatorium we were for a few months.</span> <span id="s1129">We were under the auspices of a Zionist organization, what party, we don’t know, but it was a Jewish Zionist organization with the intent to send us to Israel.</span> <span id="s1130">Then the same group was sent to a town in Germany by the name of Feldafing.</span> <span id="s1131">And there we were organized as a kibbutz, and we were taught Hebrew and Zionistic ideas, and writing and reading.</span> <span id="s1132">Our goal was to go to Israel - two of my sisters and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">My other two sisters, meanwhile, married and they had husbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Were you able to get any information about any other surviving members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Others, no.</span> <span id="s1136">I’m glad you asked that thing, because most in our minds, we always were hoping that we’re going to see my mother survive, or my sister survive, or my cousin survive, or uncle survive.</span> <span id="s1137">So whenever the survivors got together, “Did you know of him?</span> <span id="s1138">Did you know of him?</span> <span id="s1139">Did you know him?”</span> <span id="s1140">Our hope was always there.</span> <span id="s1141">As a matter of fact, while you ask this thing, till this very day, although I know it’s never going to happen, whenever we travel to Israel, I always hope that we’re going to see a face that we’re going to recognize as from my relatives - this this very day!</span> <span id="s1142">I have it always in the back of my mind, knowing that it’s never going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">And I have another experience of mine in Israel, as an Israeli soldier in Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Anyhow, we were in this camp for a while in Feldafing, in that kibbutz environment, and our goal was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1145">I was very dedicated!</span> <span id="s1146">I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1147">They selected a group of people from this larger group, a small group of 10 to 15 people - the most able ones, the most adult ones and the older ones, and they were sent away to Israel - illegally.</span> <span id="s1148">And I couldn’t wait, so I left this camp, and I went to live with my sister in a suburb of Munich.</span> <span id="s1149">And I went to school there, started school, at the age of 15, 16, already.</span> <span id="s1150">In April, ‘46, evidently the Jewish Sochnut, which was a Jewish organization that would send Jews to Israel, the British government allowed a thousand surviving children from the concentration camps to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1151">And I was so happy.</span> <span id="s1152">I was so thrilled, you know.</span> <span id="s1153">And I came home to my sister’s and told her, “Guess what!</span> <span id="s1154">You’re going to find me,” - and there’s the joke on me to this very day - “I’m going to Israel and you’re going to find me there with a shovel on my shoulder and building Israel!”</span> <span id="s1155">So this was at the age of 16.</span> <span id="s1156">And my brother-in-law always reminds me of that thing.</span> <span id="s1157">And I left my four sisters without any fear at the age of 16.</span> <span id="s1158">Went to Israel on my own.</span> <span id="s1159">And they were left behind.</span> <span id="s1160">But we knew, I knew, they knew, that their intention then was all of us, we’re going to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">So on April 9, I left Munich via train to Marseille, France.</span> <span id="s1162">There they were gathered, the whole 1,000 children were gathered there.</span> <span id="s1163">From there we boarded a ship, Champaleau, and we sailed for Israel.</span> <span id="s1164">You heard of Mufti?</span> <span id="s1165">Grand Mufti of Jerusalem?</span> <span id="s1166">Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was on the same ship that we were on.</span> <span id="s1167">And we stopped in Tunis, at which he got off.</span> <span id="s1168">And then we stopped in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1169">Then the next stop was Haifa.</span> <span id="s1170">And on April 27, 1946, we arrived in israel, Haifa - legally.</span> <span id="s1171">I was fortunate to enter legally with the blessing of the British government.</span> <span id="s1172">Then we were brought into Camp Atlit, which is very known in Israel.</span> <span id="s1173">And we didn’t have no choice where we’re gonna go.</span> <span id="s1174">Everything was assigned for us.</span> <span id="s1175">I didn’t know what party I belonged to or which party I had to choose from.</span> <span id="s1176">So out of the group of children, they took 15 children and they assigned us to the kibbutz by the name of Kfar Menachem.</span> <span id="s1177">As it turned out, this Kfar Menachem, the kibbutz, was in the south of Israel.</span> <span id="s1178">And the kibbutz happened to be a Hashomer Hatzair, a left-wing-oriented kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">We came there.</span> <span id="s1180">We were the first 15 children, known as Youth Aliyah.</span> <span id="s1181">And we were assigned teachers.</span> <span id="s1182">Then about two weeks later or so, another group of children joined us, and we were a total of 30 children - boys and girls.</span> <span id="s1183">A half a day we went to school and a half a day we worked.</span> <span id="s1184">We had our choice of what kind of work, what kind of occupation we wanted.</span> <span id="s1185">Obviously everything is related in the kibbutz, because a kibbutz is self-sustaining.</span> <span id="s1186">Work on a farm, construction, in the barn, in field, tractors.</span> <span id="s1187">I chose to be a builder, because I wanted the feeling that I build with my toil and my sweat - to build a country.</span> <span id="s1188">So I chose to be working in construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">So half a day I work in construction and half a day we learned in school.</span> <span id="s1190">So really, my formal education that I got, in Israel, was a course of two years, and I consider that the equivalent of a high school education.</span> <span id="s1191">This was my formal education, because in Poland I had only a chance to go through the third grade, and from ‘39 to ‘46 I hardly went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">So this is the experience we had in Israel.</span> <span id="s1193">In 1947, I joined the Haganah at the age of 17.</span> <span id="s1194">This, too, was a very dramatic day in my life.</span> <span id="s1195">I remember vividly that one early morning, in the kibbutz, secretly from the British, because the British were still in Israel, we were training to be paramilitary people, with old rifles.</span> <span id="s1196">But finally we graduated to the point that we could be allowed to join, officially, the Haganah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">And one early morning - real early morning - we got up, and we drove to another kibbutz - Kibbutz Nekbah.</span> <span id="s1198">It was further south from my kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1199">We spent the night there.</span> <span id="s1200">The following morning, as soon as the sun rose, we lined up in front of rifles and we give the oath, to be a member of the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1201">it was a very proud moment in my life, knowing that we put our life on the line for israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">We spent another year in that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1203">By that time we were 18 years old already, and it was 1948.</span> <span id="s1204">And in 1948, you know, they were talking about the independence of Israel.</span> <span id="s1205">So there were 30 children.</span> <span id="s1206">Ten of us volunteered to go into the service.</span> <span id="s1207">Twenty from this same children went and start a kibbutz on their own.</span> <span id="s1208">But I was among the 10 that volunteered to go into the Israeli navy.</span> <span id="s1209">At the time, they didn’[t have a navy yet, but the group that I belonged to was the nucleus of the Israeli navy, and I served in the Israeli navy till 1950.</span> <span id="s1210">(Shows photo.)</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t know if this is of any interest.</span> <span id="s1212">This was just two years ago, we were in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Well, after having been a displaced person for so many years - for most of your life - how did it feel being in Israel, a country where people had a language and a culture in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Very much proud!</span> <span id="s1215">As a matter of fact, one day when we had to go out to battle - I’m talking about during the ‘48 war, I was in the War of Independence - and before you’d go out to battle, they’d ask you something, “In the event that you get killed, who should we notify?”</span> <span id="s1216">And I didn’t have nobody in Israel.</span> <span id="s1217">I said, “I haven’t got anybody.”</span> <span id="s1218">In the Haganah, with absolutely no fear, no fear to put my life on the line for the State of Israel, so I felt very good, very proud.</span> <span id="s1219">And I was real sad to find out that my sisters came to the United States, instead of to Israel - not because they wanted to come to the United States, they were very apologetic to me and asked for my forgiveness why they came here, not because they wanted to come to the United States, they were not allowed, they couldn’t have the opportunity to come to Israel (Palestine), because of the British.</span> <span id="s1220">So it was a really sad moment, you know.</span> <span id="s1221">We very much looked forward to all my sisters to come to Israel and settle in Israel and have a home of our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1223">The reunion was delayed.</span> <span id="s1224">But there must have been a strong sense of community in Israel in those early days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1226">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1227">I really loved, and I was a very dedicated member of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1228">I was not a materialistic person, although you cannot tell it by now.</span> <span id="s1229">A very dedicated member of the kibbutz and of Israel.</span> <span id="s1230">Worked hard.</span> <span id="s1231">My goal was to build Israel and for Israel to prosper.</span> <span id="s1232">But things didn’t quite work out, the way we wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: As I said, I was in the navy, participated in the War of Liberation.</span> <span id="s1235">And after the war, I went back to the kibbutz that that original group formed.</span> <span id="s1236">Remember now that we were 10 of us joined the service and 20 of them were left to go form a kibbutz of our own.</span> <span id="s1237">And I was assigned to this kibbutz in the Galil, northern Israel.</span> <span id="s1238">And our kibbutz was supposed to be a fishermen’s, cause some of us were in the navy, we so were supposed to be fishermen.</span> <span id="s1239">I looked forward to go be a member to the kibbutz, go back to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1240">And I was there for a few months.</span> <span id="s1241">Meanwhile, in ‘49 my sister immigrated to Israel with her husband and three children.</span> <span id="s1242">I asked the kibbutz to give me a leave of absence so I can go, having a close bond to my sisters - all during the concentration camp, and through home, we were a very close family - and with that close bond, I asked the the kibbutz to give me a leave of absence so I can go and help out my sister.</span> <span id="s1243">Well, they refused.</span> <span id="s1244">The committee on the kibbutz refused to give me that permission!</span> <span id="s1245">So I felt the love and dedication, the devotion to my sister, was obviously greater than the commitment to the kibbutz then, and I quit the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1246">I went with my sister, and moved in with her.</span> <span id="s1247">We had a one room apartment on a roof in Yaffo, the Arab city of Yaffo.</span> <span id="s1248">And I went to work - construction - again.</span> <span id="s1249">And I helped out my sister, I gave her all the money, and made sure that she’s comfortable.</span> <span id="s1250">But my sister, it turned out, didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s1251">She could not adapt herself to the climate and to the economy of Israel.</span> <span id="s1252">And these were awful bad times.</span> <span id="s1253">So in 1950, they decided to leave Israel, and they went back via Italy to Germany.</span> <span id="s1254">They went back to Germany with the three children.</span> <span id="s1255">I stayed in Israel.</span> <span id="s1256">I did not return to the kibbutz anymore.</span> <span id="s1257">I went on my own.</span> <span id="s1258">I worked in construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Meanwhile, I was left alone in Israel.</span> <span id="s1260">Two of my younger sisters - the two sisters that were with me in the orphanage home and in the kibbutz - immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s1261">And in ‘49, a third sister that was in Germany, also immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s1262">And they settled in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1263">The older sister was married, she had a child, she came in ‘49.</span> <span id="s1264">The first two sisters, they came in 1947, also in April.</span> <span id="s1265">So there were no more hopes that they’re going to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1266">And my fourth sister, who was in Israel and went back to Germany with the intention, also probably, would go back to the United States.</span> <span id="s1267">I found myself alone.</span> <span id="s1268">All those years, hard years, during the concentration camp, during the ghetto, we were always together, and here I was, all alone there, and my sisters were here.</span> <span id="s1269">So my sisters started to make arrangements to bring me across, bring me to the United States.</span> <span id="s1270">It was very difficult to do it.</span> <span id="s1271">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1272">We found out, In Israel, which has always combinations to do things, that there’s some people, they were what you call “machers,” which means “arrangers” - that there’s a way of leaving.</span> <span id="s1273">Israel was not against letting people out.</span> <span id="s1274">But in order to leave Israel, you had to have a visa - where to go.</span> <span id="s1275">So we found somebody that makes some of those arrangements, that for $400 he can arrange some papers for me to come to Canada.</span> <span id="s1276">This was in 1951.</span> <span id="s1277">And I didn’t have that kind of money.</span> <span id="s1278">So I wrote to my sisters in the United States - three of my sisters.</span> <span id="s1279">There was always the though of people in the Diaspora that the Jews in America - everybody’s a rich person.</span> <span id="s1280">I thought my sisters are very rich!</span> <span id="s1281">Little did I know that they were very poor, they worked very hard for their money.</span> <span id="s1282">And as a matter of fact I found out later on, that the $400 I’d asked to send for me, they had to go borrow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">But you know, our love and our closeness among ourselves were so close, they did.</span> <span id="s1284">They borrowed the $400, and they sent the money away to a person in Canada without knowing who they are or anything - I sent ‘em the address - and they sent me some piece of paper, and through that I had a visa to go to Canada.</span> <span id="s1285">So another fellow and myself got those papers and we came to Paris.</span> <span id="s1286">We found out they were all false!</span> <span id="s1287">They were all false papers!</span> <span id="s1288">So the $400, in effect, was wasted money.</span> <span id="s1289">We came into the Canadian embassy.</span> <span id="s1290">“We don’t know you.</span> <span id="s1291">We don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1292">So we found ourselves stranded in Paris without knowing the language, without money, without being able to go to work - anything.</span> <span id="s1293">We were there fro about six weeks in Paris.</span> <span id="s1294">Meanwhile I saw Paris (laughs) - as a poor boy.</span> <span id="s1295">I knew that one of my sisters - the same sister that was in Israel - went to Germany, Munich.</span> <span id="s1296">From Paris, we couldn’t’ve asked to come to Germany, because they wouldn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s1297">So we went up to the Austrian ambassador in Paris, telling him that we want to go to visit our graves in Austria of our relatives.</span> <span id="s1298">So they gave us a visa - a stamp.</span> <span id="s1299">We took the train in Paris to go to Austria, but in order to go to Austria, you had to go through Germany.</span> <span id="s1300">So here we went on the train, our passport was fine, we had a visa to go into Austria.</span> <span id="s1301">But while the train stopped in Munich, we just forgot about going to Austria!</span> <span id="s1302">In Munich we got off the train and we came into this camp, it still was a D.P. camp, in Farenwald.</span> <span id="s1303">So we got off the train there, and we came into that camp.</span> <span id="s1304">My sister and my brother-in-law with his children were there, and we got in there.</span> <span id="s1305">This was March, April of 1952.</span> <span id="s1306">And there, too, I was very resourceful.</span> <span id="s1307">I wanted to learn a trade, so I joined the ORT organization in this camp.</span> <span id="s1308">There was a lot of youth there.</span> <span id="s1309">There were about 600, maybe 1,000 displaced persons yet in that camp.</span> <span id="s1310">And everybody was waiting, not any more to go to Israel, but to go to America, Canada, South America.</span> <span id="s1311">And I joined the ORT school, to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s1312">As a matter of fact, I have a diploma - I was a tool and die maker.</span> <span id="s1313">But I didn’t stay there too long.</span> <span id="s1314">There was some opportunity there to earn money by being a furrier, doing some furs, so I went to work for a fellow.</span> <span id="s1315">And within a month or two, I went out on my own and I had my own company.</span> <span id="s1316">And I had two, three people working for me, and I did well there.</span> <span id="s1317">I really did.</span> <span id="s1318">But our goal was to go at time, already, to America.</span> <span id="s1319">And my sisters here tried everything.</span> <span id="s1320">As a matter of fact, that got the auspices of Senator Humphrey to help.</span> <span id="s1321">And I came to this country on a preference visa.</span> <span id="s1322">You know, to “unite the families.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And so you came to Minnesota at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1325">So I’m getting there!</span> <span id="s1326">On February 3, 1955, I was granted a visa to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1327">This was my first time I flew, from Germany to New York.</span> <span id="s1328">And from New York I took a train and came to Minnesota.</span> <span id="s1329">And that’s how I got here.</span> <span id="s1330">But my sister with her husband, still remained in this camp there.</span> <span id="s1331">But two days before our wedding, my sister and her children joined us.</span> <span id="s1332">So we were all united - except her husband.</span> <span id="s1333">Her husband remained yet in Germany, but within six weeks to two months he joined us here and we were all united again.</span> <span id="s1334">All of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: So you met your wife in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: I met my wife in Minneapolis, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: As you look back on that experience, what does it mean to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: What does it mean to me to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s1339">I never look at it in this way - what it means to me to be a survivor.</span> <span id="s1340">The unfortunate part was the fact that we were born Jewish, and just because we were born Jewish, there was a Hitler that persecuted us.</span> <span id="s1341">But I never look at what it means to me, you know.</span> <span id="s1342">We had to survive.</span> <span id="s1343">It was not the survival of the fittest.</span> <span id="s1344">I’m sure there were a lot of other people as smart and as strong as I was or my sisters were.</span> <span id="s1345">I mentioned it earlier in the interview that I definitely am a believer in “destiny.”</span> <span id="s1346">I had so many cousins - literally 20 to 30 cousins.</span> <span id="s1347">I had aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s1348">They were as smart as I am, as old as I am, I’m sure as strong as I was.</span> <span id="s1349">They did not survive.</span> <span id="s1350">Why I survived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1351">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Now your early upbringing was as an Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s1353">Have you returned to Orthodox belief?</span> <span id="s1354">Or to traditional Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: I never considered myself an Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s1356">I never said that we were brought up Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s1357">The Jewish people in Poland where I grew up, everybody was Jewish!</span> <span id="s1358">We did not know to eat “hazer” or to work on the holidays.</span> <span id="s1359">As I see it now, our home was a “traditional” home.</span> <span id="s1360">If they would be here today, it would be considered a Conservative home.</span> <span id="s1361">We were very traditional, observant Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">As I said, I never wore payus, that the Orthodox Jewish children wear.</span> <span id="s1363">I never wore a yarmulke at home.</span> <span id="s1364">I went without a hat.</span> <span id="s1365">As I mentioned earlier in the interview, my father didn’t wear a hat.</span> <span id="s1366">The only time he wore a hat, when he sat down to eat, and of course when he walked out.</span> <span id="s1367">So we were not considered Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1368">And I’m sorry to say - I’m not sorry to say, I should say - I never would consider myself religious, because I always questioned: Where was God.</span> <span id="s1369">When I saw really pious, religious Jews, rabbis, observant, how they were humiliated by the Germans, then I questioned: Where was God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">However, I’m a firm believer in the Jewish people, the Jewish nation, the survival of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1371">That’s why I have a very tough time about intermarriage.</span> <span id="s1372">I do not accept intermarriage.</span> <span id="s1373">I do not accept conversion.</span> <span id="s1374">There isn’t such a thing.</span> <span id="s1375">And I have a great conflict with myself with these things.</span> <span id="s1376">I don’t accept them.</span> <span id="s1377">Although the rabbis disagree with me, I don’t accept conversion.</span> <span id="s1378">I consider myself very nationalistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Now, people may ask, they say, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1380">You were such a big hero.</span> <span id="s1381">Why are you not there?”</span> <span id="s1382">Many times I have an inner guilt feeling why I am ini the United States.</span> <span id="s1383">I really should be in Israel.</span> <span id="s1384">I really never, never, am 100% here.</span> <span id="s1385">I wish the destiny would’ve been that my sisters would’ve followed me.</span> <span id="s1386">And we all would be in Israel, because for generations - for 2,000 years - the Jewish people dreamed and hoped to have a land.</span> <span id="s1387">Now they have this land, and they don’t go, and I’m sitting here.</span> <span id="s1388">I’m a paradox.</span> <span id="s1389">I really feel about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: You said, “My sitting here is a paradox.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1392">That’s right.</span> <span id="s1393">I really have a conflict with myself.</span> <span id="s1394">So I try to make it up with money, but it’s just not enough.</span> <span id="s1395">They really want the people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: So after what you went through at the hands of the Germans and the Poles, I suppose you ended up with a pretty negative view of human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Very negative.</span> <span id="s1398">Now let me tell you something, and it should be published.</span> <span id="s1399">They should know it: that the Poles - the majority of the Poles - did just as much damage to the Jews as the Germans themselves.</span> <span id="s1400">I’m glad you brought this thing up.</span> <span id="s1401">Many Jews, many thousands of Jews, were killed, murdered, by the Poles after the war - after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1402">It was natural among people - my sister experienced it, too - it was natural among people to come to small towns to see if anybody survived.</span> <span id="s1403">And when the Poles found out that “Yunkesmiehl” is in town, they came and they murdered them.</span> <span id="s1404">They killed them!</span> <span id="s1405">My sister, a friend of hers went to the town, and they killed her father.</span> <span id="s1406">We were fortunate.</span> <span id="s1407">That’s what I say, that “destiny.”</span> <span id="s1408">I don’t know how we survived.</span> <span id="s1409">And as far as the Germans, I could never, never, never forgive the Germans.</span> <span id="s1410">Never till the day I die!</span> <span id="s1411">But they say that we shouldn’t be filled with hatred for this generation.</span> <span id="s1412">It’s not their fault, this generation.</span> <span id="s1413">I personally can never, ever, ever forgive the German people for what they done to us.</span> <span id="s1414">‘Cause just because we happened to be Jewish, there was a Hitler.</span> <span id="s1415">So I’m very negative.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: So as far as your connection with Judaism now, do you consider yourself an observant Jew?</span> <span id="s1417">I know you have a strong connection with the synagogue and with Jewish organizations, but it’s still a “cultural” connection with Judaism, isn’t it, rather than a belief in a Supreme Being?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yes, correct.</span> <span id="s1419">We are not observant Jews.</span> <span id="s1420">But I believe in the Jewish people, culturally, I like the Jewish history, I speak the language - Hebrew, I understand of what we daven.</span> <span id="s1421">But even though I go to synagogue and sit and pray and know that I’m davening in, deep in my heart I do not believe in a ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: In a Supreme Being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: I do not believe it.</span> <span id="s1424">Sometime I question it, how it happened?</span> <span id="s1425">I don’t know, but I don’t believe.</span> <span id="s1426">No, no.</span> <span id="s1427">It is a conflict, because had there been one, He could not - a rabbi would say here, could tell you a million stories and excuses why it happened - but He could not permit this thing to happen.</span> <span id="s1428">He should not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: As your children were growing up, did you share these memories with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No, and I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1431">I’m sorry that I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1432">Not that I didn’t because I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1433">Unfortunately, they didn’t have the patience, you know, to sit down and hear me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: So in a way, they’ve been free to form their own conclusions about the world around them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1436">And it’s sad, it really is sad, you know.</span> <span id="s1437">I wish they would take the time.</span> <span id="s1438">And I wish they would sit down with me and say, “Dad” ...My children are old enough.</span> <span id="s1439">And I think I’ve failed in that sense.</span> <span id="s1440">You cannot impose on anybody, because to come and sit down and listen, you’ve got to be interested in it.</span> <span id="s1441">I wish they would solicit me telling, and say, “Dad, please tell me what you went through.”</span> <span id="s1442">And I’m comfortable to tell the thing.</span> <span id="s1443">For that same reason, to remember them.</span> <span id="s1444">But unfortunately, I’m sure many children, most of the children from the survivors...</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: I think they have a hard enough time coping with their own lives to know the truth about this particular episode in history.</span> <span id="s1446">It’s something they’d rather deny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: They shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1448">They shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1449">Out of curiosity themselves, from an intellectual point of view.</span> <span id="s1450">Here they have a source - ready source - to listen, to hear.</span> <span id="s1451">And no way to pass it on.</span> <span id="s1452">Well, our kids do know that I’m a survivor, that their aunts are survivors.</span> <span id="s1453">And what my wife mentioned yesterday, what we have instituted, quite a few years already, we started small, but now, every year, on January 17, our family gathers together.</span> <span id="s1454">And when I say, “our family” it’s my four sisters and myself, and we have since then grew to 55 of us - very close - brothers-in-law, sister-in-law, children - and dead children, already.</span> <span id="s1455">So, despite what Hitler wanted to do, we survived.</span> <span id="s1456">And now from the five, there’s already 55 of us, and hopefully even more.</span> <span id="s1457">And every time when we gather, we speak about our experiences.</span> <span id="s1458">And we tell this story, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: So your children have absorbed something from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: We maintain, and hopefully some day when they’re maybe a little older, they’ll find the time and sit down and listen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Well, I thank you for a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1462">You were telling me about your pledge of a large sum of money to the Technion in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: I have defected, I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1464">This country was very nice to me, very good to me.</span> <span id="s1465">In some way I’d like to pay it back.</span> <span id="s1466">And I recently pledged $100,000 to the Technion of Haifa.</span> <span id="s1467">Why the Technion of Haifa?</span> <span id="s1468">Because I felt education is a very important thing - for humanity, the people.</span> <span id="s1469">The fact that I was denied education, I want to make sure that some needy person shouldn’t be denied that education.</span> <span id="s1470">And if I can’t do that thing, I at least do it with money.</span> <span id="s1471">I’m a success in this country, I’m very thankful, and I pay it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">And speaking of paying back, it just occurred to me, most of the people that came to the United States were helped by the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1473">You know what HIAS is.</span> <span id="s1474">To the best of my knowledge, I was the only person here among the newcomers, what we call the newcomers - the émigrés to the United States, the survivors - I’m the only person that had paid back - was asked and paid back the cost, or fee, to bring me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">At the time when I was earning only $2.00 an hour, I received a letter from the HIAS organization: “Dear Mr. Mandel: We understand that you’re working now.</span> <span id="s1476">We would very much appreciate the fact that if you can pay us back so we can help other people...” And it was a very legitimate request.</span> <span id="s1477">And I paid back my share to the HIAS - even then.</span> <span id="s1478">Quite a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1479">And I also paid back my sisters for that $400 that they sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: You certainly don’t take your survival for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I don’t take my survival for granted, no.</span> <span id="s1482">Having a good living, my goal in life is to make so much money, to be very philanthropic, to build an orphanage home in Israel.</span> <span id="s1483">But right now, meanwhile, we are already supporting one, I think.</span> <span id="s1484">The Shaliach - this means an emissary from Israel - was in the JCC, and we got to know ‘em, and I told him also, a lot of people I tell my goal in life, what I like to do, and he said, “I have an excellent idea for you.</span> <span id="s1485">Now in this Kibbutz Sasa in Galil, is what you call Pinot Anne Frank - Anne Frank Haven, they named it - and a lot of deprived children, children from broken homes, go there, and as an orphanage home, and they offer them an education.”</span> <span id="s1486">And we send money to that school, too.</span></p></body></html>
