<span id="s87">The reason I left Teschen was because my father got a big statement from a very well-known doctor in Teschen and in this statement he said that my father has to have somebody take care of him and this was my sister Jennie.</span> <span id="s88">My brother left already for Nisko.</span> <span id="s89">This was a big Arbeitslager where they had to work, but later he was in Auschwitz too.</span> <span id="s90">So I went to Slovakia; first I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s91">EM: Excuse me, was there a ghetto established in Teschen?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">ET: No, not yet,

id="s94">ET: I don’t know because I left, but I’m sure they were taken to Sosnowiec, Bersburg, and from there they had to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s95">My parents were in Teschen till June ‘42 because they called them bevorzugten Juden [privileged Jews] and we had a big house and they made room for every Jewish family.</span> <span id="s96">They paid a lot of money to the S.S. and those were the last Jews going out from Teschen.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">EM: And they stayed in their own house?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ET: They stayed in their own house.</span> <span id="s99">They had one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">EM: And the other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">ET: Had the other rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">EM: Had the other rooms, so they were what you call privileged Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">ET: Privileged Jews, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">EM: And your sister, Jennie, also...?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">ET: Was with them the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">EM: Until she was sent...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">ET: ... to Auschwitz with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">EM: With your parents and...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">ET: In June ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">EM: And you never heard of them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">ET: Only after the war.</span> <span id="s112">I heard from Dr. Leo Zipper, he was a lawyer in Teschen and he was the head of the Jewish Community there and in [Dziedzice - Polish], he told me, they took him out of the transport because this transport went to Auschwitz directly and this is how he lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EM: So he told you that they were on this transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">ET: On this transport and Jennie too.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">EM: Now in the meantime you went to Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">EM: Where did you go, what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">ET: First of all, we went through the Beskids [Beskid Mountains-Beskydy in Slovak]; this was illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">EM: The Beskiden Mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">ET: Mountains, and they caught us but the Jewish communities from Slovakia, I don’t know how this was, they arranged we should go back with Slovakian police, but they left us in the woods and we went back again to Slovakia and I was in Zilina.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EM: Zilina.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">ET: Zilina, yeah, and I was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">EM: Do you know how to spell Zilina?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">ET: Yeah, Z-I-L-I-N-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">EM: So you went to Zilina...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">ET: And there they put us in Hachsharot and there I was in Zilina illegal, everything illegal.</span> <span id="s127">The Slovakian offices didn’t know that we are there, only a few, but others were Jewish Halutzim and this is how I was there till March ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">EM: There was persecution of Jews in Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">ET: Yes, it was, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">EM: In what form?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">ET: Because they looked for Jews.</span> <span id="s132">It was antisemitic, but not so bad like let’s say in Poland or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EM: But they didn’t send anybody out?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">ET: Not yet, till ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EM: Till ‘42.</span> <span id="s136">Now tell me what happened in 1942, what month.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">ET: What month, in March.</span> <span id="s138">I came to Auschwitz from Zilina.</span> <span id="s139">They took us in big wagons, in trains, and they said first that we go only to work for six weeks--Arbeitslager--now I can tell you about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EM: When did you work in sand pits?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">ET: When I came to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">EM: O.K., now tell me about your arrival in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">ET: There was only the men were there--ten blocks, and we got--because I’m in Slovakian transport, my number is 3931.</span> <span id="s144">This is the second Jewish transport.</span> <span id="s145">The first transport were only German prostitutes and they were our Kapos and I was in the sand pit...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">EM: Sand pit.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">ET: And we had to--with shovels, we had to put sand in lorries and put them on a big hill.</span> <span id="s148">It was very, very hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">EM: You were pushing the heavy lorries.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">ET: Pushing the lorries with the sand up the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">EM: And what was done with that sand, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">ET: They put it on big hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">EM: Big mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">ET: Big mountains, yes, and I got very sick.</span> <span id="s155">I had typhus.</span> <span id="s156">I saw the people are moving their lips, but I didn’t hear anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">EM: You went deaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">ET: Deaf, not completely.</span> <span id="s159">I think completely because I didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s160">So one of those days the Oberaufseherin came and they were looking for people who could work in an office because you have to know that in the beginning of ‘42 Auschwitz was like a new city.</span> <span id="s161">They looked for people--for working people who can do this, who can sew, who can iron, who can wash, I don’t know whatever, but first they looked for people who are office workers.</span> <span id="s162">So, I thought at least one day, I will be out of this sand pits and I put on a red kerchief on my head because I was bald--they had shaved my head--and in this time it was my destiny that I am now alive.</span> <span id="s163">The Oberaufseherin called me and 20 other girls went to the office.</span> <span id="s164">First we went to an examination.</span> <span id="s165">It was very funny because one girl before me, I remember like now, she said, she was not so young, that she’s 20 years, she had experience in the office.</span> <span id="s166">And I said the truth.</span> <span id="s167">I said I was three years in a lawyer’s office and we had to type, we had to do different things and I was admitted to this office.</span> <span id="s168">Right away they put us in the shower and they gave us fresh clothes and everything because we still had lice.</span> <span id="s169">And from this time I worked until the 18th of January ‘45 in this office.</span> <span id="s170">I filled out--my luck was that my penmanship was very good and the S.S. man, his name was Unterscharführer Kristan, liked my penmanship.</span> <span id="s171">What I did I wrote out the death, I filled out the death certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">EM: Could you tell me more about filling out these death--first of all, how many girls worked in that office?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">ET: I was in the Standesamt; this is like the Bureau of Registry.</span> <span id="s174">In the Standesamt worked around 25 girls.</span> <span id="s175">It was to fill out the files when somebody wrote to the office (to the Standesamt) [registry] they wanted the death certificate of the father or the relatives, this letter got the Unterscharführer Kristan and then another girl looked in the files, took out the name and she gave it to me and I had to fill out exactly as it was in this big, big books that was taken for the registry.</span> <span id="s176">First, we had to fill out, even for Jews, but later, I think it was in ‘43, only Gentile people who wrote to them, to the Standesamt, got the death certificates from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">EM: You mean that every Jew that was taken to Auschwitz was registered officially with--that if they died it was noted that that person died, in this book?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">ET: They didn’t take it so exactly with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s179">In the beginning we had all the details, but later they didn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s180">They didn’t register Jewish people any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">EM: But in the beginning they registered and if somebody died they wrote it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">ET: They put it down, but later not, especially when somebody went right to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s183">We didn’t have any dates any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">EM: No, you didn’t even have the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">ET: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s186">Like this I didn’t even know that my parents and my sister was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EM: So that’s what you did, you were filling out death certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">ET: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">EM: Now, could you tell me a little more about the cause of death that you had to put down?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">ET: It was written down sometimes when they saw it was an old man, they said, Altersschwäche or heart attack or pneumonia.</span> <span id="s191">They wrote down whatever they wanted and if somebody wanted the ashes, they thought maybe this is the ashes from this person, but they went to the crematorium and filled out a little bag and sent it to them.</span> <span id="s192">They didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">EM: But who put down, for instance, a heart attack or whatever reason for death?</span> <span id="s194">Was it from a doctor first or was it left up to the girls to put it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">ET: This was left to the girls who worked in this office.</span> <span id="s196">They wrote down whatever they thought is the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">EM: O.K., so it wasn’t really the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">ET: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s199">It was only--let them believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">EM: And could you tell me about the living conditions and the treatment that you received?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">ET: Sure.</span> <span id="s202">Our treatment, these people that worked directly for the S.S. had better treatment and we could keep ourselves clean and we got a little tiny piece of bread.</span> <span id="s203">They didn’t steal it from us because they were afraid we would go to the S.S. and tell them.</span> <span id="s204">So our living conditions were much, much--one hundred percent, maybe more than let’s say in Birkenau or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s205">We lived in Stabsgebäude [general staff building].</span> <span id="s206">This was very important.</span> <span id="s207">This was in the cellar, one big room where all these girls who had contact with the S.S. lived because the S.S. didn’t want to have sicknesses or lice.</span> <span id="s208">So we were really kept clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">EM: And you lived in a big building?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">ET: And they called it the Stabsgebäude.</span> <span id="s211">On upper floors lived the S.S. women and we were downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EM: O.K., how many girls to a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">ET: This was a big, big room so I don’t know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EM: You lived on bunk beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">ET: Bunk beds, but we had at least clean.</span> <span id="s216">Everything was very clean kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">EM: You had blankets?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">ET: We had blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">EM: You had pillows?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">ET: No, pillows we had, maybe, but I think it was straw inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">EM: And could you tell me, did you wear uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">ET: Yeah, we had striped dresses, striped.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">EM: Did you have any kind of insignia, some sign who you were, that you were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">ET: They recognized right away because we looked different, more like human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">EM: How about your hair, was that shaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">ET: I had my hair shaved I think three or four times.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">EM: It had to be shaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">ET: Yeah, because the S.S. women didn’t want that we should look like women.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EM: Could you tell me something about your experiences with S.S. men or S.S. women and about the attitudes, about the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">ET: As I mentioned before, I had typhus when I came to the Standesamt and there we had a Kapo, he was a Volksdeutscher [ethnic German] and he came from Koenigshütte.</span> <span id="s231">Koenigshütte was not far from Teschen and he spoke Polish and German.</span> <span id="s232">I was the only one who came from Poland, because this was in a Slovakian transport which I was taken, so I told him in Polish that I cannot sit on a little chair, so he really brought me a big chair and I could relax a little my back.</span> <span id="s233">He helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s234">He was, at least, a little bit human.</span> <span id="s235">But one day I had a very bad experience.</span> <span id="s236">I filled out some forms and there was ink with pen and the whole ink spilled on these papers and the S.S. came in--I don’t know who came in--which one, I know already Oberscharführer Quackernack was his name and he said, “Who did this?”</span> <span id="s237">So this Kapo had to tell that it was me so he hit me over my face maybe twenty times.</span> <span id="s238">And I thought I was sure he would send me to Birkenau and this is like death for me, it would be like death for me.</span> <span id="s239">But he didn’t send me so I survived and then I got better, I got better.</span> <span id="s240">I didn’t go to any revere, this is a hospital, because I asked when you go to a revere do you register and they told me yes, so I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s241">And it is destiny that I went through such a bad sickness.</span> <span id="s242">This was my very bad experience, but later I was good in my work that I did and this Kapo, his name was Krupka, liked me...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">EM: This was the Volksdeutscher?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">ET: It was the Volksdeutscher.</span> <span id="s245">But he liked all the girls because they worked for him.</span> <span id="s246">He was responsible, and the Jewish girls were very good in the office work so this is how I was there till 18 January of ‘42.</span> <span id="s247">From this time started my bad experience.</span> <span id="s248">We went with cattle trains to Ravensbrük and we thought this is the end.</span> <span id="s249">I was with my dear friend, who lives now in Tel Aviv, and one day--it was already very bad, we didn’t have anything to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">EM: This was in Ravensbrük?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">ET: This was already in Ravensbrük and they sent us to Camp Malchow.</span> <span id="s252">This was Malchow.</span> <span id="s253">So I went to one friend of ours, which was a doctor before the war, and we asked her, “How long will we live?”</span> <span id="s254">She said, “The most is six weeks more,” but then it was already liberated on the third of May of ‘45 and I came to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">EM: So where were you liberated in Malchow?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">ET: No, they called it...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">EM: Where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">ET: On the third of May the S.S. came, “Everybody out, out, we have to go, we have to leave this camp.”</span> <span id="s259">So we went and we went with dogs and suddenly they disappeared completely and we were on our own.</span> <span id="s260">We were afraid to be on the streets.</span> <span id="s261">Here bombs were falling and we saw so many German soldiers, but they didn’t mind us any more and we looked very bad.</span> <span id="s262">And we came to Trewitz.</span> <span id="s263">There came the Russians and the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">EM: Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">ET: Both came but the Russians stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EM: Where was Trewitz, East Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">ET: East Germany.</span> <span id="s268">And we came--we walked and we were very careful.</span> <span id="s269">There we were a group of ten girls, I remember, and we went to houses.</span> <span id="s270">We saw even on the table warm food, but we didn’t touch it.</span> <span id="s271">We were afraid maybe it’s poison.</span> <span id="s272">So we took farina a little bit.</span> <span id="s273">Some of the girls died.</span> <span id="s274">Because what I heard later, they ate everything and they were not used.</span> <span id="s275">We were very hungry; we were already Mussulmänner, but we were careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">EM: Could you tell me what did you do in Ravensbrük or in the other camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">ET: Malchow, this was near Ravensbrük.</span> <span id="s278">I worked with boxes, Kartonage they called it, and we got a little bit food.</span> <span id="s279">This was, I think, like a factory but it was very bad.</span> <span id="s280">My friend at this time didn’t work, so I brought her a little bit food.</span> <span id="s281">This was my very, very bad experience, like I mentioned before, from January till May ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">EM: I would like to know a little bit more about your experiences in Auschwitz itself.</span> <span id="s283">Could you tell me what you remember about your S.S. supervisors or the Kapo and anything you can tell me about his treatment of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">ET: Yes, this I can do.</span> <span id="s285">We had--our boss was Unterscharführer Kristan.</span> <span id="s286">He was very young.</span> <span id="s287">When he came in the room, even nobody was in his office, he saluted to Hitler.</span> <span id="s288">There was a big, big picture of Hitler and he was responsible for this whole office.</span> <span id="s289">One day we saw it very often, he went to the window and there were big, big, like here, mini-buses full of Polish men, Gentiles, and they came from jails, we knew that at this time, and they came to be executed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s290">He looked from the window and then he put on the gloves, and there was a crematorium, which was not in use, and he shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">EM: He shot them in the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">ET: In the crematorium.</span> <span id="s293">He came back and he started to laugh as if nothing would happen, but when he didn’t look at us, we looked from the window and we saw the men and they showed us that they are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s294">We didn’t want them to know so we made with our heads that no, no, you’re not being killed.</span> <span id="s295">But they were laughing.</span> <span id="s296">They gave us to understand that they know they came to Auschwitz for their end.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">EM: You mentioned something that he liked flowers, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">ET: When he looked from the window we had in the window some flowers in his office.</span> <span id="s299">He looked and he was very interested if they are growing or so--sometimes we could see that he was a little human being, but he hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s300">He said that we are the enemies and he was very, very bad to us.</span> <span id="s301">He knew that we are his enemies and we hate them too.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">EM: Did he hit the girls often?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">ET: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">EM: How many Jewish--were there all Jewish girls working in this office?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">ET: Only Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s306">My friend Lore Shelley, wrote a book about--the book’s name is Secretaries of Death because they told us we won’t live--we won’t be alive any more.</span> <span id="s307">We know too much.</span> <span id="s308">They will kill us.</span> <span id="s309">These were the secretaries of death, but what could we do?</span> <span id="s310">We worked in the office.</span> <span id="s311">It was destiny that we are still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">EM: And then when you were evacuated you were evacuated with other people from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">ET: Sure, all of them.</span> <span id="s314">They came all together.</span> <span id="s315">There came a big, big transport on the 18th of January ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">EM: Did you know what was going on in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s317">Did you know about the gas chambers and the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">ET: Yes, yes, we knew but the people didn’t want to tell us too much because we had enough knowledge already.</span> <span id="s319">There were the crematoriums and there were friends who told the people that they are going to the gas chambers that they should do something, but they didn’t believe them.</span> <span id="s320">They thought that they are factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">EM: Who?</span> <span id="s322">The people who were going to the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">ET: Gas chambers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">EM: Were you in contact with anybody that was in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">ET: No, we couldn’t, it would be death for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">EM: Now, let’s go back to the time when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s327">You said that the Russians and the Americans came but the Russians stayed...</span></p> <p><span id="s328">ET: Occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">EM: Occupied.</span> <span id="s330">Now where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">ET: From there we went--I went with the Czechoslovakian girls.</span> <span id="s332">There were Polish groups too, but I thought I would go to Czechoslovakia because I knew my cousin is living there so we went by train to Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s333">I wrote a telegram to my cousin, Arnosh, and he wrote me quickly back I should come to them and I was there a few weeks, but I wanted to go to my city where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">EM: Excuse me, now Arnosh, was he married to a non-Jewish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">EM: So was he in camp, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">ET: His wife...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s339">EM: So you were telling me about your cousin, our cousin, Arnosh.</span> <span id="s340">Could you tell me where he was during the war, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">ET: He was in labor camps, but he was married to a Gentile girl so he didn’t go to Auschwitz, let’s say, but the last year I think he was in Theresienstadt, but thank God he survived and he’s still alive with his wife and his family.</span> <span id="s342">But with him I went to Teschen and I looked for my family, but nobody was here only my brother, Alfred.</span> <span id="s343">I was in Czeske, Teschen...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">EM: That is the Czech part of Teschen.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">ET: The Czech part of Teschen because he said they start again the pogroms in Poland, so we were there and I met already my husband, which was during the war in Russia and we married in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">EM: Where did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">ET: In Katowitz [Katowice], this is in upper Silicia.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">EM: That was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">ET: In Poland and my son is born in 1948 in Katowitz and we emigrated to Israel in 1950.</span> <span id="s350">From 1950 to 1955 we were in Israel and we came to the United States because my husband had here a sister living and from this time I’m here in New York.</span> <span id="s351">My son and his lovely wife, Joan, and my two grandchildren are in Boston.</span> <span id="s352">He works for the Department of Transportation and they are very happy in their marriage and this is all what I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">EM: Could you tell me a little bit about your life in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">ET: In the United States from 1955 it was very, very hard in the beginning, but later it was better and we lived in the Bronx, but my husband passed away in 1970 and I remarried in 1972 to Oscar Turteltaub.</span> <span id="s355">But he, I’m sorry to say, passed away in 1976.</span> <span id="s356">From this time I’m a widow and go from time to time to Boston and my cousins in Willow Grove.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">EM: Could you tell me if you are in contact with some other women who were at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s359">The girls who lived in Statsgebäude who worked in the offices or in the Nähstuben or so we still are seeing each other or call each other.</span> <span id="s360">We meet and thank God everybody is pretty well off and we got older.</span> <span id="s361">It’s 40 years after the war, even a little bit more, and we see each other and I write to my friends in Israel and Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EM: Could you tell me, who was the girl who wrote the book, Secretaries of Death?</span> <span id="s363">What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">ET: This is a book and she gathered from all of our girls who worked in the Politishe Abteilung and in Standesamt [registry] and this girl was 17 years old when she was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s365">She worked in the Politishe Abteilung and she had a dream to make this book.</span> <span id="s366">Thank God her husband is very well off and this is a gift from him because the book came out.</span> <span id="s367">I don’t know how many people bought this book, but it came out by Shengold [Secretaries of Death, Lore Shelley, New York: Shengold Publishers, Inc., 1986.]</span> <span id="s368">.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">EM: But what is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">ET: Her name is Lore Shelley, L-O-R-E, second name, S-H-E-L-L-E-Y.</span> <span id="s371">She lives in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">EM: She wrote about all your experiences in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">ET: No, every girl had to write and I wrote there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">EM: Now, is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">ET: I would like to mention that I remember something that is very interesting.</span> <span id="s376">I hope for you too.</span> <span id="s377">After the war I met two girls, sisters.</span> <span id="s378">They came from Belgium and they told me something like this.</span> <span id="s379">I forgot to mention that when we lived in Stabsgebäude and we had to go to the toilet we were watched by one S.S. man and he wanted always to talk to us and we didn’t answer him because we knew he wanted to find out something or so.</span> <span id="s380">After the war this Belgian girls told us a story like this.</span> <span id="s381">It was the evacuation from Auschwitz and one night we were sleeping in einer Scheune [barn].</span></p> <p><span id="s382">EM: In a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">ET: In a barrack and some girls escaped.</span> <span id="s384">The two girls and maybe three or four more went with this S.S. man, he knew them.</span> <span id="s385">I think he was in their office too, working, and he took a wagon and a horse and brought them to a Polish house and I think they were hidden there by the Polish people.</span> <span id="s386">He was very nice to them and they said to each other that after the war when somebody will occupy, they didn’t know if the Russians or Americans will occupy them, they will give him some clothes and they won’t mention that he was an S.S. man in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s387">It was already the Russians arrived and they were free, happy, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s388">Suddenly this S.S. man said, “Ich bin ein Jude” [I am a Jew].</span> <span id="s389">They couldn’t believe it, but he started to cry and he said the Shema Yisroel by heart.</span> <span id="s390">It was very touching and I remember we all cried and he was really a man who came to the S.S. and to Auschwitz, I think from Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and it was really one in thousands that something like this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">EM: Is there anything else you would like to add, any other story that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">ET: No, nothing special, only this, that my son still belonged to the second generation.</span> <span id="s393">He’s very interesting [interested] in the Holocaust and I hope that it won’t happen again and the people all in the world should remember what Hitler did to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">EM: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s395">We appreciate your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">ET: You’re very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
