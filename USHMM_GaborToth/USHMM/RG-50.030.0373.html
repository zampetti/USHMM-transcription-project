1996</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Can we begin by your stating your name, your date of birth and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s13">My name is Michel Reynders, R-E-Y-N-D-E-R-S.</span> <span id="s14">Date of birth, June 29, 1931.</span> <span id="s15">Born in a suburb of Brussels, Belgium.</span> <span id="s16">Called Uccle, U-C-C-L-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My family on my father's side is a large family.</span> <span id="s19">My grandfather was a physician in one of the boroughs, if you want, of Brussels.</span> <span id="s20">They had eight children, my grandparents had eight children.</span> <span id="s21">My grandmother was, as we say, the strong woman of the Gospel.</span> <span id="s22">She was leading and reigning over that family like a headmistress.</span> <span id="s23">But, she was a very, very wonderful lady.</span> <span id="s24">My parents, my father was a physician.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s26">They met when my father was a young doctor and their first encounter was actually when my mother was on the operating table when she had appendicitis.</span> <span id="s27">Then they got married in 1930 and I was born in 1931.</span> <span id="s28">I have a brother, a sister who was born in 1935 and a brother who was born in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">And we had, we lived in a very nice house in Brussels which to me remains the epitome of a nice family house.</span> <span id="s30">My grandmother's house was also a very nice one.</span> <span id="s31">And we very frequently met our cousins and uncles and all of that, the whole family, in her apartment in that big house.</span> <span id="s32">Actually, we had a sort of a little reunion of the cousins who were around practically every week.</span> <span id="s33">Every Tuesday.</span> <span id="s34">And we gathered around the big table with sweets, cookies and breads and you would call them danish, but we didn't call them that.</span> <span id="s35">Then in 1938, my parents bought another house which I didn't like and I never did like it.</span> <span id="s36">Even though we lived in it for a long time.</span> <span id="s37">And, well, shall I tell you about our, the things we did for entertainment?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Yes, but just one moment, please.</span> <span id="s39">Are you hearing the clock?</span> <span id="s40">Well, what I'm trying to get a sense of, of course, is your lifestyle, what was disrupted because, clearly, in 1940, things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Oh, absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And also a sense of your religious affiliation, all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, my, on my mother's side, let's say they were, theoretical Catholics.</span> <span id="s44">On my father's side, they were very devout Catholics.</span> <span id="s45">Everybody went to church on Sunday, every Sunday.</span> <span id="s46">And to confession a few times a year.</span> <span id="s47">Just to get the load off their chest, I suppose.</span> <span id="s48">On my mother's side, they were the type of Catholics who went to church for a baptism, wedding and funeral.</span> <span id="s49">My, on my father's side, my grandmother was a practical religious person.</span> <span id="s50">She didn't go for, you know, a lot of babbling and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s51">But, she thought religion should be applied to your day-to-day life in a practical way.</span> <span id="s52">In other words, you know, it, she didn't believe much in kneeling on bench and then going like this and so on.</span> <span id="s53">She said, do this thing right because that's the way God wants you to do it.</span> <span id="s54">And do that thing right and, you know, you'll be rewarded in your other life.</span> <span id="s55">And, you know, she wanted to make religion a real part of their, of her life and our lives.</span> <span id="s56">And she actually didn't spend all that much time, well, just one, she, you know, didn't spend all that much time in church and that's the whole thing.</span> <span id="s57">Just because, as I say, she was much more of a pragmatic person.</span> <span id="s58">Very interesting lady, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s59">What else can I say?</span> <span id="s60">Well, we celebrated, of course, all the religious holidays in a very extensive way.</span> <span id="s61">Mostly, Christmas and Easter.</span> <span id="s62">But, you may know or not know, that in Belgium, in addition to Christmas, the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that was the big event for the children before World War II.</span> <span id="s63">We would all gather to, first in our own homes and then later to grandmother's home, and get all the toys and candies.</span> <span id="s64">That would make us sick for two weeks.</span> <span id="s65">But they were delightful anyway.</span> <span id="s66">And we would sometimes go to the seaside.</span> <span id="s67">In fact, quite frequently.</span> <span id="s68">And the whole family would also meet there.</span> <span id="s69">We wouldn't always stay in the same place, but since, you know, the Belgian sea coast is very small, it was always easy to go from one village to the other.</span> <span id="s70">And we would have big picnics and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s71">We were a very closely knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Now, there were other people, other relatives of yours, who were very involved with the Catholic church, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s74">My uncle, Father Bruno(ph), was a Benedictine Monk and he had three sisters, my three aunts, who were nuns.</span> <span id="s75">Two of them were Benedictine Nuns in Liesch(ph), Belgium.</span> <span id="s76">The third one was a Sister of Notre Dame, which is a teaching order.</span> <span id="s77">And she was, she moved to various convents during her life.</span> <span id="s78">She is currently alive and well in Namure(ph), Belgium.</span> <span id="s79">She is 88 years old, almost 89.</span> <span id="s80">And clear as a bell, sharp as a tack.</span> <span id="s81">And she participated in Father Bruno's work quite a bit, too.</span> <span id="s82">As did the other sisters, who are now deceased.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did you go to religious school or to public school.</span> <span id="s84">A: No, it was traditional...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Pause in tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I was asking you if went to public or religious school.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We went to religious schools.</span> <span id="s88">We, in Belgium, the diocese or, you know, the lay, not the lay, but the nun, monastic schools, are called colleges.</span> <span id="s89">It has nothing to do with American college.</span> <span id="s90">You're in college from your first grade on.</span> <span id="s91">Until your 12th grade.</span> <span id="s92">So, yes, I did go to, first to a small school where the nuns were running the school and I was very privileged in having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten teacher, and I've never forgot her.</span> <span id="s93">I still remember her as being a real guidance.</span> <span id="s94">And then I went to the college, St. Bonefas(ph) in Brussels.</span> <span id="s95">Where my father had been, where my uncles had been.</span> <span id="s96">And it was almost a family tradition already.</span> <span id="s97">Still in existence now.</span> <span id="s98">And, in fact, my brother was there, too.</span> <span id="s99">And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins, actually, went through the same school.</span> <span id="s100">It was a very, very wonderful school.</span> <span id="s101">I had the best teachers you can imagine.</span> <span id="s102">And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate school?</span> <span id="s103">No, I loved school.</span> <span id="s104">I just adored my teachers.</span> <span id="s105">In the seventh grade I had a very tall, very powerful looking priest as a teacher.</span> <span id="s106">And I can still hear him talking.</span> <span id="s107">He was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s108">He made us live Julius Caesar's wars.</span> <span id="s109">Like you'd see a movie.</span> <span id="s110">And a couple of three years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian Alden(ph), the south of Belgium where the forests are and those people have their feet on the ground.</span> <span id="s111">Solidly on the ground, and he did, too.</span> <span id="s112">And, again, I have such extraordinary memories from my high school, you know, that I still relive them constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Because you came from a family that at least was partly quite religious and you went to religious schools, were there certain values that were instilled in you from an early age?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s115">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s116">As I told you, my grandmother was running the house even from a distance, she was still running her children.</span> <span id="s117">Her children's houses with her strong principles that, you know, of charity, of tolerance.</span> <span id="s118">Even though she was strict, she was tolerant.</span> <span id="s119">You know, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't.</span> <span id="s120">She was strict in her tolerance, you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s121">You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you couldn't feel it immediately.</span> <span id="s122">You just had to do it.</span> <span id="s123">And that was one of the principles that she inoculated into us from our very, very small childhood.</span> <span id="s124">And I think my, all my uncles and aunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles.</span> <span id="s125">So, yes, mostly Christian values.</span> <span id="s126">And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non- Christian people?</span> <span id="s127">Like the Jews and so on.</span> <span id="s128">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s129">In Belgium, you didn't make that distinction.</span> <span id="s130">I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS came and took them away.</span> <span id="s131">We were friends with them, we played in the park together.</span> <span id="s132">We, you know, Belgium was not at all a discriminatory country or discriminating country.</span> <span id="s133">I'm bringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the United States, you have to say, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">There is no such thing in Belgium.</span> <span id="s135">The identity cards that were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that.</span> <span id="s136">It mentioned profession, job, that they did.</span> <span id="s137">But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of discriminatory inkling, if I may say.</span> <span id="s138">So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high values were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that included that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were.</span> <span id="s139">Not because they had red hair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever.</span> <span id="s140">But, because they were just people.</span> <span id="s141">I think that is of extreme importance for what is going to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism in Belgium at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, I was not.</span> <span id="s144">I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in France, for example.</span> <span id="s145">France has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if you want.</span> <span id="s146">Which was definitely anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s147">We didn't have that.</span> <span id="s148">Actually, it's to the point that we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s149">Because we had no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s150">We had no records.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Were you, as a kid, involved with any social or political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Not a political organization.</span> <span id="s153">I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile.</span> <span id="s154">In Belgium we had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there were the public school cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts.</span> <span id="s155">They were friendly, but they were different.</span> <span id="s156">I was part of the Christian cub scouts.</span> <span id="s157">Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was part of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things.</span> <span id="s158">But, it didn't amount to very much.</span> <span id="s159">Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group activity, let's say.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And, your family, while they believed very strongly in charity, was that ever on any organized basis before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: My grandmother had a route, if you want to say, or route where she went and distributed food on a certain day every month.</span> <span id="s162">Part of the St. Vincent DePaul general organization, which exists in France and exists in Belgium.</span> <span id="s163">And it consists of lay people who just get together and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families.</span> <span id="s164">They visit them, and I think this is still being done, I'm not sure, but I think so.</span> <span id="s165">Right now.</span> <span id="s166">They bring them food or clothes and try to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that.</span> <span id="s167">That was, in a way, organized, if you want.</span> <span id="s168">Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide organization for the blind.</span> <span id="s169">And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of that for quite some time.</span> <span id="s170">And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind people assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: One other question.</span> <span id="s172">What kind of a child were you?</span> <span id="s173">If you had to sort of describe your energy, your...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s175">But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but I do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child.</span> <span id="s176">So, I guess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she wanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s177">I think she taught me good social behavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery.</span> <span id="s178">I was running up and down and doing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things.</span> <span id="s179">Like making mud pies and throwing them at each other.</span> <span id="s180">And one day my aunt visited us and my mother just showed her out to the door and while they were gone, we decided to sample the port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why the house was spinning so much around me.</span> <span id="s181">And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up the next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure.</span> <span id="s182">In school, as I say, I enjoyed school enormously.</span> <span id="s183">And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s184">So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty decent grades.</span> <span id="s185">That way.</span> <span id="s186">It wasn't any, you know, great effort.</span> <span id="s187">I didn't really force myself, I just studied because I thought it was fun.</span> <span id="s188">And particularly the literary branches, such as Latin, Greek.</span> <span id="s189">And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were something where I literally basked in learning those.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not always cloistered.</span> <span id="s192">In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in Belgium.</span> <span id="s193">Even before the war.</span> <span id="s194">He taught catechism at the Belgian border to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi children who would cross the border before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in Germany and under Hitler.</span> <span id="s195">He went to Czechoslovakia during the sad events of 1938 and so on.</span> <span id="s196">And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out for, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee where he made me jump on his knee.</span> <span id="s197">And I liked him very, very much.</span> <span id="s198">He was the image of perfection to me.</span> <span id="s199">He was almost a semi-god.</span> <span id="s200">I had an excellent relationship with him and I kept that relation throughout until his death.</span> <span id="s201">Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him as much as I wanted to.</span> <span id="s202">But, I had an excellent relationship with him.</span> <span id="s203">He was a very warm, outgoing person, very funny, too.</span> <span id="s204">He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What did you know about Hitler and Nazism before Belgium was occupied?</span> <span id="s206">Did you know much...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Hardly anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: ...German refugees coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: We saw a few.</span> <span id="s210">And, as a matter of fact, this is not Hitler it's Mussolini, in 1938, my parents took in a young Italian girl, about 14 or 15, to be our babysitter.</span> <span id="s211">Because her parents, her father was an active Socialist and had to leave Italy under the Fascist regime, and fled to Belgium.</span> <span id="s212">And, just as an aside, I absolutely adored that lady and I lost track of her completely until 1986.</span> <span id="s213">I decided, I've got to find her again.</span> <span id="s214">So, I wrote a letter to the mayor of her town asking, is this lady still alive?</span> <span id="s215">Does she live in that town?</span> <span id="s216">I didn't get an answer for about six months, but one day I got a letter from her.</span> <span id="s217">So, obviously, the mayor had passed on the letter to her.</span> <span id="s218">She wrote me and said, I remember you as if it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s219">I went to see her in Asti(ph) in the north of Italy.</span> <span id="s220">She came here.</span> <span id="s221">And we're still writing to each other every month and the most adorable lady.</span> <span id="s222">So, that's one thing I did know.</span> <span id="s223">About Fascism.</span> <span id="s224">As you say, we did see a few, yes, a few refugees, but, you know, until 19, well, in 1940, I was just nine years old and at that time, I don't think I understood the full impact.</span> <span id="s225">But, you grow very rapidly in a war, you know.</span> <span id="s226">It didn't take us more than a couple of years before we had it all assimilated and we understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s227">Well, not everything, but nobody else did.</span> <span id="s228">But, we understood, I think, far more than we would have if we hadn't been occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What do you remember about the German occupation?</span> <span id="s230">How it began?</span> <span id="s231">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: 1940, May 10, 4:00 in the morning, my father came and shook me and said, boy, let's go to the basement, it's war.</span> <span id="s233">And I heard anti-aircraft cannons, I heard airplanes flying overhead.</span> <span id="s234">And then we heard some bombs falling.</span> <span id="s235">Brussels wasn't severely bombed, but the Germans did bomb Brussels the first day of the war.</span> <span id="s236">I guess, more as a scare tactic than actual, you know, aim at destruction.</span> <span id="s237">And I remember that as if it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s238">And from then on, just about everything that occurred during the occupation is in my computer.</span> <span id="s239">And it comes back when, you know, when I think about it.</span> <span id="s240">I remember being a very bad boy.</span> <span id="s241">Stealing my mother's very scarce sugar and putting it into the gas tanks of the German trucks that were parked in the street in the front of my school.</span> <span id="s242">We were a little group of kids and one of them would be watching the sentry and he was going up the street, we would immediately go and unscrew the caps and pour the sugar in there.</span> <span id="s243">And, you know, that gums up the engines, makes a mess of the engine.</span> <span id="s244">And I remember being kicked in the rear end by a couple of Femp(ph) Polezei(ph) who were searching us and, I guess, as I say, I must have been ornery because I probably talked back to him and he really, I can still feel the pain.</span> <span id="s245">And one time I was on a street car and there was, unfortunately, there were a few traitors as you know, in all the occupied countries, including Belgium.</span> <span id="s246">And it was the 21st of July, which is a Belgian national day, and I was carrying a little black, yellow and red flag, which is the Belgian colors, in my lapel.</span> <span id="s247">Very obvious.</span> <span id="s248">And one of those traitors came up on the street car and said, why do you have that on your lapel?</span> <span id="s249">And I said, why do you have it on that, I'm not going to say the word, but that uniform that you're wearing?</span> <span id="s250">And he slapped me in the face and I fell out of the street car.</span> <span id="s251">I almost got killed by it, but I wasn't really injured.</span> <span id="s252">But, I think the traitors were worse sometimes than the actual Germans.</span> <span id="s253">I couldn't stand his arrogance, and I talked back, I must have been about 13 at that time.</span> <span id="s254">And, as I say, you learn very fast during the war.</span> <span id="s255">And you learn things you maybe you shouldn't be learning, like bad words and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s256">But, yeah, I remember the occupation extremely vividly for some reason.</span> <span id="s257">Maybe a half a block from where we were was a, one of the rare skyscrapers in Brussels and there lived three German generals there.</span> <span id="s258">And I remember very well going to school and seeing those gentlemen, quote unquote, come down the steps there with their green capes that were lined in red, you know?</span> <span id="s259">Very, very flashy.</span> <span id="s260">Those were probably too impressive for me to insult because for some reason, even an enemy general is still a general, I suppose, you don't say bad things to a general.</span> <span id="s261">But, I remember that as if it were yesterday.</span> <span id="s262">It's something that stays with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Was their presence ominous?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">Yes.</span> <span id="s266">We had the same reflex that the Germans had in Germany under Hitler's day that always look behind us to see if we weren't being followed.</span> <span id="s267">And, yeah, the presence was heavy.</span> <span id="s268">And they made their presence known.</span> <span id="s269">Like, every Saturday, they had a victory parade.</span> <span id="s270">Every Saturday.</span> <span id="s271">A victory parade in the streets of Brussels.</span> <span id="s272">And they would parade in front of the royal palace and then stop there and have a band concert.</span> <span id="s273">And they were pretty obvious.</span> <span id="s274">As I say, on the street cars, you had to be careful what you said because there were always some ears that shouldn't hear what you were saying.</span> <span id="s275">Oh, I remember, for example, one day I was, that was probably toward the end of the war, must have been '44, I was standing on the platform there and a man was seated inside reading a newspaper and the street car stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people.</span> <span id="s276">And everybody had to put their hands up.</span> <span id="s277">And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a pistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this.</span> <span id="s278">The Germans searched him but didn't look inside his newspaper.</span> <span id="s279">And he was never found out.</span> <span id="s280">But, you know, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Change the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Is this, I think my angle...Oh, yeah, that does make a big difference.</span> <span id="s285">I think he's, he's just sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Are you all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: I want to learn more about how, what?</span> <span id="s288">A: Is he ready?</span> <span id="s289">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: I want to get a better picture of what life was like once the Germans came into Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">How your life, personally, changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes.</span> <span id="s293">Because they tried to go easy.</span> <span id="s294">And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor.</span> <span id="s295">We did not have a Golighter(ph).</span> <span id="s296">We didn't have an SS general at that time.</span> <span id="s297">We only had one general who was an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s298">General Alexander from Falkenhausen(ph).</span> <span id="s299">Who was an old Prussian aristocrat who actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians.</span> <span id="s300">So, the first few months were not all that bad actually.</span> <span id="s301">Except for the obvious presence of the German army.</span> <span id="s302">The parades and all that sort of things.</span> <span id="s303">And, of course, the rationing.</span> <span id="s304">The scarcity of essentials.</span> <span id="s305">Which, actually, became much, much worse as of probably 1943.</span> <span id="s306">In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were that miserable.</span> <span id="s307">But in 1942, then Berlin realized that the military governor was not being strong enough, was not being harsh enough.</span> <span id="s308">And we received then, an SS man who sort of took over the, quote, political aspect.</span> <span id="s309">In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army which in itself wasn't all that bad.</span> <span id="s310">That's when things began to change very drastically.</span> <span id="s311">The day-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned.</span> <span id="s312">Various supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">There was no gasoline for my father's little car which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep.</span> <span id="s314">But there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good.</span> <span id="s315">And things like that.</span> <span id="s316">And then, we began to see things changing even more drastically.</span> <span id="s317">That's when we saw people being taken away.</span> <span id="s318">We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away.</span> <span id="s319">We thought maybe they had done some bad things.</span> <span id="s320">And were being put in jail for that.</span> <span id="s321">And then, pretty quickly, it became obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either something to do with the Resistance or simply hostages.</span> <span id="s322">People who were not Jewish that hadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of resistance and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s323">Or for having hidden resistance or people who were resistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed.</span> <span id="s324">That's another thing that didn't come immediately.</span> <span id="s325">Forced labor.</span> <span id="s326">Young people taken to Germany forcibly to work.</span> <span id="s327">Not necessarily to concentration camps, but to factories and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s328">Being paid a measly salary and living in squalor and terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s329">And, of course, it didn't take long before the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding.</span> <span id="s330">Electricity became limited.</span> <span id="s331">We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night.</span> <span id="s332">Curfews, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">That began pretty early in the war.</span> <span id="s334">Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly enforced.</span> <span id="s335">Again, it was still the army at that time.</span> <span id="s336">But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police came, those things were strictly enforced.</span> <span id="s337">And if you were out in the street at 8:30, you immediately went to jail.</span> <span id="s338">You know, not just getting a ticket or something.</span> <span id="s339">You were taken to jail.</span> <span id="s340">And, the trains were limited.</span> <span id="s341">There was hardly any coal for the locomotives.</span> <span id="s342">Except for the German transports.</span> <span id="s343">And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first Jewish transports that I ever saw, at the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s344">At first I didn't realize what was going on.</span> <span id="s345">But, I saw lots of people being packed in, they weren't yet using cattle cars.</span> <span id="s346">They were using very old third class cars with, which were boarded, the windows were boarded up.</span> <span id="s347">And, but the people were still sitting on benches.</span> <span id="s348">They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a cattle car.</span> <span id="s349">But, I saw them because there was a railroad station only about three or four blocks from my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">And the tracks were down and so you could see from a little wall and there were iron gates, if you want, you could see through the gates what was going on down there.</span> <span id="s351">And I saw this train where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">And then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are?</span> <span id="s353">No.</span> <span id="s354">Well, these are Jewish people that are taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s355">That's the first time I ever saw a transport.</span> <span id="s356">And I remember that as if it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s357">What else?</span> <span id="s358">Well, of course, the city was down completely as far as activity is concerned.</span> <span id="s359">There were some movie theaters playing German movies and propaganda, of course.</span> <span id="s360">All English or American or French movies were outlawed.</span> <span id="s361">I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944.</span> <span id="s362">When, just after the liberation.</span> <span id="s363">My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing.</span> <span id="s364">Then after World War II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but that's neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s365">During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that was important.</span> <span id="s366">Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it.</span> <span id="s367">As I say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things began to go very badly.</span> <span id="s368">We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or two.</span> <span id="s369">Sometimes maybe twice a week.</span> <span id="s370">Meat was rarely, rarely available.</span> <span id="s371">We were extremely lucky in Belgium that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an enormous bank of herring began to swim right off the Belgian coast.</span> <span id="s372">Within a mile or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">The fishing boats were allowed two lines, so they were allowed to go and fish those herring.</span> <span id="s374">And for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">And I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting until 10:00 or 11:00 in line, standing there.</span> <span id="s376">Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in school.</span> <span id="s377">And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that.</span> <span id="s378">My mother had to learn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had herring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life.</span> <span id="s379">But it saved us.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: School, at first there was no school for a few months.</span> <span id="s382">But it started again in September.</span> <span id="s383">You know, the war began in May, it started again in September.</span> <span id="s384">And the first year it was school as usual.</span> <span id="s385">But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi controlled versions were allowed.</span> <span id="s386">We were, that was mostly in high school later on.</span> <span id="s387">But, we were allowed to learn English after we had learned German first.</span> <span id="s388">It sounded awful at the time, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished high school and all my classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and English.</span> <span id="s389">Which has served me well, you know, later in my life.</span> <span id="s390">So, I guess I owe that to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s391">But, I'm not grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: You've spoken about some of the ways in which your life was changed by the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Were you aware of the different kinds of restrictions on Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on.</span> <span id="s395">And we saw some of our friends being taken away.</span> <span id="s396">And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know, they're taken away.</span> <span id="s397">Because they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s398">As I told you before, we didn't even have an inkling before World War II.</span> <span id="s399">We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go?</span> <span id="s400">Do you go to a synagogue or do you go to a Catholic church or anything.</span> <span id="s401">If they went to a Catholic church, we would see them because they would go to the same one we did.</span> <span id="s402">But, the other people who were not in our church, we didn't ask them what they did or where they went or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know.</span> <span id="s403">Yeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a transport taken by a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his office window which was just above the building where they took the people.</span> <span id="s404">So he took a picture, this was obviously forbidden, but he did anyway.</span> <span id="s405">They didn't catch him.</span> <span id="s406">We still have that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Were they wearing the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars.</span> <span id="s410">And, of course, at that time, it became quite obvious.</span> <span id="s411">Then in the center of the city, for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s412">I have a picture of that, too.</span> <span id="s413">They were forced to walk in the gutter.</span> <span id="s414">And when it was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating.</span> <span id="s415">But when it was raining they had their feet in the water which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we didn't have any good shoes anyway.</span> <span id="s416">Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they would just fall apart in that water.</span> <span id="s417">If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might have survived it, even though resenting it.</span> <span id="s418">But, that was only the beginning.</span> <span id="s419">The yellow star, there were a number of people who in the street car, would ostentatiously get up and give their seat to a person wearing a yellow star.</span> <span id="s420">Particularly if there were German officers or German soldiers on the street car at that time.</span> <span id="s421">They would deliberately show, you know, say, please take my seat.</span> <span id="s422">I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it.</span> <span id="s423">I've seen it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What was the reaction from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Very quiet.</span> <span id="s426">They wouldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s427">You know, actually, the individual German, particularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly aggressive when alone.</span> <span id="s428">As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive than the German army people.</span> <span id="s429">Now, I'm not talking about the SS.</span> <span id="s430">But we didn't see the SS all that much.</span> <span id="s431">They were always in cars.</span> <span id="s432">They hardly ever were on foot.</span> <span id="s433">The people on foot were mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when they were asked to do a search.</span> <span id="s434">And, you know, to line people up against a wall and search them and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt.</span> <span id="s435">In general, the population was very understanding and sympathetic.</span> <span id="s436">Now, there were a few bad ones.</span> <span id="s437">And I'm not going to deny that.</span> <span id="s438">I'm not proud of it.</span> <span id="s439">Nobody is.</span> <span id="s440">But, it wasn't as bad as in France.</span> <span id="s441">I can assure you of that.</span> <span id="s442">We could see that a number of shops where we had been shopping regularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed.</span> <span id="s443">There was nobody there any more.</span> <span id="s444">And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own country, take over the Jewish businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So, you were telling me about the general climate.</span> <span id="s446">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And you said that most of the Belgian public was supportive of, I guess, the Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s449">And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as we said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time.</span> <span id="s450">They, you will hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the largest newspaper in Brussels was actually Nazi controlled completely.</span> <span id="s451">But, interestingly enough, it was Jewish owned.</span> <span id="s452">But the owner went to England, so the paper was taken over by pro-Nazi people.</span> <span id="s453">The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the Catholic ones, just shut down.</span> <span id="s454">They didn't publish any more.</span> <span id="s455">So the only paper we really had was Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning.</span> <span id="s456">Which was Nazi controlled entirely.</span> <span id="s457">Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in 1943, which is the national day of Belgium, there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which had been printed and put out by the resistance.</span> <span id="s458">And, at first, it was so well made that people didn't realize it was not the real one.</span> <span id="s459">And they just took it and then you could see the people picking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you know.</span> <span id="s460">We shall win and we'll crush the Bosch and naming all the traitors and that sort of thing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny stories were written in there, too.</span> <span id="s461">And that was a day of levity during World War II when the entire city of Brussels was covered with Neswah, but not the real one.</span> <span id="s462">Which was, of course, much more real than the Nazi controlled one.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You speak of the resistance.</span> <span id="s464">How apparent was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my house we had a housekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) if you want, cleaned the entrance hallway where my father's patients would come because in Europe, many doctors had their office in their house, it was very common.</span> <span id="s466">And so did my father.</span> <span id="s467">And her son was a career soldier in the Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one of the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us, because he had to come home occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing and he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there.</span> <span id="s468">So, I became quickly aware that there was something going on.</span> <span id="s469">And so did my sister and brother who were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again.</span> <span id="s470">Roger, Roger.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Yeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was exactly my age and slept on the third floor and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook me and said, hurry up, open the back windows and hurry up, the Germans are at the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">And Roger was in the house at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same bed.</span> <span id="s473">Which was, of course, on purpose.</span> <span id="s474">He immediately ran out the roof windows, you know those roof windows in Europe where you can lift like a trap, the window, and he ran out that way and was able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm bed, but, you know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there.</span> <span id="s475">So, they searched the house, these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually.</span> <span id="s476">And they searched the house, didn't find anything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his passage.</span> <span id="s477">And after that, he never came home again.</span> <span id="s478">It must have been later in the war, it must have been 1943 or something like that.</span> <span id="s479">And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement.</span> <span id="s480">I don't think we made any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance.</span> <span id="s481">That probably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time.</span> <span id="s482">But then, when my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early '43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently.</span> <span id="s483">We, he didn't say anything, you know, he was very, very quiet and never said a word.</span> <span id="s484">He never said, I am helping Jewish children escape.</span> <span id="s485">But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's house, and I was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know?</span> <span id="s486">And at that point, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal.</span> <span id="s487">And I didn't say anything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an adult.</span> <span id="s488">And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive with me.</span> <span id="s489">I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to.</span> <span id="s490">And so he became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a place or there would be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is Robert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know.</span> <span id="s491">But, and, do you know where such and such street is?</span> <span id="s492">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s493">Well, why don't you take the street car and go to such and such house there and tell them that Robert is looking for a place to stay.</span> <span id="s494">And that's all he ever said.</span> <span id="s495">You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish.</span> <span id="s496">And Robert always had a war name, a different name.</span> <span id="s497">One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called him Roger.</span> <span id="s498">Roger Dumois(ph).</span> <span id="s499">And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six months.</span> <span id="s500">In my other uncle's house, my younger uncle, the dentist.</span> <span id="s501">Jean(ph), who worked in very close cooperation with Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s502">That was my grandmother's house and he was the only child of my grandmother's who stayed in the family home after he was married because he occupied my grandfather's medical office as a dentist.</span> <span id="s503">So he didn't have to look for another place and my grandmother just took the upper floor for herself.</span> <span id="s504">And so, the kids were brought there frequently.</span> <span id="s505">I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's apartment and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight chairs, she had a lot of chairs because she had a lot of children.</span> <span id="s506">Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of course, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s507">She says, Oh, we're just having a little party.</span> <span id="s508">And there were eight Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s509">One of whom stayed and, it was a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my grandmother's curtains.</span> <span id="s510">But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly.</span> <span id="s511">But, this is how I, you know, I realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s512">And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his real name.</span> <span id="s513">Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s514">I had never seen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that.</span> <span id="s515">But, after a while, of course, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him.</span> <span id="s516">And he had a bicycle and he would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his bicycle inside and disappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's house because he had a, there was a better heating system in his house than in my parent's second house, which I didn't like anyway.</span> <span id="s517">And, so I did get to see quite a number of the proteges, as my uncle used to call them.</span> <span id="s518">And, okay, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Well, since you mentioned this boy that you actually lived with for quite some time, this Jewish boy, I'm just curious if you, what it was like.</span> <span id="s520">Was he scared?</span> <span id="s521">Did you talk about things?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally.</span> <span id="s523">There was a feeling of security in that house.</span> <span id="s524">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s525">Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that house.</span> <span id="s526">He went to school with me to the College , of course, where else?</span> <span id="s527">It happens that that school is only about three or four blocks away from my grandparent's house, which is the main reason why everybody went there.</span> <span id="s528">And so we went to school together and sometimes we didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class.</span> <span id="s529">But, usually at 4:00, which was dismissal time, we would wait for each other at the door and just go on home as if nothing had happened, and as if nothing was going on.</span> <span id="s530">Jumping like kids do, you know, and kicking a can once in awhile and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s531">And he looked pretty happy.</span> <span id="s532">It's only actually towards the very, very end of the war when I think he had an inkling that his parents had disappeared, that he became a little more sad and more, less expansive, less talkative.</span> <span id="s533">But, for a good while there, we were just like two old buddies and playing games like you see kids do and doing our homework together and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Did he talk about what happened to his parents?</span> <span id="s535">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Or why he was hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No.</span> <span id="s538">No.</span> <span id="s539">Actually, that was one thing that Father Bruno stressed upon them, to never talk about, never, your name is Joe Blow now, you don't have any parents, you are not Jewish, you are of Flemish descent, and your parents are travelling in France or something like that.</span> <span id="s540">Or your parents are dead, you know, or something.</span> <span id="s541">But, dead from other causes he meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">No, that was one thing he was very, very strong and stern about.</span> <span id="s543">Do not ever talk about your family and things that happened.</span> <span id="s544">So, even in my grandmother's house, there was no such talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">End of tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Tape #3 ...down a little bit, they might be a little...</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, they're already down.</span> <span id="s548">No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be...Yeah, I know they were too high.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I just wanted to pick up where we stopped for a moment, because it was at the end of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: You were telling me about this Jewish boy who was hiding at your house.</span> <span id="s553">A: Right.</span> <span id="s554">Roger.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Roger.</span> <span id="s556">And that while, when he maybe learned more about his family, he became... A: Sulky, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But I was asking you whether, at any point, you ever talked to him about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: What was going on in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No.</span> <span id="s561">That was a no-no.</span> <span id="s562">And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about events surrounding the children.</span> <span id="s563">Any child that was under his protection, if you want to say.</span> <span id="s564">It just was too risky.</span> <span id="s565">You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death, not only of the child, but everybody around the child.</span> <span id="s566">So, no.</span> <span id="s567">As little talk as possible.</span> <span id="s568">How do you say that?</span> <span id="s569">The enemy has ears everywhere?</span> <span id="s570">Or something like that.</span> <span id="s571">We were very aware of that.</span> <span id="s572">And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was already, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began to understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war.</span> <span id="s573">Now, on the contrary, we had a little club, if you want, of school kids, we thought of ourselves as very important.</span> <span id="s574">And we had a club which was our resistance club.</span> <span id="s575">It didn't do much resistance, but we were organized as a military club.</span> <span id="s576">There was a colonel and there was a couple of majors and a couple of captains and if you did well, if you, for example, you could report on seeing so many German trucks going by, then you got promoted.</span> <span id="s577">And if you had counted how many B-17's are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a commendation of some sort.</span> <span id="s578">We had to know by heart, all the types of aircraft, enemy or friendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s579">It didn't amount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war.</span> <span id="s580">You know.</span> <span id="s581">And we would hide in the, somebody's basement so the Germans wouldn't hear us.</span> <span id="s582">It was very secret.</span> <span id="s583">That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think.</span> <span id="s584">When I was still a little more innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you every do any little, you mentioned putting the sugar in the gas tanks...</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s587">That was part of our assignments.</span> <span id="s588">If we did that, that was a great big promotion because, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk.</span> <span id="s589">And you could be promoted from second lieutenant all the way to major for doing that.</span> <span id="s590">Yeah.</span> <span id="s591">And when my mother found out about that, was she every unhappy.</span> <span id="s592">Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking.</span> <span id="s593">And even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have definitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in jail, and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Were there other little sabotage activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Well, yeah, flat tires and things like that.</span> <span id="s596">For some reason, a truck would suddenly develop a flat tire.</span> <span id="s597">I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick of wood and put that in the, what do you call this valve, you know?</span> <span id="s598">Where they inflate the tire?</span> <span id="s599">Push it in and there's a little peg in there that if you push it in, the air goes out.</span> <span id="s600">So, when nobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the air would go out.</span> <span id="s601">And the next morning the truck had a flat tire.</span> <span id="s602">And, but again, all that didn't amount to much.</span> <span id="s603">But, it's just the spirit, you know.</span> <span id="s604">We, it was a spirit of resistance.</span> <span id="s605">In our childish way, you know.</span> <span id="s606">Go ahead, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Was that spirit of resistance fairly prevalent in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Well, I can only speak about my own environment.</span> <span id="s609">I would say that in my own environment, it was.</span> <span id="s610">It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable and badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering.</span> <span id="s611">And, the eight children, except perhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the Bosch, you know.</span> <span id="s612">And it was still there 25 years later.</span> <span id="s613">You just don't get rid of that sort of resentment so easily.</span> <span id="s614">And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had already been imparted to us between the wars.</span> <span id="s615">You know, when they were telling stories, oh, do you remember so and so?</span> <span id="s616">Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the French and da, da, da.</span> <span id="s617">So, we were living, see Belgium has been occupied by foreign powers ever since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly independent minded people.</span> <span id="s618">And it's only since 1830, that Belgium has become a political entity of its own, a free, independent country.</span> <span id="s619">And then, but we, we have an ancestral tradition of hating the occupant.</span> <span id="s620">You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the Spaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again.</span> <span id="s621">And, yeah, that spirit of anti-occupant was very prevalent in my environment.</span> <span id="s622">It's difficult for me to judge, you know, how it was in other families.</span> <span id="s623">But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">We never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s625">On the contrary, my father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their anti-Nazi attitudes and actions.</span> <span id="s626">One of them died in a concentration camp, the other one was killed by the SS on the last day of the occupation.</span> <span id="s627">He was, they came with a car and started shooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five minutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day.</span> <span id="s628">And then there was the governor of the national bank who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children.</span> <span id="s629">And one day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Gallopan(ph)?</span> <span id="s631">And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right on his doorstep, right in front of his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Because of his efforts?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Because of his support of the resistance.</span> <span id="s634">You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts of money to be able to feed and clothe his children.</span> <span id="s635">And he didn't have anything, of course.</span> <span id="s636">And so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had left him as president of the national bank knowing that he was not, he didn't like them.</span> <span id="s637">So, he went to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I don't remember how much it was, every month.</span> <span id="s638">And my other uncle, one of my other uncles by marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the bank every month and kept the books.</span> <span id="s639">Kept the accounting.</span> <span id="s640">And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else in the bank honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: I do want to learn a lot more about this whole rescue effort, but I'd like you to tell me a bit more about what you did.</span> <span id="s642">Your involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement.</span> <span id="s644">All I ever did, as I told you in this film before, is carry little letters and escort children from one point to the other.</span> <span id="s645">I was too young to do anything else at that time.</span> <span id="s646">So, that was my contribution, if you want, being a messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Do you remember specifically...</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: And also being a school mate, which probably brought a little comfort to Roger, among others.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Do you remember specifics of some of your messengering and escorting?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, the one picture I keep is my standing on the rear platform of a street car with my arms stretched out on the railing, on the back thing, and a Jewish child looking at me with a cap on his head, hiding his dark hair.</span> <span id="s651">And my hair was light blond, very light blond, I was a perfect Aryan.</span> <span id="s652">And we were just playing, you know, being silly kids.</span> <span id="s653">With my blue eyes and my blond hair, the Germans would, there would be a few Germans on the street cars, but they would probably just take one look at me and just, you know, ignore me.</span> <span id="s654">And that was one picture that I remember very, very well.</span> <span id="s655">Another incident was that, at that time, I was carrying a letter, but I was with my aunt, the wife of the dentist.</span> <span id="s656">Of Jean, my aunt Ninette(ph), one of the women I have most loved in my life.</span> <span id="s657">And I was there with her and we were trying to find an address, and we couldn't find the house.</span> <span id="s658">And at one point, there were Germans in the street.</span> <span id="s659">They weren't looking for us, but she got scared and we ran away.</span> <span id="s660">And then she said, you know, I shouldn't have run away because that may give us away.</span> <span id="s661">I should have just said, and I said, well, let me go back by myself.</span> <span id="s662">They're not going to bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">And I went back and I finally did find that house, rang the doorbell and delivered the letter, ran like heck out of there to find my aunt again.</span> <span id="s664">And she was waiting around the corner on a bench somewhere.</span> <span id="s665">That's, those are two incidents I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: How much did you know about what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually.</span> <span id="s668">At first, we didn't really know what was going on.</span> <span id="s669">Certainly not before 1942.</span> <span id="s670">And even in 1942, early in the game, we were only sensing something was going on.</span> <span id="s671">And it was very important.</span> <span id="s672">But, we couldn't pinpoint what it was.</span> <span id="s673">But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war, there are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive.</span> <span id="s674">And it didn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and two together and began to realize how important it was.</span> <span id="s675">And what was the purpose of all these kids coming and going.</span> <span id="s676">And some I would never see again, some I would see again, maybe two or three months later.</span> <span id="s677">That would be when a hiding place would be blown for example, you know?</span> <span id="s678">Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back.</span> <span id="s679">People were talking or whatever.</span> <span id="s680">Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my little six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can perceive already.</span> <span id="s681">So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people thought we were.</span> <span id="s682">Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: So you weren't given much information?</span> <span id="s684">You didn't talk about it with your uncles or...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No.</span> <span id="s686">No.</span> <span id="s687">The only thing that was talked to or talked about was where to go put a letter and where to take a child.</span> <span id="s688">That was all.</span> <span id="s689">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s690">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s691">Even though, you know, I'm sure that if I had been put under torture, I would have certainly said what I knew.</span> <span id="s692">You know, at 12 or 13, you don't resist torture, you have to talk.</span> <span id="s693">I'm sure I couldn't have withstood torture.</span> <span id="s694">It never happened.</span> <span id="s695">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s696">But I'm sure I would have given them more information than everybody else thought I knew.</span> <span id="s697">And I had a couple of cousins who were about my age, who knew almost as much as I did, even though they weren't quite so close to Father Bruno because they lived in a different house in a different part of Brussels.</span> <span id="s698">But nevertheless, they weren't fools, they knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: You said you were asked to escort some of these kids to hiding places.</span> <span id="s700">What kind of places did you take them to?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Just families.</span> <span id="s702">Just mostly families.</span> <span id="s703">Occasionally a convent, or occasionally a school, but most of the time, families.</span> <span id="s704">And I cannot be sure of that, but I believe that one time I took a child to this extraordinary lady who helped Father Bruno with at least 50 of the children, and was, never asked for any payment except for her train fare and an occasional lunch.</span> <span id="s705">And I think I met her then, but that's a little fuzzy in my mind.</span> <span id="s706">I can't be absolutely sure.</span> <span id="s707">Mostly, these were families or private persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: What did you talk about with the kids you were transporting?</span> <span id="s709">You were, how did you transport them?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: On foot or in the street car, public transportation.</span> <span id="s711">The street cars were the only public transportation available, there were no busses, no gasoline.</span> <span id="s712">And, I think we would just talk about usual kid stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s713">School or maybe talk about the people around us.</span> <span id="s714">Talking about, you know, games or whatever.</span> <span id="s715">I think we would just talk about ordinary things.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Never, definitely never, about deportation, about camps or all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s717">Of course, we didn't know much about the camps anyway.</span> <span id="s718">But, not at that time we didn't, but we would never say, oh, your uncle so and so went away.</span> <span id="s719">What happened to him?</span> <span id="s720">Never.</span> <span id="s721">That was forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Did you have a sense of their fear or trepidation or...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Occasionally, some kids were pretty antsy, yeah.</span> <span id="s724">Occasionally.</span> <span id="s725">Some of them would be kind of, you know, looking around and checking to see if they were being followed and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Mostly the older ones, I mean older, I mean 8, 9, 10 year olds.</span> <span id="s727">Not a four or five year olds.</span> <span id="s728">But, I think that, yeah, some of the older kids were scared, obviously scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did you have to say something to them so they wouldn't give themselves away?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, we tried to, I don't know, what do you do when somebody's scared?</span> <span id="s731">You try to talk about something else, distract them, you know.</span> <span id="s732">That's all we could do, you know.</span> <span id="s733">Or we would just try to interrupt their train of thought by pointing at something, oh, look at that, you know.</span> <span id="s734">Something like that.</span> <span id="s735">I had, this had nothing to do with Father Bruno, but I had a classmate whose mother was killed in the bombing, bombing by the Americans, by the way.</span> <span id="s736">And every time there was an air raid, he would literally go into a trance, into hysterics.</span> <span id="s737">And there was nothing we could do to, you know, to calm him down.</span> <span id="s738">He would just shake all over and perspire and moan and he never got over that.</span> <span id="s739">He never recovered.</span> <span id="s740">In fact, he died rather miserably ten years ago or something like that.</span> <span id="s741">And, so there were times where you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s742">But this never actually happened to me with one of kids I was escorting.</span> <span id="s743">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: What about the risk to you?</span> <span id="s745">Was this exciting?</span> <span id="s746">Was this like a big adventure?</span> <span id="s747">Or were you a little bit nervous?</span> <span id="s748">I mean, you were taking risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: You're 12, 13 year old.</span> <span id="s750">You don't think of risk.</span> <span id="s751">You don't think of, you think of it as, you think of it as a new adventure.</span> <span id="s752">You think of it as something different, you know, outside of going to school and doing your homework and going to bed and have breakfast and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s753">Suddenly, there was something, and you had, you know, sort of a feeling of being useful.</span> <span id="s754">Because they were calling upon you to do something.</span> <span id="s755">You know.</span> <span id="s756">You were no longer the little child playing with his little cars and, toy cars in the corner.</span> <span id="s757">You know, you were part of the responsibility.</span> <span id="s758">So, no.</span> <span id="s759">Well, of course, we knew about some, something of the risk.</span> <span id="s760">We knew to avoid the Germans as much as possible.</span> <span id="s761">But that was even before.</span> <span id="s762">I mean, we tried to avoid the Germans, when we saw a group of Germans on the street corner, we immediately changed course and took another street.</span> <span id="s763">Even before 1942.</span> <span id="s764">We just didn't want to, you know, that was, that kind of risk we knew we shouldn't take, we weren't supposed to take a risk by going too close to the enemy.</span> <span id="s765">Oh, that's something we acquired immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">And our parents certainly re-emphasized that, too.</span> <span id="s767">Sure.</span> <span id="s768">It's interesting because my first exposure with the Nazi military was before World War II and I was in Switzerland with my parents in a town that's right at the border, the German border, called Reinfelden(ph).</span> <span id="s769">There's a lovely bridge there.</span> <span id="s770">And on one side is a Swiss guard and on the other side is a German guard.</span> <span id="s771">And I was, I think, seven or eight years old at that time.</span> <span id="s772">And, you know, like any kid, I ran on the bridge and the Swiss soldier stopped me and said in French, because he'd heard we'd spoke French, he says, don't go there, this guy is bad on the other side.</span> <span id="s773">So, the Swiss didn't like the Nazis any more than we did.</span> <span id="s774">Even though they spoke German in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Did you, were your activities secret even from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No.</span> <span id="s777">No, my parents knew about it.</span> <span id="s778">In fact, we had three Jewish people in our house in a row, I mean, success, in succession.</span> <span id="s779">We had first, I think the first one was a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s780">Blond, Polish girl who was a little ornery.</span> <span id="s781">She was a bit difficult.</span> <span id="s782">She didn't want to be cooped up.</span> <span id="s783">And, in fact, she left us.</span> <span id="s784">To go with a Belgian policeman.</span> <span id="s785">The last we heard, she was working as a, I don't know what you call it, a call girl or something in a tavern.</span> <span id="s786">Not far from our house.</span> <span id="s787">Where German officers went.</span> <span id="s788">I guess that fact that she was blond and blue eyed didn't tip off the Germans that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s789">Then we had a large German, no, yes, German woman, but from East Germany.</span> <span id="s790">And she was very, very scared.</span> <span id="s791">She was very, very scared.</span> <span id="s792">She stayed with us for about, I think, three months and then Father Bruno came and took her out and took her away.</span> <span id="s793">And then we had another woman and she told us all kinds of funny stories.</span> <span id="s794">She told us the stories of Laurel and Hardy movies.</span> <span id="s795">In French.</span> <span id="s796">And on the Liberation Day, September 3, 1944, she ran to her room, picked up her suitcase, she only had one suitcase, packed up, ran out the door and we never saw her again.</span> <span id="s797">I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s798">She was just so elated she was free again, that she just ran out the door.</span> <span id="s799">So that was the last, the last one I ever saw actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: So a number of, how many?</span> <span id="s801">Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s803">A number of people in your families, in your family, hid Jews?</span> <span id="s804">Is that what you're saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s806">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s807">The nuns did in their convent in Liesch(ph).</span> <span id="s808">The other nun, who was at that time in Brussels, no, no, she was in Schlovese(ph), another small town.</span> <span id="s809">That convent also hid a couple of kids.</span> <span id="s810">My parents did.</span> <span id="s811">My father did surgery on a couple of Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s812">Another anecdote.</span> <span id="s813">He had a small child who had appendicitis, put him in the open ward because that's the way hospitals were at that time.</span> <span id="s814">Maybe 20 patients in an open ward.</span> <span id="s815">And, believe it or not, a German soldier had a bad car accident right in front of the hospital.</span> <span id="s816">So, instead of taking him to the military hospital which was the other side of the city, they took him to my father's ward.</span> <span id="s817">So, at one end we had the Jewish child with appendicitis, at the other end we had an injured German soldier.</span> <span id="s818">But, you know what?</span> <span id="s819">It turned out to be a sort of a protection.</span> <span id="s820">Because this guy was there lying, he was there for at least a week before they transported him to the military hospital, well, there was a constant flow of friends and officers coming to comfort him and bring him candy and flowers and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s821">They wouldn't pay any attention to the rest of the ward.</span> <span id="s822">And there wouldn't be any searches during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I need to stop here because we're really... End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Are you ready?</span> <span id="s826">I'm rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Oh, you are rolling.</span> <span id="s828">I just started.</span> <span id="s829">Just.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Are there other memories you have of your own personal experiences during the war, you're own involvement in trying to help people?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Not specifically aimed at Father Bruno's network.</span> <span id="s832">More like the general population.</span> <span id="s833">Yes.</span> <span id="s834">For example, we had a big house and I didn't like the house, but that's neither here nor there, it used to belong, a hundred years ago, no a hundred and fifty years ago, to twin brothers who were wine merchants and they had cellars that were two level cellars, like in a sub-basement, if you want, basement and sub-basement.</span> <span id="s835">All of these were vaulted, almost like a cathedral.</span> <span id="s836">And because of that, we had the visit of the air defense people who came and looked at our place and they said, well, this is a pretty safe basement.</span> <span id="s837">It can probably resist most of the normal bombs that were available in those days.</span> <span id="s838">Would you be willing to open that up to the public?</span> <span id="s839">And we did.</span> <span id="s840">And so, yes there were numbers of people from our neighborhood who would come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun.</span> <span id="s841">Because they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with them our food.</span> <span id="s842">And in that cellar, I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">And I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit.</span> <span id="s844">And there was an air intake, a sort of a column about a foot and a half in diameter which let the air in and opened up in our back yard and I was the air raid signaler.</span> <span id="s845">I was in charge of listening if I could hear the airplanes and if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming.</span> <span id="s846">And also to warn them when it was the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go home.</span> <span id="s847">That was my duty at that time.</span> <span id="s848">So, this is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid.</span> <span id="s849">And other than that, well, yeah, distributing whatever little food we had to some other people who had even less.</span> <span id="s850">My mother did that, but she did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization.</span> <span id="s851">And my great aunt, who was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization.</span> <span id="s852">Took me around a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Yeah.</span> <span id="s854">But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s855">That was mostly just ordinary being nice to people.</span> <span id="s856">Oh, I might mention that even though my wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish resistance in their attic.</span> <span id="s857">That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them also got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the attic when, you know, in a neighborhood where everyone knew everything about everybody.</span> <span id="s858">So, what they did, they waited until it was dark, called the ambulance, had my wife's sister climb on the stretcher with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the stretcher in the ambulance and took the whole thing to the hospital.</span> <span id="s859">So, of course, my sister- in-law had to stay away from the house for at least a week because they kept people in the hospital for at least a week after appendectomy in those days.</span> <span id="s860">And then to bring the man back was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again, they had to be very careful at night.</span> <span id="s861">And there was an asthmatic woman living right across, because those were row houses, and she would always open her window during the night to take a breath of fresh air.</span> <span id="s862">And they had to wait until she closed the window before any movement could occur in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Let's get back to your family.</span> <span id="s864">Your immediate family.</span> <span id="s865">You started to tell me who all was involved in this rescue operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Who, well.</span> <span id="s867">Father Bruno was the driving force.</span> <span id="s868">The leader.</span> <span id="s869">He was also the person having no children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Whether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were smarter than that.</span> <span id="s871">But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you help me, but I will never mention you or anything.</span> <span id="s872">But he got his mother involved, my grandmother, my father, who was a surgeon.</span> <span id="s873">My younger uncle who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s874">My uncle by marriage who was the finance man.</span> <span id="s875">And his three sisters who were nuns.</span> <span id="s876">But, that was only a very small part of the network.</span> <span id="s877">Because he had to have a lot more help than that.</span> <span id="s878">So, he got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally.</span> <span id="s879">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not.</span> <span id="s880">He did all kinds of visits himself to the families where he wanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous story of the University professor in Louvan(ph), Belgium who was a devout Catholic and my uncle went to see him and told him all that was happening.</span> <span id="s881">And the man said, you know, I honestly am not aware of this.</span> <span id="s882">But, my duty as a Christian is to help you.</span> <span id="s883">When are you going to bring me a child?</span> <span id="s884">And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting for him.</span> <span id="s885">He said when he went to Israel after the war, that no one actually shut the door on him.</span> <span id="s886">So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a family or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would consider them as being servants.</span> <span id="s887">And they wouldn't like that.</span> <span id="s888">So, there were a few, but I would say not more than five or six such incidents occurred.</span> <span id="s889">And the vast majority of the people were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s890">But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved eventually.</span> <span id="s891">Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't know exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three hundred and fifty.</span> <span id="s892">That may be a little too much.</span> <span id="s893">We don't know.</span> <span id="s894">Because, obviously, for security reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war.</span> <span id="s895">So all the records he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then transferred to a more elaborate ledger.</span> <span id="s896">And so he lost track of a few of them.</span> <span id="s897">So we know for sure of about three hundred and twenty.</span> <span id="s898">And since each child probably had to be moved, one, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably something like a thousand transfers.</span> <span id="s899">You know?</span> <span id="s900">Not, there were sometimes the same families taking different children.</span> <span id="s901">But, most of the time they, you know when there was too much talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new families all the time.</span> <span id="s902">And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people of his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that.</span> <span id="s903">Like eight or nine, maybe ten.</span> <span id="s904">Close associates.</span> <span id="s905">But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were involved that should not be forgotten or neglected.</span> <span id="s906">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: How did he get into this?</span> <span id="s908">What, I mean, yes, he was a good man, but how did he initially get involved with this rescue operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to come as a chaplain, in a small school for the blind in the southern part of Belgium called Hodbomo(ph).</span> <span id="s910">And when he got there he discovered that there were some blind children, but that most of the occupants there were Jewish.</span> <span id="s911">Including the director.</span> <span id="s912">And that, you know, it just, he just saw the light immediately.</span> <span id="s913">But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in Germany.</span> <span id="s914">I told you that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in Frankfurt in a busy street and he saw people just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone.</span> <span id="s915">And he got closer and he saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black hat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s916">And they were spitting at him and pushing him and that absolutely tore him apart.</span> <span id="s917">But, obviously, being in Germany, he couldn't do a thing about it.</span> <span id="s918">You know?</span> <span id="s919">He couldn't go to the rescue of the man.</span> <span id="s920">If it had been in Belgium, he probably would have, but not in Germany.</span> <span id="s921">And he never forgot that incident.</span> <span id="s922">And when he got to Hodbomo, that little school for the blind, he said, well, now I realize the full impact of what I saw in Germany and he decided to help.</span> <span id="s923">And he didn't help because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s924">He helped because they were people.</span> <span id="s925">He said, I don't care if they had been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s926">He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other people, which made it a little easier for him to understand.</span> <span id="s927">But, he was mostly concerned about human beings, about people.</span> <span id="s928">And he said, you know, I have to do something to save those people.</span> <span id="s929">I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people.</span> <span id="s930">They are oppressed.</span> <span id="s931">They are persecuted.</span> <span id="s932">My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them if I can.</span> <span id="s933">Then, at Hodbomo, he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer in Liesch(ph) and was the executive director of the camps for sickly and destitute children of the archdiocese of Liesch whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time.</span> <span id="s934">And they started working together and Vandenburg was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno who was, you know, free of family, in a way.</span> <span id="s935">Didn't have any children and so on, and was willing to do anything to help.</span> <span id="s936">And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s937">At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction of the military government.</span> <span id="s938">And he was condemned to three months in jail and he was very happy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that.</span> <span id="s939">And he got out of jail and the Gestapo was waiting outside.</span> <span id="s940">Took him again.</span> <span id="s941">Sent him to Bergen Belsen where he finally, well, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after the liberation of the camp, of typhus.</span> <span id="s942">Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a deadly disease.</span> <span id="s943">And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network by contacting various people.</span> <span id="s944">Some of the people he already knew from the camps because they were helpers in the camps and this way he was able to place a few children.</span> <span id="s945">But, the first month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to mention that the school became very unsafe because in the village people began talking, I'm sure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking.</span> <span id="s946">And talking, as I said, is very dangerous.</span> <span id="s947">You know, the enemy has ears everywhere.</span> <span id="s948">So, the first thing that Father Bruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other places.</span> <span id="s949">So right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that school.</span> <span id="s950">So they placed those, the early ones, they placed in convents or, again, in the camps.</span> <span id="s951">But even that became unsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids, there were some adults who were also in the camps and they were arrested and sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s952">One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the name of Lepkifka(ph).</span> <span id="s953">And he escaped but his parents went to and died in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s954">And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of Vandenburg and...I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: That's okay, let it go.</span> <span id="s956">A: What's up?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: It's okay, continue please.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s959">You know, to publicize the work of Vandenburg and, incidentally, of Father Bruno as well.</span> <span id="s960">They knew each other quite well.</span> <span id="s961">As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running the camp were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi who was very broad minded at the same time.</span> <span id="s962">So, that did a lot to smooth any possible differences that might have occurred under his guidance.</span> <span id="s963">And then you, I think you were asking me how he got to do that.</span> <span id="s964">Well, then people heard about his work and they came with requests, you know.</span> <span id="s965">Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in safety.</span> <span id="s966">And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them.</span> <span id="s967">Eventually after a few months, I think it was in July of '43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a month.</span> <span id="s968">That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his bicycle across Belgium, you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring the child.</span> <span id="s969">It was a day and night job.</span> <span id="s970">You know, he worked 18 hours a day.</span> <span id="s971">And sometimes more.</span> <span id="s972">He said after the war that he had crisscrossed Belgium 40 times the distance that the bicycle racers do for the tour of Belgium now.</span> <span id="s973">So, that give you an idea of how much bicycling he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What was the involvement of the, or support of the Catholic church in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Well, in Belgium, as opposed to some of the eastern European countries, the majority of the Catholic church was helpful.</span> <span id="s976">The Cardinal, the Primate of Belgium, Cardinal VanLouie(ph), had directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious.</span> <span id="s977">But he did several times, issue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this.</span> <span id="s978">I will do, I will not interfere if you do that.</span> <span id="s979">In other words, he was giving them free rein without saying, I want you to save the Jews.</span> <span id="s980">Because that would immediately have put him in jail right there.</span> <span id="s981">And he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s982">And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius XXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my parents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he became the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that the Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the Vatican itself saved around 20,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s983">Including the Grand Rabbi of Rome who was at the Vatican during the war.</span> <span id="s984">Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because he didn't do enough.</span> <span id="s985">But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different angles.</span> <span id="s986">It, there is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade the Vatican.</span> <span id="s987">And take the Pope prisoner.</span> <span id="s988">He couldn't have done anything any more at that time.</span> <span id="s989">So, in other words, what he did in a concealed way, was probably more useful than if he had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it.</span> <span id="s990">They said he was a friend of the Germans.</span> <span id="s991">Yes, that's true.</span> <span id="s992">He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in Munich for several years and he really liked the people of Germany.</span> <span id="s993">But, he abhorred Nazism.</span> <span id="s994">In fact, one of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without reservation.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: One of the reasons I'm asking about Belgium in particular is that as we know in many instances, there was a, there were traditional beliefs about Jewish people as traitors, as Christ killers, as whatever.</span> <span id="s996">And the Catholic church was not always as supportive toward helping Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Well, you know, let's say that in my environment, it wasn't the case.</span> <span id="s998">I cannot speak for all the Belgians, but in my environment, it was not the case.</span> <span id="s999">And from what I've been reading and from what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in Holland and in Belgium than, for example, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1000">Because in Poland, even now, there is still a great hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1001">Let's face it.</span> <span id="s1002">That was not the case in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1003">It was not the case in Holland, either.</span> <span id="s1004">I want to say here that we never knew exactly how many Jews were in Belgium because people were not registered as to their race, religion, creed or anything else.</span> <span id="s1005">We figure that there were probably, including all the refugees from the east, in 1938, '39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something like 70,000.</span> <span id="s1006">Only about 30,000 survived.</span> <span id="s1007">And that was better than Holland.</span> <span id="s1008">Where only, I think, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived.</span> <span id="s1009">So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">They had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic.</span> <span id="s1011">Very sad, tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Let's stop here for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1013">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: In this rescue network of your uncle's, who, was he involved with organizations?</span> <span id="s1016">Did he get help or finances from different resistance organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation.</span> <span id="s1018">He did have assistants.</span> <span id="s1019">He had people helping him find families.</span> <span id="s1020">He had people taking care of false identification papers and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1021">But as far as administration, he was it.</span> <span id="s1022">He had all the power and all the responsibility.</span> <span id="s1023">As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his possessions were on his body.</span> <span id="s1024">That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was about it.</span> <span id="s1025">He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were willing to contribute.</span> <span id="s1026">But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the .</span> <span id="s1027">The largest bank in Belgium whose director we called governor in those days.</span> <span id="s1028">Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s1029">And he committed himself to contributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1030">It may not have been quite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help.</span> <span id="s1031">Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Gallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack Dupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1033">Another uncle of mine.</span> <span id="s1034">And he continued doing that until the liberation.</span> <span id="s1035">Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of Nazi thugs who one day came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan?</span> <span id="s1036">And he said, yes.</span> <span id="s1037">And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front of his wife.</span> <span id="s1038">But the bank continued honoring his commitment all the way to the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: What about other organizations such as the Jewish Defense Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Well, there was, of course, the CDJ, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the initials are the same in English as in French, .</span> <span id="s1041">Who was very active and collaborated very closely with Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1042">The problem with that is, like it was in France, some of the leaders of that group were, how shall I say, were persuaded by the Germans to cooperate with them.</span> <span id="s1043">But, of course, the ultimate idea was not at all cooperation, it was to get all the information they could get.</span> <span id="s1044">And so, Father Bruno was a little bit reluctant to associate directly with the CDJ because he knew there were files and reams of paper that could be found and were found by the Gestapo leading to the arrest of quite a number of people.</span> <span id="s1045">Fortunately, most of the members of CDJ escaped death.</span> <span id="s1046">Several went to various camps, but they didn't die.</span> <span id="s1047">One of them was Mrs. Jospa(ph) who was one of the closest collaborators of Father Bruno and is still alive now, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1048">And there were several others who were both in the armed resistance and in the peaceful resistance.</span> <span id="s1049">Because Father Bruno always said, I'm going to be resistance, but I'm going to be a peaceful resistance.</span> <span id="s1050">I will never bear arms.</span> <span id="s1051">Which he didn't.</span> <span id="s1052">But some of the actual armed resistance did cooperate with the peaceful resistance for various reasons and there were several of those, one of them was killed in action and another one died, I believe, after the liberation in an unfortunate accident, in the army at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: What sort of coordination would there have been between this committee and your Uncle's network?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly.</span> <span id="s1055">They were, the CDJ had visitors, or visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various places.</span> <span id="s1056">And they would report to the CDJ, but also to Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1057">And the CDJ had a committee that was specifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed.</span> <span id="s1058">But that was precisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared.</span> <span id="s1059">That there was too much documentation.</span> <span id="s1060">And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any written documentation, without papers.</span> <span id="s1061">He would handle only cash, never checks.</span> <span id="s1062">Or just, you know, items, like butter or meat or something.</span> <span id="s1063">But he would not use things that could be traced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1064">He would meet with the representatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written of their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest.</span> <span id="s1065">Then they kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Not that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone.</span> <span id="s1067">So, they didn't put his name on the records.</span> <span id="s1068">This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I was at that meeting.</span> <span id="s1069">And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it.</span> <span id="s1070">And, but that was deliberate.</span> <span id="s1071">So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">And in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s1073">It wasn't, you know, like in an army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1074">It was a loose cooperation.</span> <span id="s1075">They would have meetings that were informal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of the network.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Were there Protestant groups who were also involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: There was some Protestants but, you know, Belgium has very few Protestants actually.</span> <span id="s1078">But there were several Protestant ministers involved.</span> <span id="s1079">Indeed.</span> <span id="s1080">But to go back to the Catholic clergy.</span> <span id="s1081">There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1082">One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know, at the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own house in Namir.</span> <span id="s1083">And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences.</span> <span id="s1084">Father Bruno did not have a house or an apartment where he could, you know, which he could call his base.</span> <span id="s1085">Until a spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little house she had on the square in the middle of Brussels.</span> <span id="s1086">Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented.</span> <span id="s1087">It was a very small house.</span> <span id="s1088">On the left side was a cafe with horse betting, what do you call that?</span> <span id="s1089">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1090">Anyway, horse betting.</span> <span id="s1091">On the other side was a of the SS, who was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1092">But that turned out, again, to be a sort of a protection.</span> <span id="s1093">Because he was right next to this important Nazi officer and they never ever considered the little house in between there.</span> <span id="s1094">And the second coincidence, Father Andre in Namir had, on his left, a cafe with horse betting and on his right a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German army.</span> <span id="s1095">Can you imagine a more bizarre coincidence than that?</span> <span id="s1096">Father Andre did an awful lot of work and he deserves all the credit.</span> <span id="s1097">I think he is on the list at the museum, also.</span> <span id="s1098">Deserves all the credit.</span> <span id="s1099">And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught.</span> <span id="s1100">There were many other priests, I won't give you all the names.</span> <span id="s1101">First of all, I can't remember them right now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old Belgian family who was a pastor of a church in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1102">He, too, took care of several kids.</span> <span id="s1103">He was a friend of my father's actually.</span> <span id="s1104">And there were quite a number of other clergymen.</span> <span id="s1105">And nuns, of course, too.</span> <span id="s1106">Flora Singer was hidden in a convent of nuns.</span> <span id="s1107">It wasn't always a pleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life.</span> <span id="s1108">Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share what food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were hidden there.</span> <span id="s1109">So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of being cold in their beds because the central heating wasn't working.</span> <span id="s1110">There was no coal.</span> <span id="s1111">And at that time, central heating was mostly coal fired.</span> <span id="s1112">We didn't have any oil.</span> <span id="s1113">Even if it had been oil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway.</span> <span id="s1114">So, yeah, the conditions were not always pleasant.</span> <span id="s1115">But, what's the alternative?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: When you mention the scarcity of food or coal, how did your uncle and his colleagues get enough food or clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course.</span> <span id="s1118">To get enough food and clothing.</span> <span id="s1119">Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and maybe a little more than just enough.</span> <span id="s1120">That was only a small part.</span> <span id="s1121">I think most of the sources were actually legal sources done illegally.</span> <span id="s1122">In other words, there was, for example, the wife of the same professor at the University of Louvan(ph) who at night went, would you believe, to burglarize the office of rationing, the rationing department.</span> <span id="s1123">And stole reams of food stamps.</span> <span id="s1124">Now, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with them.</span> <span id="s1125">That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen.</span> <span id="s1126">So, they had to forge food cards.</span> <span id="s1127">And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father Bruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards.</span> <span id="s1128">Strangely enough, one of the best forgers was an old monk in Father Bruno's abbey, , very, very adorable old father who would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father Bruno that he was doing humanitarian work.</span> <span id="s1129">He said, I can't be a forger.</span> <span id="s1130">But, he did and he was probably the best of all.</span> <span id="s1131">So, they forged hundreds of food cards.</span> <span id="s1132">They also had to forge identity cards to go along with food cards because, unlike the United States, most European countries demand that their citizens bear an identity card on them all the time.</span> <span id="s1133">At least after age 12.</span> <span id="s1134">So, you know, they had to, we had to forge identity cards with false names, false places of birth and false dates of birth so that nothing could be traced.</span> <span id="s1135">One time Father Bruno was at an open market, there was an open flea market in Brussels in the center of the city, and he was looking, I think, for old clothes or something like that.</span> <span id="s1136">And he had his briefcase with him full of blank identity cards.</span> <span id="s1137">And, sure enough, as he walked away, there was a check point with two , who were there and were searching peoples suitcases as well as checking the papers.</span> <span id="s1138">And he had a false identity card himself which said that he was an employee of the government.</span> <span id="s1139">And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was taking work home because he needed to finish some cards for the next day.</span> <span id="s1140">And they let him go.</span> <span id="s1141">Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen.</span> <span id="s1142">But they did.</span> <span id="s1143">That was one of his close escapes.</span> <span id="s1144">He had a few more, but that was one of them.</span> <span id="s1145">And, so, ration cards, food stamps, stolen.</span> <span id="s1146">It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, it was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1147">You had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were stolen, they were not falsified.</span> <span id="s1148">Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then they filled in the name by hand.</span> <span id="s1149">So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult to falsify a card as long as you had one of the city rubber stamps or one of those embossing stamps.</span> <span id="s1150">That worked.</span> <span id="s1151">If you were lucky.</span> <span id="s1152">There was always a problem because, you know, you had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often happen in the SS, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their signature.</span> <span id="s1153">You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they could have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the falsification.</span> <span id="s1154">So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do you call it, a welfare check.</span> <span id="s1155">But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced.</span> <span id="s1156">Most of the time the money, as I said, came either from the bank or from private contributions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Did he have cohorts in government offices?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1159">Yes.</span> <span id="s1160">He had, fortunately, many, many of the Belgian civil service employees were faithful, were reliable.</span> <span id="s1161">They were anti-German and he knew which were and which were not.</span> <span id="s1162">He had a number of helpers, mostly in the municipal governments where it was most important.</span> <span id="s1163">Because that's where the stamps and the cards were issued.</span> <span id="s1164">One day he went in this particular municipal office where he had an appointment with the assistant chief and a lady seemed to be in a hurry and, because he was very courteous, he said, okay, go in first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">She went in, took her time, and he saw two people just babbling or talking about various papers there and then it was his turn and one of the guys walked away, went away.</span> <span id="s1166">Picked up his suitcase, his briefcase, and went away.</span> <span id="s1167">And when he got near the assistant chief, he said, you don't know, but I'm sweating here.</span> <span id="s1168">That man who just left was from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1169">If you had come in at your turn instead of letting the lady go in first, we would have been both caught.</span> <span id="s1170">So, another close escape.</span> <span id="s1171">But, this was help he got from the civil service or the employees of the government, various governments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Were most of these people who helped him motivated by working with Father Bruno, anti- German, or really motivated to rescue Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I think all three.</span> <span id="s1174">I think it varied on the person.</span> <span id="s1175">You may even add one.</span> <span id="s1176">Money.</span> <span id="s1177">Because many rescuers were given money.</span> <span id="s1178">And during the war, money was very tight.</span> <span id="s1179">And some people would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive.</span> <span id="s1180">But, I would say, all three.</span> <span id="s1181">Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1182">Charisma from Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1183">And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal for money at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: What other aspects of the logistics were very difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Transportation.</span> <span id="s1186">Not to be caught.</span> <span id="s1187">Because some kids had to be transported from one end of Belgium to the other.</span> <span id="s1188">And even though Belgium is a small country, that still represented 200 miles sometimes and the trains during the war were extremely slow and rare.</span> <span id="s1189">And so, it may have taken a whole day to do 200 miles by train.</span> <span id="s1190">You know, getting the children registered in a certain municipality with a false ID card.</span> <span id="s1191">It was difficult unless you had cooperation from the local authorities.</span> <span id="s1192">And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have help from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular municipality would be either scared or maybe even pro-German.</span> <span id="s1193">And they would get wind of the thing and immediately the child would have to be moved away.</span> <span id="s1194">That was one of the logistical difficulties, too.</span> <span id="s1195">And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't just barge in those municipal offices and pick your choice of stamps.</span> <span id="s1196">You know, it had to be done extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the employee who would leave the door open, for example.</span> <span id="s1197">Not lock the door.</span> <span id="s1198">And pretend to go home as usual.</span> <span id="s1199">And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and steal.</span> <span id="s1200">And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult.</span> <span id="s1201">Perhaps less difficult than the food cards.</span> <span id="s1202">Logistics.</span> <span id="s1203">Getting clothing.</span> <span id="s1204">Getting a child registered in school because these kids had to continue their education during the war.</span> <span id="s1205">I mean, they couldn't just stay for a year or even two years without any schooling.</span> <span id="s1206">So, to have them accepted in school was not all that hard, but, there were school inspections and the authorities, the occupant authorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come from?</span> <span id="s1207">So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell the Jewish child to stay home or another child to stay home, or another child.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, the teacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go home?</span> <span id="s1209">And the kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here?</span> <span id="s1210">Well, we think he may have a cold, keep him home for a day or two.</span> <span id="s1211">So, that would bring the number back to normal.</span> <span id="s1212">There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language problem.</span> <span id="s1213">Quite a number of these kids were from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1214">And even the Belgian Jews sometimes spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1215">And one incident occurred in a school in the Waloon(ph) part of Belgium, in the southern part of Belgium, and the school inspector came who was, unfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids was there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French?</span> <span id="s1216">And the kid said, yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1217">Alright do you speak other languages?</span> <span id="s1218">Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish.</span> <span id="s1219">And then the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at home?</span> <span id="s1220">Oh, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1221">[sharp intake of breath] That was it.</span> <span id="s1222">He gave it away.</span> <span id="s1223">But, apparently, as far as I know, the child did not get taken.</span> <span id="s1224">Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately before the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another crew to arrest him and so on.</span> <span id="s1225">Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible, you know, passed away without any major trouble.</span> <span id="s1226">But, you never know, little children, even though they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control.</span> <span id="s1227">A little girl in a train with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice gentleman across from her on the seat.</span> <span id="s1228">And he said, what's your name?</span> <span id="s1229">And she said, do you want my real name or the other?</span> <span id="s1230">And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not sympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet.</span> <span id="s1231">But, see how, you know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Other logistical consideration or challenges?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Like what happens in an emergency, for example.</span> <span id="s1236">Well, there really wasn't any set system.</span> <span id="s1237">Again, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you call this person, in that case, you call that person.</span> <span id="s1238">It was strictly a word of mouth affair.</span> <span id="s1239">And one person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find, please find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such town, as soon as he gets there, tell him there is an emergency.</span> <span id="s1240">And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to do in that particular case.</span> <span id="s1241">One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl who, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">She had not been deported.</span> <span id="s1243">She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I have to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were.</span> <span id="s1244">Most of the time they were not told.</span> <span id="s1245">Obviously, again, for security reasons.</span> <span id="s1246">For obvious security reasons.</span> <span id="s1247">Well anyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that she took the train, went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two or three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker.</span> <span id="s1248">And she was hoping to sell those to pay for her train trip.</span> <span id="s1249">She walked into a purse, what do you call those stores where they sell purses?</span> <span id="s1250">In French they call them .</span> <span id="s1251">Anyway, she went in and offered her purses for sale to the man who, I think he even bought them.</span> <span id="s1252">The man was one of the representatives of the Flemish pro-German group in Gent.</span> <span id="s1253">So, the mother went to the convent which was strictly forbidden.</span> <span id="s1254">And the sisters, in a panic, called two or three persons and the chain got into operation and the little girl was taken away after she did see her mother, I have to say, to a secret other place and the sisters simply had to give up keeping Jewish girls because the mother had told this man why she was in Gent.</span> <span id="s1255">You know, sometimes people's brains don't function too well.</span> <span id="s1256">But, anyway, that kind of emergency occurred a fair number of times.</span> <span id="s1257">One time, again you can read that if you want in the biography, there were three kids who were in a home for Jewish children which was completely under German control.</span> <span id="s1258">And Father Bruno wanted those kids to escape.</span> <span id="s1259">And, well to make a long story short, he arranged for them to have diphtheria, quote unquote, and they were immediately transferred to the hospital because of a call, again through the chain, saying that, well, the Germans were terribly afraid of diphtheria, they had to take those contagious children out of the home and isolate them.</span> <span id="s1260">So they did that.</span> <span id="s1261">And, again the chain worked, when they were so called cured, they never had been sick in the first place, Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Ruspa(ph) and a couple of other people took the three children, made a release letter in three copies, gave one to the hospital, mailed one to the home, because the Germans had said, now it's time to go get those children, and have the doctor release them.</span> <span id="s1263">Well, they mailed one, but in the meantime, before the mail got to the home which would take at least 24 hours, the children were far away and they kept the third release copy.</span> <span id="s1264">This was one of the most movie- like episodes because they had to enlist the help of the doctors, of the nurses, of the bacteriologist who falsified the cultures.</span> <span id="s1265">Of the bacteriologist, again, who had to say they were cured.</span> <span id="s1266">Of the person who made the release letter, who said they could be picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">And knew perfectly well they were not going to be picked up because they were already gone.</span> <span id="s1268">You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1269">But, nothing failed, everything worked fine.</span> <span id="s1270">What other logistical things were we talking about, again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Well, I'm sort of curious.</span> <span id="s1272">This may be a dumb question, but, how did people find Father Bruno and how did he find families to take care of the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1274">Well, how did they find Father Bruno?</span> <span id="s1275">Occasionally, through the CDJ, but most of the time a simple word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1276">Mrs. Abraham on this floor would talk to Sarah on the other floor and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little daughter and hid her.</span> <span id="s1277">You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find you.</span> <span id="s1278">Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter.</span> <span id="s1279">And they would do that.</span> <span id="s1280">Family members.</span> <span id="s1281">Sometimes out of the blue.</span> <span id="s1282">He would never know where or how those people would have got his name.</span> <span id="s1283">Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally unknown person got my name, who else got my name?</span> <span id="s1284">And, as a matter of fact, there was one time when he was going in one of the streets in Brussels to go collect a little boy, I think, and as he was turning the corner, he saw a black car stopping in front there and he knew that was the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1285">And they got the boy.</span> <span id="s1286">He never had the boy.</span> <span id="s1287">He never had this child, didn't put his hand on the child once.</span> <span id="s1288">But, they got the child.</span> <span id="s1289">That was very sad.</span> <span id="s1290">That was one of his most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten the child yet.</span> <span id="s1291">But, someone had babbled and that was it.</span> <span id="s1292">Then, we were talking about emotional issues.</span> <span id="s1293">That was a big problem.</span> <span id="s1294">Many of these children, of course, didn't want to leave their parents.</span> <span id="s1295">Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and they would try to make do.</span> <span id="s1296">The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones, it was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle.</span> <span id="s1297">Particularly for Father Bruno who had never had any children of his own.</span> <span id="s1298">And this was one of the reasons why he was known to keep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time.</span> <span id="s1299">In addition to looking for new places, he kept track of the old places.</span> <span id="s1300">And one of the most intimate friends of Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers who are now in this country.</span> <span id="s1301">And they describe when he would come to the farm where they were hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come with green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers.</span> <span id="s1302">With green knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that?</span> <span id="s1303">Well, I'm not Father Bruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so.</span> <span id="s1304">He had several identities.</span> <span id="s1305">And his last identity was Msr.</span> <span id="s1306">Renau(ph), you know Renau in French means fox.</span> <span id="s1307">And it was kind of play on words, of course, because he out-foxed them all the time.</span> <span id="s1308">And he said, no, I am Msr.</span> <span id="s1309">Renau, you don't know me as Father Bruno any more.</span> <span id="s1310">And he would visit them as often as he could.</span> <span id="s1311">But, of course, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day.</span> <span id="s1312">But, he would keep track precisely for those emotional reasons.</span> <span id="s1313">Because he had a charisma and he inspired confidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand.</span> <span id="s1314">And they would really get very, very attached to him.</span> <span id="s1315">And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed their anxieties.</span> <span id="s1316">And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better.</span> <span id="s1317">He made a big point of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: How do you find all of these families who would harbor the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Well, again, it's word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1320">And occasionally, as we said before, by the CDJ, the Committee for the Defense of Jews.</span> <span id="s1321">Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk to those people.</span> <span id="s1322">Like the University professor I mentioned.</span> <span id="s1323">He would just go in their house and say, I want you to help.</span> <span id="s1324">And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say no.</span> <span id="s1325">You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do is say, now, you're going to have to do it.</span> <span id="s1326">And we did.</span> <span id="s1327">You know.</span> <span id="s1328">Both my sister and my brother and I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this.</span> <span id="s1329">And we would do it.</span> <span id="s1330">Even if we had been very bad with our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: But I mean, isn't there a whole issue of trust?</span> <span id="s1332">In just approaching people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1334">Well, he approached people after, you know, carefully selecting them.</span> <span id="s1335">People he knew were trustworthy and people he had known for a long time.</span> <span id="s1336">His close friends.</span> <span id="s1337">Or people who were guaranteed by others.</span> <span id="s1338">There was always a risk.</span> <span id="s1339">There was always a risk.</span> <span id="s1340">Accepting a Jewish child from a family was a risk.</span> <span id="s1341">Not for the Germans, where the Germans were concerned.</span> <span id="s1342">But what if that person was a traitor?</span> <span id="s1343">What if the child was not Jewish and was just being used as a, you know, a trap.</span> <span id="s1344">You know?</span> <span id="s1345">There was always a risk.</span> <span id="s1346">But, for some reason, he must have had, he must have been a good judge of character, because the only time he almost got caught was when this dreadful traitor, so called Captain Jackson who was not a Captain Jackson, he was a Belgian by the name of Bziter(ph).</span> <span id="s1347">Convened a so called resistance group and he refused to go because he smelled a rat.</span> <span id="s1348">And all the people who went, went to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1349">And he didn't go.</span> <span id="s1350">Because he smelled a rat.</span> <span id="s1351">So, you know, he had a sixth sense that made him know when people were genuine or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Was this the time when there were arrests at Mossesar(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: No.</span> <span id="s1354">That was, these arrests were made in Male(ph) in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1355">Male(ph) Mechalen(ph) which is city between Brussels and Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1356">No.</span> <span id="s1357">And there were several of his assistants who went there and they got caught.</span> <span id="s1358">But I don't think they died in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1359">But, that's neither here nor there, I mean, they could have.</span> <span id="s1360">They were trapped by this traitor who was shot after the war.</span> <span id="s1361">He was condemned by a military court and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Wasn't there some close call at Mossesar, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1364">Well, that was early in the game, actually.</span> <span id="s1365">Early in the game when he was only beginning his network.</span> <span id="s1366">He was still at the abbey and they came and searched the abbey at Mossesar from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1367">He managed to hide a bunch of papers in a chimney and, again, those numskulls didn't even think of looking in there.</span> <span id="s1368">But, he hid them in a secret door or trap in the chimney and they never found anything.</span> <span id="s1369">But that's when the superior of the abbey said, listen, I have 80 monks here and their my responsibility.</span> <span id="s1370">I can't have you have your base of work, I approve of what you're doing, but I can't let you have your base here at the monastery.</span> <span id="s1371">Because the next time they come, they will find something and we'll all go to Bruckenvald(ph) or whatever.</span> <span id="s1372">And, so, that's when he moved out of the abbey.</span> <span id="s1373">But that was still fairly early in the game, that was in 1942.</span> <span id="s1374">And he then rented a small apartment in Luvan(ph) and that became unsafe, too.</span> <span id="s1375">And he then rented another apartment in Brussels, which he kept for a few months.</span> <span id="s1376">And then came the little house from that lady between the and the horse betting institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Did he have any time for traditional religious practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Well, he was given dispensation from mandatory celebration of Mass every Sunday by his superiors.</span> <span id="s1379">They realized that he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1380">But, whenever he had a chance, he would go to my grandmother's house and in the attic he had a tiny little alter which he built himself and he would celebrate Mass for us there.</span> <span id="s1381">That's one of the very vivid memories I keep of all of us, you know, really tightly packed in that tiny little attic and him just having barely space to turn around and speak to us.</span> <span id="s1382">That I remember very vividly.</span> <span id="s1383">So, he did as much as he could but it's quite obvious that sometimes he had to do without.</span> <span id="s1384">You know, if on Sunday morning he had an emergency, well, that went before celebrating Mass.</span> <span id="s1385">And he had permission not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: How did you feel as you learned more about this, probably afterwards, about being involved in this incredible network?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Afterwards, after the war when I was old enough to really grasp the danger and the risk, I was terrified.</span> <span id="s1388">I said, my gosh, we did all that?</span> <span id="s1389">And then when that time passed, I said, why, I'm very happy we did.</span> <span id="s1390">I felt very good.</span> <span id="s1391">I said, well, I didn't do much, but at least I was part of that and I'm so proud of having his name, bearing his name.</span> <span id="s1392">You know, that's something that is, it remains with you all your life because not so many people are given that opportunity to help.</span> <span id="s1393">And to do it willingly.</span> <span id="s1394">That, now I shouldn't be overly proud because I did so little, but when I think of my family, I'm still pretty proud.</span> <span id="s1395">You know, we all took risks, especially the adults, they risked their lives of course, and there were close calls.</span> <span id="s1396">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s1397">I guess we were blessed in our efforts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: What happened at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: I'm not so sure.</span> <span id="s1400">I don't want to elaborate too much on that because there were some slightly unpleasant moments.</span> <span id="s1401">Most of them were very happy moments.</span> <span id="s1402">Kids finding remainders of their families.</span> <span id="s1403">There were very sad moments in that happiness because they knew that their parents and grandparents had died.</span> <span id="s1404">But they were happy to return to a family.</span> <span id="s1405">Some people didn't even, some kids didn't have a family to go back to.</span> <span id="s1406">Some of them were kept in convents where they were and they were in slightly better condition because the rationing was over.</span> <span id="s1407">And some of them stayed in school.</span> <span id="s1408">Some of them had requested to be baptized, but that, oh, I want to insist on this point.</span> <span id="s1409">This is a point that Father Bruno was extraordinarily touchy about.</span> <span id="s1410">He absolutely refused to put any pressure on any Jewish child to change his religion.</span> <span id="s1411">To convert, quote unquote.</span> <span id="s1412">That he was adamant about.</span> <span id="s1413">He said we are to save them, but their souls do not belong to us.</span> <span id="s1414">That was one of his principles.</span> <span id="s1415">And, but some of them who were, you know, exposed to the liturgy and to maybe some slightly, you know, warmer person in the Catholic church, wanted to, there were about five or six of them who wanted to be baptized and that was a big point of contention.</span> <span id="s1416">Because he actually did not want to baptize them unless he had the total guarantee that first of all, the parents wanted it if they were still alive.</span> <span id="s1417">Second, that they would have accepted it if they, none of them did, but had previously made that allowance or permission if you want, and that his superiors were in agreement, too.</span> <span id="s1418">And I think there were about five out of the 320 or something who were baptized and I think, two or maybe three remained in the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s1419">The other two just went back to Judaism.</span> <span id="s1420">And he found that fine.</span> <span id="s1421">He said, first of all, you weren't totally adult, you were not sure what you were doing.</span> <span id="s1422">Now you saw your fellow Jews and you wanted to be more close to them, fine, go back, that's alright.</span> <span id="s1423">He never, never put any obstacle to that.</span> <span id="s1424">And he always refused to put pressure.</span> <span id="s1425">Now, I won't say that there wasn't an occasional old crotchety nun who thought that being non-Christian was the worst sin in the world.</span> <span id="s1426">And may have put some pressure on some of the kids, that's possible.</span> <span id="s1427">That is, I'm not denying that.</span> <span id="s1428">Neither did Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1429">But, it was against his will and, actually, there is no record that any of those actually did change, so it was just an annoyance and was a little child abuse, I would say.</span> <span id="s1430">Moral child abuse.</span> <span id="s1431">Which he certainly didn't approve of.</span> <span id="s1432">Okay.</span> <span id="s1433">I digress now.</span> <span id="s1434">What were you asking me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: We were talking about the difficulties after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Right, that's right.</span> <span id="s1437">It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving parents, if there were any.</span> <span id="s1438">To find surviving family.</span> <span id="s1439">Uncles, cousins, if there were any.</span> <span id="s1440">And to find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available.</span> <span id="s1441">Some of the kids, even though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored them during the war.</span> <span id="s1442">That became a little difficult because the CDJ, after the war, tried to gather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which is fine, I mean, it was a legitimate concern of them.</span> <span id="s1443">The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a home for Jewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1444">And some members of the CDJ wanted some of the kids to go there.</span> <span id="s1445">But Father Bruno said, I don't want that.</span> <span id="s1446">I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want them to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them religion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to practice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so.</span> <span id="s1447">And that was one of the points of contention.</span> <span id="s1448">Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1449">Another point of contention was some of the relatives who wanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed.</span> <span id="s1450">And I have, unfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my younger uncle's house the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was staying there, without permission from anybody else.</span> <span id="s1451">Not even the CDJ, by the way.</span> <span id="s1452">You know.</span> <span id="s1453">They just came and took the child.</span> <span id="s1454">Not knowing if the parents were alive or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">They just wanted the kid.</span> <span id="s1456">And they didn't even live in the same city.</span> <span id="s1457">There were a few unpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of these children went pretty smoothly.</span> <span id="s1458">Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who made a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the, I forget the new name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the CDJ, it's the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: So, Father Bruno's work didn't end at liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: No, it didn't.</span> <span id="s1461">In fact, he continued to work for about two months and then had a bad accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">And had to be hospitalized for a full month.</span> <span id="s1463">And during that time, he was unable to do anything.</span> <span id="s1464">Most of his assistants took over.</span> <span id="s1465">And took over the replacement functions and he kind of loosely supervised after that.</span> <span id="s1466">Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the war he was an army chaplain, yeah, he was a mobile Benedictine.</span> <span id="s1467">He was an army chaplain during the campaign of 1940.</span> <span id="s1468">He was slightly wounded and was taken prisoner of war in Germany.</span> <span id="s1469">Then after World War II, after his accident was healed, his superiors said it was okay for him to go back into the army.</span> <span id="s1470">And he went back into the army for another three years.</span> <span id="s1471">And he went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1472">And this is where he was able to see with his own eyes numerous concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1473">Particularly Neu , which he photographed extensively.</span> <span id="s1474">And Bergen Belsen and several others.</span> <span id="s1475">I forget which ones they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: From my reading, I understand that your uncle was a true intellectual, a scholar, and yet, came time for the war, he had tremendous street smarts, pragmatic skills all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Yes, and people have all the qualities, don't they?</span> <span id="s1480">He was a Benedictine.</span> <span id="s1481">And in French we had a saying for people who do enormous amounts of tedious, lengthy work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">.</span> <span id="s1483">The work of a Benedictine.</span> <span id="s1484">And in addition to his action work during World War II, he did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1485">He did that.</span> <span id="s1486">He did the .</span> <span id="s1487">He compiled very extensive studies on the works of some of the Catholic Church's early fathers.</span> <span id="s1488">Like Saint Irinae(ph) who was one of the early writers of the Catholic Church, in the Fourth Century, I believe.</span> <span id="s1489">Incidently, I received a call from a very erudite professor at one of the Eastern universities a few months ago saying, oh, I read in the bibliography for Saint Irinae that your uncle's work is the basic work for people who research Saint Irinae and I was very proud to hear that his name has appeared in this, I forget the name of the man, but I've got is someplace.</span> <span id="s1490">Doctor so and so is doing studies on Saint Irinae himself.</span> <span id="s1491">And he's basing his studies on Father Bruno's work.</span> <span id="s1492">He published one very extensive work in which he, a sort of a dictionary, if you want, in four languages, Latin, Greek, Coptic(ph) and Aramian(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Because Saint Irinae's writings were in various translations at that time already.</span> <span id="s1494">And so that whoever is doing studies on Saint Irinae can read them in either language.</span> <span id="s1495">And he published an extensive study on the writings themselves.</span> <span id="s1496">And then he had a continuous series of articles in one of the theological reviews in .</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: I'm just curious, this contrast between the man you're describing right now and this man of action who was so successful and so active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: He was, after the war, he was pastor of a small village for several years and enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s1499">His superior had released him from the abbey because he could see he just couldn't stay in the abbey any more.</span> <span id="s1500">He had done so much work outside that to be cloistered again would just kill him.</span> <span id="s1501">So he sent him as pastor at a small village in the south of Belgium.</span> <span id="s1502">I went there several times and enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s1503">He became totally enthralled by this pastoral ministry which he hadn't actually done before.</span> <span id="s1504">He became totally conquered by that.</span> <span id="s1505">The village people loved him a lot, too, and yet, he would close his door at a certain time and they knew better than to bother him unless if it's for an emergency.</span> <span id="s1506">And he would work on his intellectual endeavors.</span> <span id="s1507">So, he would spend two or three hours a day writing and researching Saint Irinae again.</span> <span id="s1508">And so he tried to always balance, you know.</span> <span id="s1509">Of course, during the war he did little intellectual work, but he did some.</span> <span id="s1510">And I still remember my grandmother transcribing some of his chicken scratch onto neat white paper.</span> <span id="s1511">She has a beautiful, had a beautiful handwriting.</span> <span id="s1512">And she transcribed many, many pages of his works.</span> <span id="s1513">So it would be legible for the publisher.</span> <span id="s1514">During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: As an individual, is religion important to you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: To me?</span> <span id="s1517">Well, we have remained practicing Catholics and our children are, too.</span> <span id="s1518">I perhaps don't have the as we say in France, the sacred fire, as much as Father Bruno had.</span> <span id="s1519">We try to remain, let's say reasonably close.</span> <span id="s1520">We go to church every Sunday and one of our very best friends is a Dutch priest who speaks, you know, a Dutch priest who is a, who speaks several languages and we became very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1521">And he's one of the totally adorable people.</span> <span id="s1522">A little bit like Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s1523">He has been teaching theology, languages and so on, and yet, he did all the garden work for the seminary at St. Thomas seminary.</span> <span id="s1524">Again, a man of both action and cerebral work, if you want.</span> <span id="s1525">So, yeah, we're, I would say it's important.</span> <span id="s1526">I won't claim and be dishonest and say that we are thinking about it every minute.</span> <span id="s1527">But, it is still important for us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Are there certain lessons that you gained from that religious practice or observance that impact the way you live, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: I should say so.</span> <span id="s1530">I should say the concern for other people, the concern for , as we say in French.</span> <span id="s1531">Our neighbor.</span> <span id="s1532">You know, the things that our grandmother taught us to be concerned about other people, to be practically practicing our religion.</span> <span id="s1533">Not just kneeling on the pew and babbling prayers that don't mean anything to us.</span> <span id="s1534">I probably don't remember the vast majority of prayers I learned by heart when I was young.</span> <span id="s1535">But, I don't think that's so important.</span> <span id="s1536">It's much more important to be nice to your neighbor, to do things to help, to be concerned about your neighbor.</span> <span id="s1537">I would like, if you don't mind, I would like to give you something that Father Bruno said when he was asked, why did you do that?</span> <span id="s1538">He said, the motives was a revolt against injustice and violence.</span> <span id="s1539">A consciousness of our common past.</span> <span id="s1540">Both historical and theological.</span> <span id="s1541">He was very conscious of that.</span> <span id="s1542">Personal fondness for encounters, quote, at the frontiers.</span> <span id="s1543">Because in the '40's it was still considered the frontiers, you know, Catholic priests didn't mingle so much with Jews.</span> <span id="s1544">He loved it.</span> <span id="s1545">Secondly, the goals.</span> <span id="s1546">To save human lives.</span> <span id="s1547">To reconstitute or preserve families.</span> <span id="s1548">To establish human contacts between Judaism and Christianity.</span> <span id="s1549">And the spirit is a spirit of respect of human life.</span> <span id="s1550">Respect of human dignity.</span> <span id="s1551">Expansion of mutual respect by reciprocal knowledge of values, culture and spiritual climate.</span> <span id="s1552">That was his answer.</span> <span id="s1553">He did not give very many interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Certainly not a four hour one.</span> <span id="s1555">But this is one that he expected to give, to a Jewish publication.</span> <span id="s1556">And I thought it resumed or it abstracted well what his ideas were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Through yourself.</span> <span id="s1558">These early experiences for you, when you grew up very fast, how do you think they influenced you later in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: I would say that it was a little bit on the back burner for maybe, oh, 20 years after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1560">Mostly because I didn't have time to do anything but study.</span> <span id="s1561">I was in high school and then in college and then in medical school.</span> <span id="s1562">I graduated in 1959.</span> <span id="s1563">We came here in a new environment.</span> <span id="s1564">In 1961.</span> <span id="s1565">I didn't have any books with me because I didn't know I was going to stay so long.</span> <span id="s1566">I read and spoke English, but I didn't know much about the libraries here, so I didn't have anything to go to to get more information.</span> <span id="s1567">Gradually, on the other hand, after I talked to my uncle a number of times, and I saw him again on my rare trips to Belgium, I, suddenly it came back and I said, I've got to do something about that.</span> <span id="s1568">And I became a fanatical history buff only about World War II and particularly the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1569">And I became so interested that I felt almost as Jewish as my Jewish friends at times.</span> <span id="s1570">We had a reunion in Washington D.C. about two years ago where a good dozen of rescued people met with me and we gave a series of lectures through the ADL and so on in Washington.</span> <span id="s1571">And at the end, when they asked me to say something about them, I said, I think I've got 12 new Jewish cousins.</span> <span id="s1572">And, yeah, it did change my mind on a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1573">I realized how close we could be and, you know, which I probably wouldn't have known as well if I hadn't gone into that intensive study of the events.</span> <span id="s1574">And then after I studied the Holocaust in general, then I dug into Father Bruno's records which were not all that abundant because he destroyed much of them after World War II.</span> <span id="s1575">But I was able to collect a good number of things and, of course, there were things I knew of personal knowledge.</span> <span id="s1576">I got information from my other uncles and aunts who had letters and had memories or, you know, in their minds.</span> <span id="s1577">And helped me and we all worked together on that.</span> <span id="s1578">And when he finally died, we decided we had to do something.</span> <span id="s1579">And then this nice young man, Mr. Johannes(ph) Bloom(ph), who was much to young to have known Father Bruno, was an Austrian Jew.</span> <span id="s1580">Came to Brussels and heard about him and said, we've got to do something to try to remember this person.</span> <span id="s1581">And then he got in touch with me, we wrote the biography, we got testimonies from a number of rescued people, many of whom are still alive in Israel.</span> <span id="s1582">One of his most favorite guys is still in a kibbutz there and his name is Svee(ph) Harlioff(ph).</span> <span id="s1583">And he was one of the most vocal and before, actually, we started working on that, Israel invited Father Bruno, as a guest, in 1964, in August, 1964, he was made Righteous of the Nations at the Advashem(ph).</span> <span id="s1584">And has a tree there in his name.</span> <span id="s1585">And he met a number of the kids who were no longer kids at that time, had children of their own, that he had rescued.</span> <span id="s1586">And for him, of course, it was a most emotional moment.</span> <span id="s1587">This is a picture of him that was taken in Israel and it's been the picture that everybody has shown of him.</span> <span id="s1588">It's a very good picture because it shows the twinkle in his eye and the half smile which was so typical of him.</span> <span id="s1589">And he enjoyed his stay there.</span> <span id="s1590">Then my second uncle, my younger uncle, the dentist, Jean(ph) , has recently also been made Righteous of the Nations and so he appreciated that very much.</span> <span id="s1591">He's 82 years old now, still alive and doing well.</span> <span id="s1592">So he was also honored by Israel for, actually, there were times when he had 25 kids in his house, and think of the risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Your family also helped save adults.</span> <span id="s1594">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Your family also saved some adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yeah, but not a great number.</span> <span id="s1597">And those were most of the time, done by Father Bruno himself.</span> <span id="s1598">Except for three that were in my house, in my own house, a Polish girl, a young Polish girl, an older woman from Eastern Europe...</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: You had mentioned those, I just, I think it's important for the record to state... A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1600">And a third woman, yeah.</span> <span id="s1601">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: But there were also adults who were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yeah, they came in succession.</span> <span id="s1604">Right.</span> <span id="s1605">That was at the very end of the war, actually.</span> <span id="s1606">I would say the second, well, 1944.</span> <span id="s1607">The first nine months of 1944.</span> <span id="s1608">And then, of course, the liberation took place and, in September, so, our last one ran out the door screaming happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span> <span id="s1610">I appreciate your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Well, I must say it's a great honor for me to be interviewed by the Museum.</span> <span id="s1612">I've visited the Museum and it was an extremely emotional experience.</span> <span id="s1613">My wife, who was with me, had the same experience.</span> <span id="s1614">It was, I don't know what the word is, but it was quite an experience to see that.</span> <span id="s1615">Things that I, for the most part, had at least some idea of.</span> <span id="s1616">Many things I knew rather well, but to actually see all of that in one place and be totally surrounded by that, ooh, it was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s1617">I think that's one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in my life.</span> <span id="s1618">It was really something I will not forget.</span> <span id="s1619">And I want to thank you for coming to Denver and you people who are filming and listening, I appreciate your cooperation and coping with my old house with very little power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: That's not important.</span> <span id="s1621">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1622">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
