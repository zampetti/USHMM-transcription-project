id="s14">It's called 'The Silent Voice'.</span> <span id="s15">It is dedicated to all those who's voices have been silenced forever in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945.</span> <span id="s16">I wrote this poem May 11, 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">When ages of civilization crumble to dust And death is raging supreme When the Devil is crowned by the power of deceit Then freedom is a far away dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">When all that you loved is taken from you And you are stripped to the bare bone When all moral boundaries and laws are broken Then you are in Hell with Satan alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">When Jews are depicted as sub-human, as vermin And brute force and evil prevail When Nazi doctors turn children to corpses Then all logic and reason fails.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">When the whole world remains dead silent With the exception of just a few Then they grant Satan license and opportunity To murder in the gas chambers a God-loving Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">When man and woman are kept apart And new life is not conceived When there is no sound of laughter or song How can God by man be perceived?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">When mass murder of the Jews becomes legal Under the banner of an ideology or God's sacred name Then its not the victims but the nazi murderers who did not resist Satan and defile God's name.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">When living skeletons are marching at gunpoint Through the gate of Auschwitz in long columns of five, cold, starved, forced to hard labor What power on earth gave them the strength to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">When all heads are shaved, all human rights denied And all wear the same kind of __________ striped dress When to worship God becomes a crime Then the whole world is in a very terrible mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">When Hitler's dreams become a reality And the nazi's send Jews to the left and to the right Then such men are not ruled by God's divine power But by their own burning ambition for power and might.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">When the so-called superior Arian nazi race used all their knowledge, technology and skill To murder 6 million Jews merely for being born Jewish That I don't believe was God, but Hitler's demonic will.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">That explains a lot to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begin by having you tell me your name, date of birth and where you were born, and a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s29">And you might tell me your name now and your name at birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz.</span> <span id="s31">I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in Poland.</span> <span id="s32">And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph).</span> <span id="s33">My family __________ use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I like to be called.</span> <span id="s34">I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating _________.</span> <span id="s35">I was the oldest of three siblings.</span> <span id="s36">I was born in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s37">At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000.</span> <span id="s38">A little less than half of that was Jewish.</span> <span id="s39">My family consisted at that time of my parents, ___________ Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, _____________ ____________.</span> <span id="s40">My ancestors on my mother's side came to Poland from Germany around the 16th century.</span> <span id="s41">Four generations were still alive and each one had a lot of children because they came from an orthodox background.</span> <span id="s42">So my grandmother was one of seven siblings.</span> <span id="s43">My mother was one of seven siblings.</span> <span id="s44">My Aunt who lived also in Chair-han-off (ph) had also seven children.</span> <span id="s45">My other Uncle had three children.</span> <span id="s46">They all had, the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children.</span> <span id="s47">So we had a very large family.</span> <span id="s48">I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and my first role models.</span> <span id="s49">I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an extremely religious woman, observant woman, at home we only spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s50">We observed the Jewish laws, customs and traditions.</span> <span id="s51">And my grandmother was wearing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish its called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes.</span> <span id="s52">For my grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she behaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us.</span> <span id="s53">And I remember that every morning when I would get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with me the prayers.</span> <span id="s54">She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity box, and she would tell me, "Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah (ph), our commandment."</span> <span id="s55">I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one coin from another, and a poor man came to our door and asked my grandmother for alms.</span> <span id="s56">And my grandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my hand and I said, "Grandma, so much money?"</span> <span id="s57">And my grandmother said, "My child, you only have what you give away."</span> <span id="s58">I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it, being so little, how can you give away something and still have it?</span> <span id="s59">So my grandma began with a smile and says, "Yit-cola (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me.</span> <span id="s60">I'm not giving mine."</span> <span id="s61">This is how she felt.</span> <span id="s62">And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories.</span> <span id="s63">I came from a family of story-tellers.</span> <span id="s64">And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much so, and my grandmother had lots of children.</span> <span id="s65">In fact, when Germany invaded Poland, my grandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild.</span> <span id="s66">Only one granddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph).</span> <span id="s67">I was eight years old when she emigrated to Palestine in 1934, to get married with somebody who was, without her boyfriend, that she met also in Poland, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same city, the same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him.</span> <span id="s68">And I remember that the whole family was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, "God knows if we will see each other again."</span> <span id="s69">And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), ______ _______ ________, don't cry.</span> <span id="s70">With God all things are possible."</span> <span id="s71">I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One.</span> <span id="s72">She lost a brother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter.</span> <span id="s73">But she never lost her unshakable faith in God.</span> <span id="s74">And she always believed and she never questioned.</span> <span id="s75">And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me.</span> <span id="s76">And she lived with us from the day I was born.</span> <span id="s77">And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly after Germany invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s78">From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of _________ ________, which in English means humanness.</span> <span id="s79">Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of ________ ________, they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they would say, "Yit-cola (ph), its not ______ _______."</span> <span id="s80">I use to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that yardstick.</span> <span id="s81">You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?</span> <span id="s82">But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me.</span> <span id="s83">And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift.</span> <span id="s84">But they were strict with me.</span> <span id="s85">When I was already a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like _________ you know and the kids didn't like it.</span> <span id="s86">So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too.</span> <span id="s87">So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks?</span> <span id="s88">And they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too cold".</span> <span id="s89">And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, __________________, so what did I do?</span> <span id="s90">I went in and I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to school.</span> <span id="s91">My father often used to come to the school yard because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the dairy business, like wholesale dairy business, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether they, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing.</span> <span id="s92">So he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come home, or before he left, if I wasn't home, the school wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something, just to see me.</span> <span id="s93">So that particular morning, I went to school and it was recess and some of the kids started to say, "Yit-cola (ph), your father is here."</span> <span id="s94">And I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s95">I was wearing the knee socks.</span> <span id="s96">And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he said, "Yit-cola (ph), I feel very __________ and disappointed in you.</span> <span id="s97">Because everybody can make a mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not ____________ and I'm very disappointed."</span> <span id="s98">And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me up and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, "Yit-cola (ph), everybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same.</span> <span id="s99">And in everything there is a lesson.</span> <span id="s100">So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping other people."</span> <span id="s101">The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came in, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you know how justice is important.</span> <span id="s102">I remember one time I was walking home from school alone and a bunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and physically.</span> <span id="s103">I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punches coming all over.</span> <span id="s104">And I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter with an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s105">And I couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s106">Why are they so angry with me?</span> <span id="s107">Why do they hate me so much?</span> <span id="s108">I was too young to understand it and I came home crying bitterly.</span> <span id="s109">Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was home.</span> <span id="s110">And she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?"</span> <span id="s111">You'll see later why those things are important, because of the values.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So your mother asked you what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: What happened.</span> <span id="s114">I related to her the whole story.</span> <span id="s115">And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me.</span> <span id="s116">After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?"</span> <span id="s117">And I was shocked.</span> <span id="s118">I said, "Nothing."</span> <span id="s119">And my mother looked ___________________, she said, "Well my child, then you have nothing to cry about.</span> <span id="s120">Your ______ _______ does not depend on how others treat you but on how you treat others."</span> <span id="s121">And I remember my family taught me that my _______ _______ does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date.</span> <span id="s122">Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame or held others because its not _________ __________.</span> <span id="s123">But they never taught me, what should I do when I am held, how should I respond?</span> <span id="s124">So what I used to do, I use to cry.</span> <span id="s125">Because I knew I cannot held anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my spirit as long as I don't do something evil.</span> <span id="s126">As long as I don't do something wrong.</span> <span id="s127">So they actually very much stressed __________ ________, Yiddish _______, ________ __________.</span> <span id="s128">I received both, like I said at home we spoke Yiddish but in school we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to Bant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s129">My little brother actually started at age three.</span> <span id="s130">My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox.</span> <span id="s131">But in those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we had ____________ in our home, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and traditions.</span> <span id="s132">Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a shaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person.</span> <span id="s133">She had a beautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s134">Because before my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the Yiddish Theater.</span> <span id="s135">And at that time, the Yiddish Theater used to be the ________ ________, like a regular theater but they had that in the fire house, you know?</span> <span id="s136">Where the firemen lived, so they would allow them there.</span> <span id="s137">But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for charity.</span> <span id="s138">So my parents very often used to take me to the theater and my mother belonged to a literary group.</span> <span id="s139">She was more, she was very artistic.</span> <span id="s140">If she would have had the opportunity then she would have done much more, but unfortunately.</span> <span id="s141">And I think that she instilled in me a love for literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of grandchildren and children.</span> <span id="s142">Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in 1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I never knew him.</span> <span id="s143">I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from England, London.</span> <span id="s144">Because that's where he married and he lived.</span> <span id="s145">So the whole family lived in Poland and we used to be a very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s146">So we got together and because there was not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used to, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know?</span> <span id="s147">And everybody thought that I don't even pay attention and I was just sitting in a corner and listen and take in all these stories.</span> <span id="s148">Another time also that I heard a lot of stories is that in Poland, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was only one Synagogue.</span> <span id="s149">But there was the ___________, like they call it, like the study house and a lot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other cities so they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring home, in the Hebrew its called ____________, or guests.</span> <span id="s150">And then there would be conversation at the table and they used to ask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories.</span> <span id="s151">So it was, and one thing also, that after my mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother home, which was a great influence.</span> <span id="s152">I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me, is that we didn't have running water or electricity in our home.</span> <span id="s153">And winter, to heat the house, we cooked on an iron stove, and to heat the house it used to be a tile oven, which reached from the floor, most people in Poland had those, and they used to, they were able to open wells, you put the wood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this would be the source of heat, that heated the house.</span> <span id="s154">So when they came on the holidays and ___________, they would sit around the oven and tell these stories.</span> <span id="s155">And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life.</span> <span id="s156">And I was always, when I started to go to school, one of my worst subjects was history.</span> <span id="s157">Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates, long ago, and a lot of places.</span> <span id="s158">But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea before the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects people.</span> <span id="s159">And I was a creative child.</span> <span id="s160">I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing this.</span> <span id="s161">And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished public school, that I going to continue to have more formal education, that I'm going to become a writer.</span> <span id="s162">Even as a young girl I used to write a lot.</span> <span id="s163">And I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father used to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, "Yit-cola (ph), recite a poem."</span> <span id="s164">And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems and I learned lots of songs, both at home.</span> <span id="s165">And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny, that there used to people who would go in the courtyard and sing and play instruments and some had wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money.</span> <span id="s166">So I remember once I was going home, it was on a Friday, I was going home from school.</span> <span id="s167">And those people played in our yard and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song.</span> <span id="s168">I caught most of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in the same courtyard so I followed them.</span> <span id="s169">And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its Friday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly.</span> <span id="s170">And I remember I came home, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot (ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), quickly.</span> <span id="s171">Go in and wash up.</span> <span id="s172">Come to sha-bot (ph)."</span> <span id="s173">And I was so grateful that she didn't scream at me or anything.</span> <span id="s174">And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned before, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every year, we observed Passover.</span> <span id="s175">And it was so different than it is now because every single object of the house was taken out in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s176">Dishes were changed.</span> <span id="s177">And at that time, I remember, we didn't have regular mattresses like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put in the, they changed the straw.</span> <span id="s178">And paint the house and wash every object.</span> <span id="s179">It was more for cleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual cleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it is very, it is coincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the liberation.</span> <span id="s180">And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the _________, and we're talking about slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't understand this here.</span> <span id="s181">Because up until then, I was never starved.</span> <span id="s182">I never had any personal tragedy.</span> <span id="s183">My faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a _______, and I couldn't understand all those things.</span> <span id="s184">And I remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we suffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same way.</span> <span id="s185">They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible illness then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here.</span> <span id="s186">So, in my, it never entered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here.</span> <span id="s187">That my people will suffer like this here.</span> <span id="s188">And I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Let me just ask here, you didn't have these but that was normal?</span> <span id="s190">You were fairly middle income?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty.</span> <span id="s192">This was because in the small __________, nobody in the small __________ had it at that time.</span> <span id="s193">So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland, they still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know?</span> <span id="s194">But its so much more modern, its more ____________ in the larger city.</span> <span id="s195">But at that time it was common, you didn't know anything different because I remember, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s196">When my family took me I came home and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a toilet and you pulled the string from the ceiling and I said, "It was like a miracle to me."</span> <span id="s197">So it was because this was, I'm describing the world the way I knew it and this all influenced, you know?</span> <span id="s198">Because when there was not water in the house, so we had a water carrier who would bring in water.</span> <span id="s199">We didn't have like today ready-made foods and, or you could go into the kosher butcher like today and buy a chicken.</span> <span id="s200">At that time we used to go to the market which was the market place was the place where Jews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring livestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they would bring vegetable and fruits.</span> <span id="s201">The Jewish people would bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes.</span> <span id="s202">So that was the exchange because that was the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s203">And so those things were, the life was different and it influenced differently also.</span> <span id="s204">But going back now to the not having electricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, from a nuft (ph) its called in Polish, petroleum, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Kerosene?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Kerosene, yes, I forgot the word, kerosene.</span> <span id="s207">So we had a kerosene lamp.</span> <span id="s208">And still we would always sit and read and it was very, education was extremely important.</span> <span id="s209">And so I remember that we didn't have a refrigerator.</span> <span id="s210">We didn't have all the modern appliances because at that time nobody had them in our ___________.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">[end of side 1 of tape 1] So of course we didn't have any, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have any refrigerator.</span> <span id="s212">And we used to store food in the root cellar.</span> <span id="s213">We called it root because, besides holding the perishable food we would put in there for the winter, sometimes my father would go to the country and buy like a whole sack of potatoes, carrots, onions, for the winter.</span> <span id="s214">And we also would keep there in the winter the perishable food, you know, when we cooked something.</span> <span id="s215">Sometimes when it was very cold, I remember my mother used to put it on the window sill, outside on the window sill, but mostly in the root cellar.</span> <span id="s216">So one time, in the root cellar it was dark.</span> <span id="s217">You had to, you opened, there was a square in the kitchen floor with a ring, you pulled up the ring and there was a long ladder.</span> <span id="s218">It wasn't built in, it was put in, and you had to walk this, this ladder down, it was dark.</span> <span id="s219">A dirt floor.</span> <span id="s220">No windows.</span> <span id="s221">Cold.</span> <span id="s222">It smelled wonderful with all the different kinds of vegetable things.</span> <span id="s223">But it was dark and I was, as I mentioned before, I was only 13 when the war broke out and this was earlier, so I was afraid to go down.</span> <span id="s224">And my mother noticed that I am afraid.</span> <span id="s225">She said, "Lit a candle."</span> <span id="s226">She gave me the candle to my hand, and she tell me, she waved to me, for me, and she said, "Go Yit-cola (ph), go.</span> <span id="s227">God is in the root cellar too."</span> <span id="s228">And I loved her, I trusted her, and I knew.</span> <span id="s229">I understood that if there would be danger for me she wouldn't send me because she was very protective of me.</span> <span id="s230">In fact, I was never away one single day in my, until the Nazis came in, alone.</span> <span id="s231">I was always with the family.</span> <span id="s232">So I walked down and I brought up the butter.</span> <span id="s233">And afterwards I wasn't so afraid anymore of the dark root cellar.</span> <span id="s234">For two reasons.</span> <span id="s235">First of all, because I remembered my mother's words, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), God is in the root cellar."</span> <span id="s236">And secondly, for myself I thought, if I could do it once I can do it again.</span> <span id="s237">And so at home it was warm, it was a wonderful world.</span> <span id="s238">My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of food without saying __________, which means a special prayer.</span> <span id="s239">And always stressed the importance.</span> <span id="s240">Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was __________.</span> <span id="s241">And another thing which I do really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added.</span> <span id="s242">She never took me for granted.</span> <span id="s243">She would many times over say, "Oh my __________, God Bless you and thank you", and she would make me feel so good.</span> <span id="s244">And one time I said, "Grandma, its just a little thing."</span> <span id="s245">I didn't call her grandma, I called her ___________, ___________ for grandmother.</span> <span id="s246">And I said, "It's just a little thing."</span> <span id="s247">And my grandmother would smile and she would say, she always, when I asked her something she had such a beautiful, warm smile, she said, "Yes my child.</span> <span id="s248">But kindness and caring are not little things."</span> <span id="s249">And the reason why the _________ is later I found out how much those values helped to shape me.</span> <span id="s250">And also of course there was the influence from friends.</span> <span id="s251">In fact, I used to have one friend because where we lived, we lived at two addresses.</span> <span id="s252">I was born in one house and then we moved.</span> <span id="s253">And the first house, the entrance was from the back and I remember like today, there was a huge field and I used to play there.</span> <span id="s254">And one of my girlfriends was a Polish little girl, her name was Helenka (ph).</span> <span id="s255">I cannot remember any longer the last name, but we used to play a lot together.</span> <span id="s256">And I remember that she used to come like in the morning when it snowed, winters were cold, so I don't know how its called in English but I would go out and lay down on the snow and make a…</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: An angel?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: An angel, you know?</span> <span id="s259">And with Helenka (ph) we would, you know?</span> <span id="s260">And then I remember like today, I was always very happy child and I was playing.</span> <span id="s261">And I remember when I was little and I went to the field and I felt such a sense of __________, so I would flop my hands like a feldas (ph) and pretend that I'm a bird and fly.</span> <span id="s262">And later, it never entered my mind that one day all this going to be gone.</span> <span id="s263">That I will not have this anymore.</span> <span id="s264">And then, everything all of a sudden changed when the Nazis came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You mentioned this Polish girl.</span> <span id="s266">Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: We, there were not too many, not too many.</span> <span id="s268">We had some non-Jewish, and we had a good relationship to them.</span> <span id="s269">Actually, I personally, the only serious incident of anti-Semitism was when I was walking home.</span> <span id="s270">And another thing which also, but that was not, it was verbal, it was not attacked.</span> <span id="s271">I once heard a non-Jewish child saying to me, "The houses are yours but the streets are ours."</span> <span id="s272">And at that time it didn't reflect, but I could, also when I was thinking about it I said, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s273">My family lives here already for, my ancestors came here in the 1600's.</span> <span id="s274">We are citizens.</span> <span id="s275">We do everything.</span> <span id="s276">And yet, we're not looked as equals?"</span> <span id="s277">You know, you sense a little bit.</span> <span id="s278">But I personally didn't sense it so much.</span> <span id="s279">I knew more about it from going to Hebrew school, knowing about the poems from my grandmother and my parents, use to tell how it was.</span> <span id="s280">I also knew good things also about some neighbors, but we had pretty decent relationships.</span> <span id="s281">It wasn't at that time, but that was after like, after Pew-suit-ski (ph), Mal-shall-vic Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, things started to change.</span> <span id="s282">And you know, we were not treated, we were treated like second-class citizens in many ways because when we wanted to go to higher studies, it started like a few years before the Holocaust, you couldn't go, Jewish people couldn't go to the university, we were not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: What year are you talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: What year?</span> <span id="s285">I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't remember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better.</span> <span id="s286">Though the government officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of things I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from history.</span> <span id="s287">That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did you know about, or did your family talk about, what was happening in Germany prior to 1939?</span> <span id="s289">Did you know who Hitler was?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: At the time?</span> <span id="s291">No.</span> <span id="s292">I didn't know much of politics, yes.</span> <span id="s293">I was like I said a creative child.</span> <span id="s294">I was more interested in writing and in playing with the kids and doing art work and singing, I loved to sing since I was a child.</span> <span id="s295">And my mother taught me, not just my mother but both my parents because they used to take me to the theater, many songs and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So your family didn't talk about what was happening in neighboring Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Maybe they talked but I don't remember this in particular.</span> <span id="s298">That didn't, you know, like I said, I was only 13 years old when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s299">And another thing when I was a child, here a 13 year old child knows a lot about her body, knows, you know?</span> <span id="s300">Because I wasn't brought up in the environment and my grandmother was so orthodox, so it was more modest and you didn't know much about sex, you know?</span> <span id="s301">And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time.</span> <span id="s302">And I remember that in our city there was a girl, her name was Rosa Loberta (ph) and she was a leader from __________ ___________.</span> <span id="s303">And because some of my friends who were somewhat older along there, to tell you the truth, I knew it’s a Zionistic organization.</span> <span id="s304">I didn't understand yet exactly the, I didn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you.</span> <span id="s305">So I wanted to belong too.</span> <span id="s306">And in Poland everybody belongs to orthodox, to some different organizations, but practically everybody belonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to ___________ ___________.</span> <span id="s307">And I remember she took me to one meeting and Rosa Loberta (ph) was there and I met her and I said to her, "Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting."</span> <span id="s308">And this was about a year before the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s309">And she said, "Yit-cola (ph), you have to wait _______________ because it starts from ______________."</span> <span id="s310">And when ___________ came I no longer could do it.</span> <span id="s311">And later, I don't know if you know about Rosa Loberta (ph), she was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did she impress you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s314">She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader.</span> <span id="s315">Very, very much for Israel.</span> <span id="s316">She was very much involved in Zionist and she was hoping that, very much involved.</span> <span id="s317">You know, the older children, because I was _________ and I think because of my grandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all other influence from my parents who took me to the theaters, who took me to Jewish plays and every summer we would go to the country and ____________, cousins, from Warsaw, because I had cousins there, I had ___________ cousins, the _______________, so we would get together.</span> <span id="s318">And I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very affectionate, she was very warm.</span> <span id="s319">And I remember, I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also made a great influence, that she instilled in me a love for literature and for singing and everything.</span> <span id="s320">Is that when we lived in Poland, we didn't have closets like we have now.</span> <span id="s321">We had what they called a French amour' (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the floor to the ceiling and it had two doors.</span> <span id="s322">Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was used for the wardrobe, and the left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandmother's and my mother's, hats lying there.</span> <span id="s323">And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was always locked, this side of the wardrobe.</span> <span id="s324">And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I used to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest.</span> <span id="s325">And I used to think, maybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers.</span> <span id="s326">It was a whole source of curiosity for me.</span> <span id="s327">And I remember one day my mother said, "Yit-cola (ph), please come.</span> <span id="s328">Come here.</span> <span id="s329">I want to show you something."</span> <span id="s330">She took out the key and she opened the chest.</span> <span id="s331">And I had like two kinds of emotions.</span> <span id="s332">In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest that was constantly closed.</span> <span id="s333">And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?</span> <span id="s334">What is there?</span> <span id="s335">And she opened the chest and she said, "Look Yit-cola (ph)."</span> <span id="s336">And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books.</span> <span id="s337">And she took out a book, pointed to the closet, she said, "Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds.</span> <span id="s338">You can sit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world."</span> <span id="s339">And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read.</span> <span id="s340">And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward.</span> <span id="s341">And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff.</span> <span id="s342">And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by _______________ ______________, a Yiddish writer, it was called _____________ _____________, Bunchos (ph) of the Silent.</span> <span id="s343">I remember many stories, but this story I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s344">And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos (ph), ___________ ___________ which means silent.</span> <span id="s345">And this man, when he was a little child, lost his mother and became an orphan, only had his father.</span> <span id="s346">At the age of 13, the father remarried and took a very cruel woman who abused the little boy.</span> <span id="s347">She would eat well but she would starve him.</span> <span id="s348">She made him chop wood barefoot in the winter.</span> <span id="s349">He never had a new change of clothes.</span> <span id="s350">They didn't send him to school.</span> <span id="s351">Didn't have a friend.</span> <span id="s352">But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely, but he never complained, not even to his father.</span> <span id="s353">And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a drunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair.</span> <span id="s354">He picked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place.</span> <span id="s355">He wandered into a big city and for no reason known to him he was put in jail.</span> <span id="s356">And then he was, for the same unknown reason to him, he was let go.</span> <span id="s357">But he was still silent.</span> <span id="s358">Never complained.</span> <span id="s359">Then the story relates how he suffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then people wouldn't pay him.</span> <span id="s360">He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent.</span> <span id="s361">And then he married a woman who already had a child.</span> <span id="s362">And it was a little boy, a baby.</span> <span id="s363">And she left him with the child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the house.</span> <span id="s364">But Buncho (ph) was again silent.</span> <span id="s365">And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story.</span> <span id="s366">It kept me so in suspense.</span> <span id="s367">I remember it today.</span> <span id="s368">Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read well, I read many of the books which my mother had in that chest.</span> <span id="s369">And the reason why she kept it locked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her books.</span> <span id="s370">Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it.</span> <span id="s371">But its just the values that she had.</span> <span id="s372">So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s373">And even in the hospital where people are allowed to complain, he was still silent.</span> <span id="s374">And in silence he lived and in silence he died.</span> <span id="s375">And after he was buried they put a piece of wood and a marker on his grave and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife found it and used it to light the, to heat the stove.</span> <span id="s376">So he didn't even have a grave or anything.</span> <span id="s377">And then, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice.</span> <span id="s378">And when he came up, they told him, "Buncho (ph), here in heaven everything is yours.</span> <span id="s379">Whatever you want.</span> <span id="s380">Pick, choose."</span> <span id="s381">And he couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s382">Why would somebody be so good to him in the other world where they were so cruel to him here?</span> <span id="s383">And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain.</span> <span id="s384">Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more.</span> <span id="s385">So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?"</span> <span id="s386">And he couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s387">And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter."</span> <span id="s388">And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent.</span> <span id="s389">He had no choice.</span> <span id="s390">And also, what would we give for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s391">So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic.</span> <span id="s392">This book is in English still and its beautiful.</span> <span id="s393">I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty.</span> <span id="s394">And when he says here that they look, why was he silent?</span> <span id="s395">He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out.</span> <span id="s396">But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span> <span id="s397">When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other house already.</span> <span id="s398">And our house was strict _____________, which was near Warsaw Street, which was the main street.</span> <span id="s399">And as soon as we came out, this was almost in the corner, was a large house and they had a cellar, they had like big cellars.</span> <span id="s400">So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding.</span> <span id="s401">And even there, sitting there, my mother tried to calm us down with telling us stories.</span> <span id="s402">She was such a wonderful story-teller and she knew so much literature and so many plays.</span> <span id="s403">And then, when they just came in, we were still allowed to move from place to place, so people started to run.</span> <span id="s404">People from Warsaw came to small towns.</span> <span id="s405">Other people came to different places.</span> <span id="s406">And my father's entire family, his sisters, three sisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and my father was born in Pull-tos (ph), Poland.</span> <span id="s407">So they still lived with the children and, I think, their nieces and nephews, they lived in Pull-tos (ph).</span> <span id="s408">And we didn't know what's happened to them because, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conversation between my parents, he said, "Let's go to Pull-tos (ph).</span> <span id="s409">My sisters are gone."</span> <span id="s410">Because both parents, like, I never knew my grandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of them.</span> <span id="s411">But we didn't know, we didn't go.</span> <span id="s412">And then, when they took Warsaw, we could no longer go from place to place.</span> <span id="s413">That's when the Nazis begun their systematic destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Did the Germans come into your town?</span> <span id="s415">Were there bombings?</span> <span id="s416">Did the soldiers actually come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The soldiers came in.</span> <span id="s418">There was bombing.</span> <span id="s419">And, I just told you, we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s420">And then when the bombing stopped, I'll tell you what my grandmother did.</span> <span id="s421">It's almost ironic.</span> <span id="s422">My grandmother lived through World War One, so she remembered a different kind of Germany.</span> <span id="s423">Because she remembered a Germany not at war against civilian people, women and children especially targets, and Jewish people.</span> <span id="s424">So she baked a cake and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), take it out to the poor soldiers that are away from home."</span> <span id="s425">She was a very compassionate woman.</span> <span id="s426">She had nothing to do with political _________, and she asked me to bring it out.</span> <span id="s427">So later when they, I think it was towards the end of, they came in October, I mean September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s428">At that time was about 3,300,000 Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s429">Ninety-percent have perished.</span> <span id="s430">And most of those, the ten percent who survived, mostly survived in the USSR Because there were no ghettos.</span> <span id="s431">There was no concentration, no gas chambers, you know, concentration camps with gas chambers.</span> <span id="s432">They also have suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Okay, tell me your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: So, anyhow.</span> <span id="s435">When the Nazis came in to the other cities, that was the last time that I saw my relatives.</span> <span id="s436">All the other relatives that lived in the other towns because we could no longer travel from place to place.</span> <span id="s437">They started by taking up the spiritual and the community leaders, the intelligencia (ph).</span> <span id="s438">Some Polish people too.</span> <span id="s439">And they took them away some, they shot, the ones they took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw.</span> <span id="s440">And they started to destroy the Synagogues, the Holy Scriptures.</span> <span id="s441">They confiscated all our businesses.</span> <span id="s442">We didn't have, in Check-hon-off (ph) a business.</span> <span id="s443">My father was, like I said, I told you before.</span> <span id="s444">And they started to put on curfews.</span> <span id="s445">We were not allowed to congregate in large groups.</span> <span id="s446">I could no longer, we could no longer go to school, all schools were closed.</span> <span id="s447">All social Temples were closed.</span> <span id="s448">We had to wear a yellow star.</span> <span id="s449">We were not allowed to walk on the pavement, just in the street.</span> <span id="s450">And we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened.</span> <span id="s451">Everyday they made new laws.</span> <span id="s452">And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws because they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: How soon did this happen after they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books.</span> <span id="s455">I told you, my mother valued so much book and its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was from the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the Synagogue, in the Synagogue, they burned down everything.</span> <span id="s456">So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not allowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ___________, which is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers.</span> <span id="s457">So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most.</span> <span id="s458">They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did.</span> <span id="s459">So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard.</span> <span id="s460">They started to torture, to mock.</span> <span id="s461">Because to, they did whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s462">They had all legal rights to do those things.</span> <span id="s463">And then they confiscated the business, they looted the merchandise.</span> <span id="s464">They started to ration the food and started starvation.</span> <span id="s465">And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the street.</span> <span id="s466">And after a whole day's work, they would come home and would have to stay in long lines to get a small ration, a very small ration.</span> <span id="s467">So right away we started to starve.</span> <span id="s468">Couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s469">And in other __________ country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up.</span> <span id="s470">But you couldn't.</span> <span id="s471">So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span> <span id="s472">That we had to be silent, you know, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s473">And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother.</span> <span id="s474">They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor.</span> <span id="s475">So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was ____________ because they singled us out as an inferior race.</span> <span id="s476">And we were not allowed to have any transactions, not business, not social, not sexual, because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would happen, it would be punished.</span> <span id="s477">And we had a big _________ and one time a man, a civilian, until this day I don't know his name, but I remember the incident very clearly because I was also involved in it.</span> <span id="s478">A man came in and he was selling household articles.</span> <span id="s479">Since people, most people gave up the money because they didn't want to risk, if they are caught for whatever you did against the law, it was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s480">And even without any reason they shot and they killed and they tortured.</span> <span id="s481">But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked.</span> <span id="s482">And one man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph).</span> <span id="s483">He was the owner of the building where I went to school.</span> <span id="s484">And he walked by too and he came in.</span> <span id="s485">And my mother all of a sudden realized that if somebody is going to see us standing and having any business transaction with somebody who is not Jewish, and we didn't know whether he was Polish or whether he was German, because there was a lot of __________ __________, that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live in Poland.</span> <span id="s486">So she said, she was afraid, so she said, "Please come into my house."</span> <span id="s487">She invited everybody.</span> <span id="s488">And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money.</span> <span id="s489">So he bought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise.</span> <span id="s490">My mother didn't buy anything.</span> <span id="s491">We gave up the merchandise, you know?</span> <span id="s492">Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the ghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or whatever.</span> <span id="s493">But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who was selling the merchandise.</span> <span id="s494">But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our house and denounced my mother.</span> <span id="s495">And they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us."</span> <span id="s496">And that is the first time in my life that I heard my mother lie.</span> <span id="s497">She said she didn't know.</span> <span id="s498">But she did know who he was.</span> <span id="s499">He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to school there.</span> <span id="s500">So after . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s501">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother.</span> <span id="s504">They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was.</span> <span id="s505">And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying.</span> <span id="s506">That she said she didn't know, she denied it.</span> <span id="s507">So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything.</span> <span id="s508">They took her away.</span> <span id="s509">The Gestapo took her away.</span> <span id="s510">I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured.</span> <span id="s511">So I was afraid to be separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s512">So I run after her.</span> <span id="s513">And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone.</span> <span id="s514">So they kept on chasing me away.</span> <span id="s515">And finally, one of them said, "Take her too."</span> <span id="s516">And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her.</span> <span id="s517">And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us.</span> <span id="s518">They took my mother in to a separate room.</span> <span id="s519">This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness.</span> <span id="s520">And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming.</span> <span id="s521">The shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent.</span> <span id="s522">That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive.</span> <span id="s523">But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious.</span> <span id="s524">And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open.</span> <span id="s525">Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, dragging her across the floor.</span> <span id="s526">And took me in, to be next.</span> <span id="s527">And I wanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she is still alive.</span> <span id="s528">So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place.</span> <span id="s529">And she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything.</span> <span id="s530">And I loved my mother because she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was.</span> <span id="s531">So I was, when they started to ask me questions I said, "I don't know it."</span> <span id="s532">I lied too.</span> <span id="s533">Deliberately.</span> <span id="s534">And they started to beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s535">And after I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin-nook (ph)".</span> <span id="s536">Enough.</span> <span id="s537">_______ _________ _________ _________, which means maybe we don’t know.</span> <span id="s538">Maybe _______ we don't know.</span> <span id="s539">And that's when they released us.</span> <span id="s540">This story begun in 1939, shortly after Germany invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s541">I didn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph).</span> <span id="s542">I didn't know what's happened to him.</span> <span id="s543">At that time, the Nazis used all kinds of techniques.</span> <span id="s544">They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s545">We, in Judaism, in home and in Hebrew school, they taught us that we are all responsible for one another.</span> <span id="s546">What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all.</span> <span id="s547">Group punishment for individual action.</span> <span id="s548">So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force and we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it.</span> <span id="s549">So I didn't know what's happened to the Cal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they would have killed the whole family, not just the father.</span> <span id="s550">And I'm going to stop here because I don't want to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me.</span> <span id="s551">And I'm going to skip and come back later to 1939.</span> <span id="s552">I'm going now to 1981 when I went to the world gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people before I left that they wanted me to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a documentary.</span> <span id="s555">And I told them that story.</span> <span id="s556">Anyhow, when we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us got a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygmuntowicz USA.</span> <span id="s557">That was all.</span> <span id="s558">And as I was standing, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know?</span> <span id="s559">And Menachem Bacon was the President there.</span> <span id="s560">And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the gates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and after so many, more than 2,000 years, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland, then people cannot tell you, "The houses are yours but the streets are ours."</span> <span id="s561">And I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s562">And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew, but they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask questions.</span> <span id="s563">And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself, "Can I have a marker or a pen?"</span> <span id="s564">And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph), Poland and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s565">I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not recognize me.</span> <span id="s566">I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult.</span> <span id="s567">My name has changed.</span> <span id="s568">Who will know me?</span> <span id="s569">And as I stand there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania (ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon.</span> <span id="s570">And he looked at my badge, he said, "You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?"</span> <span id="s571">And I said, "Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph)."</span> <span id="s572">And with him walked another man and he said, "I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too."</span> <span id="s573">And I said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s574">And he said, "Cal-hus (ph)."</span> <span id="s575">And I went berserk.</span> <span id="s576">I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited and he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, "Ask him for the address."</span> <span id="s577">So I asked him for the address and before he gave __________ I said, "Are you the son or the father?"</span> <span id="s578">Because he looked too young to be the father.</span> <span id="s579">He said, "I'm Cal-hus's (ph) son."</span> <span id="s580">And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-alia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to Israel, and he married an Israeli-Jewish ________.</span> <span id="s581">And we went there to interview him too.</span> <span id="s582">And I found out his father, unfortunately, died in Auschwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s583">But he and another brother survived.</span> <span id="s584">And both are married and have children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s585">And that's when I was understood, my grandmother's saying, that you only have what you give away.</span> <span id="s586">And that you don’t have to be rich or famous and you can give away ______, good deed and your _______ ________, and three generations.</span> <span id="s587">When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice.</span> <span id="s588">And that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother.</span> <span id="s589">And I learned what ________ _________ is.</span> <span id="s590">What to do with humanness.</span> <span id="s591">And now you understand why I was sharing with you the lessons, what my mother said.</span> <span id="s592">________ _________ doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to 1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know.</span> <span id="s593">Actually, Cal-fus (ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion.</span> <span id="s594">They took him and made him a part of the, you know, the interview.</span> <span id="s595">Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939.</span> <span id="s596">After they took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions.</span> <span id="s597">In the meantime, my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s598">That was before we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s599">My grandmother was no longer alive.</span> <span id="s600">And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close relationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s601">And she had such a great influence in this, I was heartbroken.</span> <span id="s602">But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to go to what we went through and she died in her own bed and she was buried in Chair-hon-off (ph) and is there still.</span> <span id="s603">That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: I wanted to ask, in this period where the Synagogue was burned, you weren't allowed to go to school, there were all kinds of restrictions.</span> <span id="s605">Did you pray at home?</span> <span id="s606">Did you try to continue to . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s608">I still said every, in fact, even today, so many years, I still have the _________________, it's like in-bred in me.</span> <span id="s609">Because I said it every morning when I was a child.</span> <span id="s610">And then, it just . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Were you able to try to observe holidays and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: We couldn't observe holidays anymore because, first of all, Jews were not allowed often to pray or to go among the Synagogues.</span> <span id="s613">We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food.</span> <span id="s614">We lived in constant fear.</span> <span id="s615">And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, the religious people suffered more because they couldn't often _____________ and there was starvation.</span> <span id="s616">When you, we tried as much as we could.</span> <span id="s617">I still knew what day it is and we tried as much as we could to keep the sha-but (ph), but that was when we were still living in Chair-hon-off (ph).</span> <span id="s618">And I actually didn't say good-bye to any of my relatives.</span> <span id="s619">Only, from all the family, from all the members, the only person on my mother's side that I said good-bye was to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s620">Because my mother and I was at her bed side when she died.</span> <span id="s621">And she was clear, her mind was so clear.</span> <span id="s622">And I remember that I was terribly upset and my mother said something that also was to be a lesson.</span> <span id="s623">She said, "Yit-cola (ph), (she said that in Yiddish, of course, because as I said I spoke Yiddish), death teaches us not to take for granted life."</span> <span id="s624">And we still had, usually you know, according to tradition, the Jewish burial was very important.</span> <span id="s625">But later we couldn't have, people couldn't ultimately go and bury so we still, she was still buried in Chair-hon-off (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: You were able to bury her properly?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: We did, we were able to bury her properly but it was not like a big funeral that she would have had because the children from Warsaw, the children from __________ and all of them, they couldn't come.</span> <span id="s628">We just, our family, and the people who were involved.</span> <span id="s629">Because from everything, from birth to death, our lives was different than it is now, how it was during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s630">Because, for instance, there was not funeral pyres.</span> <span id="s631">There was not, you didn't bury people the same way that is here.</span> <span id="s632">And everything was different, on the way the customs were done.</span> <span id="s633">Our whole lives changed.</span> <span id="s634">Before the Nazis came in, the longest that I ever didn't eat was from one meal to the other.</span> <span id="s635">And being that we have a kosher home and familiar, after meat, eating, you wait six hours.</span> <span id="s636">So the religion taught me a lot of discipline too.</span> <span id="s637">And later the people who kept kosher could not keep kosher, they didn't have food at all.</span> <span id="s638">They were starving.</span> <span id="s639">So then in the middle of the night . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did you break those rules?</span> <span id="s641">Did you eat whatever you could at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: At that point there was no meat.</span> <span id="s643">There was no meat and we tried as much to keep as we could.</span> <span id="s644">But eventually when the hunger tool over you no longer could do it anymore because I remember a young pupil once of a Rabbi, when I was in Chair-hon-off (ph).</span> <span id="s645">Somebody was sick so he said that you're allowed, you don't have to fast if you don't feel good because to preserve your health, that was the first obligation.</span> <span id="s646">So all the laws, all the rules that applied before into other times that no longer could be applied here.</span> <span id="s647">Because here was just one thing, survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: How long were you able to live in your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: This is where I'm coming to now.</span> <span id="s650">I remember exactly.</span> <span id="s651">It was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s652">October 15, 1941.</span> <span id="s653">We were asleep and we heard, they broke in, the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s654">"All you-den rouse."</span> <span id="s655">All Jews out.</span> <span id="s656">And at that point we only, we couldn't, you wake up and you are tired, oh, the first thing with my mother, grab what she was mostly interested of course, the family should get out alive.</span> <span id="s657">She took the candlesticks, books, her books.</span> <span id="s658">A few books and a couple of bundles because everybody was constantly having, like a few things, we didn't know from day to day.</span> <span id="s659">And we didn't know, where are they taking us?</span> <span id="s660">And when I was a child, we use to, I use to play a lot at, you know they have, ________ it was called, a river.</span> <span id="s661">I'm trying to, is this a river or a lake?</span> <span id="s662">Which is larger?</span> <span id="s663">A lake?</span> <span id="s664">A river.</span> <span id="s665">A lake is larger, I think, but this was a river.</span> <span id="s666">And in this river, we used to play as children, I use to go, and there were big trees.</span> <span id="s667">In fact, I remember a story when I talk about the river and, I don't know, should I tell it?</span> <span id="s668">Which is really, okay.</span> <span id="s669">But anyhow, since people in this river, people used to bathe and there was like a special, like a place where on sha-but (ph) we used to go, ___________ they use to call it, you know, to go for a walk.</span> <span id="s670">And we would go to the river.</span> <span id="s671">And had beautiful moments.</span> <span id="s672">And then was a big castle near the river, there was a castle.</span> <span id="s673">When I lived there, it was empty, nobody lived in there.</span> <span id="s674">But a beautiful castle.</span> <span id="s675">In fact, I was now in Poland, it's still there, the castle is still there.</span> <span id="s676">I have a photograph of it.</span> <span id="s677">So, in the middle of the night, "All you-den rouse."</span> <span id="s678">With dogs, rifles, and they chased us out and they took us to the castle near the river.</span> <span id="s679">Lee-din-ya (ph) was called the river.</span> <span id="s680">And from there they put us on trucks and they took us to the ghetto, Nove' Mesto, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Now who was with you at this place?</span> <span id="s682">Your entire immediate family?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: My parents, my little brother and my little sister.</span> <span id="s684">That was all.</span> <span id="s685">My Aunt and Uncle and their children, they were the only ones that I saw still in the beginning, but when they chased us out they were not with us.</span> <span id="s686">So like I said, the only person that I said good-bye was my grandmother.</span> <span id="s687">The rest of the family we didn't know because to the other cities we couldn't even go, but them we would see occasionally.</span> <span id="s688">But when they chased us out, not until after the war I found out that when they chased us out they didn't chase out the whole city, they just chased out part.</span> <span id="s689">I don't know whether it was the larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later, so my Aunt must have been, and her family with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you have any sense of why you were chosen to go at that point verses another family?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: I didn't even know that we were, that somebody was left.</span> <span id="s692">Because they chased us out in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s693">We didn't have a chance to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s694">Not until after the war did I find this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So they sent you to this other town?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: They sent us to other town which was called Nove' Mesto, they changed the names, everything was changed.</span> <span id="s697">And Nove' Mesto, where previously lived one family, they put in six, seven and eight families.</span> <span id="s698">And the ghetto, you know, I don't have to explain to you what a ghetto is, we were isolated from the whole city.</span> <span id="s699">And it was so terribly crowded.</span> <span id="s700">And there, where we lived in was a family, the family which lived there was called Yat-rack (ph), and when we came there the facilities were not much better, like in ours.</span> <span id="s701">And so many families with little children, and everybody wanted to be able to go to the stove or use the facilities and everything.</span> <span id="s702">So, it was already horrible just being so crowded.</span> <span id="s703">And one time, my mother and father said to us, "Kindle-left (ph) children, get together the few belongings, we are leaving."</span> <span id="s704">And I thought to myself, are they loosing, have they lost their minds?</span> <span id="s705">Where are we leaving?</span> <span id="s706">It's a ghetto.</span> <span id="s707">We cannot go out.</span> <span id="s708">But we were, knew to respect our parents so we obeyed.</span> <span id="s709">And we went to a place where was before a storage for grains.</span> <span id="s710">And it was empty, it was a dirt floor and nothing there, just a small window and a door.</span> <span id="s711">And my parents went, there were many ruins and they got together some bricks and by themselves they built a little stove.</span> <span id="s712">But what they said is still clear and vivid in my mind.</span> <span id="s713">They said, "At least here we'll have, it's enough that the Nazis destroy us from the outside.</span> <span id="s714">Here at least we'll have a little bit more peace and we'll be together.</span> <span id="s715">But it won't be because the fighting, the screaming, the children crying.</span> <span id="s716">So we'll live there, right here, in this storage room."</span> <span id="s717">Exactly, and the conditions of the ghetto, I don't think I need to go in because its very clear at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Well how bad was it?</span> <span id="s719">I mean, there are many kinds of ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s721">This ghetto, to my knowledge, was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical resistance, of fighting.</span> <span id="s722">In fact, there was some ghetto, it was not as large a ghetto.</span> <span id="s723">What I remember is that we were constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s724">And my mother tried from the little meal that we had, she tried to make meals and many times what she did, she would take a little of hers, she would give to the smaller children because they couldn't endure so much.</span> <span id="s725">We wanted the parents, if the parents wanted to protect the children, she still was trying to read poetry and to sing songs, she still had the books, and she says, "We must, as long as we live, we must go on like a clock.</span> <span id="s726">We cannot stop.</span> <span id="s727">We have to go on."</span> <span id="s728">And she tried to teach my little sister who didn't have a chance to go to school, so she tries to teach her at home, _________ and to write a little bit.</span> <span id="s729">And my brother never had a chance to become barmitzvah.</span> <span id="s730">I don't know the exact age of them but I know that before, that he was not yet barmitzvah.</span> <span id="s731">And barmitzvah was always a very, very important thing for a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s732">So we lived in constant, and there was a lot of sicknesses.</span> <span id="s733">Because the sanitary, there was no medication, there wasn't a sanitary.</span> <span id="s734">A lot of parents died.</span> <span id="s735">You saw little orphaned children in the street begging for food.</span> <span id="s736">It was just horrible.</span> <span id="s737">Why I don't go in so much detail from the ghetto, because remember like I said before, that each time we thought it's the worst, something worse came.</span> <span id="s738">So after Auschwitz, this was like paradise.</span> <span id="s739">And for the main reason, because I still had my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Okay, but then let me ask you a few questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Because we know a lot more about some of the larger ghettos, but I don't know too much about this one.</span> <span id="s743">Was there an organization within it?</span> <span id="s744">Was there a yudden-rot (ph)?</span> <span id="s745">Where there Jewish policemen?</span> <span id="s746">Or did the Germans patrol the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: The Germans patrolled, I don't know why I don't have so much knowledge of how it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s748">Because I know one thing, that most of the time we stayed inside so much.</span> <span id="s749">I know there was a lot of sickness.</span> <span id="s750">I know that they tried to help, there were people who tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s751">But the problem is that everybody was starved.</span> <span id="s752">Everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s753">You couldn't go, it's just that sometimes the parents like made sacrifices.</span> <span id="s754">They would give a little of their ration to a younger child and the starvation.</span> <span id="s755">The kids couldn't anymore go to school.</span> <span id="s756">But if they would discover that we teach the children, we could be shot.</span> <span id="s757">They didn't want us to be educated.</span> <span id="s758">They wanted to destroy everything else.</span> <span id="s759">So still, the parents tried to teach and there were groups and we tried, like there was a group and if somebody got sick they tried to help.</span> <span id="s760">But the exact conditions that I should remember so clearly, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s761">I didn't know, I was too young still to know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So you didn't know how it was organized or run?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Was there a soup kitchen?</span> <span id="s765">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: I don't.</span> <span id="s767">No, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: It's okay.</span> <span id="s769">If you don't mind, ask you a few questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, no, you can ask me.</span> <span id="s771">But I don't know.</span> <span id="s772">I know that, yeah, there must have been a soup kitchen because I remember that we used to go to get some food, because we didn't have the food at home.</span> <span id="s773">We got rations.</span> <span id="s774">But I don't remember exactly how it was organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Did people work in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s776">Did either of your parents, were they forced to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I don’t think too much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s779">Did you play with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s781">In fact, there was one girl that I got to know in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s782">We stayed friends.</span> <span id="s783">So yes, I did have friends, tried to as much as we could to go on and to talk, but the conditions were so horrible.</span> <span id="s784">Because hunger and no place to wash, no place to, if somebody got sick there was no medication.</span> <span id="s785">So there was a lot of illnesses, like typhus was a lot, also, going in.</span> <span id="s786">Some people died of starvation.</span> <span id="s787">Some people died, that's what I remember most, is little kids crying a lot and begging.</span> <span id="s788">And older people sitting outside because there is already a lot of orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Were bodies buried when people died?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: This I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Did you, were you able to sort of, you were, was the ghetto fenced in?</span> <span id="s792">Were you able to go out of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s794">Yes, it was fenced in.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: But you could wander freely on the streets in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: In the ghetto, people tried not to wander around too much because they didn't want to, they wanted to avoid to be visible.</span> <span id="s797">Not to get hit because the Nazis had a tendency to torture, to mock us.</span> <span id="s798">In fact, for that reason, we tried as much to stay out of sight.</span> <span id="s799">I remember that I was mostly trying to be inside, like I felt safer to be inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did the Nazis come into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s801">Do you remember seeing people in uniform inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s803">But not constantly.</span> <span id="s804">I don't know why I have so little recollection of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s805">That is not too much, I was a whole year in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s806">It was exactly October 15, 1941.</span> <span id="s807">They chased us from home.</span> <span id="s808">And the ghetto, the entire ghetto was liquidated on November 17, 1942.</span> <span id="s809">About a year later.</span> <span id="s810">What I remember is that when, again in the middle of the night, I don't know why, but when we were chased off it was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s811">But this time we were told, they got us all together, and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a family camp where we are going to have better conditions.</span> <span id="s812">Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families are going to be together and work.</span> <span id="s813">And people were happy that we're going to have better medical conditions and better food.</span> <span id="s814">And then they took us all and they put us in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s815">I still had . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: How did you get this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: From the __________ because I went there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: No, how did you get the information that you were going to be moved supposedly to these family camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Because a Nazi say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: So they came and they told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: They told us that we are going to be resettled to a family camp and we are going to have better conditions.</span> <span id="s822">We're going to have medicine, because a lot of people died because they got sick, they didn't have any medication.</span> <span id="s823">And that we're going to have more food, that we're going to have good conditions.</span> <span id="s824">We're going to work but we're going to have good conditions.</span> <span id="s825">And it made sense because they want us well, that's what we thought.</span> <span id="s826">So they are going to feed us better, they are going to give us medication, and we didn't put any resistance because we didn't know.</span> <span id="s827">We believed it.</span> <span id="s828">I was brought up to trust people, to believe.</span> <span id="s829">You know, in my life, my family didn't ever betray me.</span> <span id="s830">Like I said, the only time I heard my mother lying is this, so I had no reason why not to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Let me ask you one question.</span> <span id="s832">Did your family talk about what was happening or you just got by day to day?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: I didn’t hear much discussion, I don't know whether my parents wanted to shield us.</span> <span id="s834">Believe it or not, in the worst conditions, they were telling us stories, they were teaching us . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s835">[end of side 1 of tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: So you and your family were put on cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Tell me about the trip, the journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Oh that was a time I will never forget.</span> <span id="s840">They closed, they closed, we were put in the cattle cars, they pushed in, it was so tight that you hardly had place to sit down.</span> <span id="s841">There was nothing to sit on.</span> <span id="s842">And there was no place to relieve yourself.</span> <span id="s843">They locked us in with just a small window that you looked out, and they locked us, you know, hermetically sealed cattle trains.</span> <span id="s844">And when the journey begun, there was so many people packed in this here, and we traveled with this here, the train, from November 17, 1942, when we arrived in Auschwitz was November 22, 1942.</span> <span id="s845">So five days, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: What was happening in the cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: What was happening in the cars?</span> <span id="s848">It was hot.</span> <span id="s849">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s850">We were thirsty.</span> <span id="s851">People were crying.</span> <span id="s852">People were praying.</span> <span id="s853">People were screaming, going crazy.</span> <span id="s854">We had no choice, we had to relieve ourselves in front of other people.</span> <span id="s855">Starvation.</span> <span id="s856">Fear.</span> <span id="s857">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s858">How long are we going to go?</span> <span id="s859">Where they are taking us?</span> <span id="s860">They promised better conditions, when is it going to be?</span> <span id="s861">And I remember parents tried to comfort, when we arrive there things are going to get better.</span> <span id="s862">And in the meantime, people were fainting.</span> <span id="s863">People got sick.</span> <span id="s864">It was just a living Hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: As a young girl do you remember what was going on in your mind, what you were thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: What was going on, I was clinging to my parents.</span> <span id="s867">And I was wondering, what's going to happen?</span> <span id="s868">And I was crying because I saw my little brother and sister so hungry and I had nothing to give them.</span> <span id="s869">The parents wanted to protect us, we want to protect the parents.</span> <span id="s870">And we saw older people, we were always told by my parents and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, that we always help those who are less fortunate but here we were all less fortunate.</span> <span id="s871">And the worst thing was that we couldn't help each other too much.</span> <span id="s872">We were all in the same condition.</span> <span id="s873">There was no relief, no relief.</span> <span id="s874">And just, I kept on thinking about, I wanted to turn my mind off so I was trying to think of stories but the hunger took over.</span> <span id="s875">We were sleepy, there was no place to lay down.</span> <span id="s876">It was the most horrible journey.</span> <span id="s877">It was a horrible journey.</span> <span id="s878">And then, after five days like this, the stench, the tiredness, you know?</span> <span id="s879">The Holocaust for me, it was not, _______ ___________ was nothing to compare to what we suffered.</span> <span id="s880">But the worst suffering was that we, I saw the people I loved and I couldn't help them, and they couldn't help us.</span> <span id="s881">We lost control of our lives.</span> <span id="s882">And that was even before we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s883">And when we arrived, this train stopped all of a sudden, the door flung open, people who looked very strange to us in striped gray and blue stripes, wearing, with hats, __________.</span> <span id="s884">And then the Gestapo came and said, "All rouse, schnell, schnell, schnell."</span> <span id="s885">Always schnell, always rouse.</span> <span id="s886">And they told us to leave everything, to leave our bundles there.</span> <span id="s887">We didn't have too much to begin with.</span> <span id="s888">And everything went so fast.</span> <span id="s889">And then the Gestapo were chasing us and I remember I saw a gate.</span> <span id="s890">It said All-might-muck-fry (ph).</span> <span id="s891">All-might-muck-fry (ph) means work makes you free.</span> <span id="s892">But as I found out later, the only dead was only when they liberate us.</span> <span id="s893">Only a few survived.</span> <span id="s894">When we came they started to make selections.</span> <span id="s895">And Mengelia, at that time I didn't know that this is Mengelia, some very well fed, good looking Nazis, with the Nazis uniforms, with the swastika, stood so, they were, you couldn't tell from their faces anything.</span> <span id="s896">Expression was like mocking and everything.</span> <span id="s897">And later I found out that the one who made the selection when we were there was Mengelia.</span> <span id="s898">And they started to separate male from females and make selection.</span> <span id="s899">To the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s900">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s901">And all of a sudden, when we came there facing the gate where it said All-might-muck-fry (ph), this is the gate.</span> <span id="s902">On the right-hand side, which would be the left, but on my side facing, was a Red Cross truck with a sign, Red Cross.</span> <span id="s903">And I remember I pointed it out to my parents.</span> <span id="s904">I said, "See, they kept their promise.</span> <span id="s905">The Red Cross stands for help."</span> <span id="s906">And then they said, they started to tear apart the families.</span> <span id="s907">Separate the families.</span> <span id="s908">Pulled out children from the hands of their parents.</span> <span id="s909">Little infants away from the mother.</span> <span id="s910">And they started to make the selection.</span> <span id="s911">To the left and to the right.</span> <span id="s912">Immediately they took away my father.</span> <span id="s913">My father was a young man, maybe early 40's or 40 or so.</span> <span id="s914">And they took away my little brother and sister.</span> <span id="s915">My mother and I they put together in the line, we were selected to go each.</span> <span id="s916">And at that point . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: How old were your brother and sister at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I just go by because I know that my little sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet school.</span> <span id="s919">And my brother wasn't yet barmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age.</span> <span id="s920">It was, at home we didn't celebrate birthdays like here because for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe in the evil eye and things like this.</span> <span id="s921">I don't know, superstitious.</span> <span id="s922">But anyhow, they were still young.</span> <span id="s923">So when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everything went so fast that I didn't even have time to think.</span> <span id="s924">And then my mother turned to me and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), you’re a big girl.</span> <span id="s925">I have to go with the little children.</span> <span id="s926">But remember my child, no matter what's going to happen to you, don't become hateful and bitter.</span> <span id="s927">Don't let them destroy you."</span> <span id="s928">That was her last words.</span> <span id="s929">And all of a sudden I was all alone.</span> <span id="s930">And that's it, everything that I had, everything, because I was became dead.</span> <span id="s931">And I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye because I didn't know that we are parting forever.</span> <span id="s932">I didn't know about gas chambers, nothing.</span> <span id="s933">My personal experience, nothing can historically, I never knew about gas chambers.</span> <span id="s934">When you saw that we were deceived.</span> <span id="s935">Deceived, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s936">So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way.</span> <span id="s937">And they left for the barracks.</span> <span id="s938">And they took them away.</span> <span id="s939">I didn't know at that time where, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s940">Now when I know what's happened, but I mean, at the time when they took us away we didn't know.</span> <span id="s941">And they took away all older people, young children, pregnant woman.</span> <span id="s942">So I talk to myself, I remember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be together.</span> <span id="s943">So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated very much.</span> <span id="s944">I figured the little children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever.</span> <span id="s945">Who could know that doctors who were trained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health.</span> <span id="s946">In fact, I wrote a poem about Mengelia.</span> <span id="s947">Would you like me to say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: I think I'd like you to continue now and then we'll see if you feel like reading it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s950">Anyhow, when they took us away all of a sudden they brought us into a place and we were, they shaved, first of all they made their number.</span> <span id="s951">We had to give up everything.</span> <span id="s952">I remember I was clutching a little picture, a photograph of my family, and I had to give it up.</span> <span id="s953">At first I didn't want to so they started to beat me so I figured its not worth it to, you know?</span> <span id="s954">I knew that I'm not going to be able to keep it so I gave it up.</span> <span id="s955">And we had to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: What is your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: My number?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: They gave you a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s960">2-5-6-7-3.</span> <span id="s961">Not everyone got numbers.</span> <span id="s962">The ones who they took away to the gas chambers, they didn't get numbers.</span> <span id="s963">And also, I don't know whether you are aware, Auschwitz was Auschwitz I, II.</span> <span id="s964">I was taken to Birkenau and Birkenau was where the gas chambers were, all the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Were your brother and sister still with you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: When they took away . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: When they took you into the shaved and tattooing . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Oh, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s969">They immediately had the selections.</span> <span id="s970">Mangelia sent them to the trucks.</span> <span id="s971">And I remember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister.</span> <span id="s972">My brother was protecting my little sister, they took them away.</span> <span id="s973">And then my mother saw them going away.</span> <span id="s974">I don't know how much she know, what she knew, but again her ___________, she made a fatal choice and she went with the children.</span> <span id="s975">She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl.</span> <span id="s976">So that was the last time I ever saw them.</span> <span id="s977">The whole family for four generations.</span> <span id="s978">And I had no idea where my Aunt, who lived in Warsaw, she was married with children, my Aunt in the ________.</span> <span id="s979">Another __________, all the relatives.</span> <span id="s980">I never said good-bye, I don't know what's happened to them.</span> <span id="s981">Whether my Aunt in Warsaw died in the Warsaw ghetto, whether she was, this we will never know.</span> <span id="s982">We don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking.</span> <span id="s983">Because, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and why I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step-mother came.</span> <span id="s984">And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600 century my ancestors came to Poland.</span> <span id="s985">And yet, we had to leave everything.</span> <span id="s986">Everything that was ours they inherited, they took away everything.</span> <span id="s987">Nothing was ours.</span> <span id="s988">And, you know?</span> <span id="s989">And then when we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads.</span> <span id="s990">The guys, it was done too.</span> <span id="s991">And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad fortune can only be understood in retrospect.</span> <span id="s992">So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the number.</span> <span id="s993">At least I'm alive with the number.</span> <span id="s994">And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed, but obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this.</span> <span id="s995">But we got a bath, which we welcomed because a shower was, you know?</span> <span id="s996">And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms.</span> <span id="s997">And they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train.</span> <span id="s998">And, not from the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there.</span> <span id="s999">And then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes.</span> <span id="s1000">Everything was taken.</span> <span id="s1001">Our clothes, our shoes, our hair, our name.</span> <span id="s1002">Everything.</span> <span id="s1003">And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I was just a number.</span> <span id="s1004">And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called us by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up.</span> <span id="s1005">They always would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I always would say under my breath, "Yit-cola (ph)".</span> <span id="s1006">Because I thought to myself, how can I be a number?</span> <span id="s1007">I can feel, I can think, I can laugh.</span> <span id="s1008">Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of mind, freedom of thoughts.</span> <span id="s1009">And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance.</span> <span id="s1010">That I refused to see myself through their minds.</span> <span id="s1011">And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair of shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s1012">And mine, unfortunately, were not matching.</span> <span id="s1013">And we got an enamel bowl.</span> <span id="s1014">And this was all our worldly possessions.</span> <span id="s1015">In one day our entire past was wiped out.</span> <span id="s1016">And we had no future.</span> <span id="s1017">We didn't know it then yet.</span> <span id="s1018">I didn't know about gas chambers yet.</span> <span id="s1019">And they marched us into a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Let me ask you one question here.</span> <span id="s1021">Was there anyone in this group you knew from before?</span> <span id="s1022">Did you know some people from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1024">We came with people from our town who were in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Did any of the older people try to protect you because your mother wasn't with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: The older people didn't come in with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity.</span> <span id="s1029">However, I had one bad experience.</span> <span id="s1030">And I'll come to it.</span> <span id="s1031">So when they gave us, and we always had to march to line up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January 18, 1945, I had no longer freedom.</span> <span id="s1032">No freedom.</span> <span id="s1033">We were, everything, because from the morning we woke up, we came ________ in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks.</span> <span id="s1034">And was three layer bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1035">And crowded on the bunk beds with one blanket.</span> <span id="s1036">And they were so low that you couldn't sit up.</span> <span id="s1037">We couldn't sit up.</span> <span id="s1038">The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept.</span> <span id="s1039">There was no night clothes.</span> <span id="s1040">From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth.</span> <span id="s1041">I never saw myself in a mirror.</span> <span id="s1042">Nobody ever embraced me.</span> <span id="s1043">Nobody ever said, after having so much love.</span> <span id="s1044">So when I'm looking back from an environment where I was free like a bird, to come to a place where I felt like in a cage.</span> <span id="s1045">And you know, you can put a bird in a cage but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly.</span> <span id="s1046">They took away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free.</span> <span id="s1047">They took away my loved ones but they could not take away my desire to live.</span> <span id="s1048">And I guess there were many horrible things but probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved.</span> <span id="s1049">And not only experiencing my own suffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span> <span id="s1050">And I couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1051">And in the barracks, where I could say something when the Nazis were not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel.</span> <span id="s1052">Because everyone spoke a different language.</span> <span id="s1053">And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1054">So when we came in, so many people were crowded in this barrack.</span> <span id="s1055">And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to be thrown into an environment like this.</span> <span id="s1056">And everybody was suffering.</span> <span id="s1057">My first concern was, when is our family going to come?</span> <span id="s1058">But I still was naive enough to believe what the Nazis told us, that we are going to get united.</span> <span id="s1059">So I'm waiting.</span> <span id="s1060">And I don't see them.</span> <span id="s1061">So I start asking questions.</span> <span id="s1062">And there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent.</span> <span id="s1063">Whether they didn't want to tell us because they didn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to?</span> <span id="s1064">This I don't know, but whoever I asked nobody answered anything.</span> <span id="s1065">They didn't say yes or no, nothing.</span> <span id="s1066">Finally, after constantly badgering and repeating, one of the girls said, "You might as well tell her.</span> <span id="s1067">We are all here condemned to die."</span> <span id="s1068">And she points at the smoke and she said, "You see that chimney?</span> <span id="s1069">This is where your parents are."</span> <span id="s1070">And tells me the story about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1071">She said, "This is where we're all going to be."</span> <span id="s1072">Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral, my parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin.</span> <span id="s1073">It's like spitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish law.</span> <span id="s1074">So I did not for once think about committing suicide.</span> <span id="s1075">But at that moment, if I would have been able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was.</span> <span id="s1076">And I just was ready to give up.</span> <span id="s1077">I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious.</span> <span id="s1078">I didn't care what's happening.</span> <span id="s1079">And anyhow . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Can I ask you a question here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How long do you think you were there before you realized this?</span> <span id="s1083">Or before you were told this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: I didn't know the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Was it a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: No, no, not months.</span> <span id="s1087">It was in a few days.</span> <span id="s1088">The exact day I don't know.</span> <span id="s1089">Not very long, not very long.</span> <span id="s1090">Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls.</span> <span id="s1091">And I'm going to go in later to describe what a day in Auschwitz was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its like a funeral for me.</span> <span id="s1092">I lost everybody.</span> <span id="s1093">So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1094">So I took the bread and left it.</span> <span id="s1095">In the morning my bread was gone.</span> <span id="s1096">And one of the girls there, I don't remember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff (ph) and she actually came from a prison.</span> <span id="s1097">I don't know whether the prison was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than our laws.</span> <span id="s1098">For keeping ________ on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live.</span> <span id="s1099">To kill you was legal.</span> <span id="s1100">But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death.</span> <span id="s1101">To survive was to them, everything that was our they have taken away, if we would try to keep something, we were treated like criminals.</span> <span id="s1102">So anyhow, in the morning Esther says to me, "Oh poo Yit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread."</span> <span id="s1103">And I said, "My gosh, what place is this?</span> <span id="s1104">Stealing somebody's piece of bread."</span> <span id="s1105">And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again.</span> <span id="s1106">Even though I was, like my throat was locked.</span> <span id="s1107">And I left the bread.</span> <span id="s1108">In the night for some reason we slept so many people on one bunk, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other, we had to wake the others, so somebody woke up.</span> <span id="s1109">And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me was eating my bread.</span> <span id="s1110">And that was almost like the last straw for me.</span> <span id="s1111">And at that point I just didn't care what's happening.</span> <span id="s1112">And I was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s1113">And I didn't know it at the time, in Auschwitz if you didn't get up for the _________ or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you would right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1114">So a girl walks over and she ask me, "Why are you crying?"</span> <span id="s1115">And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying.</span> <span id="s1116">I just didn't even want to answer.</span> <span id="s1117">Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's caring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, "Yes my child, but kindness and caring cannot be little things."</span> <span id="s1118">Like when I did the ____________.</span> <span id="s1119">And what's happened?</span> <span id="s1120">And finally I tell her.</span> <span id="s1121">And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread, I cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything.</span> <span id="s1122">So she took a piece of her bread and she broke it off and she said, "Take it."</span> <span id="s1123">And I didn't want to take it.</span> <span id="s1124">Because I already knew that we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s1125">So I figured I cannot afford to get involved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes, there's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain.</span> <span id="s1126">But there was something in her voice and her face and everything.</span> <span id="s1127">Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph), Yanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka.</span> <span id="s1128">And finally I took the bread and I said, "No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone.</span> <span id="s1129">It's not even worth living.</span> <span id="s1130">I'm all alone."</span> <span id="s1131">I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend.</span> <span id="s1132">And from that day on, she became like my sister.</span> <span id="s1133">We cared for each other.</span> <span id="s1134">We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other.</span> <span id="s1135">In Auschwitz, a piece of bread meant life.</span> <span id="s1136">Meant winning in the game of survival.</span> <span id="s1137">So I just felt that she was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast.</span> <span id="s1138">Here, Esther stole my piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1139">And this girl gave away a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1140">I didn't even know until this day, I don't know when she came, I didn't know at that time anything.</span> <span id="s1141">Now I know that she was born in Warsaw, but I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1142">At that time we didn't think of it.</span> <span id="s1143">And I took the bread and with it something in my spirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I.</span> <span id="s1144">We didn't know if we were going to get out of there, but to live or to die with ______________, with humanness.</span> <span id="s1145">Not to lose our dignity.</span> <span id="s1146">And this is important to know, that in Auschwitz there were two kinds of laws.</span> <span id="s1147">If somebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron with soup, people would lift up the lid and put in their bowl and grab and run.</span> <span id="s1148">If they were lucky they could run away.</span> <span id="s1149">If they caught them, they would get 25 on their bare behind.</span> <span id="s1150">And sometimes even worse.</span> <span id="s1151">But one inmate from the other, that was a no law.</span> <span id="s1152">Would not take, because we know this meant survival.</span> <span id="s1153">And from 1942 to 1945 I was in Auschwitz, nobody ever stole from me anything.</span> <span id="s1154">You know?</span> <span id="s1155">And we felt like we had no freedom at all.</span> <span id="s1156">No freedom of movement, only in our soul and our mind could we be free.</span> <span id="s1157">And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make.</span> <span id="s1158">We use to switch, you know, like to share.</span> <span id="s1159">I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or vis-a-versa.</span> <span id="s1160">One day when she had the _________.</span> <span id="s1161">And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if they were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure when they divided.</span> <span id="s1162">You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so great.</span> <span id="s1163">Binna and I trusted each other and we kept together our bread.</span> <span id="s1164">We didn't keep it separate and she never betrayed me, or vice-a-versa.</span> <span id="s1165">And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my family, she became the friend that I kept with.</span> <span id="s1166">When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I were more like friends, under such circumstances.</span> <span id="s1167">And when the day that they usually begun, when the whistle would blow, get up.</span> <span id="s1168">And we would always, it was still dark.</span> <span id="s1169">I didn't have a clock because as I said, my only worldly possession was the shift, the wooden clog and the bowl.</span> <span id="s1170">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1171">So I didn't have a watch, I didn’t know what day it is, I didn't have a calendar.</span> <span id="s1172">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1173">People say, did you have this?</span> <span id="s1174">So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn’t have more than this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in Auschwitz was like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: We didn't wake up by the clock.</span> <span id="s1179">We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark.</span> <span id="s1180">We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day.</span> <span id="s1181">We didn't have any extra clothes.</span> <span id="s1182">This was all that we had.</span> <span id="s1183">And there was water but we were told that this is not good drinking water.</span> <span id="s1184">So water was very scarce.</span> <span id="s1185">We didn't have, we couldn't go to the bathroom when we wanted.</span> <span id="s1186">It was like a collective bathroom, like the latrines you know?</span> <span id="s1187">And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece.</span> <span id="s1188">So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink.</span> <span id="s1189">And therefore they got diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1190">And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up.</span> <span id="s1191">We didn't have anywhere to wash.</span> <span id="s1192">So it wasn't clean.</span> <span id="s1193">And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work.</span> <span id="s1194">And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now.</span> <span id="s1195">So it was important.</span> <span id="s1196">And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some freedom.</span> <span id="s1197">So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the __________, I would still say the prayers, even in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1198">And we would start, go to the ________ where we are counted.</span> <span id="s1199">Alive or dead, we had to be _________.</span> <span id="s1200">And they used the matter that one was responsible for all.</span> <span id="s1201">So if one person would not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no matter how long.</span> <span id="s1202">Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything.</span> <span id="s1203">If we didn't have, and we would stay, freeze.</span> <span id="s1204">So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you know somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each other.</span> <span id="s1205">And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted.</span> <span id="s1206">And sometimes we would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for.</span> <span id="s1207">Other times we would stay for hours.</span> <span id="s1208">And then they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would have had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water.</span> <span id="s1209">A little beet.</span> <span id="s1210">A piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1211">Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly.</span> <span id="s1212">But we didn't get enough of it.</span> <span id="s1213">We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat anything almost.</span> <span id="s1214">In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm us.</span> <span id="s1215">And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the snow.</span> <span id="s1216">And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that.</span> <span id="s1217">They tried to torture us.</span> <span id="s1218">And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear, "Links."</span> <span id="s1219">Line up and go march.</span> <span id="s1220">And on both sides big, long lines with the prisoners marching, with the inmates marching.</span> <span id="s1221">And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about slavery in Egypt or _________ was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves.</span> <span id="s1222">So prisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not condemned to die, you know?</span> <span id="s1223">Not that way, they used them for something.</span> <span id="s1224">And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work.</span> <span id="s1225">And then we had to go through the gates, and at the gates many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out somebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good.</span> <span id="s1226">Other times we were just called, 1-2-3, 5-6-7, the 8th out, sometimes the 10th out, we never know.</span> <span id="s1227">So you could not plan from one second to the other because you don’t know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day.</span> <span id="s1228">That's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness must feel.</span> <span id="s1229">And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we tried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last.</span> <span id="s1230">The less visible you could make yourself.</span> <span id="s1231">And we marched.</span> <span id="s1232">When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman was our Block Elster (ph).</span> <span id="s1233">A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsible.</span> <span id="s1234">And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1235">And then we came to work.</span> <span id="s1236">And we always worked outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1237">And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside, outer-commando (ph).</span> <span id="s1238">And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was not usual work.</span> <span id="s1239">We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used to mock us.</span> <span id="s1240">And point to the gas chambers and ____________ they said, "See?</span> <span id="s1241">That's where you’re all going to come out."</span> <span id="s1242">And then he said, "Where is your God now?"</span> <span id="s1243">And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar.</span> <span id="s1244">"Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.</span> <span id="s1245">God is in the root cellar too."</span> <span id="s1246">And I said to myself, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.</span> <span id="s1247">You’re the last one of your family.</span> <span id="s1248">If you don’t survive, the world will not know and it will be the last.</span> <span id="s1249">It's like your family will not have existed.</span> <span id="s1250">Go.</span> <span id="s1251">God is here too.</span> <span id="s1252">But man is not here.</span> <span id="s1253">_______________ [humanness] is not here."</span> <span id="s1254">And I started to understand what _____________ means, why my parents stressed it so much.</span> <span id="s1255">And I never for once felt like God has failed me.</span> <span id="s1256">I felt the people failed me.</span> <span id="s1257">Because God gives men choices to do good or evil.</span> <span id="s1258">But they have chosen and they were the educated people.</span> <span id="s1259">My family always stressed education.</span> <span id="s1260">____________ .</span> <span id="s1261">In fact, my family used to say that _____________ is the highest form of religion, science and achievement.</span> <span id="s1262">And in Auschwitz, I had a chance to find out that this was true.</span> <span id="s1263">Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees.</span> <span id="s1264">And he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family.</span> <span id="s1265">So I did not doubt God.</span> <span id="s1266">In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I remembered other things, which I didn’t mentioned this story and I think I will now because I thought of that story often.</span> <span id="s1267">You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless of how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes.</span> <span id="s1268">It didn't matter whether you had a lot.</span> <span id="s1269">And most, and there was not big department stores like this here, so mostly we would go to the dressmaker to make a dress.</span> <span id="s1270">That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember my mother ordered for me navy blue ___________.</span> <span id="s1271">And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two-piece dress, a sailor dress, a pleated skirt with the collar like this.</span> <span id="s1272">And when we went to try on first the measurements and everything.</span> <span id="s1273">And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and look in the mirror and it fit well.</span> <span id="s1274">And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress.</span> <span id="s1275">The sailor dress.</span> <span id="s1276">And I came home and it was early Passover, before Passover.</span> <span id="s1277">So, like a child, I wanted to put on the dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it.</span> <span id="s1278">And when I was going to put on the dress, my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now."</span> <span id="s1279">I said, "Oh Mom, it's gonna . . ." She said, "It might get tore and it might get stains and then you won't have it for Passover."</span> <span id="s1280">And I said, "Oh Mom, its going to be okay."</span> <span id="s1281">So I remember my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please.</span> <span id="s1282">Don't take chances on something you can't afford to lose."</span> <span id="s1283">But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please.</span> <span id="s1284">So finally my mother said, she says, "Well, you learn about responsibility.</span> <span id="s1285">That's the only way you’re going to learn."</span> <span id="s1286">And I promised I won't, I'll be careful.</span> <span id="s1287">And I had every intentions of doing it, it was not out of mischief or not caring.</span> <span id="s1288">And I put on the dress and I came out.</span> <span id="s1289">And I was very, a combination.</span> <span id="s1290">In one way I could be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you that we had the ________, the river.</span> <span id="s1291">And we use to go there, it had beautiful trees.</span> <span id="s1292">And the kids came and somebody challenged, they said, "Who can climb up highest on the tree?"</span> <span id="s1293">And I was pretty good at that, you know?</span> <span id="s1294">I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at favorably.</span> <span id="s1295">They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin.</span> <span id="s1296">People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me.</span> <span id="s1297">And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, "Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother is coming."</span> <span id="s1298">And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress.</span> <span id="s1299">And I went to get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt.</span> <span id="s1300">I came down.</span> <span id="s1301">My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me.</span> <span id="s1302">And I was in tears.</span> <span id="s1303">And I said, "My God.</span> <span id="s1304">My mother begged me not to take chances.</span> <span id="s1305">Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn."</span> <span id="s1306">And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear.</span> <span id="s1307">And when I came into the house with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much.</span> <span id="s1308">All she said, "Take of the skirt."</span> <span id="s1309">Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two together.</span> <span id="s1310">"And I'll fix it for you."</span> <span id="s1311">But she said, "Remember one thing.</span> <span id="s1312">It's up to you.</span> <span id="s1313">You can wear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you.</span> <span id="s1314">But you’re going to go to services."</span> <span id="s1315">I was crying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress.</span> <span id="s1316">But I remembered the lesson.</span> <span id="s1317">Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson.</span> <span id="s1318">In every experience.</span> <span id="s1319">And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose.</span> <span id="s1320">And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz, is to lose my life.</span> <span id="s1321">So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no.</span> <span id="s1322">I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away.</span> <span id="s1323">And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had.</span> <span id="s1324">And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had.</span> <span id="s1325">And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a Jewish community, without the ____________, we were always Jewish there, but we were not, Jewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1326">There were Gypsies, there were Jehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all countries.</span> <span id="s1327">However, the Jewish, we, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the same camp.</span> <span id="s1328">The Polish girls were not together in the same barracks with us.</span> <span id="s1329">We were separated.</span> <span id="s1330">So in all the years that I was there, I never had any contact with a man.</span> <span id="s1331">I'm not talking in a sexual way, but I mean even to be friends or to be in the company of men.</span> <span id="s1332">And here, this is my teen-age years.</span> <span id="s1333">The price of going to _______, the price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal education.</span> <span id="s1334">The price of all the things, of liberty, which I started to realize how important freedom is.</span> <span id="s1335">Our liberty.</span> <span id="s1336">And this is when, when I felt all this here, then I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down how I feel.</span> <span id="s1337">But I didn't have.</span> <span id="s1338">And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run away from the harsh reality.</span> <span id="s1339">So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt and it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this earth by invisible strings, chained to a destiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the sky with a heavy sigh, but my wings have been clipped and I no longer can fly.</span> <span id="s1340">And I was looking out and seeing the physical surroundings.</span> <span id="s1341">Around us was the barbed wires, the watch towers, the crematories.</span> <span id="s1342">The smoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud.</span> <span id="s1343">There was so much mud there that when we wore those wooden clogs, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and on cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the ________ bite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on the job they would mock us, they would beat us.</span> <span id="s1344">We could not, we were not allowed to help each other.</span> <span id="s1345">And the useless words.</span> <span id="s1346">And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this is, if this is our _______, I don’t even have the word to express it, its like a different planet.</span> <span id="s1347">It's in the same world like a different planet, a planet of destruction, of death.</span> <span id="s1348">The dead were not buried and was mountains, everything was mountains.</span> <span id="s1349">Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them.</span> <span id="s1350">And constant living under the fear of maybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no medication.</span> <span id="s1351">Everything that they promised was not.</span> <span id="s1352">And once I found out what they do with the people who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing.</span> <span id="s1353">And I asked somebody, "Where is the music?"</span> <span id="s1354">And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing.</span> <span id="s1355">When the transport was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the gas chamber, the music was playing.</span> <span id="s1356">Classical music.</span> <span id="s1357">And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I knew that my people are burning, the music is playing.</span> <span id="s1358">And you know, even after the Holocaust I always loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry because the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart.</span> <span id="s1359">And then, after a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections.</span> <span id="s1360">Some people got beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1361">Other people from working were injured, some people got sick.</span> <span id="s1362">And every day there became lesser and lesser of us.</span> <span id="s1363">And the bodies, more skeletal.</span> <span id="s1364">And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything and we started to accumulate lice.</span> <span id="s1365">So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to ________ to expose of the lice.</span> <span id="s1366">And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a comedy comparing to what it was.</span> <span id="s1367">That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to describe everything.</span> <span id="s1368">So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole day, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are there.</span> <span id="s1369">And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread.</span> <span id="s1370">It wasn't enough to live and not enough to die.</span> <span id="s1371">And many people, many, constantly people died.</span> <span id="s1372">And seeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone.</span> <span id="s1373">And constantly new transports, and you couldn't speak.</span> <span id="s1374">So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness.</span> <span id="s1375">Like I started before to tell you, is all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s1376">They tried to dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I remember what my parents taught me, that my ___________ does not depend on how other treat me but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it.</span> <span id="s1377">We didn't even have a piece of toilet tissue.</span> <span id="s1378">All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn't have a piece of toilet tissue.</span> <span id="s1379">This is how they deprived us.</span> <span id="s1380">Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing.</span> <span id="s1381">You know, they tried to reduce us to be like non-humans.</span> <span id="s1382">And the mocking constantly and everything.</span> <span id="s1383">So again, each day the same thing, over and over, starting the ______ and just hanging on another day.</span> <span id="s1384">Just if you could get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chamber, go through the day and come home together with Binna, that's _____________.</span> <span id="s1385">And many times, people would go in the evening and somebody would say, "Listen, I'm going to give you a little of my soup.</span> <span id="s1386">You want to give me a piece of your bread?"</span> <span id="s1387">Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread.</span> <span id="s1388">And the starvation.</span> <span id="s1389">And then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are going to give us extra bread, who wants to have extra bread?</span> <span id="s1390">And I learned very quickly, whenever they called for volunteers for something, I never wanted to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1391">I felt, others suffered but I don’t want to get involved to do something which wouldn't be ________, you know?</span> <span id="s1392">And what I found out one time, they took, they made a selection.</span> <span id="s1393">They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they took away the girls and not until after the war, one who was taken away and survived, I found out that they took them for experiments.</span> <span id="s1394">And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia.</span> <span id="s1395">You know, they castrated some men and some women, the operations, so they could never bear children anymore.</span> <span id="s1396">And some people, one woman, she is already dead now, but a few years ago she was still alive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electro-something, I forget how this is called, they had to take it off from her face.</span> <span id="s1397">Hair grew like a man, you know?</span> <span id="s1398">And different things.</span> <span id="s1399">There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know who got married but never could have children because of those experiments.</span> <span id="s1400">And some got sick.</span> <span id="s1401">But the majority died, they didn't survive this here.</span> <span id="s1402">Yes, and another thing.</span> <span id="s1403">There was a ______________, you know?</span> <span id="s1404">So, and they sometimes Mengelia or other doctors would come and we had to strip and, which is _________.</span> <span id="s1405">He would look us over and those who looked already skinny or they are too sick or, away to, but at that point, away to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1406">There was a block where they would send away, and sometimes they didn't have enough time to get them out, so they would put them, put them in this block and they no longer gave them food or anything.</span> <span id="s1407">And then they take them away.</span> <span id="s1408">If you got sick, it was tough luck.</span> <span id="s1409">Then you were a goner.</span> <span id="s1410">Until this day, I cannot, I'm thinking and I'm amazed myself that I didn't, wasn't able to be clean there.</span> <span id="s1411">I didn't have medications, a few times I got sick.</span> <span id="s1412">Not like real serious.</span> <span id="s1413">Without an aspirin, without medication, everything else.</span> <span id="s1414">And yet to survive.</span> <span id="s1415">And then constantly transports.</span> <span id="s1416">And then was one day, we were called _______, they asked us to stay longer and there was a girl and her name was _____________, something with a "Z" begins, I forget her last name, Zit-a-emir (ph), something like this here.</span> <span id="s1417">I didn't know her personally but I knew of her.</span> <span id="s1418">She was a messenger, you know?</span> <span id="s1419">And I don’t know the exact story because I don't, I'm not, I was not a witness when she run away, I didn't see her run away.</span> <span id="s1420">But I know that one day we were all called together and we were, they prepared a gallow and they were going to hang her because she run away and they brought her back, they found her.</span> <span id="s1421">And she, when they found her, I don't know from where because in Auschwitz I couldn't get anything more than what I got, the bowl and the clothes.</span> <span id="s1422">She had a razor someplace hidden.</span> <span id="s1423">And before they hang her, she cut her wrists in my prescence.</span> <span id="s1424">Then there was another hanging.</span> <span id="s1425">This hanging I did not witness because Rosa Loberta (ph), my __________, the beautiful Rosa, this story I just know from my __________, the few to have survived.</span> <span id="s1426">That she was also hanged in Auschwitz because she wasn't dead and they destroyed one of the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1427">And when the Nazis started to lose the war, of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside communication.</span> <span id="s1428">Completely cut off.</span> <span id="s1429">That's why I say, its in this world but a planet like a different world because we were isolated completely.</span> <span id="s1430">They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted to destroy everybody because even though he is losing the war but he still was carrying on with the plan of destroying the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1431">So the girls made to destroy the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1432">And anyhow, there is somebody who's name is Noy-ia Zub-o-dal-vich (ph), he lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1433">And he was able, because they kept him in solitary, and they tortured her.</span> <span id="s1434">And from him I know this story.</span> <span id="s1435">That they hang her.</span> <span id="s1436">And before they hand her, she said, "Ha-zak viv-lots (ph)", the strong and brave.</span> <span id="s1437">And what they wanted from her is that she should denounce, they interrogated her too and they wanted her that she should tell who the others were.</span> <span id="s1438">The resistance, you know, she was involved with other people.</span> <span id="s1439">She, from the story that I've heard, that she was smuggling pieces of ammunition or something, but as I said, I'm not a witness to that but I heard.</span> <span id="s1440">So there was resistance but very, not speaking for the Warsaw ghetto we know that resistance, but this I'm not going to speak because I wasn't in those ghettos, I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1441">But the very fact, to want it to go on knowing that nobody is left anymore.</span> <span id="s1442">There is no place to go back or anything.</span> <span id="s1443">So surviving, and we didn't know how others, what's going on, what are they doing with the war or anything.</span> <span id="s1444">But I kept constantly asking myself, the German people at that time were the most educated people and yet they did the most horrible things.</span> <span id="s1445">A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy?</span> <span id="s1446">And everything, it seemed to me like ironical.</span> <span id="s1447">The youngster he considered too young to live and the old were too old to live and the teen-agers, from teen-age years to older a little bit, they were just right to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to die there.</span> <span id="s1448">So it was extremely, constantly living with pain to see that everyday there is less and less.</span> <span id="s1449">And there was the son-day-commander (ph).</span> <span id="s1450">And the son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the involvement with gassing the people.</span> <span id="s1451">And I didn’t know it then but now, afterwards I found out, and almost I was in there.</span> <span id="s1452">I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never saw a gas chamber inside.</span> <span id="s1453">And what I, so we saw, I have photographs and I saw it by myself.</span> <span id="s1454">The process that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on gas, this was out completely of my experience both historically and privately.</span> <span id="s1455">I never heard this.</span> <span id="s1456">And not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . .[end of side 1 of tape 3]... You know, all the values, all the many beliefs that I've been taught and many things, I had to tell them everything.</span> <span id="s1457">It was not just the physically, but to tell them because I started to ask questions of myself.</span> <span id="s1458">I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschwitz, to gas chambers?</span> <span id="s1459">Imagine.</span> <span id="s1460">Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our traditions and everything, but a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol.</span> <span id="s1461">Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those who were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teeth, they put in gold teeth.</span> <span id="s1462">So when the people were dead, before they went in they cut their hair and this was used for German economy, it was for mattress stuffing and everything.</span> <span id="s1463">And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s1464">My parents didn't go to college, and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1465">But how did they live?</span> <span id="s1466">I started to compare the values.</span> <span id="s1467">And then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses, and every single thing they took away from every part of the body.</span> <span id="s1468">From the skin, lamp shades and everything.</span> <span id="s1469">So everything was, again, what is technology for?</span> <span id="s1470">And this is why, when I got out, I could no longer have the same values.</span> <span id="s1471">I had to tear down everything and to compare.</span> <span id="s1472">What did my parents teach me?</span> <span id="s1473">What did my grandmother teach me?</span> <span id="s1474">What does my religion teach me?</span> <span id="s1475">That the most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save the whole world.</span> <span id="s1476">And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely intelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree.</span> <span id="s1477">And yet she resisted.</span> <span id="s1478">She resisted both physically and spiritually.</span> <span id="s1479">She did not give up Cal-fus (ph).</span> <span id="s1480">And from one person that is now several generations of people.</span> <span id="s1481">Can you imagine how many generations would be if they wouldn't have killed the six million?</span> <span id="s1482">How many people?</span> <span id="s1483">And one Mengelia could do so much damage.</span> <span id="s1484">And that's when I started to realize, by going back.</span> <span id="s1485">Not everything that I reflect while being there.</span> <span id="s1486">Many things I reflected upon until this day.</span> <span id="s1487">And I started to say, so I realized something very important.</span> <span id="s1488">That four groups of people actually influenced my destiny.</span> <span id="s1489">Because the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish.</span> <span id="s1490">I did not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in the gas chambers, to be murdered.</span> <span id="s1491">They didn't die.</span> <span id="s1492">They didn't die.</span> <span id="s1493">They were murdered.</span> <span id="s1494">Those who starved of starvation, those who were killed or those from diseases, they were murdered because they put us in those conditions.</span> <span id="s1495">And everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror and by deception.</span> <span id="s1496">And this is why I start about honesty.</span> <span id="s1497">And then I started to realize, when I look back now, I realized also that there are some things you cannot buy without money but there are also some things we cannot buy for money.</span> <span id="s1498">And those are the things that I miss the most.</span> <span id="s1499">No money in the world can replace the six million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: I want to ask you some specific questions about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1501">You've told me quite a bit but I'd like to learn a little bit more about who the guards were?</span> <span id="s1502">How they treated you?</span> <span id="s1503">Who were the people you lived with?</span> <span id="s1504">Where were they from and did that keep changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Well in Auschwitz everything kept changing constantly.</span> <span id="s1506">Because people were dying very fast, okay?</span> <span id="s1507">And people were coming constantly.</span> <span id="s1508">So the turnover was very quick.</span> <span id="s1509">People came.</span> <span id="s1510">The people in Auschwitz, we were in the same barrack but as I told you, we could not speak each other's language.</span> <span id="s1511">Some could.</span> <span id="s1512">The people who spoke Yiddish came very handy for me.</span> <span id="s1513">Because in Europe not everybody, but those who came from religious homes, they could speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1514">So it, as far as the guard, the people in the barracks I couldn't speak with everybody, nor did I have the energy, nor was there enough time.</span> <span id="s1515">We came home, we were dead tired.</span> <span id="s1516">And once we gave us the piece of bread we were lucky that we could lay down our heads because before we knew it, it was morning again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: How many people slept on your bed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I think it was like about six people or something like this here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: In that one-third of the bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1521">And the bunks were so low you couldn't sit up.</span> <span id="s1522">You couldn't sit up.</span> <span id="s1523">And sometimes it happened that somebody died in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1524">Couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1525">The corpse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Were you aware, I mean at certain periods because you were there a long time, you were there two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: I was from 1942 to 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Yeah, the end of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: In November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1531">Were you aware of periods when there were less people there or all of a sudden there was a huge new transport coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Towards the end when they started to lose the war, there was more transport.</span> <span id="s1533">They were bringing more people.</span> <span id="s1534">It's like, it seemed to me from looking back now, that Hitler was determined to destroy everybody.</span> <span id="s1535">He was also determined that there shouldn't be any traces.</span> <span id="s1536">And another thing, which, see somebody would run away.</span> <span id="s1537">Everything is relevant to conditions I've learned.</span> <span id="s1538">For instance, if one girl would run away, there were a lot of obstacles.</span> <span id="s1539">The first obstacle was that if one would run away the others would stay in ________ until they found _______ of that, we all would be punished.</span> <span id="s1540">So those who had a conscious and who cared said, how can I save my life at the expense of others?</span> <span id="s1541">Secondly, they evacuated, Auschwitz was called before Oswiecim, it was a town.</span> <span id="s1542">In fact there is a survivor who is from Oswiecim.</span> <span id="s1543">That was her hometown.</span> <span id="s1544">So it was a town like any other towns in Poland.</span> <span id="s1545">So they cleared, they evacuated all the people from there because they didn't want to have witnesses.</span> <span id="s1546">Plus for miles and miles away there were no people so you couldn't hide.</span> <span id="s1547">And Auschwitz, Birkenau was the only concentration camp to my knowledge, but I don't know everything, so as far as I know until this day Birkenau was the only concentration camp where they made, they put on numbers.</span> <span id="s1548">So you had the numbers.</span> <span id="s1549">Your head was shaved.</span> <span id="s1550">You had no, you were wearing the clothes.</span> <span id="s1551">And the same number that you had on the arm was also put on the dress, shift.</span> <span id="s1552">Where could you go?</span> <span id="s1553">And there was barbed wires, guards, watch towers.</span> <span id="s1554">So it's one of the two, she would want to go to the barbed wires because, so two things happened.</span> <span id="s1555">Either you get electrocuted or you get shot from the guards.</span> <span id="s1556">So it was impossible almost to run away from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Did people try?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Not too many tried for the reason that I told you, because there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1559">Who would take you in?</span> <span id="s1560">Where would you go?</span> <span id="s1561">So not too many people.</span> <span id="s1562">Some people might have jumped the train, but I don't know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Were there many suicides?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Relatively very few.</span> <span id="s1565">That I am surprised.</span> <span id="s1566">Very few.</span> <span id="s1567">For me, its like, when I told you, at the point when Binna and I decided to accept it, I accepted her piece of bread but I also accepted what she offered more, her friendship.</span> <span id="s1568">At that point, I made a decision.</span> <span id="s1569">I will, first of all, of my upbringing, I told you what my, this here had a very great influence.</span> <span id="s1570">Plus I said, I will not collaborate in my own destruction.</span> <span id="s1571">I did everything to try to keep myself clean, to keep myself, under the conditions.</span> <span id="s1572">I even went through like the motions of washing myself just to feel and try to think, its ironic we were thinking, I remember that Binna and I was talking, said, if we're going to go out from here, once in my lifetime I want to still have a whole loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1573">That was my dreams.</span> <span id="s1574">Dreams change.</span> <span id="s1575">It was one of my dreams.</span> <span id="s1576">When I was, before the Holocaust, I was dreaming of getting a good formal education, become a writer.</span> <span id="s1577">When I was in Auschwitz, I was dreaming about once in my life, before I die, once to have the feeling of not going, my stomach should not turn from hunger, have cramps, hunger cramps.</span> <span id="s1578">And the other dream was still to be free.</span> <span id="s1579">To be able to walk once in my lifetime still without the guards walking with me, with the guns and having to march.</span> <span id="s1580">I-spy-dry-links (ph), I-spy-dry-links (ph), I still hear that in my head, the columns.</span> <span id="s1581">And to see people dying and suffering in a world of destruction when I was brought up to respect life.</span> <span id="s1582">This was, and another thing that we were naive, and I see now that its not so, is that whoever goes out, if I have one dress, just a clean dress and someplace to put my head I will not ask for anything more, but if I have a loaf of bread, a clean dress.</span> <span id="s1583">We wanted so little.</span> <span id="s1584">But we still have not faced reality then because in concentration camp, in Auschwitz, I was with other people.</span> <span id="s1585">And actually, even though the conditions were so horrible, somebody still took care, I still have someplace to, even that was the horrible conditions, but I had where to put my head down.</span> <span id="s1586">And even though there was so little, hardly enough to get through the day, food, I still had somebody.</span> <span id="s1587">So after age 13 I was never on my own.</span> <span id="s1588">I never, I was protective, loving environment.</span> <span id="s1589">Here completely alone except for Binna, which became my friend from, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1590">I didn't know her from before.</span> <span id="s1591">And then, to go out in the world, I didn't face it because at that time all we had, all we were thinking about is of surviving.</span> <span id="s1592">Of having the things, the things that I want.</span> <span id="s1593">So at that time I wasn't thinking of other things.</span> <span id="s1594">It's not until I came out __________ that everything hit me.</span> <span id="s1595">And so we were in Auschwitz and with all this here, constantly dead around us.</span> <span id="s1596">No separation between life and death.</span> <span id="s1597">The dead people were not buried there.</span> <span id="s1598">They put them, they took them in, they had like a little wagon and they would pull them away.</span> <span id="s1599">And if somebody died when we were at work or was killed, we had to carry them back to the concentration camp to be counted, because we knew we are accountable.</span> <span id="s1600">They made us responsible, one for the other.</span> <span id="s1601">And this was going on for years.</span> <span id="s1602">And not having, loneliness, cold, starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: You had to carry bodies, you personally carried bodies back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: I personally was fortunate that I didn't have to, but there were many times that our commanders, you know, it was a commander, you were assigned to a specific group, we had to carry home, somebody was killed or died on the way, we had to carry them home.</span> <span id="s1605">Dead or alive they had to be accounted for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Do you remember other things that you and your friend talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: We was talking about how, that when we going to get out we are going to be grateful.</span> <span id="s1608">And you know, I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1609">You know, intuition has nothing to do with logic, right?</span> <span id="s1610">But you know, I once read that the heart knows of the reason, that reason doesn't know heart.</span> <span id="s1611">But actually, one time, its like, I don't know, it was not at night, its not what I was dreaming.</span> <span id="s1612">Its just like a, its like a vision that I see that I am free and people are standing around me and asking me what the number is.</span> <span id="s1613">I didn't know whether the outside world knows.</span> <span id="s1614">I didn't know at all what it was.</span> <span id="s1615">I was isolated.</span> <span id="s1616">Imagine, in older years, not only did they take away everything from me but they stole three, six years, nearly six years of my life.</span> <span id="s1617">They stole the chance of education.</span> <span id="s1618">They stole the chance, I never could go to proms, to dates.</span> <span id="s1619">So from one thing to the other.</span> <span id="s1620">And still they didn't finish in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1621">In 1945, it was January 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Okay, but I want to still ask you a few more questions before we move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: When it started getting, more transports would come in.</span> <span id="s1625">Did the conditions get worse or did they stay pretty much the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: The condition got constantly worse for me because I became weaker.</span> <span id="s1627">My body was almost like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s1628">And the longer you suffer the harder it gets.</span> <span id="s1629">And to see the constant destruction.</span> <span id="s1630">Because I, I cannot praise myself and say, but I had, it was helping me to see the people suffer.</span> <span id="s1631">It is helping me when I see that, I wanted to help somebody.</span> <span id="s1632">They didn't allow us to help each other.</span> <span id="s1633">We had to do it in hiding.</span> <span id="s1634">Let's say if somebody fell and you were to lift up and to help you got beaten.</span> <span id="s1635">Sometimes you both could get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: So you got weaker but you didn't get less food or treated worse or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Well personally it didn't change that much, but the only thing is that there was more, the transport was so constantly, the smoke coming and the music playing.</span> <span id="s1638">And more people, we lost more people.</span> <span id="s1639">So that was the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Did the music playing when you went in and out of work too?</span> <span id="s1641">When you left for work every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Basically the music plays mostly when a new transport came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Did you pass by or did you live near the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: I have, I was never in the building where the crematorium because if I would be there I wouldn't be here speaking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: No, I'm saying were you nearby there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: No, not so near.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: So you didn't see the people being taken there, that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: No.</span> <span id="s1649">Even my own family.</span> <span id="s1650">When they took away, I just saw them taking them on the trucks, but I didn't see them taking this here.</span> <span id="s1651">But what they did with them and the conditions there, this I found out afterwards.</span> <span id="s1652">I also found out that the people who worked in the crematorium, every three months they would gas them too.</span> <span id="s1653">Because they were most anxious that nobody should know.</span> <span id="s1654">They wanted to wipe out every trace of the crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Who were the guards?</span> <span id="s1656">Who were your guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: I didn’t know them personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Were they Germans?</span> <span id="s1659">Were they Polish?</span> <span id="s1660">Were there Jewish guards too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: No.</span> <span id="s1662">No Jewish guards.</span> <span id="s1663">Mostly I heard German.</span> <span id="s1664">There was also like somebody who watched over us.</span> <span id="s1665">We were watched constantly.</span> <span id="s1666">Back breaking labor, which was not useful, starvation, isolation, all those things you know, any, this is why if there is a plague we experienced it.</span> <span id="s1667">If there is a plague we experienced this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: So your guards and the work commandos.</span> <span id="s1669">Your __________, all of these people you really didn't have any contact with, other than them watching you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Were they mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: The guards were terribly mean because if you for one second to stop to say something you got beaten.</span> <span id="s1673">If you wanted to help somebody you could get beaten or shot.</span> <span id="s1674">They teased us, they mocked us deliberately.</span> <span id="s1675">You know, and constantly lived under the fear that you can be taken away.</span> <span id="s1676">The fear of getting sick.</span> <span id="s1677">So constantly.</span> <span id="s1678">And then after a while if you, like I made up my mind, live or die.</span> <span id="s1679">Because everybody has to die.</span> <span id="s1680">But it was important to, I was grateful each day I __________ they did not assign me some kind of duties or things to do which would dehumanize me really.</span> <span id="s1681">Because what they said about the dead didn't dehumanize me.</span> <span id="s1682">That dehumanized them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: What about corruption?</span> <span id="s1684">Were you aware of other prisoners trying to get stuff or being able to kind of manipulate the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: From whom to get stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">W: From whom ever they could get, I don't know, guards or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: The thing is, the guards, those who were there were already sadistic and cruel, otherwise they wouldn't be there.</span> <span id="s1688">And with the guards we couldn't, I told you from the beginning, it was ____________, they, we were, the dogs.</span> <span id="s1689">A dog should also be treated with respect because everything that God created should, but the dogs had better than we had.</span> <span id="s1690">They loved all their dogs.</span> <span id="s1691">Sometimes they would let their dogs bite some people.</span> <span id="s1692">And a lot of mockery.</span> <span id="s1693">That I felt, okay, they say that they had to carry out their duty.</span> <span id="s1694">But they really didn't.</span> <span id="s1695">They could resist.</span> <span id="s1696">They could say no.</span> <span id="s1697">They couldn't maybe, when Hitler became so powerful, but they could have done that in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1698">My mother risks my life and hers and she wouldn't do because she would rather have died than to turn in another person and to survive on somebody else's expense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Were all the prisoners in your block Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1701">Only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1702">In our barracks were only Jewish.</span> <span id="s1703">I didn't have contact with non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1704">I didn’t have any contact, there was no men.</span> <span id="s1705">The men were separated.</span> <span id="s1706">In all those years that I, in all the time I was there the only people that I saw is Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: You came from a very loving family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: A very affectionate, loving family.</span> <span id="s1710">Were you able to recreate some of that warmth and affection with your friend there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1712">We were very, very nice to each other.</span> <span id="s1713">We tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s1714">Like I said, we would share, when she had her worse day she would give me a little of her food and we always tried to encourage, not to give up.</span> <span id="s1715">We used to say, and we spoke always Yiddish with each other, and I used to say to her, "They want to kill us.</span> <span id="s1716">We must not help them."</span> <span id="s1717">We really make a conscious effort.</span> <span id="s1718">Physically I had no choice because they could take us away anytime.</span> <span id="s1719">They didn't need a reason.</span> <span id="s1720">They had complete control of our lives.</span> <span id="s1721">But at least we tried not to destroy, we tried to encourage each other.</span> <span id="s1722">Maybe tomorrow something will happen.</span> <span id="s1723">_______________.</span> <span id="s1724">And I didn't realize it but I must have had always a very deep faith, very deep faith.</span> <span id="s1725">I'll tell you something, which is not, it didn't happen then . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Let me just, I just want to finish this.</span> <span id="s1727">As I'm trying to get a sense of how all of the prisoners related to each other, the, you mostly related to this one girl?</span> <span id="s1728">The older people didn't try to take care of the younger people or any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: There wasn't so many older . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Well, but there were people older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Yes, there were people older.</span> <span id="s1732">No.</span> <span id="s1733">People were helpful to each other because we knew that we are, we share the same circumstances, the same destiny.</span> <span id="s1734">There were, I talk mostly about Binna because I was closest with her.</span> <span id="s1735">With her I become, we shared such a traumatic, such an extreme experience.</span> <span id="s1736">And that's when you really get to know people.</span> <span id="s1737">That's where the weaknesses, and when I saw the contrast of Esther to her.</span> <span id="s1738">With Esther I never hounded, I never, I wish if she is alive until today, I don’t even hold that against her because under those circumstances not everybody was strong, to resist.</span> <span id="s1739">But the point it, she didn't want to do me harm, she just couldn't resist the hunger so I, this was my only experience where somebody from the girls were mean to me.</span> <span id="s1740">I never suffered any cruelties from the Jewish girls there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Did you share physical affection?</span> <span id="s1742">I don’t mean necessarily sexual, but just that sort of warmth that people need from each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: There wasn't too much of this here.</span> <span id="s1744">We were dirty, we were cold, we were tired constantly.</span> <span id="s1745">On the job you were this, but I could feel for instance that Binna cared for me.</span> <span id="s1746">Because as I went to the gate, we were going to go through the gate, and when she knows that they always looked how you look, not that they needed __________ because they took away my family and they were Nazi, so she would say, "Yit-cola (ph), you are pale."</span> <span id="s1747">She pinched my cheeks.</span> <span id="s1748">I would do the same for her.</span> <span id="s1749">If we stood in the pen or where we stood, she said, "Get into this light."</span> <span id="s1750">She was three years older than I, so it was like, in fact, after the liberation when we were together some people said, "Well, she's acting like she's your mother."</span> <span id="s1751">She just felt about me like I'm her younger sister.</span> <span id="s1752">But affection, hugging, kissing?</span> <span id="s1753">There was not, no, there was not affection.</span> <span id="s1754">You feel, you don’t have just __________, okay, physical affection is very important because at home I could not walk by my parents or my grandmother without a hug and a kiss.</span> <span id="s1755">But this was not the place, it was not the time.</span> <span id="s1756">If you would see, we were so thin, so skeletal, so dirty, so lonely, so terrible, so full of pain, that those things wasn't even on the mind.</span> <span id="s1757">You know, the hug.</span> <span id="s1758">It wasn't because we hug each other, there was not, you came home from work.</span> <span id="s1759">I don't remember it, special hugging each other.</span> <span id="s1760">The only time was like if one of us broke down, the other would embrace and say, try to comfort and say, especially like this.</span> <span id="s1761">No, I felt deprived and I missed this a lot because I was always an affectionate person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: That's why I was asking you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Yes, I missed it terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Were you at all aware of when Jewish holidays were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Did you have much information about the rest, what was going on in the rest of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1768">Very isolated, not knowing what, just this world.</span> <span id="s1769">Getting cup, coming to the barrack, waiting, and by the time you got your piece, little food, and everything and the _________ finished, especially in the cold, you were so glad, you were so tired that you laid down.</span> <span id="s1770">Sometimes you were too tired to talk even.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: When you first got there, were there prisoners who had been there longer who would give you advice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: When I came in the beginning, I described to you the conditions.</span> <span id="s1773">I was very, very down, very worried to what's happened to my family.</span> <span id="s1774">But when I found out I was so, felt betrayed, I felt shocked, I felt grieved, I felt so many emotions.</span> <span id="s1775">And I was just, I don't know if it wouldn't be for Binna, whether I would have even survived.</span> <span id="s1776">Just knowing that we need each other for support, that she is already an orphan and alone.</span> <span id="s1777">And you can't imagine how many times I told her about the story, Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span> <span id="s1778">Because I remember that, when my mother finished reading this story and I asked her, I'll never forget this, and I said, "How could Buncho (ph) the Silent endure so much suffering and pain?"</span> <span id="s1779">And my mother answered me, "My child, sometimes are many stronger than iron and other times we can't enough lie, but no one knows their own strength until they are ever tested."</span> <span id="s1780">And that's when I found out, if somebody would tell me, this I remember this thing.</span> <span id="s1781">That the very first time when I came and I saw the conditions, I saw everything.</span> <span id="s1782">And for the first time I was isolated from my family, I said to myself, at that time I was not in contact with anybody yet, I'm not going to survive here one day.</span> <span id="s1783">And you know something?</span> <span id="s1784">It was ironic.</span> <span id="s1785">When I went on the March of the Living, there was a girl and the first day she said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), I'm not going to make it."</span> <span id="s1786">And I said, "Survivors don't give up, honey."</span> <span id="s1787">And I told her, that when I was in concentration camp, that I'm not going to make it, and I made it.</span> <span id="s1788">You're going to make it, I'm going to help you.</span> <span id="s1789">And she called me, you know, what kind of award I got.</span> <span id="s1790">It was funny.</span> <span id="s1791">At the end, when we were going already from the airport to Philadelphia, two kids who were very creative, they observed everyone.</span> <span id="s1792">So somebody, they took a napkin and they tore it in pieces and they wrote down, one got the award for the best dancer, one for the best whatever, and I got the Bobbie (ph) award.</span> <span id="s1793">I was to them the Bobbie (ph), the grandmother.</span> <span id="s1794">And she even introduced me to her father by saying, "Yit-cola's (ph) my adopted grandmother."</span> <span id="s1795">And all the kids say, I'm like a Bobbie (ph) to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Did you toward the end do different work assignments or did you stay mostly on that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: No.</span> <span id="s1798">Toward the end of it almost, toward the end of 1944 I got a lucky stroke.</span> <span id="s1799">I was given a job to the ___________, the __________ they called it, the _____________.</span> <span id="s1800">_________ they were called because we were wearing red kerchiefs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: How did you get this assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Just was lucky.</span> <span id="s1803">Somebody must have died or something or maybe they needed more.</span> <span id="s1804">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1805">But one day, instead of taking me out, they took me to the commander.</span> <span id="s1806">And that was, I wish it would have happened earlier then I would not have lost so much weight and so much suffering.</span> <span id="s1807">Because this was better, for several reasons.</span> <span id="s1808">First of all, you didn't have to work outside.</span> <span id="s1809">The outside work was a killer.</span> <span id="s1810">Many, many people died.</span> <span id="s1811">I was young and maybe that helped me to survive, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1812">But anyhow, in the ____________ we would go, we work inside.</span> <span id="s1813">Our work consisted of selecting, you know the people who arrived they took away everything from them.</span> <span id="s1814">It came from the, and all the bundles were brought to the _____________, they called it.</span> <span id="s1815">Why they called it Canada (ph) I cannot tell you, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1816">But this is what it was called.</span> <span id="s1817">And my job, and the jobs of those who were there, was to take apart the bundles and to select and to put in bundles the towels with towels, and all this went to Germans for their economy.</span> <span id="s1818">Everything that was ours became theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Was it strange going through other people's belongings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: It was very strange.</span> <span id="s1821">But we had no choice.</span> <span id="s1822">We had to obey orders.</span> <span id="s1823">At least, it was not hurting people.</span> <span id="s1824">Those were things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">End of Tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: You were telling me about the work commando at Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1829">In Canada we had to work also every day.</span> <span id="s1830">My work consisted, and everybody's work actually consisted, we took apart the bundles and we had to select them.</span> <span id="s1831">Put each item of the same kind in bundles and in places.</span> <span id="s1832">Now, let me start with the advantage for me.</span> <span id="s1833">The advantage was that I didn't have to work outside.</span> <span id="s1834">I was shielded a little from the cold and from the heat.</span> <span id="s1835">The work was easier than it was to drag the stones and everything else.</span> <span id="s1836">And also I couldn't take anything from there but there were Nazis that were watching us too.</span> <span id="s1837">But what I could do, occasionally but not always, nobody could see.</span> <span id="s1838">Let's say if I found a piece of bread, I couldn't take it out but I could take a piece of it and eat it.</span> <span id="s1839">So that provided a little extra food for me.</span> <span id="s1840">Then there was something that they did that if it wouldn't be for what my mother taught me, that my ___________ does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, I would feel ashamed to tell this here.</span> <span id="s1841">It's just like a woman who is raped, and it doesn't have a good self and she doesn't understand that it’s the victimizer not the victim who is suppose to feel ashamed, then I would feel ashamed to tell you this here.</span> <span id="s1842">But I don't.</span> <span id="s1843">I feel pained.</span> <span id="s1844">When we were leaving, every single day, the most humiliating, the most painful thing, they would search us internally so we wouldn't smuggle out any diamonds, any gold, because sometimes you did find those things there.</span> <span id="s1845">So we couldn't take out anything.</span> <span id="s1846">And that was so humiliating for me.</span> <span id="s1847">A girl who was modest, who wouldn't even undress in front of her parents.</span> <span id="s1848">And you know I was like a budding teen-ager when the Holocaust begun.</span> <span id="s1849">And here, to go through, that sometimes I wish I would have still walked in the outside commando because each time they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches.</span> <span id="s1850">It was so humiliating and so disgusting to have these Nazis to search me.</span> <span id="s1851">So as far as this, if you heard stories that somebody smuggled out, that's not true.</span> <span id="s1852">_________, maybe they didn't tell you, but they searched us.</span> <span id="s1853">They searched us every inch, all over, even internally so what, how can you smuggle something out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Were you searched by men or women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Sometimes were men, sometimes women.</span> <span id="s1856">It was not, and either way it was disgusting, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1857">I feel, I cannot tell you how much, how I felt.</span> <span id="s1858">Because I was never, until I came to _____________ I never had a internal examination.</span> <span id="s1859">And this was my experience, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1860">And also the horrible thing was to see, to know that, seeing all the things from some families brought beautiful things because they were not in ghetto, they came in and many people were rich.</span> <span id="s1861">And knowing that the people are dead and that these clothes are going to go away for the German economy, that for the Jewish children who were wearing the clothes, Jewish mothers and fathers and grandfathers.</span> <span id="s1862">I shed plenty of tears.</span> <span id="s1863">The only advantage was that I was warm and had a little bit of extra food.</span> <span id="s1864">That was the only advantage of this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: So in your two years plus in Auschwitz, basically you had this job and you had that outside work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: That's all.</span> <span id="s1867">It started physically and emotionally and spiritually in every single way.</span> <span id="s1868">That's why I related to you the story about going to ___________ because I thought, how could a writer stand so much suffering and abuse, and I don't know ________ because at that time, it was almost like it felt, why was Buncho (ph) the Silent silent, why didn't he say something?</span> <span id="s1869">But I had to find out that I had to be silent to survive because even when they called me number, tried to reduce me to a number, I couldn't say loudly or anything, but under my breath I said, Yit-cola (ph).</span> <span id="s1870">You know what I called my number?</span> <span id="s1871">My badge of honor.</span> <span id="s1872">And somebody asked me once, a reporter, why do you call it your badge of honor?</span> <span id="s1873">And I told him.</span> <span id="s1874">I got the number merely for being born Jewish.</span> <span id="s1875">To be born Jewish or Gentile is not a choice, but to murder people because they are different, because they are Jewish or Gentile and because somebody gets a crazy idea that somebody is superior to somebody else, which is a figment of Hitler's imagination, then this is something which made me even more proud to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Toward the end, did you have a sense that you might get out of there?</span> <span id="s1877">That the war was shifting, that there was a possibility you would be free?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: I had no, I didn't have any knowledge what was going outside.</span> <span id="s1879">There was no paper, no ______ of communication, no meeting with anybody else.</span> <span id="s1880">I didn't have any contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: No rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: No rumors.</span> <span id="s1883">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1884">I didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s1885">I don't know, it seemed to me like all I did was work, come home, just waited.</span> <span id="s1886">Couldn't wait to get, to lay down, to put down your head, it was so exhausted and cold.</span> <span id="s1887">And sometimes, you know what was our, but that was not done deliberately, we slept so many on one bunk bed.</span> <span id="s1888">So out of necessity of the overcrowdedness we slept on the side like I told you, close one another.</span> <span id="s1889">So that was our, you know body gives out heat too.</span> <span id="s1890">So we had one blanket, everybody was pulling in different direction.</span> <span id="s1891">So laying, whoever was lucky was laying in the middle, felt less cold.</span> <span id="s1892">So it was not, its an existence, not knowing.</span> <span id="s1893">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1894">All those years, not having the things which you take for granted.</span> <span id="s1895">Like a piece of toilet tissue?</span> <span id="s1896">How degrading.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: So you had no idea what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: I didn't know anything what was going on.</span> <span id="s1899">I was living, each day was the same from day to day.</span> <span id="s1900">Just knew inwardly, emotionally, spiritually that I need to hold on.</span> <span id="s1901">But that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: And by saying that, I need to hold on, there obviously was some hope that you would get through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s1904">But you know what?</span> <span id="s1905">I remembered the upbringing I had, that we never, we don't give up hope.</span> <span id="s1906">We don't give up hope.</span> <span id="s1907">In fact, I remember saying, from my family, ___________ ______________, which means as long as one vein is still moving there is hope.</span> <span id="s1908">So we were hoping.</span> <span id="s1909">I had even after the Holocaust situations where everybody gave up hope.</span> <span id="s1910">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1911">I'm not this kind of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: So how did you happen to leave Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: I didn't, again, I didn't make any choice.</span> <span id="s1914">In Auschwitz, the only choice I made is, you cannot always pick circumstances but you can pick responses.</span> <span id="s1915">So the only choice I made, to live or to die, with dignity, with Menschlichkeit, and to hold on as long as I can.</span> <span id="s1916">So I didn't make any choice, but one morning we woke up and I didn't even know what's happened.</span> <span id="s1917">We didn't have the ______________.</span> <span id="s1918">They started to chase us out.</span> <span id="s1919">And we started on the death march.</span> <span id="s1920">And that was the most horrible thing because you survive for so long and here we had to march because the Nazis wanted to make sure that we should not get into the hands of the Russians.</span> <span id="s1921">They wanted, they blew up some, I didn't see them do that, but later I was, now I know how many things they blew up.</span> <span id="s1922">They tried to destroy all the evidence of the crimes that they committed.</span> <span id="s1923">So we had to march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: What did they say to you?</span> <span id="s1925">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: They didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1927">They said, "Just go.</span> <span id="s1928">Go."</span> <span id="s1929">And what happened, and we even in concentration camp we were not allowed ultimately to help each other, in their presence.</span> <span id="s1930">But here was even worse.</span> <span id="s1931">Because if one, we had to walk.</span> <span id="s1932">It was, imagine Poland is very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1933">We were now in April and it was still pretty cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1936">I was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: The march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: No, the march of the living was in January but when I was now in Auschwitz, when I went to visit now . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1940">But I'm talking about, I'm confusing this.</span> <span id="s1941">Let's stay with 1945 because it's getting confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1943">I'm just trying to tell you the truth, very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: It was in January?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: In January, January 18th we were chased out.</span> <span id="s1946">I didn't know at the time if everybody was left or not because there was no time to find out.</span> <span id="s1947">And what they did or didn't do, once I wasn't there I couldn't see.</span> <span id="s1948">But we had to march on foot.</span> <span id="s1949">If you stopped, if you fell, they shot you.</span> <span id="s1950">If somebody fell or couldn't go you were not allowed to help them.</span> <span id="s1951">So many people, there were plenty people who I saw on the way who was laying dead.</span> <span id="s1952">And we could not do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1953">This is the most, this probably, besides my own experience from my own suffering, this was the most horrible thing for me.</span> <span id="s1954">To be human and not to be able to help another human being, if somebody falls.</span> <span id="s1955">Lived for so many years and then in that way to die?</span> <span id="s1956">A lot of people died on the way.</span> <span id="s1957">A lot of people died on the way.</span> <span id="s1958">And we started to march on January 18, 1945 and we came to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s1959">I'm thinking ___________, I wrote down the date someplace.</span> <span id="s1960">It escapes me now because I'm so, I'm going to give you the dates I wrote it down but not right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: January 24?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: I think.</span> <span id="s1963">Six day march, after six days, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Were there people from a lot of different barracks or was it just your group on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: There was lots of people.</span> <span id="s1966">I don't know whether the whole camp or not because I don't know, what the case was.</span> <span id="s1967">But there was, you could see like marching very, very long.</span> <span id="s1968">And not until we were almost German, and then they took us to this, to Revensbruck.</span> <span id="s1969">We arrived to Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1971">On the march, did they give you any food?</span> <span id="s1972">Did you stay someplace at night?</span> <span id="s1973">Did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: We had to walk.</span> <span id="s1975">Walk and walk.</span> <span id="s1976">Not until we were already on the German soil, and I don't know exactly what spot it was, then there was like some trucks that picked us up.</span> <span id="s1977">And on the truck on the way we fell asleep, standing, sitting, in anyplace.</span> <span id="s1978">But while you walked you had to stay alive and to be silent, to be Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Did they give you any bread or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Not while we were walking.</span> <span id="s1981">Some people had a little piece, people died of thirst, of cold.</span> <span id="s1982">It was so cold and with the clogs, with the frozen feet.</span> <span id="s1983">And by that time we were skeletons.</span> <span id="s1984">Most of us was more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s1985">If it would take a little longer we probably would not have made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Was it all women on the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: I marched with all women.</span> <span id="s1988">Maybe there were men too but when they chased us out of the camp from the rest it was, I mostly saw women.</span> <span id="s1989">Maybe men came too but when they took us out we were all women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: And you were with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1992">Fortunately she made the march.</span> <span id="s1993">And then we came to Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Oh I know, there was one other question I did want to ask you.</span> <span id="s1995">As you were marching did you notice any of the local people along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: I didn't notice anything.</span> <span id="s1997">I was just having one thing in mind, the only thing I looked if Binna is still walking with me.</span> <span id="s1998">That was my concern and if they other girls, if nobody is, and I knew with the last strength, I don't know with what strength I, I remembered my mother's words, "Sometimes a man is stronger than I am."</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: I just wondered if people saw you marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: This I don't know.</span> <span id="s2001">I was too involved, to make sure that I can make it, you know, when you went so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: So what happened when you arrived at Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: We arrived at Ravensbruck, that's a date that I also wrote but right now I'm so upset, when I'm thinking about this Canada, the ___________, the search.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: I think you've said that you were there about two to three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2006">I think February 24 I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: January 24 to February 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: February 11th, right.</span> <span id="s2009">January 18th we were chased and then we came six days later, the six-day march, and then we came in February 11th.</span> <span id="s2010">And there was also, this was the only concentration camp, death camp, on German soil that has also gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: And you were there for two or three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: What was it like?</span> <span id="s2017">Same kind of suffering, same kind of suffering still.</span> <span id="s2018">They still didn't let go.</span> <span id="s2019">And I made a stew and Esther dead.</span> <span id="s2020">They took us, this time we didn't have to walk already, they took us with trucks.</span> <span id="s2021">And they brought us to another concentration camp in Malchow, Germany.</span> <span id="s2022">In the Malchow, Germany they had no gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: You didn't work in Ravensbruck did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s2025">It was not a long time.</span> <span id="s2026">It was already confusion.</span> <span id="s2027">Did some work but it was not already as extensive as it was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: So in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: We did work but, yes we did work.</span> <span id="s2030">I'm trying to think because I know I worked in an ammunition factory, but that was in Malchow.</span> <span id="s2031">Because I remember we sabotaged a lot of the things there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: So, in Ravensbruck during the day . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: We did work.</span> <span id="s2034">I don't remember exactly what type of work we did there.</span> <span id="s2035">To an ammunition factory or something.</span> <span id="s2036">There was not any Canada or anything like this here anymore.</span> <span id="s2037">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2038">I don't have that many because Auschwitz, other towers, everything ___________, this is why I, the others is, but I know that there was crematoriums.</span> <span id="s2039">I was less shielded.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Do you remember any striking differences between Ravensbruck and Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: It wasn't as huge.</span> <span id="s2042">I didn't hear the orchestra playing so that was the, and there wasn't so many people.</span> <span id="s2043">And I didn't stay so long so there I have, when I speak even though I was there but I must not speak of Auschwitz because that's where, it was the last day when I came with family, that was the last day on earth for my entire family.</span> <span id="s2044">Thousands of Jews from the ghetto Nove Mesto including my friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s2045">And the first day of ______________, that's why Auschwitz was the worst of it, Birkenau, that was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Well of course, and you also were there much longer.</span> <span id="s2047">I was just trying to get a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Yes, we did work but I don't, I remember that after that, after Auschwitz, I no longer worked on the outside commando.</span> <span id="s2049">So it must either an ammunition factory or something.</span> <span id="s2050">To be very honest with you I don't remember because I didn't stay that long there.</span> <span id="s2051">But I know that there was gas chambers and I know they wouldn't just sit and not do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: And the people, the other prisoners who were there when you arrived, they looked pretty much like the people at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2053">They were thin and sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Not everybody, not everybody because it depended on the length of time.</span> <span id="s2055">That had a lot to do, it depended on the physical strength of a person.</span> <span id="s2056">Some were, not just _______ people but they were fortunate they didn't get sick because if you got sick it's the end.</span> <span id="s2057">I don't remember Ravensbruk (ph) in as many details but I know it was, the people there was more Polish people in Ravensbruk (ph).</span> <span id="s2058">A lot of Polish people and some were a little older too.</span> <span id="s2059">So it seems like they allowed older people maybe more there to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: So then they took you to Malchow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: And they took and brought me to Malchow.</span> <span id="s2062">And I came there with Binna too.</span> <span id="s2063">And there, to my recollection, there was no gas chambers anymore.</span> <span id="s2064">We still were treated badly, we still had little food.</span> <span id="s2065">The only good better thing was, and we went every day to work, and the conditions were horrible.</span> <span id="s2066">The only better thing was for me personally, for Binna, that we didn't work outside.</span> <span id="s2067">Because outside, winter or summer, without clothes, the proper clothes without.</span> <span id="s2068">That was, and we worked inside and we, there I remember exactly what, an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s2069">And I know that they gonna use this ammunition maybe against us or other people so whenever we could sabotage something we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: How?</span> <span id="s2072">You know, like if you’re suppose to put it on this way you put it in the opposite.</span> <span id="s2073">I didn't have any tools or anything to sabotage it but not to do it.</span> <span id="s2074">And if you could work slower we worked slower, you know, the productions.</span> <span id="s2075">And we knew, whatever we can we didn't want to do to help the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2076">To help them to succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Was anybody, of the prisoners, kind of organizing this?</span> <span id="s2078">Sort of advising people what to do?</span> <span id="s2079">Or you just thought this up on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: With what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: With the sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: That was a pretty veiled conception.</span> <span id="s2083">We all wanted all the time but what could we do?</span> <span id="s2084">We couldn't.</span> <span id="s2085">In Auschwitz I couldn't, what could I sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: But here did people talk about it?</span> <span id="s2087">Did they, when you were new there did people who were already there make suggestions or you just figured it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Some word would get out and some we saw other people doing it.</span> <span id="s2089">It was not discussed, we were afraid to talk.</span> <span id="s2090">You know, somebody, you never knew who can hear us or something.</span> <span id="s2091">But we saw that whenever we could, not to do properly or something, then we did it.</span> <span id="s2092">If it would be, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2093">Knowing myself, I don't know, if I had opportunity to damage the Nazis, that I don't know if I could do.</span> <span id="s2094">But the things that helped them to kill people, that I did with good conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: And enjoyed doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost felt like a responsibility.</span> <span id="s2097">It felt that, they used everything for destruction, you know?</span> <span id="s2098">People can be creators or destroyers of life.</span> <span id="s2099">Everything can be used for good and evil.</span> <span id="s2100">That is the education, I was dreaming about a formal education but I tell you, there is no substitute for personal experience.</span> <span id="s2101">And what this experience in the concentration camp taught me no professor, no text books, no school could teach me.</span> <span id="s2102">Because there you had the consequences of your action.</span> <span id="s2103">When, learning, book learning is important but it doesn't have consequences.</span> <span id="s2104">It's not the same thing.</span> <span id="s2105">It's one thing to read about slavery than being a slave.</span> <span id="s2106">It's one thing about losing, if somebody lost a family, than losing your own.</span> <span id="s2107">Same thing about suffering, about believing from that my ancestors were in Egypt, its different when you go _________ on yours.</span> <span id="s2108">Then you know.</span> <span id="s2109">And then something happens inside you.</span> <span id="s2110">Depending on your attitude.</span> <span id="s2111">You become either bitter or better.</span> <span id="s2112">My mother's last words were not to become bitter and hateful and not to let them destroy, and I realize this now.</span> <span id="s2113">That hate is the most destructive thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: What else can you tell me about Malchow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Well I can tell that Malchow?</span> <span id="s2116">I just felt everyday, everyday was like you want another lease on life.</span> <span id="s2117">I know that the worse the condition got the longer it took.</span> <span id="s2118">We tried to encourage each other again, maybe tomorrow, don't give up, hold on.</span> <span id="s2119">That was like a ___________, don't give up.</span> <span id="s2120">Don't give them the victory, don't give them the final victory.</span> <span id="s2121">And we just went, we knew we were trapped and we were hoping for a miracle.</span> <span id="s2122">And not knowing if its going to happen.</span> <span id="s2123">It just went on.</span> <span id="s2124">Worked and another day, another day, not knowing what's going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Now at this point did you have a little bit more information about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: We didn't have contacts with anyone.</span> <span id="s2129">From 1942, until I came to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2130">Actually from the ghettos we knew nothing, until I came to the ghetto, before the ghetto I could still hear rumors or something but nobody, we didn't have, who could tell us?</span> <span id="s2131">The only people that we saw when I was in concentration camp is the inmates and the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: I just figured that maybe at this point you might have some sense that you had been moved into Germany . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: No I didn't because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2134">Because, I had been told not to build, not to assume.</span> <span id="s2135">An assumption is different from a fact.</span> <span id="s2136">So I didn’t know, so I didn't make any assumption.</span> <span id="s2137">I just hoped and prayed and tried to hold on for as long as I could.</span> <span id="s2138">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: I was there until I was liberated on, during Passover, April 26, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: What happened?</span> <span id="s2143">That's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s2144">I woke up one morning.</span> <span id="s2145">No __________.</span> <span id="s2146">Commotion.</span> <span id="s2147">And then the Swedish Red Cross came to save us.</span> <span id="s2148">Not everybody.</span> <span id="s2149">They took out mostly those who were sick and by that time I was pretty sick.</span> <span id="s2150">And Binna and I, and a few other people, there was a girl, Franya Gilman (ph), she was also on our truck.</span> <span id="s2151">And ironically, being deceived by the Nazis about this, Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2152">When I saw this Red Cross I was afraid to go up.</span> <span id="s2153">But you know, people convey messages by words, by their emotion, by their body language.</span> <span id="s2154">And those people didn't seem like Nazis.</span> <span id="s2155">First of all, they didn't wear the uniforms.</span> <span id="s2156">And I felt that this is not, but at first there was fear to go up.</span> <span id="s2157">But, so they took us on the trucks.</span> <span id="s2158">From on the date that I gave you and the war was still going on because it didn't finish officially.</span> <span id="s2159">So a bomb, a part of a bomb fell in our truck and it hit Franya Gilman (ph) and Franya Gilman (ph) had to have her foot amputated.</span> <span id="s2160">That was already toward the end, on the way.</span> <span id="s2161">And from there we traveled from Germany to via Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: I want to ask you a question before you continue.</span> <span id="s2163">When you say you saw the Swedish Red Cross, where were the Nazi guards?</span> <span id="s2164">Where were the Germans at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: I didn't see the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2166">I don't know what's happened to them.</span> <span id="s2167">I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s2168">All of a sudden I didn't see, in the commotion, we didn't know, something _____________.</span> <span id="s2169">And frankly I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s2170">I didn't know if I should be happy or should be unhappy, I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s2171">But then they came and they helped me.</span> <span id="s2172">By that time I was pretty sick.</span> <span id="s2173">And they helped me to come to a truck, they helped me up.</span> <span id="s2174">And we came to, we traveled.</span> <span id="s2175">It took a whole day.</span> <span id="s2176">At night I remember we were in a barn, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Did you take a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2179">By bus.</span> <span id="s2180">Not bus, by trucks.</span> <span id="s2181">Trucks also.</span> <span id="s2182">But not such a, not with Nazis anymore.</span> <span id="s2183">And I didn't know what to think, I felt sick and I didn't know already but I saw from the way they touched us because the Nazis never would touch us because we were full of lice and ________________.</span> <span id="s2184">And those people seemed to be kind and we came Denmark.</span> <span id="s2185">So we stayed over night in a barn.</span> <span id="s2186">And after that they brought us to Lund, Sweden.</span> <span id="s2187">A university city, to a hospital.</span> <span id="s2188">And I was alive but I had no home to live in so the hospital, they gave me my first home after liberation.</span> <span id="s2189">But before we went in we had to strip again, naked, throw away the tattered concentration camp shift, and we got a bed.</span> <span id="s2190">And after all those years, nearly six years, I saw myself in front of the mirror.</span> <span id="s2191">I couldn't speak a lot of Swedish, or understand.</span> <span id="s2192">I was stateless, homeless, penniless, jobless.</span> <span id="s2193">Unlike my non-Jewish fellow survivors, I couldn't go back home to my family, to my relatives, to my friends because Jewish home, Jewish families and Jewish communities were destroyed.</span> <span id="s2194">I had no one left, to help me, to love me, to wait for me, or to miss me.</span> <span id="s2195">But I missed terrible, everybody.</span> <span id="s2196">And I remember the shock I got when I saw myself for the first time in the mirror.</span> <span id="s2197">I didn't know myself.</span> <span id="s2198">I didn't see myself all those years.</span> <span id="s2199">And it was no sign of womanhood.</span> <span id="s2200">Another thing, during this Auschwitz I didn't get my period.</span> <span id="s2201">Until this day, I don't know the reasons why.</span> <span id="s2202">That was malnutrition or whether they were putting something in the food?</span> <span id="s2203">I would suspect its malnutrition.</span> <span id="s2204">And I didn't know if I am going to be like a normal woman.</span> <span id="s2205">And when I saw myself in the mirror, I started to scream.</span> <span id="s2206">The nurses didn't know what's happened.</span> <span id="s2207">And I didn't know how to explain.</span> <span id="s2208">[end of side 1 of tape 4] Anyhow, I, it was a coincidence because I was born during Passover and I was liberated during Passover.</span> <span id="s2209">And I had less, I had more on the day when I was born than the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s2210">Not a tangible shred was left of my pre-war childhood world.</span> <span id="s2211">Not a single document, not a family annual, not a photograph, nothing.</span> <span id="s2212">And the Swedish people in the hospital were very kind.</span> <span id="s2213">Very, very kind, very caring.</span> <span id="s2214">And to me, if I didn't get beaten that was already a lucky day.</span> <span id="s2215">Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything what was happen, with Hitler, I didn't know what's Germany, I didn't know how the war is.</span> <span id="s2216">I was away from the war for nearly six years, not having any contact, isolated from the whole world.</span> <span id="s2217">Not reading, not knowing anything.</span> <span id="s2218">I only knew what I sensed, what I felt and what I, by comparison.</span> <span id="s2219">And I talked to myself and I started to realize how one person can make a difference.</span> <span id="s2220">This was Gentile people and this was Gentile people.</span> <span id="s2221">One destroyed so many of my people, the other saved them.</span> <span id="s2222">And I started to understand many, many things.</span> <span id="s2223">Not immediately, because in the beginning I was too sick to think and it was lonely.</span> <span id="s2224">Binna fortunately survived too.</span> <span id="s2225">At what point I realized . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: That you were actually free?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: When I was with the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2228">Then I started to realize, when we were going, when we came to Copenhagen and I saw that they treat us, it was like between night and day, the contrast.</span> <span id="s2229">They treat us kindly, the others treated us cruel.</span> <span id="s2230">They took care of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: And you felt you were able to trust them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: At first I was afraid to go because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2233">What the Red Cross represented to me destruction of so many people at first.</span> <span id="s2234">But then I didn't see any Nazis.</span> <span id="s2235">I wasn't, I was naive, I was young but I wasn't completely stupid.</span> <span id="s2236">And I could see that, the difference of the way they treated us and, you know?</span> <span id="s2237">They fed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: What did it feel like, being liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">A: It was a tremendous shock, a tremendous, the transition was not, I didn't, all the time I dreamt about being free but the every day struggle to survive, to get through the day, not to be put to the gas chambers, not to be maimed, not to be, health, and to live.</span> <span id="s2240">It was the struggle to survive so that you couldn't think about all the other things.</span> <span id="s2241">You were with everybody together.</span> <span id="s2242">Many people together, we were on the same boat like we used to say.</span> <span id="s2243">But when we were liberated, and when I came there, I couldn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s2244">I was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s2245">I couldn't understand a word of anything.</span> <span id="s2246">A stranger in a strange world.</span> <span id="s2247">Not having anyone.</span> <span id="s2248">And all of a sudden, in the beginning right away I didn't even think so much.</span> <span id="s2249">I was too sick, too tired, the shock was very much.</span> <span id="s2250">But then the very first time, I will never forget, but this was later, but I'm sharing now an experience when I was the first time, or maybe I should go when I come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: I was in the hospital there.</span> <span id="s2253">I was getting good care.</span> <span id="s2254">The contrast was a sharp contrast from the way the Nazis treated us here.</span> <span id="s2255">And I remember one thing I was thinking, if this is, I remember I was seeing the differences because I always had the ability because I was creative to compare.</span> <span id="s2256">I said, "This is Gentiles and this is Gentiles."</span> <span id="s2257">So good and evil, no one has a monopoly on it.</span> <span id="s2258">It has more to do with the _____________.</span> <span id="s2259">With who you are as a human being.</span> <span id="s2260">What you believe about yourself, about God and about others.</span> <span id="s2261">That effects your behavior.</span> <span id="s2262">And therefore, I realized even more what my mother's last words, don't become hateful and bitter, don't let them destroy you, I realized what tragedies and hatred is.</span> <span id="s2263">And the more the Nazis tortured me, the more I was determined never to become like them, to view myself through their eyes.</span> <span id="s2264">And here I saw kind people.</span> <span id="s2265">I had a very, very wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s2266">Very, very grateful to the Swedish people, the way they helped me.</span> <span id="s2267">They helped me to get on my feet.</span> <span id="s2268">I have nothing.</span> <span id="s2269">I came in, like I said, I had more on the day I was born.</span> <span id="s2270">Here I went in the hospital, I came in nude because they couldn't allow this filthy dress to come in this here, the first thing, we came in and took the showers and they helped me to bathe, covered, nurse me back to health.</span> <span id="s2271">And for this I will be always grateful because I learned not to take anyone or anything for granted.</span> <span id="s2272">Because its very easy to lose everything.</span> <span id="s2273">And we stayed in the hospital and then, I think I gave you all the dates, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Well I don't know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: Otherwise I have everything, I have it all written down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: I don't know how long you were in the hospital, I just know that you arrived in Lund on April 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2278">Because on the 26th I was liberated.</span> <span id="s2279">On the 27th I was in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s2280">The 28th I arrived.</span> <span id="s2281">And at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything.</span> <span id="s2282">What is it?</span> <span id="s2283">Who is responsible?</span> <span id="s2284">And basically what I was interested is, in the beginning, to regain my health.</span> <span id="s2285">I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth, health is important because if you’re sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much.</span> <span id="s2286">And I was very much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me.</span> <span id="s2287">So I needed to become my own parent and start taking care of myself.</span> <span id="s2288">Of course, Binna and I were still very devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time.</span> <span id="s2289">And I was there in the hospital, I got very good care.</span> <span id="s2290">I also was always fortunately a good student and always loved language, words.</span> <span id="s2291">I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish.</span> <span id="s2292">So while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn a little bit.</span> <span id="s2293">And to recover.</span> <span id="s2294">And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945.</span> <span id="s2295">From there I was sent to Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden.</span> <span id="s2296">It's called Dod-ug-stup (ph), it's ____________ you know?</span> <span id="s2297">And this was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called ______________.</span> <span id="s2298">On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that was the address.</span> <span id="s2299">Now there we were in a quarantine, we still couldn't go out because the people were afraid, if we are, if we don't carry any diseases or, so we were not treated badly, in fact we were treated very nice.</span> <span id="s2300">However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 ________, which is like 50 cents here, for pocket money.</span> <span id="s2301">And we started, the people from the town came to the, there was also a fence, but was not barbed wires, it was not electrocuted wires, and we would come to the fence and they looked.</span> <span id="s2302">Some came and we would give them sometimes the money and ask them to buy little trinkets for us.</span> <span id="s2303">And there was a couple with a young son, must have been maybe early 20's, and with the few words that I could speak we made contact.</span> <span id="s2304">I already recovered a little bit, looked a little better.</span> <span id="s2305">And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of me that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that when I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with him.</span> <span id="s2306">And that was the first date of my life, okay?</span> <span id="s2307">So I was very excited and anxious.</span> <span id="s2308">I didn't know how I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years.</span> <span id="s2309">I didn't have any experience in dating and mating.</span> <span id="s2310">I went out with him.</span> <span id="s2311">It was a very, very painful experience for me.</span> <span id="s2312">Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a compliment, you don't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s2313">And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart.</span> <span id="s2314">Here I suffered so much and I'm not Jewish?</span> <span id="s2315">And again, he doesn't see me as a human being.</span> <span id="s2316">Yes, I'm not denying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who I am.</span> <span id="s2317">Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to be Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this.</span> <span id="s2318">It hit me so hard, and I don’t believe he meant it in a bad way, in a malicious way.</span> <span id="s2319">He was a kind person.</span> <span id="s2320">But for somehow he reminded me who I am, not that I ever forgot it.</span> <span id="s2321">And I said, "Good-bye."</span> <span id="s2322">Excuse myself with tears in my eyes and I left.</span> <span id="s2323">And I made a decision.</span> <span id="s2324">Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish because I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family.</span> <span id="s2325">I cannot do it to my family or to my people or to myself.</span> <span id="s2326">And in our camp there, in the DP Camp, was a woman which was called, we called her _________________, means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is the Rabbi's wife.</span> <span id="s2327">So she was the Rabbi's wife and she was orthodox and she took a great interest, she wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish.</span> <span id="s2328">So she took us, she told us there is a camp that she wanted to take us.</span> <span id="s2329">Also, we were not still completely free to go.</span> <span id="s2330">A kosher, a camp.</span> <span id="s2331">It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much the kosher because in the concentration camp I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be with Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: The DP Camp was mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: The DP Camp was only Jewish, but when I went out, and he tells me this here, I was too wounded yet from the whole experience.</span> <span id="s2334">Maybe if he would say today I would laugh it off, it wouldn't even have mattered to me this much.</span> <span id="s2335">But at that time, I wanted to be accepted for who I am because I realized by that time, if I cannot be accepted for who I am surely I will not be accepted for what I am not.</span> <span id="s2336">So I wanted somebody to accept me for, it's not that I had anything about a Gentile or anything, but I wanted to be, I needed to be among my people who are Jewish in order to know that I don't, shouldn't be told you don’t look Jewish, or be accepted for who I am.</span> <span id="s2337">So I volunteered to go to the camp.</span> <span id="s2338">And on July 10, 1945 I left ____________ and I went to Hel-shin-fel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called.</span> <span id="s2339">However, there was something which was troubling me.</span> <span id="s2340">I wanted Binna to come too.</span> <span id="s2341">I didn't want to separate.</span> <span id="s2342">I thought of Binna as my extended family.</span> <span id="s2343">The Rabbi's wife said, "Itka, I don't want to separate you from your friend, but I can't take her.</span> <span id="s2344">Not now at least.</span> <span id="s2345">Because I cannot make exceptions."</span> <span id="s2346">And she was three years older so she could no longer go.</span> <span id="s2347">But she said, "I give you my word that after a few weeks, I will bring her too.</span> <span id="s2348">But not right now because then I cannot give __________ about this."</span> <span id="s2349">So I decided to go and I told Binna that I'm going to try to make sure that she comes later.</span> <span id="s2350">And the Rabbi's wife certainly kept her promise and she brought Binna there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Now I have a question about actually both of these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: The DP Camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2354">Because I'm curious who organized them and supported them?</span> <span id="s2355">And also, what sort of activity went on in them?</span> <span id="s2356">They were trying to, I think, restore people.</span> <span id="s2357">Were there family tracing services?</span> <span id="s2358">Did they have religious services?</span> <span id="s2359">In these DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: In the first camp there was hardly anything.</span> <span id="s2361">There was just the emphasis on restoring us to health.</span> <span id="s2362">Even when I came there, I was not physically that strong yet.</span> <span id="s2363">So the emphasis was on restoring, to get us used to a normal life, if you can call it normal.</span> <span id="s2364">And so there was not much, we rested basically.</span> <span id="s2365">We didn't do very much.</span> <span id="s2366">It was more recuperating.</span> <span id="s2367">It was like a convalescent home you would go from a hospital, that sense, except better because we were already, we were not invalids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Any religious services?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: No.</span> <span id="s2370">Not at that point.</span> <span id="s2371">Nothing yet.</span> <span id="s2372">At that point it was just plain start putting us a little in the, now when I came to Hem-shed (ph), we observed strictly the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s2373">In fact, Mr. Pound (ph) was the name of the __________ and he could only speak Swedish.</span> <span id="s2374">He was the, in Swedish was the ____________.</span> <span id="s2375">This was like the manger, like the, whatever you call it, when somebody is in charge of.</span> <span id="s2376">He couldn't speak a single word of other language, just Swedish.</span> <span id="s2377">So he asked, "Is there anyone who can speak Swedish a little?"</span> <span id="s2378">_________________________.</span> <span id="s2379">I learned quickly the language.</span> <span id="s2380">While I was there, I was always with the dictionary and trying to learn the language.</span> <span id="s2381">So he, I became his helper in the office.</span> <span id="s2382">I had no training to be in an office and I wasn't asked to do any office work.</span> <span id="s2383">My job consisted basically, translating.</span> <span id="s2384">If somebody came in and needed something.</span> <span id="s2385">We got sheets and pillow cases and things like this from there, so we needed to change them, I would be in charge of this here.</span> <span id="s2386">If somebody, basically helping him translate and do duties like this but no office work because I had no training in this here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: Who supported these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2389">At that time I didn't know, I was still not having, I was in the world already, in the normal world but it wasn't yet a normal life for me, it was not.</span> <span id="s2390">So I would rather not say and tell you something which I have no knowledge.</span> <span id="s2391">But I know it must have been, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2392">Now I'm asking, I'm glad you’re asking those question because maybe I'm going to ask around to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: It may be __________, it may be International Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: Yeah, it could be somebody, maybe the Red Cross or maybe the Swedish . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Or the World Jewish Congress, or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: Yeah, somebody.</span> <span id="s2397">But who?</span> <span id="s2398">I don't know at that time.</span> <span id="s2399">But we had good meals.</span> <span id="s2400">It was in a very nice place, physically it was a nice place, nice surroundings.</span> <span id="s2401">A lot of nice greens and it felt good.</span> <span id="s2402">When we came there we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s2403">Everybody got a suit case, the same kind, and a change of clothes next to what we were wearing.</span> <span id="s2404">And sheets, pillow cases, soaps, towels, this we got from there.</span> <span id="s2405">And I was working there and then at one point, I start to feel that I no longer want to be in collective life.</span> <span id="s2406">I want to start a life on my own because when its collective, it has advantages, but it has the disadvantage.</span> <span id="s2407">You don't develop an identity as much.</span> <span id="s2408">I needed to start a field, build a life.</span> <span id="s2409">So Binna and another girl, Regina Shapiro (ph), who was there also, we were assigned to go, we got our first job.</span> <span id="s2410">And this, I didn't have any, I was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s2411">I had no marketable skills and only seven grade of public school and a few grades of Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s2412">So I didn't have, I had to take whatever job they would give me as long as it was respectable.</span> <span id="s2413">And on November 18, 1945 I left, Binna Gold-gramp (ph) and Regina Shapiro (ph) and I left and we went to a _____________, it called Redland-da (ph), _________________ _______________, you know, not so far from Bar-oss (ph).</span> <span id="s2414">At that time I didn't know where its located.</span> <span id="s2415">And Binna saw that we were, I mean Regina saw that we were like sisters and she was all alone so she asked us if she wants to be with us.</span> <span id="s2416">And I said of course.</span> <span id="s2417">So we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: You had complete freedom to leave when you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Yes, at that time we could leave.</span> <span id="s2420">That was because when I came there in __________ was in July and we went on November 18th, so by that time, yes, we could leave.</span> <span id="s2421">Of course, a lot was still lacking to my complete health and everything else, but I was ready, I wanted to assume a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: Let me ask you something, did you think there was a chance that maybe some of your family members had survived?</span> <span id="s2423">And did you think about going back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Not once.</span> <span id="s2425">I knew that they didn't.</span> <span id="s2426">I knew that my immediate, when you say immediate family, doesn't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Not immediate family but you had a lot of cousins and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: I didn't go to Poland.</span> <span id="s2429">I didn't have the means, I didn’t have the strength, I didn't have the know-how, I didn't have the money, I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s2430">I just stayed, this is why later, towards the end, I'm going to just make a summation and you are going to see why I realized that, I'll talk about this later because then its going to make more sense than now.</span> <span id="s2431">Anyhow, so when we went to work here, we came, that was my first job.</span> <span id="s2432">Freedom by choice.</span> <span id="s2433">Until that date, whatever I did is where they sent me, even to go into _____________, to the kosher ___________, the DP camp.</span> <span id="s2434">I don't know if we didn't call it, we called it ______________.</span> <span id="s2435">I didn’t even know that it exist, DP camp, so I was still cut off of the world.</span> <span id="s2436">I had no communication because I wasn't on my own, I didn't have any radio, I didn't have, you know those things, papers and things.</span> <span id="s2437">I couldn't read too well yet to be able to understand, so it was pretty tough still.</span> <span id="s2438">And when I came to _____________, on my first job I had a very traumatic experience.</span> <span id="s2439">I came willing to except any job providing its respectable.</span> <span id="s2440">I was determined, if I survived Auschwitz with dignity I will not, I was determined on three things not to give up, on my life, on my ___________ and on my freedom.</span> <span id="s2441">Because I realized without it life is not worth living for me.</span> <span id="s2442">And I came there, there was basically a very tiny village.</span> <span id="s2443">There was a sanatorium for children with TB.</span> <span id="s2444">And most of the inhabitants there, I don't know how much the population, were people who were elderly people.</span> <span id="s2445">Single, elderly people.</span> <span id="s2446">There was very, I don't think there was anybody my age there.</span> <span id="s2447">But at that time I didn't think about those things.</span> <span id="s2448">I was just grateful and why I accepted the job also because it was room and board and I would still get paid a little.</span> <span id="s2449">And I need that to have because that was, I didn't have a home still.</span> <span id="s2450">I didn't have an apartment or anything on my own yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: How did you find out about this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Mr. Pound helped me out.</span> <span id="s2453">Mr. Pound liked me a lot.</span> <span id="s2454">In fact, he said to me, we got to know each other and he liked me a lot and he said, "Itka, if this doesn't work out you come back to me.</span> <span id="s2455">I have a wife and children and we'll take you in until you get on your feet."</span> <span id="s2456">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s2457">He was not interested in me as a woman, he was interested as a human being, to help me.</span> <span id="s2458">He saw me as a homeless child.</span> <span id="s2459">And he offered, but I was determined to make it on my own.</span> <span id="s2460">And we went there, and the general boss was a very nice woman.</span> <span id="s2461">She would sometimes invite me for a walk, to go with her, she would help me a little with Swedish.</span> <span id="s2462">Anyone who didn't help me was nice to me then, you know?</span> <span id="s2463">The comparisons, you know?</span> <span id="s2464">That's what I said, when you heard me saying a reference with which to compare.</span> <span id="s2465">And she took me into the kitchen, assigned me to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2466">In contrast, the woman who was the manager of the kitchen, she was the general manager.</span> <span id="s2467">The woman who was in the kitchen for no apparent reason hated me with a passion.</span> <span id="s2468">From the moment she brought me in.</span> <span id="s2469">Why?</span> <span id="s2470">I have no idea and it doesn't surprise me.</span> <span id="s2471">Half of the world hated me, that I didn't care and I survived, so I didn't worry about it anymore.</span> <span id="s2472">However, she assigned me to her and one day the general boss said to me, "Make the sandwiches."</span> <span id="s2473">As soon as she left, she would say, "Scrub the floor", or do something that was not as easy or as good as the other job.</span> <span id="s2474">But I figured, I came here to work and I'm going to do what they tell me until I'm able to get on my feet and then I'll see.</span> <span id="s2475">And I worked there and I got paid, not too much.</span> <span id="s2476">And Binna, Regina and I shared one room and we got room and board.</span> <span id="s2477">One day was my half a day off and I was going to leave and they burst from the kitchen, made like "Don't go!"</span> <span id="s2478">And all of a sudden I had a flashback from concentration camp and I was getting nervous.</span> <span id="s2479">And I very politely ask, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s2480">"There are still dishes", she answered.</span> <span id="s2481">And I said, "There will always be dishes in our hospital, but it's my half a day off."</span> <span id="s2482">Because I was thinking, if she would have asked me I would have gladly stayed.</span> <span id="s2483">Because then I have a choice.</span> <span id="s2484">But when I'm ordered I have no choice.</span> <span id="s2485">And if I accept it once, the beginning is the most important, than I'm going to have to do it all the time.</span> <span id="s2486">And I'll lose my freedom and I'm not ready to, after Auschwitz, never again will I give up my freedom willingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Were you afraid to say no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s2489">And I marched out.</span> <span id="s2490">After Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s2491">Just to do something to disgrace myself or my family.</span> <span id="s2492">Other things I'm not afraid.</span> <span id="s2493">What can scare me after Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2494">And as soon as I walked out, and I came to my room, this so-called good manager comes in and she says to me, "Itka, I heard what's happened.</span> <span id="s2495">But would you do it for me?</span> <span id="s2496">Go back?"</span> <span id="s2497">And I had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s2498">The heart said one thing, the head said another.</span> <span id="s2499">But I went back.</span> <span id="s2500">Walking on the way, everything in me revolted.</span> <span id="s2501">I said, "I'm sorry, I can't do it."</span> <span id="s2502">I started to cry and I run back in and I didn't go in.</span> <span id="s2503">I had been taught as a child that never make serious decision, long range decision when you’re under emotional strain.</span> <span id="s2504">So I told myself, I said, suppose I left?</span> <span id="s2505">Where am I going to go?</span> <span id="s2506">I have no home.</span> <span id="s2507">The only option is to go to Mr. Pound and I don't want to do that.</span> <span id="s2508">To be a burden for them.</span> <span id="s2509">What future is there for me?</span> <span id="s2510">It also meant to leave Binna, to separate from Binna.</span> <span id="s2511">Because I didn't dare ask her, come with me, when I have nothing to offer.</span> <span id="s2512">Not a place, not an apartment, not a job.</span> <span id="s2513">So I said, no, I can't do it.</span> <span id="s2514">So I went to the good boss and I told her how I feel about it, and I said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s2515">I have no home and no place to go.</span> <span id="s2516">But I am a survivor of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2517">I got so much abuse that I promised that I will never allow anybody to abuse me again or give up my freedom.</span> <span id="s2518">So I will gladly stay because I don’t have any other place to go.</span> <span id="s2519">Give me any job.</span> <span id="s2520">I don't mind scrubbing toilet.</span> <span id="s2521">Job doesn't scare me.</span> <span id="s2522">I was working carrying stone and things.</span> <span id="s2523">But I want to be treated with dignity.</span> <span id="s2524">If somebody wants something from me, let them ask.</span> <span id="s2525">And if I can I will gladly give, but I don't take orders anymore."</span> <span id="s2526">And she said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s2527">I would gladly do it but she has been working for me for 36 years.</span> <span id="s2528">I can't afford to lose her."</span> <span id="s2529">After that I had no longer to think.</span> <span id="s2530">So I figured, so again not justice.</span> <span id="s2531">It's just for convenient for me.</span> <span id="s2532">At that point I said, whatever is involved, whatever risk, I must take it.</span> <span id="s2533">I went in with tears in my eyes, I said good-bye to both my friends.</span> <span id="s2534">They didn't offer to come and I didn't ask them.</span> <span id="s2535">At that time I didn't even consider, I didn't even, now I am thinking, how come I didn't offer to come Binna?</span> <span id="s2536">I wouldn't let them anyhow, but they didn't.</span> <span id="s2537">You know, everything went so fast.</span> <span id="s2538">And I picked myself up and I went.</span> <span id="s2539">Like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</span> <span id="s2540">Went to the world with no one, an orphan, with no one to care.</span> <span id="s2541">And when I came to the train, they asked me where do you want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">End of Tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: At the last tape you were getting ready to get on a train for somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Somewhere.</span> <span id="s2546">And when I came to the train, running not walking, because I want to make the train.</span> <span id="s2547">I didn't have too many belongings to take with me, I didn't have very much.</span> <span id="s2548">And I didn't even have time to buy the ticket at the office, at the station, but I boarded on the train.</span> <span id="s2549">And the conductor asked me, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s2550">I said, "To the nearest, largest city."</span> <span id="s2551">Because I didn't know Sweden at that time, I hadn't been around yet.</span> <span id="s2552">So he said, "Boss (ph)?</span> <span id="s2553">Boss (ph), Sweden?</span> <span id="s2554">You know Boss (ph)?"</span> <span id="s2555">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s2556">And that's where I learned.</span> <span id="s2557">When I came into Boss (ph), Sweden, I did not know a single soul.</span> <span id="s2558">I had no home.</span> <span id="s2559">And all of a sudden it dawned on me.</span> <span id="s2560">Where am I going now?</span> <span id="s2561">Now I am completely alone.</span> <span id="s2562">No family, and not even friends.</span> <span id="s2563">My two friends are also without me.</span> <span id="s2564">Where am I going to sleep?</span> <span id="s2565">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s2566">And I walked quite a while, mostly I was completely oblivious of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to realize my situation, that I have nothing.</span> <span id="s2567">I have no money.</span> <span id="s2568">I have no home.</span> <span id="s2569">I'm a homeless person and I'm all alone.</span> <span id="s2570">Even as bad as it was in concentration camp, I knew this is where I'm going to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s2571">Here, I don't have anything.</span> <span id="s2572">And I must admit I was concerned.</span> <span id="s2573">And all of a sudden I looked up to Heaven and I found myself praying.</span> <span id="s2574">And I remember exactly what I said, inside myself.</span> <span id="s2575">Dear God, I am all alone and I am helpless.</span> <span id="s2576">I'm in your hands.</span> <span id="s2577">Guide me.</span> <span id="s2578">I don't want to do something to disgrace myself or my family.</span> <span id="s2579">And I had been walking, I don't know how long, and then all of a sudden I thought that I hear somebody saying, "Yit-cola."</span> <span id="s2580">I said, am I losing my mind?</span> <span id="s2581">I'm hearing voices?</span> <span id="s2582">And again I hear repeating, "Yit-cola."</span> <span id="s2583">And I look around and a girl from concentration camp recognized me.</span> <span id="s2584">She lived in Boss (ph).</span> <span id="s2585">And I tell her my story and she said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2586">We are concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s2587">We can share whatever we have.</span> <span id="s2588">Come up."</span> <span id="s2589">And I stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s2590">She directed me how to go to the unemployment office, the next day, and I went.</span> <span id="s2591">They asked me, did you work before?</span> <span id="s2592">I told them, yes.</span> <span id="s2593">Why did you leave?</span> <span id="s2594">I said, "I tell you the truth, there's no young people.</span> <span id="s2595">And I wanted to start a new life.</span> <span id="s2596">There was nobody for me to associate with."</span> <span id="s2597">Which was not a lie.</span> <span id="s2598">But that was not the only reason because eventually I would have left anyhow.</span> <span id="s2599">But it didn't dawn on me.</span> <span id="s2600">She asked me to come back, that she's going to check out my story.</span> <span id="s2601">Because I wasn't used to telephones yet because I didn't have a telephone.</span> <span id="s2602">And she checked out the story and when I came back, she asked me, "Why did you try to protect her?"</span> <span id="s2603">And I said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s2604">I didn't leave, I'm not going to gain anything by making her look bad."</span> <span id="s2605">You know, my manager from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2606">"I just don't have a future there.</span> <span id="s2607">And I left for this reason, but I also eventually would have left anyhow because there is no life for me."</span> <span id="s2608">And I told her a little bit, not much, but I told her that I have two friends who stayed there and I want to be with them, can she find a job for me, for them too?</span> <span id="s2609">And she did find me a job.</span> <span id="s2610">However, in Sweden was a custom.</span> <span id="s2611">That you only, if you worked for somebody they provided you with an apartment.</span> <span id="s2612">You paid for it but if you stopped working you no longer could use that apartment.</span> <span id="s2613">So I went to work and, when I had already a job for the three of us, and an apartment, I got in touch with my friends and I brought them over.</span> <span id="s2614">With Regina it didn't work out too well because there was, two is okay, four is okay, three is a little part in our relationship.</span> <span id="s2615">Because Binna and I, except for underwear, shared everything.</span> <span id="s2616">Even after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2617">It wasn't mine and yours.</span> <span id="s2618">Money, time, work.</span> <span id="s2619">She felt better if she did for me, if I did better I did for her.</span> <span id="s2620">So we were like sisters.</span> <span id="s2621">Regina wasn't, she was more, she was a nice girl but, like, this is mine, this is yours, and we were not accustom because even in Auschwitz we shared.</span> <span id="s2622">So we decided that she's going to have for herself a room.</span> <span id="s2623">So we were on the second floor, ___________ was also a little room.</span> <span id="s2624">So Binna and I shared one room, she shared another room.</span> <span id="s2625">In Sweden, the custom was the dinner was not in the evening, it was during lunchtime.</span> <span id="s2626">Since I was brought up in Poland and there was no ready-made foods and everything, so I was still accustom to do, I knew a little bit how to cook because when I was at home I used to help my __________ and my parents, you know?</span> <span id="s2627">Chop this and . . . so I knew that my mother tried to teach me everything, what she could, and I would, we would make meals together.</span> <span id="s2628">And every day somebody would go take turns, one day Binna would go and warm up the food a little early and I did, I had a day when I didn't feel so good she would help.</span> <span id="s2629">We were really devoted to each other.</span> <span id="s2630">And one day, I was walking home from work and I was rushing.</span> <span id="s2631">I was always very fast and energetic.</span> <span id="s2632">And bingo, I'm on the ground.</span> <span id="s2633">And I feel that from the elbow, from the back, somebody's helping me up.</span> <span id="s2634">I turn around.</span> <span id="s2635">And it was a man.</span> <span id="s2636">I thanked him and he starts talking to me and he notices that I have an accent.</span> <span id="s2637">And we start talking and he had an accent too and we found out that we are both survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2638">And he tells me that he lives on the same street, he asked me where I lived, I told him, the same street.</span> <span id="s2639">But he lives in a hotel and I was, I got a small apartment.</span> <span id="s2640">He helped me home and he tells me that his father was, not a ___________, but you know like a self-made _____________, ____________.</span> <span id="s2641">There used to be a lot of people like home-made remedies and he was going to clean up my knees and bandage, I was still, even though I went through Auschwitz, but I still was not the kind of girl that would let him see my knees, you know?</span> <span id="s2642">So I said, no thank you.</span> <span id="s2643">And I warmed up the food and offered him some food.</span> <span id="s2644">And he said it smelled nice and everything, and he said, "Oh, I would gladly pay to have a meal like this."</span> <span id="s2645">And I said, "I don’t run a restaurant.</span> <span id="s2646">However, if you want to have a home-made meal, during the week we work, I don't have the time, but on Sunday you're welcome.</span> <span id="s2647">Binna and I is going to be home.</span> <span id="s2648">You can come up and have dinner with us."</span> <span id="s2649">His name is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph), now he called himself Abe.</span> <span id="s2650">And Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) started to come.</span> <span id="s2651">I don’t know how I should call it, to date me?</span> <span id="s2652">But he would come constantly visiting.</span> <span id="s2653">Showed a great interest in me.</span> <span id="s2654">I liked him very much as a friend.</span> <span id="s2655">Very loyal, well devoted, caring.</span> <span id="s2656">But I didn't have any feelings for him otherwise.</span> <span id="s2657">And he was coming to our home for almost a year.</span> <span id="s2658">Now, at that time, they sent to Sweden, when we came to Sweden, all the women were there.</span> <span id="s2659">____________.</span> <span id="s2660">There were other women from Sweden too, that were survivors.</span> <span id="s2661">But the men they sent in other places.</span> <span id="s2662">So there were only two men in our city.</span> <span id="s2663">So there was no prospect for somebody to find, you know?</span> <span id="s2664">So everybody, Binna and everybody else is saying, "Itka, you're so lucky.</span> <span id="s2665">You have a man who likes you so much."</span> <span id="s2666">And, I don’t know, I never talked with him about love because I certainly didn't love him.</span> <span id="s2667">I loved him as a human being, as a good person, but no otherwise.</span> <span id="s2668">And I remember that Binna said, "Oh, I would be lucky to find a man like this."</span> <span id="s2669">And, "Why don't you marry him?"</span> <span id="s2670">And I said, "You like him, you marry him."</span> <span id="s2671">Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we actually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters who live in America, who survived.</span> <span id="s2672">I don’t know where, I don't know too much about those things.</span> <span id="s2673">And they send him a visa.</span> <span id="s2674">And I could have gone with him to America but I did not want to go.</span> <span id="s2675">Because I said, I'm not going to negate myself in any way.</span> <span id="s2676">If I'm going to marry someone it's going to be somebody who I have deep feelings for.</span> <span id="s2677">Love not only as a friend but as a ______________.</span> <span id="s2678">And anyhow, one time, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to our apartment and he tells me, he invites me to come to his apartment.</span> <span id="s2679">I got so angry.</span> <span id="s2680">I said, "After knowing me so long don't you know I'm not the kind of girl that doesn't go to a man's apartment?"</span> <span id="s2681">You know, we were brought up, you had to be a virgin when you got married, it's not like today, you know?</span> <span id="s2682">And he said, "Sha-sha, I'm not just inviting you.</span> <span id="s2683">I'm inviting Binna too and there are going to be other people."</span> <span id="s2684">And I didn't know at that time yet what's, and I came.</span> <span id="s2685">And this was either June 24, 1946, yes, it was already 1946.</span> <span id="s2686">June 26 or, I think it was June the 24th in 1946, and I come to the party and as I come in with Binna, there are lots of guests, and I didn't know that this was the party for his, farewell party, good-bye party, bon voyage party.</span> <span id="s2687">He was leaving for America.</span> <span id="s2688">And as I come in a man sits there and as soon as I look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes room and says to me in Polish, "Please sit here."</span> <span id="s2689">And I sit down next to him, and from the first moment, I care deeply about him.</span> <span id="s2690">And I started to get worried, what about Binna?</span> <span id="s2691">And he, I found out later that Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from the same hometown and the man that this man came with was also from the same hometown.</span> <span id="s2692">From Bell-hot-off (ph), Poland.</span> <span id="s2693">They're all survivors and they knew each other from home, they went from __________.</span> <span id="s2694">And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men.</span> <span id="s2695">And he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am not going to get involved with him so he said to his friend, "If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you."</span> <span id="s2696">Because he considered me to be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man.</span> <span id="s2697">And the person that I met there was Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband.</span> <span id="s2698">And after, and he ask me can he take us home.</span> <span id="s2699">So I said to him, "You came with your friend.</span> <span id="s2700">Why don't you invite him too and we'll go together?"</span> <span id="s2701">Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make ______________, you know how _______________is, to be the matchmaker.</span> <span id="s2702">And he said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s2703">And they want to go upstairs and I said, "No, it's too late.</span> <span id="s2704">After a certain hour nobody comes to our apartment."</span> <span id="s2705">So he said, "Promise me that you're going to wait for me."</span> <span id="s2706">He worked in shifts from morning until 2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00.</span> <span id="s2707">That I'm going to wait.</span> <span id="s2708">He got a job and the other man was _____________ ____________, which turned out later to be Binna's husband.</span> <span id="s2709">And he said to come, will we wait for him?</span> <span id="s2710">And I agreed.</span> <span id="s2711">Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and ___________ ____________ started to date Binna too.</span> <span id="s2712">And one time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, "Do you know a girl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?"</span> <span id="s2713">And I said, "By sight I don't know much about her.</span> <span id="s2714">I just know she's a pretty girl.</span> <span id="s2715">That's all I know about her, from sight.</span> <span id="s2716">Why are you asking?"</span> <span id="s2717">And he tells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another city in Sweden, and he asked him to meet his sister.</span> <span id="s2718">He wanted to make a match.</span> <span id="s2719">He didn't tell me at the time though that he gave him a letter, he really was trying to make a match.</span> <span id="s2720">So I said, "Why don't you go?"</span> <span id="s2721">And Binna kicks me under the table, she said, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s2722">You're going to send a cat for __________.</span> <span id="s2723">You like him so much and you're going to send him to another girl?"</span> <span id="s2724">I said.</span> <span id="s2725">"Yes.</span> <span id="s2726">If he likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later."</span> <span id="s2727">And she didn't like that so she sent ____________________.</span> <span id="s2728">He came back and he said, "Now we can get engaged."</span> <span id="s2729">So a week later, after I met him, I was engaged.</span> <span id="s2730">And on July 13, 1946, before Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) left to go to America, we had a double wedding.</span> <span id="s2731">Binna married Mendal Crook (ph) and I married Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph).</span> <span id="s2732">That was the happiest and the most tragic day of my life.</span> <span id="s2733">Happy because obviously I love my husband, we loved each other.</span> <span id="s2734">But he is the sole survivor of a large family.</span> <span id="s2735">He was one of seven.</span> <span id="s2736">Only one sister died before the Holocaust and the rest of his family didn't survive.</span> <span id="s2737">And I was the sole survivor of my family.</span> <span id="s2738">At least he had three __________ at his wedding.</span> <span id="s2739">I didn't have one single person from my hometown.</span> <span id="s2740">One single person who knew me.</span> <span id="s2741">My family.</span> <span id="s2742">And I remembered that when my, when we lived in Check-hon-off (ph), we used to, I mentioned before that we were kosher, so we would buy chickens, ducks, geese.</span> <span id="s2743">And from the chicken feathers we took to the ritual slaughter and then they would pluck, it wasn't ready-made like here, so all the other feathers they threw away.</span> <span id="s2744">But from the geese and from the ducks, they would save it.</span> <span id="s2745">The down.</span> <span id="s2746">And this was suppose to be for a trousseau, for Yit-cola (ph), when she's going to get married.</span> <span id="s2747">And whenever they had a wish, they said they should live to see me under the __________, which means under the canopy.</span> <span id="s2748">And here I was all alone.</span> <span id="s2749">I had no one.</span> <span id="s2750">And it hit me.</span> <span id="s2751">The only person I had is my husband, Binna and _________, who was my dear friend.</span> <span id="s2752">___________, bless his memory, he is no longer alive, he died several years ago.</span> <span id="s2753">And at our wedding, I had a borrowed dress.</span> <span id="s2754">I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s2755">We married deliberately during vacation, the week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week.</span> <span id="s2756">And on our honeymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup.</span> <span id="s2757">And for a whole week, the four of us shared.</span> <span id="s2758">This was our condition in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2759">And yet, I've tried to make a go of it and Binna and I made a switch.</span> <span id="s2760">I shared with her my apartment and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) shared a little apartment when they came from the other city.</span> <span id="s2761">So Binna went to live where Rockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in that little apartment.</span> <span id="s2762">You don't understand?</span> <span id="s2763">I had an apartment where I shared with Binna before I was married.</span> <span id="s2764">Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another city and they had a little apartment.</span> <span id="s2765">So when we got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband.</span> <span id="s2766">And I lived with Rockmiel (ph).</span> <span id="s2767">But there is something that, it’s a curious thing, because I learn a lot from people.</span> <span id="s2768">When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people.</span> <span id="s2769">So there was only Binna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I didn't know from before.</span> <span id="s2770">One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at that time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married.</span> <span id="s2771">She was a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and not everybody wanted to marry out of their religion.</span> <span id="s2772">So anyhow, we had a tiny room.</span> <span id="s2773">All there was in the room is two single beds, a table and a couple of chairs.</span> <span id="s2774">I didn't even have a stove in the room so we went to going from the steps, to go up to the first floor, I took a little, made a little curtain or drape and I bought a hot plate.</span> <span id="s2775">And that's how I cooked.</span> <span id="s2776">And from the sink that we used.</span> <span id="s2777">But I was satisfied.</span> <span id="s2778">So I went out to bring in the food.</span> <span id="s2779">Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my fiancée when we got engaged, and she says to me, "Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you."</span> <span id="s2780">And I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s2781">And she said, "He's too big a flirt."</span> <span id="s2782">And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with facts.</span> <span id="s2783">How would she know what he is, she just met him?</span> <span id="s2784">She would say he's not attractive, she can see, but how can she know he's a flirt?</span> <span id="s2785">He's never, she never met him before.</span> <span id="s2786">So I just ignored.</span> <span id="s2787">After we were married, my husband asked me, "Are you good friends?"</span> <span id="s2788">And I said, "Just met her."</span> <span id="s2789">But I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement.</span> <span id="s2790">So he said, "Did you know that when you went out to ________, she invited me to come to her apartment without you?"</span> <span id="s2791">I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this.</span> <span id="s2792">And I thought to myself, you see how important is the thing for yourself.</span> <span id="s2793">To think what people say and use your own common sense.</span> <span id="s2794">This is why I'm telling you the story.</span> <span id="s2795">Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was working very hard.</span> <span id="s2796">And Mendle (ph) told me how hard he's working so I was upset about it so I went and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get a better job.</span> <span id="s2797">And I should get apartment, to get a little bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s2798">And we were in Sweden and we didn't have anything, we started without anything.</span> <span id="s2799">But we understood that it’s a beginning and we worked hard.</span> <span id="s2800">And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whether I'll be able to bear a child.</span> <span id="s2801">Because I didn't get the period yet for so long.</span> <span id="s2802">Finally I got the period.</span> <span id="s2803">And anyhow, we got an apartment.</span> <span id="s2804">And you know, I'm telling you those stories because I'm seeing that all over, in every country and in every religion, and even in every home, there can be people who are good or not so good.</span> <span id="s2805">So anyhow, we had an apartment and this, in this house where I had the apartment from this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any children in that home, in that place.</span> <span id="s2806">Because there were only living people without children.</span> <span id="s2807">Mostly elderly people.</span> <span id="s2808">And she put in our apartment two beds, single beds.</span> <span id="s2809">And one time, at night, I hear somebody is opening the door.</span> <span id="s2810">She came to check if we are sleeping together, and here I am married.</span> <span id="s2811">And I always, I don’t know so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as I can remember, I was taught to think for myself and to trust myself.</span> <span id="s2812">And my parents always gave me confidence, you know, that I had that, that I was able to trust myself.</span> <span id="s2813">So I figured, let her say what she wants.</span> <span id="s2814">I didn't argue, I didn't talk back.</span> <span id="s2815">And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant, in that place.</span> <span id="s2816">But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable.</span> <span id="s2817">So again, I had to switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were murdered.</span> <span id="s2818">And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child.</span> <span id="s2819">Here I'm pregnant and somebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child.</span> <span id="s2820">I need her permission?</span> <span id="s2821">So I started to look for an apartment to get, to keep the moving again.</span> <span id="s2822">Anyhow, when, before, when I moved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another apartment.</span> <span id="s2823">And I didn't know anything about how the human body works.</span> <span id="s2824">A woman's body.</span> <span id="s2825">And the doctor just told me the date, when to expect.</span> <span id="s2826">And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come.</span> <span id="s2827">All the time my husband and I was rehearsing.</span> <span id="s2828">Where we going to go?</span> <span id="s2829">How we going to go?</span> <span id="s2830">Everything.</span> <span id="s2831">It so happened he had still shift work.</span> <span id="s2832">And he left in the morning and I woke up and my water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s2833">I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before.</span> <span id="s2834">So I go in, I don't have a friend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask.</span> <span id="s2835">So I go into a neighbor, to ask her, what does that mean?</span> <span id="s2836">She said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s2837">Go ask the doctor."</span> <span id="s2838">So she's advising me to go ask the doctor.</span> <span id="s2839">My husband is not home, I don’t have a telephone number.</span> <span id="s2840">And here I see something is not right and I don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s2841">So I take my bicycle and I'm going on a bicycle to ask the doctor.</span> <span id="s2842">And here my water bag is broken.</span> <span id="s2843">And I came to the doctor and they don't let me go home anymore.</span> <span id="s2844">In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one thing influences the other.</span> <span id="s2845">And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the street and they ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby.</span> <span id="s2846">And here I was a little bit _________.</span> <span id="s2847">Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the bike to the hospital, that the water bag broke.</span> <span id="s2848">And he tells her the story.</span> <span id="s2849">So she says, "Well, if the water bag broke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live."</span> <span id="s2850">In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy boy and my husband comes to the hospital and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face.</span> <span id="s2851">He holds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion.</span> <span id="s2852">I said, "What's going on here?"</span> <span id="s2853">And I was wondering.</span> <span id="s2854">No congratulations, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2855">So distant and cold?</span> <span id="s2856">I said, that's not my husband.</span> <span id="s2857">That's not the man I know.</span> <span id="s2858">And I said to him, "Mistletov, we have a son."</span> <span id="s2859">And he get so excited and tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them because she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s2860">So I'm showing you, why am I telling you this story?</span> <span id="s2861">I had no experience.</span> <span id="s2862">I was alone.</span> <span id="s2863">That when I needed somebody, a mother, I needed relatives to help me, I had nobody.</span> <span id="s2864">You know?</span> <span id="s2865">And my son was born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born.</span> <span id="s2866">Two miracles in my life.</span> <span id="s2867">A son and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream that my people prayed, the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s2868">But unfortunately I didn't have relatives to share ________________.</span> <span id="s2869">And ever since I've been liberated, I couldn't even tell you the time because usually I know, that I feel, I told you ___________ I want to do something, but I couldn't put it in words.</span> <span id="s2870">I knew that I had to go back one day to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2871">I never said good-bye to my family.</span> <span id="s2872">I just knew that something is still not finished yet.</span> <span id="s2873">Anyhow, and I stayed in there.</span> <span id="s2874">Then after that I was, started to work, no, the first year we had no choice so we had to take, after my son was about a year, we took him to a nursery because we had nothing.</span> <span id="s2875">We needed to work and I was suffering tremendously because I was brought up with two loving women at home and a father.</span> <span id="s2876">And, but I had no choice.</span> <span id="s2877">And my little boy had an accident.</span> <span id="s2878">He was accidentally, you know in Sweden we still didn't have the modern conveniences so we had a stove, a wood-burning stove, and I was use from Poland, so we washed the diapers and we boiled them.</span> <span id="s2879">And I even ironed them.</span> <span id="s2880">And one day, by accident, and I always caution him don't go to the stove, and the hot water spilled on him.</span> <span id="s2881">And I thought that I'm going to lose him so I went with him to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2882">I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day she didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's _________.</span> <span id="s2883">And she tells me, "Your personal life is of no concern of mine."</span> <span id="s2884">I didn’t say anything and I thought to myself, I'm free physically.</span> <span id="s2885">Now I have to be independent financially too.</span> <span id="s2886">And since my husband had shift and got my child with others, and I started to go to fashion design school.</span> <span id="s2887">And I'll show you, I have the diploma.</span> <span id="s2888">And I started to work.</span> <span id="s2889">And when my second son was born, I no longer had to take him to the nursery.</span> <span id="s2890">I could be home with him.</span> <span id="s2891">Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double wedding.</span> <span id="s2892">She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and she miscarried.</span> <span id="s2893">So she got pregnant again.</span> <span id="s2894">I was early, she was, it turned out that we were, both she and I gave birth in the same hospital.</span> <span id="s2895">Her first child was born on October 1, 1948.</span> <span id="s2896">My son was born October 10, 1948.</span> <span id="s2897">And since in Sweden, so many adjustments.</span> <span id="s2898">In Europe, we didn't know about formulas.</span> <span id="s2899">So we used to nurse each others children.</span> <span id="s2900">We were very close with each other.</span> <span id="s2901">Anyhow, then in November 29, 1951 my second son was born, _________.</span> <span id="s2902">And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work outside but it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewed everything, from little suits for the children, to draperies, to slip covers, to custom ___________ and I worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s2903">But I was happy because I could be home with the family.</span> <span id="s2904">Then I received information that, from the _______, that we can go to America if we want to.</span> <span id="s2905">And I decided that I'm going to talk with my husband, find out how he feels.</span> <span id="s2906">And we both decided.</span> <span id="s2907">We're going to go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: Why did you want to come to America and leave Sweden?</span> <span id="s2909">Or not go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: They didn't give me a choice to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2911">If they would give me a choice I would go.</span> <span id="s2912">Because they would take care of it, so I had to go again where I was, the reason why I was leaving Sweden is because there was no synagogue.</span> <span id="s2913">There was, the few Jews that were there, if any, were assimilated.</span> <span id="s2914">And I felt I survived as a Jew, I suffered as a Jew, I lost my family because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s2915">And orthodox or not orthodox, but I want to give my children a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s2916">A ___________ education, not just the secular but a Jewish education too.</span> <span id="s2917">I wanted to be, for instance, when my son had to be circumcised we had to bring a Rabbi from Stockholm.</span> <span id="s2918">When we want to have kosher meat we had to send it, by the time it comes after three days its no longer kosher if you know the laws of __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: But you could have moved to Stockholm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: No, we felt there is no, that there, we could have moved, it's not so easy to move.</span> <span id="s2921">You have to have a job, you have to move, and you have the circumstances.</span> <span id="s2922">We had nothing, we started with nothing.</span> <span id="s2923">So we decided, plus, I just felt that too many, you know, in Europe there were too many painful memories.</span> <span id="s2924">If they would have given me a choice I surely would have gone to Israel and that time, but I didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s2925">They assigned me to come Philadelphia, so on February 15, 1953 we arrived to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, and we've lived there ever since.</span> <span id="s2926">During the time when we came here, I knew that we wanted to have a larger family.</span> <span id="s2927">And we had to make a choice.</span> <span id="s2928">And I knew that all life, from the morning you wake up until the time you go to sleep, you make choices.</span> <span id="s2929">And I was also taught that every, in every choice there are consequences and there are lessons.</span> <span id="s2930">So I had to put my value system to work.</span> <span id="s2931">And I said one thing, if I have children I don't want them somebody else to take, I want to be with them.</span> <span id="s2932">I want to, I didn't have that privilege because it was not of my choice, my mother would have wanted me, because one of the things which I remembered, very distinctly, is that my mother put aside her, she wanted to be an actress but she put away.</span> <span id="s2933">And the family was always first.</span> <span id="s2934">And other things which I heard when I was home is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriage and I was very much the child that she wanted so much and I was loved unconditionally by my parents.</span> <span id="s2935">And I felt I don't want to deprive my children of that.</span> <span id="s2936">So we decided, my husband and I, as long as we can pay our bills, we'll forego luxuries.</span> <span id="s2937">I would never accept a handout from anyone.</span> <span id="s2938">We worked hard work.</span> <span id="s2939">And I will stay home with the children __________.</span> <span id="s2940">And then in 1956, November 24, 1956, our son Samuel was born.</span> <span id="s2941">Again, I remember that when I was going to go to America people said, where you going to go with a baby?</span> <span id="s2942">Or the seas, and how are you going to make out?</span> <span id="s2943">I always had faith.</span> <span id="s2944">I said, listen, I'm nursing the baby.</span> <span id="s2945">So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve.</span> <span id="s2946">And then somehow its going to work.</span> <span id="s2947">You cannot have everything mapped out every inch of the way.</span> <span id="s2948">And we went.</span> <span id="s2949">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s2950">I came here.</span> <span id="s2951">I didn't know a single person in this country.</span> <span id="s2952">I didn't know a single word of English.</span> <span id="s2953">Again we had to adjust, to start anew, to make adjustment, to make work.</span> <span id="s2954">_____________, I was already skilled, I was already a fashion designer but my husband had no marketable skills.</span> <span id="s2955">He was working in a knitting factory making nylon stockings.</span> <span id="s2956">But he was willing to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a job here when we came to Philadelphia, he worked in ___________.</span> <span id="s2957">By the time he came, the _______ the children were asleep.</span> <span id="s2958">By the time he came home, they were already, they were still asleep, they were already asleep.</span> <span id="s2959">And I said, no, this won't do.</span> <span id="s2960">Because I will never put material possessions above spiritual things, which we need.</span> <span id="s2961">So I encouraged him to change the job.</span> <span id="s2962">There was an advertisement.</span> <span id="s2963">After he worked a few days, they just had a few ________, they let him go.</span> <span id="s2964">So he was taking any kind of job, three, four jobs.</span> <span id="s2965">But he would never, we never took anything from anyone.</span> <span id="s2966">And we struggled and then on February 21, 1964 our youngest son, Michael, was born.</span> <span id="s2967">And I knew that I made the right decision, to stay with the kids at home.</span> <span id="s2968">Because, first of all, it would cost a fortune, four children you have to camp, and I didn't want to send them to camp because I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country, picking mushrooms and my mother showing, making crowns and put on your head, and singing, and I don’t want them to miss all this here.</span> <span id="s2969">I felt that to give them love, because I started to realize that it's the love that I received that I can give to others now.</span> <span id="s2970">And that you can survive with very little because in Auschwitz I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s2971">And after I was married.</span> <span id="s2972">Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to become barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest in peace, that we're going to go to Israel instead.</span> <span id="s2973">And to celebrate his barmitzvah there.</span> <span id="s2974">And since I'm an intuitive person, and we decided this already, I wake up one morning and I said to my husband, "Honey, let's go now."</span> <span id="s2975">And he said, "When was this born?</span> <span id="s2976">Why?"</span> <span id="s2977">And I said, "I don't know why.</span> <span id="s2978">I just now feel we should go now."</span> <span id="s2979">And he agreed.</span> <span id="s2980">And it was a very good decision.</span> <span id="s2981">And we went.</span> <span id="s2982">And for the first time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay?</span> <span id="s2983">I was eight years old in 1934 when she left.</span> <span id="s2984">I came there in 1974, with my youngest son.</span> <span id="s2985">Ours was always a very close knit family and Uta (ph) was thrilled.</span> <span id="s2986">We cried in each others arms.</span> <span id="s2987">Because she was the sole survivor of her family.</span> <span id="s2988">She always felt bad that she left.</span> <span id="s2989">She never could come back.</span> <span id="s2990">And I remembered my grandmother saying, ___________________.</span> <span id="s2991">So I was able to go back with my son, to meet my cousin Uta (ph).</span> <span id="s2992">And there is Israel, there is a country now.</span> <span id="s2993">And she gave him for his barmitzvah a ___________ and a ___________.</span> <span id="s2994">And she asked him, just like my parents called me affectionate, I called my children affectionate, "Michael, what would you like besides this."</span> <span id="s2995">He said, "Nothing, I'm just happy to see you."</span> <span id="s2996">She says, "No, tell me."</span> <span id="s2997">He said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s2998">He wants a little chain, Michael.</span> <span id="s2999">And I went to Israel, it didn't take long.</span> <span id="s3000">I receive a call.</span> <span id="s3001">My cousin Uta (ph) went to the doctor, her check up, and either on the way there or on the way home, got a heart attack and died.</span> <span id="s3002">If I wouldn't have gone then, I already told you what I, my intuition and that I listen to my intuition.</span> <span id="s3003">And I would not have seen her.</span> <span id="s3004">Anyhow, Michael was a beautiful young man.</span> <span id="s3005">He was very successful because he was loved and he had a talent to laugh, a full measure.</span> <span id="s3006">I remember when he was a little boy.</span> <span id="s3007">He used to ask me, "How come that we don’t have family?</span> <span id="s3008">How come you have a number?"</span> <span id="s3009">And I told him, and the conversations, I wrote it down and then I made a poem from it.</span> <span id="s3010">And I remember that when we moved into our first home, this is my second home in America.</span> <span id="s3011">He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother, an elderly lady.</span> <span id="s3012">He said, "Lady, I don't have any grandparents.</span> <span id="s3013">Would you be my grandmother?"</span> <span id="s3014">I'm telling you those things, that it effected not only us, it effected the children.</span> <span id="s3015">And she became like his adopted grandmother.</span> <span id="s3016">She was very good to him.</span> <span id="s3017">She lived to be 96.</span> <span id="s3018">Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was more than fifteen years between him and my older son.</span> <span id="s3019">So he almost grew up like an only child because they were already in college, ___________.</span> <span id="s3020">And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely and I said, "Michael, I need a little medicine."</span> <span id="s3021">And I'll never forget his scared look.</span> <span id="s3022">And he said, "Ma, are you sick?"</span> <span id="s3023">And I said, "Oh, not that kind of medicine.</span> <span id="s3024">I need a hug and a kiss."</span> <span id="s3025">And he came over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many times, he would say, "Want a little medicine?"</span> <span id="s3026">And that became our _________ between us, medicine meant a hug and a kiss.</span> <span id="s3027">And when he was already in college, he would always, when I would write to him or call him, I'd say, "Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine."</span> <span id="s3028">And he said, "I can’t wait to give it to you."</span> <span id="s3029">And he was very successful because he was loved by many people.</span> <span id="s3030">He was successful in college.</span> <span id="s3031">He graduated from the University of Rochester.</span> <span id="s3032">At age 25 he was already in a wonderful position and he owned his own home and he was successful in every way.</span> <span id="s3033">He was dating a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s3034">And it was, my son Jerry was suppose to graduate in 1990, from University of Cornell.</span> <span id="s3035">And Michael was here Thursday and he said, "Mom, Dad.</span> <span id="s3036">Be ready.</span> <span id="s3037">I'm going to come and pick you up.</span> <span id="s3038">We're going to go to my brother's graduation."</span> <span id="s3039">That was Thursday.</span> <span id="s3040">Friday, the police came and told me that I have no longer a son.</span> <span id="s3041">My son, Michael, was killed.</span> <span id="s3042">And instead of a graduation party I had a funeral.</span> <span id="s3043">He was killed instantly in an automobile. . . [end of side 1 of tape 5] Michael was loved.</span> <span id="s3044">Hundreds and hundreds of people came to his funeral.</span> <span id="s3045">Hundreds of trees were planted.</span> <span id="s3046">He has a garden in Eastside from all the trees that was planted.</span> <span id="s3047">My cousin, _____________, my son is gone, my family is gone.</span> <span id="s3048">And I always wear this, this is my most precious piece of jewelry.</span> <span id="s3049">Michael.</span> <span id="s3050">And in my lifetime, I see the destruction of European jewelry.</span> <span id="s3051">The ________ and defeat of Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s3052">And the rebirth of the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s3053">I remember one time, Michael and I were very, very close because he was the youngest.</span> <span id="s3054">And he was the longest home.</span> <span id="s3055">And he was very, very affectionate and he gave me back what I gave him.</span> <span id="s3056">And when I lost him I was thinking, at least I was always for him.</span> <span id="s3057">And his cards, in our home we have a tradition, we write home-made cards.</span> <span id="s3058">And in each card he said, Mom you were always there for me and you loved me unconditionally.</span> <span id="s3059">And the kids, when I went now to where they are living, I mean to the World Holocaust Survivors, Michael is no longer with me.</span> <span id="s3060">He is still with me because he died late.</span> <span id="s3061">He didn't go with me to the gathering.</span> <span id="s3062">And now when I went to the March of the Living, and I saw the trees and I was thinking.</span> <span id="s3063">When I went the first time I went for Michael's barmitzvah.</span> <span id="s3064">My husband was still a healthy man, now he's not.</span> <span id="s3065">How many changes in our lives and how quickly, from good fortune to bad fortune, life can change.</span> <span id="s3066">And how many times, if we don't have a, if we don't say good-bye to the ones we loved.</span> <span id="s3067">And because of that, I never leave anyone without giving a hug and a kiss, and giving the love and affection.</span> <span id="s3068">And I feel I did make the right decision, that I gave up everything and was a full-time mother, wife and friend to those who needed me.</span> <span id="s3069">After Michael started college and I said to myself, when I can close the door and nobody will wait for me and depend on me, then I can start paying back the community.</span> <span id="s3070">In the 1970's I got involved in speaking on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3071">But before that, I was a volunteer in __________ Hospital in the Mental Health Department.</span> <span id="s3072">I was going as a volunteer to the Great-a-felt (ph) Prison.</span> <span id="s3073">I was going on ____________.</span> <span id="s3074">I remembered my grandmother's teaching.</span> <span id="s3075">Help those who are less fortunate than we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: Are you okay?</span> <span id="s3079">Do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">A: No it's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: You sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">Q: When you came over here, to this country, was it easy for you to make new friends?</span> <span id="s3084">And to start again?</span> <span id="s3085">You had to begin again in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: When I came here, as I said before without wanting to repeat myself, I didn't know one single person in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3087">But when I was still in Sweden, when I came to Sweden, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s3088">And I'm going to go back something, to Sweden, because the same thing happened here.</span> <span id="s3089">It happens to be related.</span> <span id="s3090">When I was in Sweden, and one time it dawned on me, that if something would happen to me, you know?</span> <span id="s3091">So alone and everything.</span> <span id="s3092">Nobody would miss me.</span> <span id="s3093">If I would die, nobody would, it wouldn't be a loss if people don't know me.</span> <span id="s3094">And I decided that the most important thing is family and friends.</span> <span id="s3095">And I made an effort to reach out.</span> <span id="s3096">I was no longer of being hurt, that I lose somebody, because in life everyone that we love either they will die before us or we will die before them.</span> <span id="s3097">But not to love is the greatest loss.</span> <span id="s3098">Not to trust is the greatest loss.</span> <span id="s3099">When I came here, I didn't know anyone.</span> <span id="s3100">When I made my son's barmitzvah, the first one, I had over 100 people.</span> <span id="s3101">And when I make my _________ barmitzvah, I have over 300 people.</span> <span id="s3102">When I was going to make Michael's barmitzvah, and I start to make the list, we needed 500 people.</span> <span id="s3103">I don't say everybody was a personal, close friend, but they were people who I was involved.</span> <span id="s3104">And I said, no, I cannot get involved.</span> <span id="s3105">I made for my friends already now, I _________ in Israel.</span> <span id="s3106">I find one thing.</span> <span id="s3107">That the survivors of the Holocaust here in Philadelphia, we have our, first we were called the Jewish New Americans.</span> <span id="s3108">Then we changed the name to Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s3109">We have a common past and a common responsibility.</span> <span id="s3110">To remember our personal stories.</span> <span id="s3111">Because for us the Holocaust is both a personal and a collective Jewish tragedy.</span> <span id="s3112">It's a human tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">Q: Did you find that, certainly as you were getting started here, that it was easier to be close to people who had also undergone the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3114">Or did you readily make friends with other people who hadn't been in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language.</span> <span id="s3116">And we formed already 1956, we already had here the organization.</span> <span id="s3117">So we shared a lot together.</span> <span id="s3118">And we realized that this cannot be just a social organization.</span> <span id="s3119">We have to work for Israel.</span> <span id="s3120">We have to remember the Holocaust and to share with others and to teach.</span> <span id="s3121">But for me, I had and I still have, all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s3122">If I would show you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up?</span> <span id="s3123">Because I made, I didn't discriminate.</span> <span id="s3124">I feel one thing, the only criteria that I, that is important to me, is not how much somebody has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares.</span> <span id="s3125">And when a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they can be mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: Was it easy for you in the early days here?</span> <span id="s3127">Before you were going around and speaking about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3128">To talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still.</span> <span id="s3130">However, I don't do only the things which are easy.</span> <span id="s3131">I do many things which are difficult but they are necessary.</span> <span id="s3132">And when I was asked, there was here a professor ___________, the late ____________, I mentioned to you before.</span> <span id="s3133">And she is from ____________.</span> <span id="s3134">And she wrote a book of the Holocaust and she, once a friend of ours from the organization invited about 20 survivors.</span> <span id="s3135">I didn't know what the purpose was, it wasn't like a social thing.</span> <span id="s3136">And I found out that she wanted to organize, that people should speak on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3137">And I went there and that was the first time that different survivors among ourselves started to share a little feelings.</span> <span id="s3138">And I realized that there is not, we realized that there is very little in the text books about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: Actually what I'm trying to understand is, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but you had friends from all walks of life, talking in the earlier days here.</span> <span id="s3140">Was this something that you could talk about?</span> <span id="s3141">That you could share?</span> <span id="s3142">Did people want to hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: I never went around and volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: Just on a personal basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions.</span> <span id="s3146">And I answered.</span> <span id="s3147">I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they asked about sex.</span> <span id="s3148">Short question, short answer.</span> <span id="s3149">They asked me so I answered.</span> <span id="s3150">And people, not too many people were so interested, they didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s3151">And then, a little later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3152">They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3153">So we started to form an organization and be involved with this here.</span> <span id="s3154">So it was difficult.</span> <span id="s3155">Because, to give you one example, with some people it was easier.</span> <span id="s3156">Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding and more curious.</span> <span id="s3157">Others are more involved with their own life.</span> <span id="s3158">So it depends who it was.</span> <span id="s3159">I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she started to tell a little bit.</span> <span id="s3160">She said, "Well, we had that in America hard too.</span> <span id="s3161">We didn't have any steak."</span> <span id="s3162">And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her.</span> <span id="s3163">The Holocaust has taught me many lessons.</span> <span id="s3164">Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences.</span> <span id="s3165">I had no frame of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have.</span> <span id="s3166">The blessing of a loving family.</span> <span id="s3167">The blessing of good health.</span> <span id="s3168">The blessing of having my home.</span> <span id="s3169">Not to be called all different names.</span> <span id="s3170">Because I've been called all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s3171">I've been called no name at all.</span> <span id="s3172">I've been called, derogatory now, __________ Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name.</span> <span id="s3173">I was called you refugee.</span> <span id="s3174">You foreigner.</span> <span id="s3175">All kinds of name.</span> <span id="s3176">And I feel one thing, that its very important.</span> <span id="s3177">Respect for one another.</span> <span id="s3178">Respect for differences.</span> <span id="s3179">That we cannot expect everybody to be alike.</span> <span id="s3180">And that we must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial.</span> <span id="s3181">It's important to protect our human rights.</span> <span id="s3182">And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened.</span> <span id="s3183">When somebody does not treat you right.</span> <span id="s3184">I have learned to become a _____________.</span> <span id="s3185">I want to give you an example because that's going to be more.</span> <span id="s3186">I was invited several years ago to an open house, a barbecue.</span> <span id="s3187">And the barbecue started because there was some people who were suppose to come from other cities too, it was like a big gathering.</span> <span id="s3188">They started to come on Friday until Sunday evening.</span> <span id="s3189">We came Sunday.</span> <span id="s3190">We live, it wasn't in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3191">And when we arrived, not the owner but one of the guests greeting me with anger.</span> <span id="s3192">"What's the matter?</span> <span id="s3193">Why so late?"</span> <span id="s3194">At that time I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is controlling me emotionally.</span> <span id="s3195">So I looked at him very calmly and I said, "Thank you.</span> <span id="s3196">I am so glad that you missed me."</span> <span id="s3197">And he answered, "You know I like you Yit-cola (ph)."</span> <span id="s3198">And I said, "Thank you" again.</span> <span id="s3199">This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive.</span> <span id="s3200">He was otherwise a good man, but he had a habit of putting some people down.</span> <span id="s3201">And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in the group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent.</span> <span id="s3202">And this is nothing to do with race, color or religion.</span> <span id="s3203">It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love yourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself.</span> <span id="s3204">And to care.</span> <span id="s3205">To know that what we do effects not only us, it effects others too.</span> <span id="s3206">Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many times, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my parents and grandmother made for me.</span> <span id="s3207">You know children don't make where to live and what to do, of course I had some.</span> <span id="s3208">During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my life.</span> <span id="s3209">Even after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3210">Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to come here.</span> <span id="s3211">But I didn't have many choices.</span> <span id="s3212">I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because the _________ ___________.</span> <span id="s3213">So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices which others made that effected me.</span> <span id="s3214">And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words.</span> <span id="s3215">And it goes like this: Four groups of people Dramatically influence my destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">My late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), Poland Who knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day Murdered in Auschwitz my entire family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">The bystanders, who knew but didn't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">And the Swedish Red Cross, who didn't know me but liberated me From Nazi tyranny and brought me to a hospital in _____, Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">I am one and the same person.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">If four different groups of people viewed me differently, And treated me differently, I was loved for who I am And I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">The more the Nazis tortured me for who I am The more I was determined never to become like them, But to view myself through their eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">To the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">But I am not a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">My number is my badge of honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">Let those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">I am a proud Jewish daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">To be born Jewish is neither a crime nor a disgrace, But to starve, torture and murder innocent people For being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">A crime that has influenced the entire world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Because whatever we choose to say and do We are becoming partners too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">But others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds Or the victims of our evil deeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">We each can make a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">One person can save many people And one person can destroy many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Mengelia is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">On the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Shindler is responsible for so many lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">From the 1,100 Jews that Shindler saved, 6,000 descendents are now alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Can you imagine how many would be if the others had survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">Therefore, I feel that my first responsibility</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">Is to God To live by the commandments And not to transgress them Because I cannot do evil without becoming evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">The lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and I'll help him and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">And I know one thing, we live in this world We are responsible for one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">But not in a way to punish each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">So whenever there is injustice and cruelty We need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">And to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed And not with the oppressor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">In the final analysis, without ______________, all _________, religion and education fails.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">So we need first to improve ourselves because then we make a better world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">If you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">Q: I have a question.</span> <span id="s3249">Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibility for your world . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: Our world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">Q: Right, but it's the same.</span> <span id="s3252">Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so that had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned the birth of the Israeli State.</span> <span id="s3253">Are there other things that have effected you in this country, like the Civil Rights Movement or wars or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3255">I feel, do you remember there was a __________ who came and he wanted to, here in Philadelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis?</span> <span id="s3256">We went and marched.</span> <span id="s3257">When there was, we went to speak.</span> <span id="s3258">Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here.</span> <span id="s3259">We went to court, I was among them, and we fought against it.</span> <span id="s3260">When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have to be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on somebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up.</span> <span id="s3261">I said, "I don't appreciate what you said."</span> <span id="s3262">In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met through such occasion.</span> <span id="s3263">Because we were in the _____________, it was a meeting and somebody said something negative about another group.</span> <span id="s3264">And I said, "I really don't appreciate because I know how it feels when people do that."</span> <span id="s3265">So in small thing.</span> <span id="s3266">You know, prejudice is very easy because you don't have to give accounts for it.</span> <span id="s3267">You just say it but you don't have to give, you know?</span> <span id="s3268">And the point is one thing, it's like fire.</span> <span id="s3269">When there is only one spark, you can erase it.</span> <span id="s3270">But if there is a big fire, you have no control any longer.</span> <span id="s3271">So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily life, in the personal, how we do people.</span> <span id="s3272">Because usually when a person from one group offends another, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group.</span> <span id="s3273">So its important to respect each other.</span> <span id="s3274">It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people worked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was marching.</span> <span id="s3275">So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I write a letter, I speak up.</span> <span id="s3276">That's my contribution.</span> <span id="s3277">Those are the things which I do.</span> <span id="s3278">I cannot say, it doesn't bother because it effects.</span> <span id="s3279">You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just me, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people have lost.</span> <span id="s3280">They will never become what they had the potential of becoming.</span> <span id="s3281">The world will never know how many wonderful people we have lost.</span> <span id="s3282">Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have gained.</span> <span id="s3283">Because some of them still live in hiding _______________.</span> <span id="s3284">So what did the world gain?</span> <span id="s3285">Lose good people and gained criminals?</span> <span id="s3286">Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain a criminal.</span> <span id="s3287">What trade-off is that?</span> <span id="s3288">So it's important.</span> <span id="s3289">Even to, in my own home, to my own husband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything, I will always stand by you ____________.</span> <span id="s3290">But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part of it.</span> <span id="s3291">Then you have to trade yourself in.</span> <span id="s3292">So there are certain loyalties.</span> <span id="s3293">In life we need to make choices.</span> <span id="s3294">We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to say no.</span> <span id="s3295">Because you know, in the commandments there is the ten commandments.</span> <span id="s3296">It says you shall, you shall not.</span> <span id="s3297">And another thing how you can put out, you cannot hatred with hatred, anger with anger.</span> <span id="s3298">Somebody once said in anger to me, I hate you.</span> <span id="s3299">Because I wouldn't give in to something that was not moral or ethical.</span> <span id="s3300">I said, it's okay I love you for both of us.</span> <span id="s3301">And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you it's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, you are stubborn.</span> <span id="s3302">I said, what you call stubborn, that stubborn is what saved me from.</span> <span id="s3303">Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me.</span> <span id="s3304">That no power in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own destruction.</span> <span id="s3305">Because what we do, this is what we become.</span> <span id="s3306">You kill you become a killer.</span> <span id="s3307">You cheat you become a cheat.</span> <span id="s3308">You save somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we know or how much we have, how much we care.</span> <span id="s3309">Caring is what life is all about.</span> <span id="s3310">And we have a wonderful group in Philadelphia now, that was in the museum last week.</span> <span id="s3311">They are called Champions of Caring.</span> <span id="s3312">High School students.</span> <span id="s3313">And this is sponsored by the Holocaust Museum in the Washington.</span> <span id="s3314">And by the Jewish Relations Counsel in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3315">And the ________, also in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3316">And those kids, what do they do?</span> <span id="s3317">They go and help those who are less fortunate.</span> <span id="s3318">The sick, the elderly, the disabled.</span> <span id="s3319">This is what we need to do.</span> <span id="s3320">You know, the strongest message I can give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's killers.</span> <span id="s3321">Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">Q: Would you like to read something?</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3324">I picked those two poems because, actually there are three poems that I would like to share with you if there is enough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: We'll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s3327">The first one is called 'A World That Vanished'.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: And when did you write these?</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: This was written May 8, 1978.</span> <span id="s3330">A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and breathing it, it's effected so deeply my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">Just like a leaf tossed to the wind Separated from its branches and tree</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Not belonging anymore Liberated but not free Carrying the pain of separation Memories so painful and dear Memories of our world, it use to be A world that is no longer here I still see the Sabbath candles And my mother's gentle face My father is chanting the prayers My grandmother with her white shawl of lace I see my little sister and brother So young and so full of cheer Not yet understanding tragedies and hatred But sensing uncertainty and fear The Nazi boots are marching My world with terror is filled The Holy Scriptures are burning Children are starved, tortured and killed The ghettos are closing us in What is there for us in store?</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">My world is going slower and slower Nothing is like it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">The freight trains are taking us on a journey For most it is the last ride My brothers and sisters are burning There is no more place to hide Hitler's final solution is sealed We are trapped in a world of Hell I am amazed that I have survived The horrors from the Holocaust to tell And there is another poem, which is called "I Am Not A Number", and I wrote it May 13, 1994.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">I was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz Surrounded by barbed wires, gas chambers, smoke and flame The Nazis tattooed a number on my arm 2-5-6-7-3 became my new name They tried to reduce me to a number Dehumanize me day by day But regardless of all their efforts The could not take my self worth away They murdered in the gas chambers my entire family In one single day All my earthly possessions were so brutally taken away They treated me worse than a hardened criminal Even though I did not commit any crime They hated me merely for being born Jewish And starved and tortured me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">I was only 13 years old when they took away from me my right to life But they could not take away my will to live and to survive For nearly six nightmarish years I have endured a living Hell Nevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich And lived my story to tell The third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael.</span> <span id="s3337">When he asked me the first time about the number.</span> <span id="s3338">And this was written May 14, 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Who wrote on your arm, Mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">Asked curiously my little boy one day I looked sadly at my innocent child and thought Very carefully what to say The Nazis tattooed this number on my arm I told my son short and plain Why did they do it, Mom?</span> <span id="s3341">He asked further My God, I thought, how can I explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">You see my child, there was a man Adolph Hitler was his name He was very cruel and hateful And inflicted on people suffering and pain Oh, said he, and ran out to play And I signed with great relief I wanted to protect him for as long as I could From knowing my deep sore and grief He grew and I could not protect him forever So I answered his questions one at a time He wanted to know why we Jews are hated Did we commit some kind of a crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">No, my child, I told my son, We have not committed any crime Yet we Jews have been victimized and slaughtered By _____________, ______________ and Hitlers all the time Do you hate the Nazis for what they did to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">Now I have no grandparents and relatives like my friends The Nazi murdered all our loved ones They have blood on their hands I know, my child, that you too are hurting But hatred and revenge can never restore The lives of those who perished in the Holocaust And the precious things we had once before You and I who know what pain is Must never inflict hurt and pain We must try to build a better world So the death of the victims shall not be in vain This is my message.</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: Did you talk much about your experiences with your sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3347">But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3348">I wanted them to know their grandparents.</span> <span id="s3349">Because I felt its important.</span> <span id="s3350">And as a result, my oldest son __________, a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer, came here to visit.</span> <span id="s3351">He lives in New York.</span> <span id="s3352">And afterwards he calls me up and he said, "Ma, I had a very traumatic experience."</span> <span id="s3353">I said, "What's happened?"</span> <span id="s3354">He said, "I was waiting for the train and I saw a man laying face down across the tracks.</span> <span id="s3355">And I saw from nearby that the train is coming.</span> <span id="s3356">I didn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s3357">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s3358">And I was thinking, what should I do?</span> <span id="s3359">My mind was racing.</span> <span id="s3360">On the one hand, I risk my life because I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back.</span> <span id="s3361">And on the other hand, I thought, what would my grandmother do?</span> <span id="s3362">My grandmother ________________."</span> <span id="s3363">Because I told him the story how my mother sacrificed herself and me.</span> <span id="s3364">And he said, "I jumped up and I saved him.</span> <span id="s3365">People had to pull me up."</span> <span id="s3366">My first reaction was, how could you do something like this?</span> <span id="s3367">And then I said, "_____________, when you graduated from Yale University I felt you achieved something special.</span> <span id="s3368">But this is something more special.</span> <span id="s3369">You proved that you are a ___________ and that is the highest religion, education and achievement.</span> <span id="s3370">I am very grateful."</span> <span id="s3371">Another thing, because everything effects, another thing is that when he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this country, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child.</span> <span id="s3372">I once told him, because he asked me also about my experience.</span> <span id="s3373">I said, "____________, both your parents are survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3374">We lost everything that was ours.</span> <span id="s3375">All that we have is our good name.</span> <span id="s3376">And if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are my child.</span> <span id="s3377">But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spiritually.</span> <span id="s3378">But there is one thing.</span> <span id="s3379">You do something morally and ethically wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name."</span> <span id="s3380">And I completely dismissed it from my mind.</span> <span id="s3381">When he was an adult already and I came to visit.</span> <span id="s3382">And all of a sudden, he starts telling me, "You know, Mom?</span> <span id="s3383">Whenever I was going to do something I asked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents?"</span> <span id="s3384">And thank God, my son grew up to be a very respectable, loving son, husband, father.</span> <span id="s3385">He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild.</span> <span id="s3386">She is named after my late son, second name.</span> <span id="s3387">Her name is Elizabeth Michaela.</span> <span id="s3388">We call her Eliza-la (ph).</span> <span id="s3389">And she was here shortly before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996.</span> <span id="s3390">And for the first time, she noticed my number.</span> <span id="s3391">And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's Day.</span> <span id="s3392">During the time she learned a little more, she grew.</span> <span id="s3393">And she's playing, busy playing, and she takes a look on my arm and she says, "Barbie, A-B-C's."</span> <span id="s3394">Because she has a book with A-B-C's and she sensed that this is related.</span> <span id="s3395">She's only two years old.</span> <span id="s3396">So it's even effecting her.</span> <span id="s3397">For me, for my children, even for my grandchildren, it's too late.</span> <span id="s3398">They will never know the joy of having grandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know.</span> <span id="s3399">But hopefully its not going to be too late for others.</span> <span id="s3400">And I want to finish with a very inspiring story.</span> <span id="s3401">Remember that I repeated many times that my grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away.</span> <span id="s3402">In 1984, I received a letter from a person that I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s3403">Ida Jervis (ph), _____________, Washington.</span> <span id="s3404">And I opened the letter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin.</span> <span id="s3405">I'm named after the same great-grandmother, ____________ _____________.</span> <span id="s3406">I was four years old when my family left Poland and I'm sure that you will appreciate this.</span> <span id="s3407">And I'm looking, she send me a photograph of my grandmother and her son.</span> <span id="s3408">And I thanked her.</span> <span id="s3409">She invited me to come and visit.</span> <span id="s3410">Really not knowing what to expect, a survivor, how I'm going to act?</span> <span id="s3411">Am I going to be reacting normal, am I being all broken up, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3412">And I came and there was another relative who knew my mother because they were cousins and she left shortly before the war.</span> <span id="s3413">And she's telling me that every year for many years now, they have a ____________ family reunion, because this cousin was ____________ and she came with her sister and they started this because people lived in different places.</span> <span id="s3414">And they invited me to come with my family.</span> <span id="s3415">We went.</span> <span id="s3416">From not having any relatives here, all of sudden I had more than 130, 140 relatives.</span> <span id="s3417">And until this day, whenever we can we go for Thanksgiving reunion.</span> <span id="s3418">We are close.</span> <span id="s3419">And my cousins speak with price, my cousin, every occasion, my cousins.</span> <span id="s3420">They have family.</span> <span id="s3421">So, because my grandmother send this picture away from Europe, this picture is now returned to me and I realized now I can tell you what you can give away, you still have it.</span> <span id="s3422">After I lost everything in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3423">My home, my family, my community, my earthly possessions, six years of my life and went through a living Hell.</span> <span id="s3424">I found out, when I had lost everything material, that I have spiritual things to give.</span> <span id="s3425">The Nazis hated me but they couldn't stop me from loving people, from believing in God, and from caring and wanting to help.</span> <span id="s3426">And we certainly have what we give away.</span> <span id="s3427">We can give up, for over 20 years I've been giving away stories, about the Holocaust, about my family.</span> <span id="s3428">Many people tell me, I know you because your grandmother and parents, like they would be mine.</span> <span id="s3429">And I still can give away.</span> <span id="s3430">We can give knowledge, a poem, love, compassion.</span> <span id="s3431">What you are doing, to give away typed, to record this here, it's the spiritual things that nobody can take away.</span> <span id="s3432">And the result, passing them onto the next generations.</span> <span id="s3433">The result is passing them onto any person, older, young, stranger or family.</span> <span id="s3434">When we do that, then long after we are gone they remain.</span> <span id="s3435">Because Anne Frank wrote a diary.</span> <span id="s3436">She is gone and her diary is going to live on.</span> <span id="s3437">And we can always give away kind words and good deeds.</span> <span id="s3438">No matter how poor or rich we are.</span> <span id="s3439">How educated or not.</span> <span id="s3440">And this is what is important.</span> <span id="s3441">This is the lesson of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3442">Now you understand why I felt it's important to talk about my family.</span> <span id="s3443">They gave me unconditional love.</span> <span id="s3444">Showed me, my mother's experience and I, many times when I think, if she could love me so, so much a stranger, how much more did she love me?</span> <span id="s3445">And that gives me, makes me feel like I'm worthwhile.</span> <span id="s3446">And this is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: You're welcome.</span> <span id="s3449">And thank you for your time and effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0435 PAGE 64</span></p></body></html>
