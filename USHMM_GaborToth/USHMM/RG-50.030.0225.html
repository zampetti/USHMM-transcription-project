<span id="s88">My grandfather was then in his late 60's, was old.</span> <span id="s89">It's like people standing in the line to wait to get in to this German office, to get uh, uh, know how you say this, to get, a paper, to get mine uncle out.</span> <span id="s90">Two Germans came up to mine grandfather, cut off his beard.</span> <span id="s91">He lived another three or four days.</span> <span

yeah.</span> <span id="s105">In '39, was start the ghetto.</span> <span id="s106">We were to a main street, Ulica Lubelska (ph?)</span> <span id="s107">, as they closed that up the street, we couldn't get out through the front door any more.</span> <span id="s108">We had to go through the back door.</span> <span id="s109">And it was like months like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What was it like inside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s111">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Was already very, we were already very scared.</span> <span id="s113">Very, like stopped living.</span> <span id="s114">In one time we were a middle-class family.</span> <span id="s115">We were fairly . . ., and we stopped living.</span> <span id="s116">We had to fight for the every day, for to get the food on the table.</span> <span id="s117">We exchanged uh, let's say we had the situation might be a little better than other people, were hungry right away.</span> <span id="s118">Just we exchanged a little leather for the goods, the, the Poles what they came let's say with food, with eggs, with uh flour or some what they bought.</span> <span id="s119">Leather was to them then like gold.</span> <span id="s120">They needed those boots and they needed this.</span> <span id="s121">I don't know who made for them this, I don't know.</span> <span id="s122">Just a piece of leather then was like gold.</span> <span id="s123">As we got food, and even enough, it's a fact my grandmother came to live with us, mine aunt and uncle came to live with us, because let's say in beginning of '40, this, this wasn't in terribly nice of them, but the war and everything so quick, and right away the ghetto and right away the - to fight every day - afraid to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">They're shooting people when after eight o'clock let's say, at night we couldn't get, go out anymore.</span> <span id="s125">We couldn't, if, if the exchange would be if they catch us would be shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Killing too.</span> <span id="s127">Started to be uh a struggle, every day struggle, day by day.</span> <span id="s128">In the, you were considered to take the closest people in.</span> <span id="s129">It might be oh, we going, we going, this can't take forever.</span> <span id="s130">It's going to end.</span> <span id="s131">It's going to end in six months.</span> <span id="s132">It's going to end in, in, after the six months, another six months my father used to say.</span> <span id="s133">And like I say, we took in mine aunt and uncle because uh we had the place and they started already to transfer people to smaller places, to Arentadt (ph ?)</span> <span id="s134">, to Kozienice.</span> <span id="s135">And if we wouldn't take in our family, we had to take in people what coming in.</span> <span id="s136">And was already a camp about four miles from, four miles from Kozienice, what it was digging, I don't know what they were digging.</span> <span id="s137">Just every day, in the morning, the Gestapo or the SS came and took all the men and took them there to dig like a river.</span> <span id="s138">I don't know, was about four volka (ph), about four miles from Kozienice.</span> <span id="s139">And in '40...1940, by the end of 1940, yeah, they liquidate.</span> <span id="s140">They took all those people.</span> <span id="s141">Then went my grandmother, mine uncle and aunt Fitzpack (ph), seven children--because one cousin, the oldest who like I was the oldest, I took with me to this place to work, to this place where we were digging those places.</span> <span id="s142">By...by luck, because I knew the engineer.</span> <span id="s143">We went together to school, and I bribed him, natural, with...I bribed him to take.</span> <span id="s144">Because they took just men and younger people, just.</span> <span id="s145">I wouldn't separate from my parents for nothing.</span> <span id="s146">I was, I would go with them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s147">Just I bribed him.</span> <span id="s148">And I begged him and he took in my parents and my younger sister.</span> <span id="s149">She was a kid.</span> <span id="s150">And my younger brother.</span> <span id="s151">And I, and I begged mine uncle to just... He didn't want to go; just this cousin.</span> <span id="s152">He lives, he's in Bayonne (ph?)</span> <span id="s153">.</span> <span id="s154">He went with us to this place.</span> <span id="s155">And there was work, digging.</span> <span id="s156">I don't know what they were digging.</span> <span id="s157">And one...mine younger brother was working for the Gestapo, and he was still not with them.</span> <span id="s158">He was uh cleaning their...oh oh...uh cleaning their boots, things like that.</span> <span id="s159">And I was concerned about him.</span> <span id="s160">And this day--was one day in 1940, must have been in October, was already after the Jewish holidays--they came with trucks, and liquidate a half of this camp.</span> <span id="s161">They took away then mine aunt and mine uncle and other people, half of this one to Wolanow.</span> <span id="s162">They took him to work, to Wolanow.</span> <span id="s163">And about a month later, I went to Kozienice to... I..</span> <span id="s164">.</span> <span id="s165">I missed something what is important.</span> <span id="s166">I saved a kid, three years old; and she is alive and she is in New York, and I can tell you the whole story.</span> <span id="s167">Now I'm going to go back here.</span> <span id="s168">When I knew they were going to liquidate, my mother was already...my parents and mine sisters, my sister and brothers were already in this camp.</span> <span id="s169">And I was waiting what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s170">I was like a mother to all mine younger brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s171">Waiting what's going to happen to mine brother.</span> <span id="s172">I didn't want to go out not knowing.</span> <span id="s173">And I knew...somebody told me from the Gestapo, "Tonight twelve o'clock we going to liquidate Kozienice."</span> <span id="s174">He got leather from us too.</span> <span id="s175">And a neighbor--the closest neighbor from us, Pola Luxenburg (ph?)</span> <span id="s176">--when she saw me, my family arranging to go there, she said, "Eva, how did you do it?"</span> <span id="s177">And I could not tell, I could not tell her.</span> <span id="s178">As I told to her she gave me a piece of gold and I give this guy, and I give this guy and she went out, her husband and her brother to the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: To this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s181">They had a little girl, three years old.</span> <span id="s182">They paid off some Poles to take the little girl.</span> <span id="s183">We all thought it's going to be six months, a year.</span> <span id="s184">I don't know how much they gave those Poles.</span> <span id="s185">Just they gave them some money to hide out this little girl, three years old.</span> <span id="s186">Before, it was about eight o'clock or nine o'clock, I knew it's going to be the liquidation.</span> <span id="s187">And I was ready, the last, by myself to go out there--was about two hours walk, three hours walk.</span> <span id="s188">I saw the little girl, the...the...the Polish family, bringing back the little girl to the grandparents.</span> <span id="s189">The grandparents were staying there.</span> <span id="s190">And I went to this grandfather, and I couldn't tell him tonight is the last night.</span> <span id="s191">Just I said, "Please give me...give me uh Ruthele.</span> <span id="s192">Please give me Ruthele.</span> <span id="s193">With me, I take her to Poland."</span> <span id="s194">And he said, "No, let Polack have."</span> <span id="s195">And we were fighting maybe a half hour over this little girl.</span> <span id="s196">He didn't want to give her to me 'til I said, "It's going to be too late.</span> <span id="s197">Polacks not...cannot come for her."</span> <span id="s198">And I just took her by my hand and went out.</span> <span id="s199">We came there; and my mother, my parents were natural upset already.</span> <span id="s200">We came there about eleven o'clock, and the same night they all were taken to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Where, did you see this?</span> <span id="s202">Where were you?</span> <span id="s203">Physically where were you?</span> <span id="s204">You saw them being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Where were you hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: We were there, not hiding, in this place to work.</span> <span id="s209">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Wasn't a hide out place.</span> <span id="s211">Was this place.</span> <span id="s212">This girl saw me for the first time this year.</span> <span id="s213">We have every year, we have... She's now in her fifties.</span> <span id="s214">She was...she held a speech how I saved her life then.</span> <span id="s215">OK.</span> <span id="s216">Thanks God for that life.</span> <span

they went to her and told her, "Thanks.</span> <span id="s224">Thanks to your mother, we have our Ruthele."</span> <span id="s225">Alright.</span> <span id="s226">And there we were about, two about three, four months as to this camp.</span> <span id="s227">Was a camp, like I said before.</span> <span id="s228">They took a half, and later--I was not there and mine parents were hiding.</span>

Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s253">The youngest brother--eleven years old, Schepsele (ph?)</span> <span id="s254">--as I was afraid they're going to kill him if they see him, as I told him to go away from the line.</span> <span id="s255">And later, when they let us back in, I'm going to take him back.</span> <span id="s256">I thought then I can do everything for them.</span> <span id="s257">I was ready to do everything for...for my sister or brother to live, even get shot.</span> <span id="s258">It didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s259">And he went to this Polish family, begged them to stay there for two hours.</span> <span id="s260">He didn't know we're not...they're not going to let us in back.</span> <span id="s261">And they took him right away to the Gestapo.</span> <span
